Listening to the songs again today, I get this creepy nostalgic feeling that bring back many memories: the hard rocking Enter Sandman, Sad But True, and the outrageous Wherever I May Roam are just some elements of the heavy material that Metallica is known for presented here, but there's the surprising turn on The Unforgiven, an epic metal classic that sways and tingles as it switches from one chord to another (the song also produced a heartbreaking and memorable video as well), the wonderful ballad Nothing Else Matters which is, in my opinion, one of the best songs ever written.Metallica might have sold out in the late 90's with haircuts, designer clothes and the whole Napster incident, but somehow The Black Album still shines in its own dark way!RecommendedB+"},{"rating":"2","title":"quite alright","review":"This CD is around the time when Metallica evolved into a more regular, standard metal band from their previous thrash days. This CD has many good songs . . . actually, Kirk Hammet's guitar solos are just as good as ever, James Hetfield appears to have picked up a more involved singing voice, etc. One thing I didn't really like too much was how the fast, lightning guitar riffs and drum lines have essentially disappeared. Lars on this album tends to go with more slow, heavy beats. Jason does a good job however with bass lines in place of the late Cliff Burton (R.I.P.) Overall, this CD isn't bad, and I reccomend it, but for some true Metallica, go with either Kill 'Em All or Master of Puppets.Best of this album: Wherever I May Roam, The God That Failed, Sad But True, and Of Wolf and Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I love this album! it's the first Metallica Cd i ever bought. the guy actually searched the entire store for me so i could buy it. i love the songs \\"the unforgiven\\" and \\"Though the Never\\" i paid 30$ for this CD and it was and is well worth it.

My friend of Misery is a song that is pretty good. Even Sad But True is another song that I can say is pretty heavy from the album. This is the album that put metallica into the mainstream and for some they soldout. But hey what band in music today hasn't sold out. Eventually your favorite band will and for Metallica, many fans just couldn't accept that.To me they didn't.

It's Metallicas attempt to reach a larger audience. If you want to reach a larger audience the first thing you do is sweeten your sound - and thats just what they did. Enter Sandman is a very catchy tune. If your name is Poison or Def Leppard is great to have catchy songs - if your name is Metallica - its a sellout. Sad But True and Unforgiven are.....unforgivable pop songs.The rest of the album , with the exceptions of Of Wolf and Man and Holier Than Thou is kind of bland.

It holds no candle to Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, & And Justice for All.I even prefer Kill them All over the Black album. Anestasia-Pulling Teeth. Need I say more??I will say that it's no worse than Load, Reload, and St. Anger. I still scratch my head wondering what the hell happened when they put those three albums out.

Enter Sandman, probably the simplest song on the album (nice wah wah textures tho in the solo) is so over-played and over-rated its just not funny and Dont Tread On Me, geez, they seemed to just chug a few power chords together and put to tape whatever they came up with, and the solo, Hammetts worst solo on any Metallica album. However shining lights include My Friend Of Misery and Wherever I May Roam.Too many people own this one, MOP and Ride deserved all the accolades and sales, this did not.Still, its Metallica, and they're the definitive metal band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really dislike this album","review":"My sister bought this CD and i listend to it expecting the hipe about Metallica was going to live up to its expectation's and it really didnt. none of the songs on the were even worth taking my time from my Nirvana CD's to listin to. Metallica is the most over rated band i have ever heard in my life. I think these so called Metallica fans are really listing to that fat ugly lead singer of Metallica to rebel against there parents and thats the only reason Metallica lives today, to sell out time after time.

Metallica severely compromises their previous artistic vision and speed metal chops to cash in with some mainstream metal.

Well, I'd say it's time to either start an entirely new group or just hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUTS!","review":"With this record Metallica completely sold out. It lacks any of the aggression that is found on the earlier records. This is not the true Metallica but rather the new Selloutica.

Each of these accusations is no less retarded than the previous one. The black album rules; there's a reason it sold 14+ million, and it features several hard rock classics.

With touring for 3 years straight, pushing videos, documentaries, live albums, performances on Arsenio Hall, MTV, Metallica made enough money that they should have retired.Load&Reloadwere better, andGarage, Inc.beat all three, but I gave this one 2 stars because it was at least better than their newest piece of garbageSt. $#!T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"A lot of people tried to condemn Metallica for selling out with this album.

Let's start with the obvious: THIS ISN'T THRASH!!!! What were they thinking? The technicality is still kind of there on this album, but the raw speed which made their first four records so good is almost entirely missing. There are some tempo shifts, but there is not the progressive 'feel' of '...And Justice for All' or 'Master of Puppets'. Next, we have Hetfield's vocals. They're decent, but he doesn't have the rebellious, rip-your-soul-out style any more, going more for the mainstream sound. Overall, this is an OK album if you like the post-1991 era Metallica.

If only Cliff didn't die, they would be in much, much better shape. It's a shame when a band that used to be so monumentally great and talented could sell out to become just another cheap rock band. And the problem is, it just got worse and worse from here on, the latest \\"Metallica\\" release being the ambyssal \\"St. Anger\\".

The book reads like Sheridan is on trial, strategically leaving out the other side of the argument and the opinions of those subordinates who felt neutral or highly of him. Quoting southern commanders and soldiers who have a poor opinion towards Sheridan doesn't have much of an effect. Many of the North's commanders and successes had negative and misinformed reviews by the media and commanders in the confederacy throughout the war.

She had all of Sunnydale High and a lot of dynamite to back her up. This time the action pits the Buffinator against all the muscle of T-Rexes, and all the craftiness of a conniving demon. And this time, Buffy's more on her own. This is not to say the Scoobies, especially much-missed Oz aren't players, but the action here is top-notch. Yet what makes this book really roar are the original plot and character development. This isn't just a make-a-buck story plugged into an episode outline. The author has really developed the new characters while incorporating our standard faves, and she knows how to make rising action carry a plot. A must-read for die-hard Buffy fans, those just arriving at Sunnydale, and everyone looking for a novel this Halloween season."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I've read a good chunk of the Buffy novels that are out there, and I have to say, this one was disappointing. It seemed that the author did not have a firm enough grasp on the Buffy-verse characters to write them with the truth or reverence that true fans have come to expect from these novels. The aw-shucks, dino-rific! focus was more appropriate for younger Buffy readers/watchers, while the gore factor was unnecessarily high. If you're dying for a Buffy fix, this'll do, but I'd recommend rereading your Watcher's Guide, or picking up something by the always satisfying Christoper Golden and Nancy Holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally- a book where Oz says more than 2 words!","review":"This may not be the BEST Buffy book out there (try The Evil that Men Do or the Gatekeeper Trilogy for that), but it is definitely worth the time and money if you're an Oz fan. This is the long-overdue book that takes much from Oz's point of view.

I'd say you should read this book. Nothing really outstanding. It's set -as most of the Buffy books from the past two years- in that alternate season three universe created by Golden and Holder where Faith and Wesley seem to not exist and Giles was never fired by the Council. But the story has more problems than that. The author seems to hide her tentative grasp of the Buffy characters by dedicating most of the first half of the book to two original characters that most Buffy-fans would not really care about to begin with, and then throwing in a lot of action in the second half so Buffy and the gang are too busy running around to have time to interact with each other in a way we are familiar with, which is good because most of the scenes when they do don't ring true and the dialogue, more often than not, doesn't sound like them either. ...it's about time they took the Buffy novels out of season 3..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the fuss?","review":"With the exception of the very pretty track nine, this CD is very quiet and bland, and, compared to the five star reviews and some expert piano playing heard with his band live at Cheltenham on Radio 3, quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ties!","review":"These ties came to me in great condition and I thought since I got them so cheap, they'd be cheap fabric.

In the Umberto Eco interview, Paris Review #185,he talked about two kinds of art he didn't like; that which is better than his and he wish he had done it, and that which is worse than his.Based on Ms. Winterson's writing, I doubt if she is a very fun person to be around (just guessing for what it's worth, but she only wants to be judged by her work, sorry)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh. Dear.","review":"A really quite awful book from a once-quite good author (witness 'Oranges are not the Only Fruit', an inspiring and insightful novel later turned into an equally good television programme). Layers of pretentious prose tumble over each other whilst blindingly fatuous 'points' are made with all the subtlety of, well, any of Jeanette Winterson's other, later works. As Emerson, Lake and Palmer once found out, basing a work around an epic subject does not make the work epic.

I sometimes can even fit my coat in here! The wheels - oh, the wheels. The wheels are a godsend. I walk and walk and walk...over rough cement, up and down stairs, along the street to the bus stop (on the rough shoulder)... they are just as perfect as they were when I bought them.If you are looking for a tough, durable and roomy rolling bag..this is for you.One more thing.

The backpack came beyond my expectation. It quite roomy for all my needs that I could stay on campus for a whole day, sturdy and waterproof.

The first of the newer shows with the new Captain Shanks character (voiced by Harry Goz's son, Michael Goz) are also very funny, although it is clear in some places that the writers had as much trouble adjusting to the changes they were forced to make as the fans. As most fans know, episodes after the ones in this set take a serious down-turn in writing quality, so much so that it is hard to believe they were produced by the same people. So, if you found the early Sealab 2021 absolutely hilarious, be sure to buy this set because it contains the last of the comedy gems in the series. There are extras on this set, including two unaired episodes and some commentary, although the extras tend to be hit or miss in quality as in previous sets depending on your taste. But, whether or not you like the extras, you'll love the episodes. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Yes, I know Harry Goz died a bit into this season, but that's no excuse for some of the low quality jokes in the later episodes. Especially the first one with Shanks. Seasons one and two of the DVD's had some high quality commentary, while the only decent commentary on this set is the first episode with Shanks whereas they let a third party completely rip the episode, and the third season of the series, apart, literally saying \\"If you bought this I feel bad for you\\" I swear, its in the commentary and its very true. Season 3 just was not at all entertaining after Murphy died. The best episode of the set is one in the special features that never aired... Overall, I am strongly disappointed. I only gave it a 2 rather than 1 because Harry Goz diserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking hary goz(captain murphi's voice)","review":"i sorely miss captain murphi, he is replaced by an annoying football coach type, compared to captain murphi's normal almost doctorial looks with utter craziness going on in his brain and coming out of his mouth, this new captain is a totally obvious idiot he looks and sounds and talks the way you'd expect him to. there's no craziness wrapped in a serious look, like murphi had. he has a southern accent too. which i found very sucky. i believe this(sea lab 2021) captain murphi was the original captian from the original serious cartoon drama from the late 1970's? or 80's? (sea lab 2020), same face, same voice actor(harry goz)... this new captian.... well.... just inst murphi. the other characters are always enjoyable though. but the great murphi mixture is gone. the original cadence is gone. and i watch season 3 strictly in case of emergency of overdose of seasons 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly dramatic reviews only cloud the issue...","review":"And the issue is that these are still great episodes! If you are a fan, then expect some changes with the new captain. If not then I'd say give season 2 a try (most consistent to me- I found some of season one to be so intent on being absurd that they failed to be funny!). A lot of friends think I'm an idiot for liking this show- so be prepared for one goofy show!Is this the last great season? Who knows- I'm just some schmuck reviewer on Amazon. But don't be confused by the childish drama- these are fun and goofy as before. As much as I liked the early shows, this is not some character driven drama, it is a crazy cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit & Miss","review":"Sea Lab is often a hit and miss show. This DVD is no different from the ones that came before it. There are many funny, worthwhile bits in this season.

But remember, Derrick is single and Rose is not.As the two fight their attraction, circumstances change setting off a web of jealousy, deceit, love, insanity and even murder.Hands down, Darrin Lowery knows drama and he knows how to deliver a story saturated with it. Now this novel is one of his earlier works so it doesn't posses the finesse of his later works as his skills have sharpened, but it is worth reading. It arches over the top, but it'll pull fans along and not disappoint. The editing was horrible and it could have flowed a little smoother, but neither detracts from the solid plot.

Now, I live on the east coast, not arid Arizona, so I don't know what the problem is, but it seems like cheap manufacturing. At any rate, early on we tried licking the clings to get them to stick to the scene, and that sort of worked, but soon they were too curled and non-sticky for even that to be a possibility. What a waste of money, and so frustrating for my eager toddler.

My daughter absolutely loves this little set. It comes with a standard background of a little girl standing in her room ready to get dressed and a variety of outfits for different types of weather. At first my daughter just wanted to peel everything off and put different outfits on. Once she did that though she was very interested in dressing her for the weather. This toy is great for talking about the rain and snow, how we would dress if it were cold or hot, etc. It comes with a sun, snowflakes, and raindrops too so your child can adjust the window scene as well.

Not sure if it would hold the interest of the older kids, but this three year old is sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Miss Weather colorforms are very colorful and the concept is ideal for younger children. The child picks the outfits to fit the season. Our problem was the decals would not stick from day one. Colorforms are supposed to stay on the board until removed. These would not even lay down. I really should have sent it back, but we made do for the one time she played it. I was very disappointed, my son had colorforms when he was young 15 years ago and they always stuck and stayed in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Weather Dress-Up","review":"Lets start by saying that this item is over-priced. Miss Weather is very limited. How much better if there were: at least three pages, many outfits, backgrounds, and objects. Miss Weather Dress-Up leaves little to the imagination. This is an item that offers little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too busy!","review":"This would have a good toy if it weren't for the dizzying amount of color. The actual board is so loaded with primary colors that it is hard to imagine a young mind getting a perspective on where to put the colorforms. A broader, cleaner white background would have improved this item a great deal. In this case, less would have been more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point if they don't stick?","review":"I was SO excited to purchase this for my daughter as I have many fond memories of my old Holly Hobby colorforms. What a disappointment to give them to her and discover that they don't stick. At all. We tried dampening them with a rag and that didn't work either. I would love if Colorforms could make the old version that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea but pieces don't stick","review":"I bought this for my daughter even after reading all the other reviews that said t he pieces don't stick. I figures if they didn't stick well she could use it on the window. Within a day of getting it the pieces don't stick anymore. I even cleaned everything with water like they suggested but it didn't help. My daughter loves this toy but the pieces keep winding up all over the floor since they don't stay in place. She can't really use it on the window because the girl is not a piece so she can't dress anything up. The colorforms I had when I was little were great. These are terrible. Cute idea, but poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick at all.","review":"My two year old loves the idea of this toy - the clothes for different weather, the colors, the teddy bear - but is very quickly frustrated, as they don't stick at all. Not even fresh out of the box. So, every time she tries to add a new peice on, another one is so easily pushed out of place. I was very disappointed with this toy, and with the new colorforms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I remember","review":"I used to have these colorforms when I was a kid, so I ordered these for my niece. They are cute but not as durable as the one I used to have. The pieces fall off after a few seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool design - does not last","review":"I bought one of these at Target and really enjoyed it for about 4 months. The battery clip broke (cheap plastic, poor design) forcing me to tape the battery into it just to make it work. Now, target wont stand behind the product and it is inconvenient at best to use. Don't buy this product.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Gem!!","review":"I got this little gem about 2 weeks ago and I love it. It's compact and lightweight and downloading was a breeze on Windows Media player. I fit 65 songs in a matter of minutes. The only thing that I find a bit disappointing is that it doesn't have is a backlit it would come in handy since I like to listen to music at night. The armband is very useful during my workouts and I happen to find the volume level exceptional. One thing I would like to be able to do is download songs straight from napster onto my player so if anyone knows how to do that please let me know. I ideally wanted a ipod but I didn't really want to spend that kind of money so this is a great substitute and I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with the rewind button","review":"In principle I think this is a great product.But I've tried to buy it twice, and both times the rewind button didn't work. The 'press and hold' feature on the rewind just jumps to the beginning of the track, rather than running quickly backwards through the track as it should do.This is an important feature for me, since I want to use the player for language learning. So I've had to return the product twice, and doubt I'll bother to try again.Maybe there was just a single batch that has this problem, rather than being every single player on the market. I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR MAC USERS!!","review":"This product is a total lie. On the package it says it is compatible with Mac and PC. After having problems being able to play songs that I dragged to the player, I called technical support who informed me that they prefer that you use Windows and that they don't have any information to support Mac OS users. I explained that the reason the player was even bought was because it was compatible with Mac. The woman apologized and explained that they prefer you use Windows. The whole thing is extremely ludicrous and a complete lie. I will never buy another RCA product again. I am furious."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO MUCH FUN!","review":"This is my first gadget I've really bought except for my digital camera and it was super easy to figure out! The instructions are idiot proof and I had so much fun using it! The arm strap is very adjustable and comfortable to use when lifting weights or anything else! I love this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Workout","review":"RCA LYRA is very small and comes with a great arm band for working out. Headphones are excellent and clip onto your ears. SOUND QUALITY IS UNBELIEVEABLE! I use this to run & workout & it is GREAT! Don't buy the expandable memory until you realize you're going to need it. Also, it is VERY easy to download & delete music to the player. I have not had any problems with it yet and i think it's great & definitely worth your dollar :) Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running!","review":"I've been using it for 2 months, and am VERY pleased. The player installed flawlessly with my XP Professional systems, and the Music Match software works OK, but has some bugs. I'm using MusicMatch 7.5, the newer versions might be a little better, but haven't tried them. Some of the other critisims -- such as played songs out of sequence is due to the music match. The trick is create a playlist, save, send and then do not reorder the tracks, or the songs may play out of order.The only weak part of the unit is the headphones, but decent headphones cost $20. I like the Panasonic RP-HS40. I havent't use the SD cards much (I use them for my digital camer, and pocket PC) because I heard they suck up the battery. With the install 128MB memory I've been getting the full 15 hours.Use the MP3 Pro as opposed to the MP3 format. At 96kbps it sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Player, with a 184 Songs Limit","review":"The RCA Lyra is cute and compact. It also sounds good. Unlike those multi-functions buttons on other models, the Lyra has separate buttons for Stop/Play/Forward/Backward; so they are easy to operate. As it's been mentioned in many of the reviews before, the battery door feels quite flimsy. I worry that it may break off each time I changed the battery. Battery life is very good using NiMH rechargeable.One important point: It's great that this player accepts SD card for extra memory, but there is an undocumented limitation: I'm referring to the 128MB model. While the player can read from a 1GB SD card, however, a maximum of 184 songs can be recognized. The PC sees the SD card as an additional drive and you can stuff the 1GB card full with songs, but only the first 184 can be played! Say your typical song is 3-4MB a piece, then effectively, any extra memory above 512MB is not usable. That's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2 and both had problems so i had to return at my expense","review":"I purchased 2 of these refurb units for my daughters for xmas. One would not read from its internal memory and the other worked for about 24 hours and the next time I tried to connect to it and add more songs, the USB communications would not function and would actually hang my PC. It wasn't my PC because I could disconnect it, then plug the other one in which would communicated fine. I have also had other RCA Thompson products (Lyra Portable Media Players to be more specific) and should have known better because I also had big problems with those devices. As well their tech support is also pretty much non-existent so I highly recommend trying out another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with really bad quality","review":"I like the shape, the controls and the expansion slot. Too bad the production is so shoddy.The control buttons either stop working or start controlling the wrong commands. For example, I can control the volume from the song selection buttons, so now there is no way to skip to the next song. Hopefully next week it will switch back.The battery compartment top uses a 1/16\\" plastic tongue to latch. And of course that broke, so now tape holds the battery in.And finally, once the battery life gets below 50%, a quick movement or change of volume turns the player off. Aggravating to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIT OR MISS. I SAY DON'T TAKE THE CHANCE","review":"After reading other reviews it seems this product is either really good for some or really crappy for others. <br /><br />I got this for Christmas last year and it seemed ok as a gift. Windows found it right away and it was easy to put music on it as what should be expected.<br /><br />But I started to hate it because of the fact that I can't adjust the order of the songs unless I delete them and put them back on in the order I want them in.<br />The battery cover is flimsy and the whole thing is made out of cheap plastic. <br /><br />Now recently this thing stopped working all together on me. I put music on it but the thing freezes and says there are 00 songs on it.<br /><br />After looking at other reviews, I say don't take the chance of getting a crappy player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, worth the money.","review":"I recieved this player as a gift about 4 months ago, and it has worked perfectly to date. I would recommend it to someone searching for an inexpensive mp3 player, or someone with a relatively small music collection. The only problem I've ever had with it is its lack of a backlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I had this product for 3 days and it began to mess up. If I played a song it would cut out or freeze. The only way you could get it to play again was by taking out the batteries and then putting them back in. This product is not worth buying at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"instructions should be better","review":"Almost returned this mp3 player, I could not figure out how to transfer music from my hard drive, they were very skimpy and not very detailed on how to transfer music. (on the instructions)Tried to contact rca, useless! On the day I was going to return it, I gave it another try, but this time I used the help icon that music match jukebox provided, and it worked! Excellent mp3 player, good sound, lightweight and would have gave it a 5 star if the instructions were more precise. Buy one, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor, not recommended","review":"It sounded great and has great features, but manufacturing quality was horrible. The 'select' button didn't work most of the time, and the USB connector was very fussy.To make matters worse, it disconnected (bad USB connector) during download to my SD memory card and killed a $60 card.Then to add insult to injury, the customer service from RCA is absolutely awful. No phone support, very slow reply to email questions which led to a toll-call to a secret phone support number, during which the support person denied that the player could be at fault. When I asked to talk to her supervisor, she told me that no one there could help me.For fun, I tried to contact the corporate offices. They don't seem to exist.I would not recommend purchasing a Lyra, or anything else from RCA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Construction","review":"This player was all that I wanted it to be when I bought it for my son - I even bought one for myself. Shortly thereafter, though, my son's battery compartment door broke - there's a tiny plastic tab that locks it closed. If mine hadn't broken shortly thereafter I'd say he was rough with it, but I know I wasn't. The plastic tab will first loosen, which VERY annoyingly shuts off the player in the middle of use, and then it will break off completely. It's a poor design (or perhaps this was what it was designed to do so you'd have to buy another). Now we have 2 MP3 players with taped-closed battery doors. I wouldn't buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"stops when bumped","review":"Doesn't handle bumps and hits very well i.e. wearing while working out or gardening. The player just stops and goes to the first song. Does the same thing when battery life gets low. Not impressed with battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon","review":"Got it home, the software was easy, downloaded tracks successfully, then it wouldn't stay on...I mean not for 20 seconds...tried new battery after new battery, but that wasn't the problem.Funniest part was, when we returned it to Wal Mart, they simply wrapped it back up to put on the shelf for some other poor soul to bring home---they even left our downloaded tracks on it...The good news: The good news is that it came with one kid's promotional song preloaded on it that played fine before we tried to put our own music on there. So if you just want to pay $90 to hear \\"Fish at the bottom of the sea\\"...go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I purchased this product at Radioshack (for $110) a little over a month ago, and and first I was unbeleivably pleased. This machine held MOST of my music, it was small, and it was very simple to use. Without a memory card, it only held about 30 songs, therefor I bought a memory card for $75 which doubled my memory. Additionally, there is not backlight!Now it is worth $185 with the card and it only holds 67 songs. The machine started to turn off unintentionally, and the music was played with the vocalist being completely drowned out. I went back to Radioshack, and they gave me a new one. It isn't any better. I have been researching ipods and for $250, I could have 2500 songs! That is less than $75 more, and I'm sure the quality is better. Dont buy this product, because it was expensive for doing so little. I would go for the iPod!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice size and simple once you figure it out!","review":"I bought this player two months ago and it's been great for the most part. The arm band and small size of the player make it great for workouts. You'll need a better set of headphones for working out than the included set. No big deal, you can find some for about $10. Another issue I've had is that the SD memory card came loose a couple of times in cold weather and caused the player to shut down. If you only need the 128MB of included memory, you should be fine. Also, the additional memory card will drain your battery faster. One other thing I didn't like was that it took me a while to figure out how to transfer playlists while using musicmatch. After you figure it out, its great, but it took me a while.All in all, I like this player and it seems like a good value for under $100. It's got all the basics you want for a device you can use on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 Player for running or just around the house...","review":"I bought my RCA LYRA RD1071 from Walmart about 2 months ago for $79.00. It is my second MP3 player and I have to say I am very pleased with it. I fit 50 songs on the built in 128 MB card (Using MP3PRO). The armband is great for running and a lot better then the belt clipped ones. Yes it will fit the upper arm, I have 17\\" arms and I have no problem. The headphones took a little getting used to, but work great while running, I have never had an issue. The main feature I feel is missing is a backlight. If I am running at night I have a hard time seeing what buttons to push. No big deal though there is not that many buttons to mess with. To the person that is having problems with the songs skipping in the middle, that is probably a PEBKAC or ID10T error I would say. I have had no such problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!","review":"I don't care what anyone else who's reviewed this item says, don't buy it. I bought one, got it home, and it kept freezing in the middle of songs--I had to actually pop the battery out to reset the player. I returned it immediately. I foolishly thought I must have a defective player and just got a replacement. That one worked well until shortly after the store's 14 day warranty ended then started acting up. It turns itself off as if on a whim. Sometimes it decides to skip. Sometimes it freezes in the middle of songs and I have to do the reboot thing. When the battery gets even half-way discharged, the player will turn itself off after every song it plays. I used to be able to carry it in my pocket, now if I do it skips or turns off so I have to carry it while I walk (I'm not an arm-band kind of girl though the player comes with one). It's just a pathetic player. Really, don't waste your money. I can't stress this strongly enough. I wish I'd bought ANYTHING else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just shy of perfect","review":"I LOVE this little thing! It is perfect for running or an form of exercise.

It weighs next to nothing, even with the AAA battery and has about the size of a matchbox. Installation was a breeze on my Windows ME system and the computer recognizes the player as a separate drive when connected via the usb cable. If a sd card is in the slot, this too is a separate drive (eg. drives E and F). I don't even use the included musicmatch software, I just drag and drop the mp3-files onto a sd card and pop it into the player. How much easier can it get? A nice feature, which my old player didn't have, is that it remembers the last song that was played when you shut it off and continues from there.Oh, by the way, the sound is great too, although I don't use the included headphones.The only potential problem I can see so far is that the battery compartment lid seems to be a little shaky and might break when not handled carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great product.","review":"I bought this product yesterday and I am crazy about it. I bought it for $90 at Circuit City. It is a great product. I like the headphones and the armband, except for one thing. It would be nice if the armband had a clear plastic cover so you can see the song title and press the buttons like pause, stop, fwd., bwd, etc. while still keeping it covered. It would also be nice if the LCD screen had a backlight so you can read it in the dark. The volume is great, it goes so loud! It is so easy to just drag files to the player using Internet Explorer with Windows XP. MusicMatch software is very confusing. I can't figure it out. To convert CDs to MP3 files, I recommend dBpowerAMP at www.dbpoweramp.com. It is a very good product for converting files. It is a free download. It lets you choose many things, like compression size, and the destination file.Overall, this player is a very good player."},{"rating":"1","title":"I though it would be a good player.....","review":"I bought this player of a few days ago and i thought it would be great.

I've had no end of trouble with it, and as usual, RCA provides no customer support. There is no telephone number to call in the product literature and sending them an e-mail is just as effective as sending my cat an e-mail.

This player requires additional software updates from rca.com in order to make the music tracks play in the order you want, rather than in alphabetical order. Also, the installation directions from rca.com are not quite correct, so you'll have to rely on your personal experience with computers to successfully install the patch. Once this is accomplished, the player works OK. I also suggest looking at the online discussion boards for other pitfalls of this product. The users seem to know more about the product than RCA ... and there is NO toll-free technical support for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you serious?!","review":"I found the Lyra to initally be pretty good. I am always on the go and kind of clumsy. I need an mp3 player to be durable. I will soon be purchasing a new mp3 player because my battery cover is now held on by tape. I dropped the player on carpet and the piece that locked the cover on, broke off. so I am very disappointed in the structure of the player, the size of the player is nice and conveniant and the buttons are easy to find but that is where it stops. The headphones are uncomfortable, who was in charge of that decision! I don't drive, so public transportation is key for me and I use my headphones all the time.

This album is recommended.My name is Ripper, and I approve of this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Landmark","review":"The power and anger I feel when I listen to this reminds me of the power and anger I felt when I first heard the Sex Pistols. If your idea of rap is that Puff Daddy idiot, then do yourself a huge favor and buy this CD. You'll understand that rap wasn't always about acquiring material posessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop Classic","review":"PE's second is a work of pure genius. A political masterpiece with probably some of the best songs ever heard. Favorites include Bring the Noise, Don't Believe the Hype, Terminator X to the Edge of Panic, Louder Than a Bomb, She Watch Channel Zero?!, Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos, and Rebel Without a Pause. A true classic in hip hop and should be own by all fans of hip hop. Highly Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best...period","review":"Many say that this is the best rap album ever made. I agree, but that's still selling it short. The truth is, this is one of the best albums ever made in any genre. The combination of intelligent, poetic lyrics with driving beats and layering of sounds continues to be hugely influential both within and outside of hip hop.This album, along with The Clash's 'London Calling,' proves that it is possible to combine political conviction and artistic achievement to create innovative work. Public Enemy raised the bar for popular music in general - unfortunately far too few artists even try for it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still bangin'","review":"I've been listening to this Cd ever since it came out. The message of this album is still valid today and ALL true hiphop fans should recognize it as THE album that took rap foreward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have You BEEN All My Life?","review":"Why have I been wasting my time listening to Charlie Parker and Claude Debussy all these years? What ever made me think that Aretha Franklin and Gundula Janowitz could actually sing? I must have been high. THIS is the great work of true musical genius that all mankind has been waiting for. It marks the culmination and final, greatest achievement of the human race. What have we left to live for?

Ok, in 20 years when Public Enemy would be forgotten, Elvis would still be selling and going platinum."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this music? Maybe on Planet Suck-ville","review":"This album is half baked, a nonsensical hodgepodge of militiant fight music and boring, repetitive beats. Who is bass? What are they talking about? If anyone understands What Chuck is talking about when he screams BASS at the top of his lungs then you belong on the same planet as these not very fab four. Two thumbs down Professor Griff. Check out Will Smith, Notorious B.I.G. or The Insane Clown Posse for better beats and a more uplifting, wholesome, positive message.

An absolute classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"best hip hop album ever","review":"Simply the best.

The music that accompained it delivered in a way I'd never heard before, with both fusing to make a record of such ground-breaking importance that after even ten listens, you could not yet comprehend it on a full scale.15 years on, it's still the best album I've ever bought or heard, with Chuck's voice still blowing everything else out the water. Eminem may be top dog today, but just like Mike Tyson in his prime, when PE were at their best, no one could touch them.Stand out tracks on this LP could well be all of them, with Rebel Without A Pause, Don't Believe The Hype and She Watch Channel Zero being my particular favourites. Produced by the Bomb Squad and everything on this record so tight, it was little wonder that the rap game and music in genre would never be the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most important rap/hip-hop CD ever made...","review":"...that much is true.

Want to hear old school rap? Well, then this is the CD for you. This is when rap had a cause and a feeling.I myself am not a huge fan of rap, but I can appreciate the early beginnings. Like I said, rap actually discussed issues, and important issues, albeit from interesting angles. Public Enemy knew how to do it too. I am sure most of you know their style, but for those of you who do not, or are too young to know, they sound like the Beastie Boys, at least to a degree. I do not know whether this is the best Public Enemy album or not, but this one certainly has power, as their group did. Public Enemy influenced many, as is seen in a brief instance in Limp Bizkit's new song, Phenomenon. Their affect on modern rap is even vaster than that.This is why the CD is as good as it is. Because of what Public Enemy has done for music, and just the sound of this CD itself, this album gets a four star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opa! A Wonderful Introduction","review":"This album was my introduction to Yanni. Many people may have images from the Live at the Acropolis concert which has been shown repeatedly on PBS, and may think of lush, orchestral ballads, but his earlier works were almost exclusively electronic. Here he is able to create playful, joyous melodies (as well as a couple of tender, gentle ones) that have none of the sterile feel of early electronic works. The music here is as sunny as the isles of Greece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cameleon Days CD Yanni","review":"I have been trying to add to my \\"Yanni\\" collection, and I was happy to find this CD album available.

Her intellegence, her legendary beauty and her joint crusade with her first husband, the King of France would make for an amazing story alone. Now add to it that she was also the wife of King Henry II of England and the mother of Richard the Lionheart (and SEVERAL other children) and you have the makings of an epic story filled with love, betrayal, political intrigue and so much more! Instead, Lofts tells a nice story though uninspiring which touches areas of excitement briefly toying with them and then instead wanders down the a road that is interesting but dull. This is my third Norah Lofts novel and I am still seeking the same talent and style I found in A Wayside Tavern. I am again left disappointed and wondering how the same woman wrote that book and this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Account of a Fascinating Person","review":"Although the writing is fair in this book, I was disappointed by the lack of depth to the characters, including Eleanor. This is one of the most fascinating queens in history, whose story is multi-faceted. However, this book only scratches the surface of Eleanor's life. It does not develop the relationship between her and Henry (or their sons, for that matter), which is a major pivoting point in Eleanor's life. I did like Eleanor's prison companion, Kate, and thought her character was not as flat as most were in this book. And what about the Princess Alys, who was betrothed to Richard from a young age? This book doesn't even go into the possibility of the rumored relationship between King Henry (Richard's father) and Alys as being the reason Richard called off the betrothal. I would not recommend purchasing this book unless you can find it for a quarter or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad recording","review":"Need I say more but a very poor master tape was used on this particular CD (sounds like a beat up cassette tape)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I remember years later...","review":"I had a dear aunt give me a copy of \\"All Things Great and Small\\" as a kid.

Although there are some with more memory, I only needed one that held about an hour of music, so I gave this one a try. They had them at the store I worked at, plus it was onsale, and I got an employee discount and it came with a $10 gift card, so I ended up paying about $50 brand new. Everything works fine, even the headphones, although they look funny on you while wearing them...the sound is great. The worst thing is that I have to listen on full volume, because it doesn't go up all that high. You need that if you want to drown out all of the other noise in the gym. Outdoors works better. If you are on a budget or want a first unit, buy a used one and go for it. I have had mine almost a year and no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother making a playlist","review":"I recently purchased this product and returned it 2 days later. The instructions are useless. Once I figured it out I started creating playlist and transferring them, only to have the songs played in alphabetical order by song artist, not the order of the playlist. There was nothing in the instructions or on the RCA website to help figure out what the problem was. I finally found a phone number for RCA LYRA tech support on the Better Business Bureau website. The LYRA tech person had no idea what the issue was. I got an e-mail from RCA that said the player was made to play the songs alphabetically. Why pack software to organize and manage your music if the LYRA isn't going to play it the way you want to hear it? I was very unhappy with RCA's customer support as well as MusicMatch's customer support. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linux support","review":"It works great under linux too.All you need to do is make sure your kernel has support for USB storage (most major distros do and if they don't, it's easy to recompile with support for it), and it will come up as /dev/sda1 (unless you have a serial ATA drive, in which case, /dev/sd[b/c/d]1)You can simply mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/mp3 and copy your files to it just like a normal directory.Don't forget to unmount before unplugging the USB cable.The arm-band is also great for running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy.....but","review":"The player itself works fantastically. It produces plenty of volume to keep away distractions during my workout and is small enough to stay out of the way.Two problems:1. I wasn't able to sync this Lyra with my computer. Granted, my machine runs on Windows ME...I had to take it to a buddy's computer to load music using his XP machine.2. The earphones that come with the Lyra are [bad].

It's compact and fits right into my back pocket. I just have to remember not to sit on it. There are a couple downfalls to it though. One is that it doesn't have a backlight on it. That would come in handy in so many ways. And the other one is that it battery doesn't last long at all. Sucks up the juice waayyyy too fast. Or maybe it's just me because I use mine a daily basis, but still. But other than that it's a great little tool. I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it 'cause it's simple enough","review":"I have had one for about 3 months now and what I like is being able to download music and play it in my car during my long commute. I use the tape adapter (that lets you play a cd player in tape deck) and was surprised that I could tell the differences between the different DSP's (from flat sound to pop, rock, jazz).Anyway, I was leary at first since it wasn't expensive.

The headphone jack on the second one went south about seven weeks after I bought it. The left speaker cuts in and out and every once in a while the player will stop playing music and replace it with a very high pitched squeal that won't stop until you pull out the battery.

Anyway, I haven't had the RCA Lyra 64 MB for a year (August04- March05) and it already has fallen apart. Problem 1: The button you use to skip back didn't work. If I was listening to Song #4 and wanted to go back to Song #2, I could only skip forward just to get to #2. Problem 2: The headphone jack was garbage. If I wanted to hear out of both sides of my headphones, I had to position it inside of the jack a certain way. That really had hurt my index finger. Problem 3: The lid to the battery compartment broke, so I had to wrap a rubber band around it so the battery wouldn't pop out.

The music comes out 'pixilated' - you can hear some of the music but not the words. It's as if the music is inside out somehow.When I returned home I hooked the little thing up to my Mac and the computer didn't recognize that it had ANY files on it, but the lack of available memory confirmed that those suckers were on there. Imagine my *shame* when I had to bring the player to a friend's P.C. to access the drive and erase the files.To make matters worse, this player apparently will not accept music downloaded/purchased from the iTunes on-line music store.Sign me, \\"Saving for an iPod\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good MP3 player...if it doesn't break","review":"I bought this for my husband after a lot of research.

I only got a voice mail message saying that they would call back within 24-48 hours. I never received a return phone call. Amazon was good about accepting the return, but I had to pay for return shipping on filter accessories that I ordered with this unit. This problem is not with the Amazon retaler. It is a problem with Penn-Plax, the manufacturer.

After reading the reviews on this site decided to give this a try. I could not wait and went to PetCo which was $40.00 more than Amazon. Glad I paid the $40 more as I'd hate to ship this crap back.All I can say is CHEAP and NOISY and difficult to prime. I'm hoping PetCo takes this back. The plastic used is the kind that breaks easily.

The film moves sssllooowww. The timing is off. The actors are all stock characters: the flamboyant one, the actor trying to hide, the guy on the down low, the straight female best friend, and the \\"gay everyman\\" main character. Surprisingly, the supporting actors are cuter than the main actor, unlike in most Western, gay films. I loved that this film shows that there are gay-identified men in India. However, homophobia on the subcontinent is never brought up. No character critiques this legalized bigotry brought over by the English imperialists. This was disappointingly apolitical, especially coming from characters that are supposed to be sharp, hip, and class-privileged. The one thing I loved about this movie is that many men with sexy, hairy chests are featured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a very flavorful sauce that packs a decent punch as well.

And, they published this book with a VERY explicit cover hinting at sex that NEVER arrives. With Laurell Hamilton, well that is false advertising.This book was published to sell on her name ala Stephen King at his top. Like him, they told her to clean out her desk and bring them back anything she had, because everything with her name on it was selling like hotcakes. The stories were mediocre except for a couple good ones, and none had the appreciable sex that people were buying Hamilton for. So, almost like a the exaggeration of a bad liar, they slap the blindfolded woman eating the cherry on the cover. Sheesh.Get it at the library.

For those of you who have never had the pleasure of experiencing these books, this would be an excellent introduction to the best of what Hamilton offers: strong female lead characters; paranormal realism and heroic fantasy settings; an intoxicating mix of well-written magic, courage, monsters, and sometimes humor.As an old-school Hamilton fan, I regret her last few years of weak-plotted, bodice-ripping romance weakly disguised as fantasy. This collection reminds me of why I wrote down her name years ago after reading the short story \\"Geese\\" (featured in this collection, btw) in one of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Sword and Sorceress compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best short stories EVER!","review":"I usually HATE short stories.

Hamilton's \\"Strange Candy\\" is a collection of 14 short stories, each with a brief introduction by the author. The short stories all contain fantastical creatures. There are mermen, wizards, wicked sorceresses, and even some Anita Blake that readers have not previously seen.Considering my recent disappointment with Hamilton's Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry series, I was pleasantly surprised by her short stories. I enjoyed every single one of them and found them to be well written and very entertaining.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes supernatural short stories. I would also recommend it to the Hamilton fan who is feeling a bit disgruntled with her recent novels. \\"Strange Candy\\" is a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears Easily","review":"I've gone through two of these.

Obviously trying to cash in on current interest in forensics, each chapter is poorly written and is accompanied with 3 or 4 case studies.The material in each chapter seems to be just common sense any adult could write about after doing minimal research and the case studies are too short, repetitive and sometimes don't even make sense.Very disappointing.

The leather is soft, supple, and wonderful to hold. However, I like the sturdiness of the French Moroccan leather better. The type in this Pitt Minion is very clear and readable, unlike that in the NIV edition. It does not lay flat the way it should, but I understand that it will eventually do so through normal use. One problem, as others have noted, is that the inner margin is too narrow and you have to pull it back more in order to read the text. This problem should correct itself through normal use and time, supposedly.You should also know that this KJV pitt does not include a concordance, but it does have nice cross references in the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rid of the HARD peas...Please.","review":"I LOVE all of your soups!!!!!!

Women aren't referred to as \\"tricks\\" or \\"ho's,\\" but as \\"black queens.\\" There are social commentaries about single working mothers (Mama's Always on Stage), homelessness (Mr. Wendal), and internal strife within the African American community (Everyday People). My favorite song on this album is \\"Fishing for Religion,\\" which not only has a great beat, but also makes a sharp criticism about how some churches encourage passiveness. Most striking throughout this album is the love and celebration for African American culture.There are several mellower songs on the album. Personally, I prefer the upbeat numbers, but if you're looking for something a little funky and thought-provoking, give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"good CD! worth buying!","review":"I really want to know how you can have \\"way too much ernestness in your social message\\". As a previous reviewer complained in regards to this album. Is that like being \\"too positive\\"? is there such a thing? This album is a bit retro at this point in time which is why the 4 instead of 5 stars. the biggest shame is that they broke up.

They devote a track to a kind of live-show announcement, reeling off the band members' names and roles. The worst is delivered by Speech, who let's us know more than once that yes, he is the LEADER. Good for you, Speech.This is music that needed a few more months of fermentation, and a better producer. As is, it shows a pretty immature grasp of songwriting and way too much earnestness in its social message.It's late 1999 as I write this; if you haven't got this CD already, skip it.

When the product arrived, it turned out to be just one, password protected PDF file in a CD. Nothing else, no .doc or any other writable file formats, just the PDF file. later on it truned out that if you need the writable file formats (like MS Word) you would have to pay 30-40$ extra and download them from the producer webpage.

This event was also hurt by the Nash/Giant match not happening, the Beniot/Raven match not happening and the DDP/Curt Hennig match not taking place in a steel cage like it was menioned it would before. Trust me folks, this one ain't worth $50!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps one of the best of 1997","review":"Not a bad show, too many guys got replaced, it would have been nice to see Nash vs Giant, Raven vs Benoit, Konnan, Norton, and Savage vs Steiners and Bossman, but still not too shabby of a show. The main event was disappointing, but I still got my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Effort","review":"Some will like the Hogan/Sting match if you have been waiting to see the two collide and have yet to see it. However, the match several years late and both are past their prime (well, Hogan was never a good worker). Malenko and Guerrero have a match that would be good for a house show; however, this match can't even be compared to some of their previous match-ups. Those matches redefined the face of pro wrestling in the United States back in 1995, but this one only stands out because the rest of the card is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This so called ppv is the worst ppv of all time.

Other matches include Eric Bischoff vs. Larry Zybszko, \\"Diamond\\" Dallas Page vs. Curt Henning, Bill Goldberg vs. Steve \\"Mongo\\" McMichale, Chris Benoit vs. Saturn, Lex Luger vs. \\"Buff\\" Bagwell, and Macho Man Randy Savage, Scott Norton, and Vincent vs. Stiener Brothers and Ray Traylor.

The 6 man tag team match between Team NWO(Scott Norton,Vincent & Randy Savage) & Team WCW(Ray Traylor,Rick Steiner & Scott Steiner) was not great but pretty good. The Bill Goldberg-Steve McMichael match was not good but at least it was fairly short. The Perry Saturn-Chris Benoit-Raven's Rules match while not a bad bout,the stupid rules eliminated any chance of a good match too. The Buff Bagwell-Lex Luger match stinks like a 27-year old hamburger. The US title match between Curt Henning & DDP was 10 minutes of nothing. The Larry Zbyszko-Eric Bischoff match was horrible. The World title match between Hulk Hogan & Sting was short,awful & stupid.

Something special about the conflict was the astonishingly low time from target aquisition, to coalition planes being able to put steel on target.The dvd is also high on interviews, and low on action footage.This is probably a nice dvd for military fanboys with low technical knowledge...but for the rest of us this is a thing to avoid.

For example, there are far too many yo-yo models that are missing from the guide (either in description or picture); the descriptions are inconsistent, too brief and, in many cases, inadequate because there is no accompanying picture. Many of the color pictures have poor contrast and brightness making it difficult to see details in a logo or decal. The price values associated with nearly all the yo-yos in the book are way out of line with what collectors are currently willing to pay. In some cases, it is hundreds of dollars more!

It's especially nice treat to see the show IN COLOR!! When I was kid, we had Black & White TV -parents didn't get COLOR set until all the kids left home! Really enjoy seeing show again, but quickly realized is true what another reviewer has touched upon.. that MAJORITY of duration of show is filled up by time consuming, repetitive sequences shown over and over in each episode.. watch me pull a rabit out of my hat.. ect. I never noticed it as a child but now, as an adult, it has literally put me to sleep numerous times!! I've had to play episodes several times to try and stay awake! I suspect that back in the 1960's they couldn't afford to do all new animation each episode, so only the actual stories were new each time. But is nostalgic remenicing to see them again IN LIVING COLOR! Wish SONY would put out Season Four!! I have all three seasons and would snatch up Season Four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"r & B season 2","review":"It's a shame they didn't use the original music during the credits. Jay Ward didn't own the rights to the music and the company putting out the DVD set didn't want to have to pay royalties for its use. Imagine seeing The Andy Griffith Show and not hearing the whistling theme song. It's also annoying that they used the opening credit segment that showed the name of the show as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE AND FRIENDS, when it was really ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS. If you notice, when that segment plays, the voice is NOT that of William Conrad, but rather, someone who \\"sounds\\" like him. Other than these complaints about the opening and closing credits, the material on the set if great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another dose of Moose and Squirrel","review":"Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose (the Jay standing for Jay Ward their alter ego/creator) is utterly brilliant. I loved it as a child, but that is nothing compared how I love it as a child. Everything had some subtle double meaning...well, okay not so subtle! Lol, remember this is Jay Ward who marched up to the White House on the quest to get Frost Bite Falls on the Map - write at the outbreak of the Cuban Missile Crisis and nearly got through in the jail-house, where he would have been tormented by Mr. Big and Fearless Leader.It's the reason DVDs were made. Such great quality.

The list is actually glass, ceiling, Eiffel Tower, drapes, roses, door, tree, elephant, street, ashtray. I had not recalled that list since about 1982 yet I pulled it out of my head just now and will remember it forever, just like pi to a few thousand places, every phone number every person I know ever had, every address, every car license plate, you name it.

If you liked Peter Pan you will love this book by JT Petty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly great book!","review":"After reading a portion of this book in a free sampler, I had to buy it!

These are things thst earn this pencil 2 stars.The eraser doesn't work! How on Earth can you work without and eraser?

I used to visit my local library and sit on the floor in front of the shelf where the book was located and read it over and over and over and over again. I could never get enough. Now I am even happier to find that it is still in print and I can have one for my 5 year old. I can't wait until he gets to hear it. I hope he likes it just as much as I did and still do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teacher's tool to teach Homophones and Puns","review":"My fourth grade class throughly enjoyed the humor in Gwynne's books: The King Who Rained, A Chocolate Moose for Dinner, and A Little Pigeon Toed. They thought the books were very funny, and they tied right in with our spelling unit on homophones too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids don't get it","review":"I hate to post a negative review, especially since the author is someone I respect, but I just need to put this out there so other librarians like me won't make the same mistake--we just don't have the budget to afford books that won't circulate. I was excited to order this book--the premise is great and I figured teachers would love this in their classrooms--but it's so old-fashioned that kids today just don't get the jokes and haven't heard the sayings. Like sheep gambling on the lawn and the family coat-of-arms. It's targeted for young children but even the fourth-graders at my school didn't get most of the text. I think this book is amusing to adults, but is not for today's kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This was a favorite book as a child. Now I have purchased it for my child.

I didn't want to buy anything too expensive so I got these. They're perfectly serviceable and a good price but their appearance leaves something to be desired. You can see the seams where the two halves of glass are 'glued' together and there is a lot of rippling throughout the glass so they aren't terribly clear. They're fine for husband's needs, but I won't use them for company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and compact","review":"I got this from the library and had to add it to my gardening collection. It's compact, but has lots of useful information, from rose care to good ideas on how to select and use particular rose varieties and a big photo section showing favorite roses. I've had a lot of fun looking at it again and again. If you only want one rose book, I don't think you could go wrong with this one. If you already have lots, like me, you'll still find this useful and enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful information, but the book falls apart","review":"I received this book a couple of days ago from Amazon, and while the information and photographs are helpful, the pages are falling out. It's a paperback and it just seems to be pretty shoddily put together. Kind of a hassle to have to return it especially since I live in Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for Younger Readers","review":"This book was written more for adolescent readers than adults. If you are truly interested in quality books about Nicaragua, then do not purchase this particular edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunt presents an excellent, very readable summary.","review":"As a historical work, this is the most readable, entertaining, and interesting book I can recall. Hunt includes lively, animating biographies of each historical figure, giving them a personality beyond the ordinary dry treatments of these great people.Besides making for entertaining reading, The Story of Psychology is easily more informative than any book on the subject that I have seen. The reader can choose any section of the book, divided neatly by fundamental psychological camps (the Behaviorists, the Personality Psychologists, etc.) and become aptly informed on the focus of that group, its leaders, and its place in the history of Psychology.This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfairly biased, and more readable than informative","review":"Hunt tries to do a good job in making the subject matter interesting, but in doing so he devotes so much space to anecdotes that he leaves out a lot of more pertinent information. Also, he does not give a neutral history of psychology, but instead displays empirical biases and a bias of psychology as a science throughout the book, writing at more length about philosophers and psychologists who agree with him and dismissing, ridiculing, and understating those who do not. For a non-biased history of the philosophical roots of psychology, try Robert MacLeod's Persistant Problems of Psychology. Unfortunately, though, that book only has the philosophic background of psychology and does not enter into the history of psychology in the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersting and informative!","review":"This book was assigned to my History and Systems of Psychology class as our textbook. My professor promised to the class on the first day that this was a book for a class that we would: 1) actually want to ready and 2) wouldn't be able to put down. I did not take his comment seriously at right but he was right! This book is highly readable, grabs your attention from the start, and keeps you wanting to turn to the next page. It tackles psychology (and often cases science as a whole) as a process that started hundreds of years ago. Hunt introduces the reader to many famous thinkers, and many unknowns to the average person, who had an effect (whether positive or negative) on the development of psychology as we know it today. If you are at all curious as to why psychology exists today and who developed its ideas, then this book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, anecdotal, readable.","review":"Highly recommended for its historico-philosophical background made clear and interesting, spiced as it is with interesting stories about the founders and forerunners of psychology. One could wish for more fairness toward Jung and the organismic psychologies; I for one see psychology's scientific side as its least interesting one (physics envy!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yanni outdoes himself!!","review":"This is an exellent cd as are all of Yanni's.

Finally got this one, and my force field is complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your life elsewhere !!!","review":"This book is a far way from helpful. The authors have done an O.K. job in transformming their lives. But they seemed to have trouble giving the reader some ideas on how to achive it. They gave about a dozen examples of how people achive \\"F.I.\\", but no new ideas.(we've read this before when it was titled \\"Your Money or Your Life)Anyone who has read \\"YM or Y L\\" should consider themselves done with the subject. Blix and Heitmiller give off some sort of cockyness about the lives they lead. Maybe someday we will all get there.Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had expected more from this product. All it is are single page maps of cities in Kalamar and the Young Kingdoms with no labels, references, and little distinction between them. All in all, hopelessly generic and of little use."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing exceptional about this book","review":"The gist of the story is that baby owl must wait and wait and wait. His mother tells him he just has to wait. We know not for what until the end. He is waiting to take his first flight. When he finally gets to fly he loves it and enjoys the sites.Charming illustrations in chalk pastel. Owls are very cutesy looking (cartoon-ish) with very large eyes (versus a more accurate portrayal of what they really look like).There is just nothing special about this book. I find it boring. Unless you have a special affection for owls or want to read to your child about how sometimes we must wait to do something we want, I recommend skipping this book. While the content is innocent, friendly, no violence or negative comment, I just can't see any reason why I should rate this higher than 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Representative of Genre of Civil War Regimental Histories","review":"This volume of regimental histories of Georgia units in the Civil War is a gem. James Madison Folsom traveled to Virginia near the end of the war and worked directly with the regimental leaders of the units included to compile these histories, along with statistics (e.g., number of men enlisted, killed, wounded, etc.). Civil War history buffs will enjoy reading the histories. Family historians will be especially interested in the histories. My great-great grandfather was a member of the 6th Georgia Volunteer Infantry, and its regimental history is 11 pages in length. Heroes and Martyrs of Georgia provides the most complete source of information about the 6th Georgia regiment that I have been able to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"optical race","review":"I have listened to a lot of tangerine dream over the years but optical race is the best album they made. Every song sounds unique and really relaxes you. Take this album to the beach at night and watch the ocean and you feel like you are being entertained by nature and tangerine dream. The music just flows with the ocean scenery, no other tangerine dream album does this. I scuba dive a lot and i love the ocean and this album adds a awsome soundtrack to that beautiful mysterious world ocean. This album is great also just for lounging and relaxing, the stress melts away, i am also a firefighter so believe me i helps a great deal... SCUBA SCUBA!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangerine Dream","review":"Tangerine Dream's best album. They have dabbled in electronic music since the 70's. Most of their albums were mediocre at best. This album is one of my favorite albums for driving or listening at home. If all of their music was of this quality I would rate them second only to Jean Michael Jarre as electronic artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this cd!","review":"This cd is just mesmerizing through and through.It also seems hard to find.

SEVERAL pages of pictures by Trevor Constable and others using his advice on techniques! Several pictures from his first book are here, and many updated shots as well.All in all a good book if you like UFOs or just enjoy \\"different\\" things! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool","review":"i teach high school english, 10th grade honors, to be exact. our school has no real grammar program -- and it shows! i've struggled with what to do about grammar, because de-contextualized grammar doesn't work and in-context takes longer to work than i have with my kids. i see almost no improvement. i grant that my situation is particularly abominable, but the point is: i got this book this summer and i have been doing it and i talked two of my colleagues into doing it with me and right now i don't even know where my book is because my dept seems to be sharing it. i haven't been doing it long enough to be sure, but i think this is going to work. it feels like it. it feels good so far. i think some stuff has already started to stick. that's cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to learn and review grammar skills for junior high","review":"This book is a great tool for teaching and reviewing grammar skills at the junior high level. A story unfolds, one sentence a day, and provides needed repetition of basic grammar skills. I use it as the sponge lesson each day at the beginning of my classes. The book also contains quizzes and writing lessons. The kids love it; they are honing their grammar skills, and they race to be \\"first\\" because that person gets to write the correct sentence on the overhead! It's amazing what a little competition can do! I teach in Texas with a state-mandated skills test hanging over us every year, and I'm convinced it has helped our 7th and 8th master the writing portion of the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like for several reasons","review":"I really disliked this book for several reasons:- It's a really complicated and disorganized way to explain a good idea (give kids an ongoing story with grammar mistakes and let them correct it).- That's all the book is: a concept. It's not a turnkey solution in itself like every other book I've ordered in this genre. All of the work of making up the story is left up to the reader.- It's really poorly written with some questionable grammer, including the title. Why is there an apostrophe in Caught 'ya? The author loses credibility with that one.Gave it two stars because of the listing of common grammar mistakes from her experience. All in all, not a good purchase - disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"As a homeschooling mother, I was looking for something fun for my daughter to do. I found this book to be a waste of money and incredibly simplistic. About 95% of the book was unnecessary - an outline of the procedure and the actual story would have sufficed. I feel really ripped off. This is how they teach grammar in school? A sentence a day? No wonder many kids can't read, write or spell. Unfortunately I can't get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complicated...","review":"I tried reading the introduction to this book and got bogged down in all the details. I couldn't figure out the program. Too confusing! Also, you have to make up your own stories. I'd rather have a book with everything ready to go for classroom use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Positive for Character Education","review":"Although the concept is a good one, I swept this book under rug. As an English teacher, I am always willing to find fun activities to peak my student's learning, but I refuse to use stories that sound disrespectful toward teachers and students. My job is to teach respect for peers and to build character while teaching the beauty of Engish, but this book offers neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Students LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"I bought the book at Christmas break and my 4th graders look forward to it every morning when they come in the door. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Giggling grammar","review":"I have been using one of the daily oral language stories contained in this book and my students love it. The continuous stories really help kids to connect to the subject matter, rather than just focusing on the grammar corrections.I do wish that the book contained more stories rather than just suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion on the product","review":"This is a great sweat band. Absorbs and does the job it is supposed to do. Not just a head decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insights from the Outsider","review":"Fuentes does not bridge the gap between two colossal cultures, he defines that gap. As a gringo in his own country Mexico, and a foreigner in the US, he is qualified and capable to draw a honest and sensitive picture of these two countries and its characters. He uses the physical divide to draw a picture of what really matters to him - the poverty and impasse existence of myriads of people in Mexico. Luckily, there is only a hint of his (far leftist) politics, and we are allowed to enjoy his cultural insight, deep understanding of characters, compassion for suffering, and sense of humor. A powerful author, but short of the genius of friend and peer Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambivalent novel long on poetry, short on solutions","review":"Tedious novel in the form of nine linked stories shows Mexican life from multiple angles, none too flattering. The crystal frontier of the title is, of course, the U.S.-Mexican border; what matters here is less the border as geopolitical fact and more its impact on the Mexican psyche. The author aims his barbs at both sides of the border; there's little surprising here except perhaps for the portrayal of a disdainful Mexican upper class that couldn't care less about how the other half lives or whether it lives or starves. Book clubs will find this a useful tool for stirring up discussion on the illegal drug and immigration issues whether they read through to the end or not; those who do will be rewarded with a chapter written half in normal prose and half in surreal fragmentary lines of poetry, the effect of which is not unlike sitting through a Tarkovsky double-feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photocopy quality","review":"The book in itself is excellent, I have seen and used it for research at the Allen County Public Library in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I had hoped to include a copy in my own personal library, b ut when I received this copy, I found that a great majority of what I needed to review for research was illegible. Bottom line, \\"I don't like it\\" does not mean the substance of the book, but the quality of the photocopy results in the re-issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This is a must read book for anyone interested in taking care of thier family or loved ones.

Very good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Set","review":"We were very disappointed in this item, which is listed as a CD with Book. There was no CD, so the book that did arrive was useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It's the Now that hurts!\\"","review":"The title may be somewhat misleading, as this somber story is not about endangered species or a native tribe. Rather, it is the poignant portrait of a family--especially the relationship between two sisters--shattered by sudden, senseless devastation. Almost 11, Joss has longed to have her own horse--a dream about to come true on her birthday. But no one could foresee the disaster as family dynamics are irrevocably severed.Narrated by 13-year-old Kate, this book reveals sisterly intimacies and suppressed rivalries, while praising the role of devoted friends and kindly adults. Far from saccharine, this book will lead young readers into serious reflection on the fragility of human life; the \\"personal myth\\" of teenagers precludes acceptance that tragedy could occur in their own family, or to their close friends or even themselves. Each person must cope with grief in his or her own way, for death is always hardest for those who remain behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"After firmware upgraded,It can serve as a removable disk.","review":"This removable disk design makes it even simpler to transfer music files.Sometimes,it is handy to carry a few warez and documents in 195.Maybe,it can aslo be a usb bootdisk.My classmate bought one at 2300RMB,about 278Dollars in shanghai,China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats the point?","review":"If your going to buy this item, I have one question to ask of you...Why?

The prose was clean, the development logical and the treatment adequately thorough for an undergrad text.For those who find their first class in E&M; a little daunting, I would strongly recommend the little book: \\"Div, Grad, Curl and All That\\" by H.M. Shey. This informal text covers all of the vector calculus essential to basic E&M; theory with lots of worked examples and problems with solutions. My advice is to bone up on vector calculus first -- it makes E&M; theory much more accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is by far the worst text book I have ever used.","review":"As an introductory level textbook, this is terrible.

Be warned: There is an addendum that goes with the book, because there are a significant number of mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What!","review":"When I met the band after a show one night I told them \\"the music is what gets me nothing else but the music\\". It seems like they were concentrating on something else other that the music that makes them OAR, especially when they made it sound like a Kelly Clarkston album and then sold it to the radio. Sorry, still love the band but this album just puts them on the bottom of my list of shows to see this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same O.A.R....but still good!","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who say its not the same O.A.R., which is definately true. The thing i have always liked about OAR is how they are so easy to listen to and get into, and i think that this album still exhibits that. Some of the lyrics aren't as deep and it doesn't have such a reggae-ish vibe, but hey its still good music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back O.A.R.","review":"I have been a devout fan of OAR since the time when \\"oar\\" was a paddle to most people. I've heard all songs, own all their albums, and can't get enough of them. When I heard the new record I was extremely dissappointed. Although still a good album, they have obviously changed their style of music. Many of us true fans have loved OAR for the unique sound and style, because of their instrumental jams in every song, their constantly changing lyrics, powerful live performances, and I must say... the new album shows none of this. OAR is obviously trying to branch out and reach a new audience, but at the same time they are compromising their music and true fans. If OAR keeps this up they will sound just like any other pop music band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educate yourself","review":"It's a great argument as to whether or not this is indeed o.a.r. music.....for that argument it is NOT, and they proboly know it.....It's even a greater argument to say that music should evolve....this ISN'T music evolution this is leaving yourself at the door and shaking hands with the devil! When you evolve as a band you don't COMPLETELY CHANGE and furthermore change your music so it fits the current cycle of main-stream CRAP thats played on the radio! Radio music is for those who have no understanding of music but rather understand the same repeating noise that otherwise poisons the ears of those who listen! Good bands dont make the radio PERIOD it's a shame but that's the industry........your either true to what you do as an artist or your another slave to industry driven mind numbing garbage.If it's gold they are after i would hope they realize how phoney the lustre is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real fans will appreciate, fake fans stray away","review":"Any fan of a band that can't appreciate and respect their growth and change as an artist should never call themselves a fan of music in general.

I enjoy all of O.A.R.'s past albums. This new stuff is not O.A.R. Their older music has sucn a distinct sound, you could recognize one of their songs easily. Their new songs sound like something that any generic pop-punk band would be playing on MTV. I am a huge O.A.R. fan and this is absolutely horrible. It sounds nothing like them. It sounds unoriginal. There is no fun in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I am just simply shocked. Granted I just bought this CD, however after listening to it I an EXTREMELY skeptical. It's very pop and very mainstream. If any of you have ever heard of Suicide Machines you will know what I mean. They shot themselves in the foot with an album like this but I hope to God O.A.R. does not. O.A.R. is my favorite band and this is not them. Continuing down this path will put them back to playing in the corner bar or broken up completely. The fans are where its at, why disappoint them? More than half of the reviews state the same. PLEASE reconsider your path! This is the first review I have ever written, as I am that disappointed. I am going to see O.A.R. in Denver Oct 21st, 2005 and I really hope I do not hear any of their new stuff.

Runs Low","review":"Can't say if this CD represents a sell out by O.A.R., but it is not the O.A.R sound that I have grown to love. Something that seems to happen to most creative people over time is that the creative well starts to run low or just goes empty. This CD has that feel to it. Not really a good tune on it. This review is a tough love review and I hope O.A.R. makes a comeback."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.A.R. is no Stranger to Success","review":"I cannot get enough of this band. My favorite band and I'm not dissapointed. It's impossible for them to dissapoint me. Another great CD, a little more poppy, but still a great, great CD. If you don't know anything about O.A.R, check out any of their live CD's to get a good idea of the band..\\"34th and 8th\\" or \\"Any Time Now\\" is a good place to start, CD wise.

It's feel good music and these guys are full of passion. I did notice there is a difference from the older albums though. I would have liked them to incorporate a little more of the jazz sound in to this one. All in all a solid, upbeat album. On another note, I highly recommend going to one of their shows, they are awesome live!! Been to at least four shows so far.

It is completley unoriginal pop music. Oar was influenced wayy too much by stores like hollister and money. This is Honky Music. If you have no taste in music and don't understand it this album is for you. Otherwise Load up on some of their old albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a let-down...","review":"Radio stations will love this album - serious O.A.R. fans will not! I've been a fan of the band for years and have seen them in concert numerous times. I was a little nervous to hear they were making a more \\"polished\\" major-label album, and all of my fears were confounded upon listening to \\"Stories of A Stranger.\\" Its sound is very mainstream pop, with hardly any of the jazzy spunk that set O.A.R. apart in the first place. I can only hope that they'll take the response of their fans to heart and return to the more raw sound of their previous albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I have been an OAR for about two years now. When I first heard them i was like who the hell is this and then I kept listening more and more and they are now my favorite band.I now have almost all of there albums and think this one is another great work by them. They like any other band have progressed to another level and I think have opened themselves up to a new crowd. You are seeing the true OAR fans on here supporting them and it is because of these fans that OAR will never leave there original sound and it is these fans that will open the eyes of the new fans to their earlier music and they will continue to top of the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Listen","review":"The more I listen to the music, the more I like!

I remember when I used to hear an amazing amount of emotion in Marc's voice, and they had a unique, edgy style to their music. This album is totally different, and frankly, I don't like it. There is only one song I would listen to over and over again, and that is the first song on the album. A huge disappointment. Also, similar to what some other reviews have said, their live show has gone way down hill. There is no connection with the audience, and their 'jamming' is always the exact same."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.A.R. selling out","review":"Im very dissapointed at O.A.R.'s new c.d and it gives just more evidence that money is more important then good music these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME","review":"O.A.R. has released an INCREDIBLE CD. It's great! It feels wrong to ever go to the beach again and not listen to this CD. Every song is a great song. Worth every penny. A great product.

This album is completely mainstream and extremely \\"popish\\". The lyrics are great but the beat is not O.A.R.Personally, I think they should have stuck with their last record label Everfine, because Lava is taking them down the wrong path.I recommend any of their previous albums, especially \\"Any Time Now\\" and their most recent \\"34th and 8th\\" album. I've been a fan for about 7 years now, and can honestly say that I am really dissapointed in their latest album.

We learn right from the start that Odelia is out to change how society looks at larger men and women. The surprise is when she adds in the character of Greg, a paraplegic to whom Odelia finds herself attracted. But Ms. Jeffries turns the tides on us and shows us that even Odelia, who is fighting discrimination, has some misgivings about getting involved with Greg due to his handicap.I was afraid the book might be \\"preachy\\" about stereotypes, but it really wasn't. It was presented very well and meshed well with a good mystery.

In the end there is some sort of join up, and the story ends happily.Another issue I have with these books is that they do not grow with the reader, I started reading these books at age 11, now I am 15. There needs to be more drastic events (or at least one) within the characters. There needs to be something more exciting (Mystery, Romance, or Action). Overall New Beginnings is unthrilling, and a repeat of past books.

I did not think I would like this book. Surprisingly I did, because there was a lot of things not out in the open that were underlying in the story. Let's face it: this book IS typical Heartland because it was about Amy helping this family pick up from her last visit in book #9. Carey is a troubled teen that does not feel sure about how to feel after her grandfather Huten dies. But she knows in her heart that she must leave Ocanuba because he gave her his blessing to go see the world. Amy, helping Maverick and through horses, can understand human behavior, which is quite right. Also this book carries the fact that saying you'll leave a person or place you love is one thing, but it takes courage to actually follow through. Brooke deserves a lot of credit here for her thick plots. This book actually kept me turning the pages for hours on end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop at 20","review":"This is a good Heartland books. I just wanted to say that the books up to 20 are all awesome. 20 is really a very good ending to the series. That being said -I would recommend that you stop reading here. Don't read the special books after this. You will feel betrayed as a reader and you will get an entirely new perspective of the books and characters(Not a Good one, in anyway) So end your reading here. Go back and read the books over and over again. Don't ruin your love of Heartland, Amy, Ty, the horses, and every body else.

A merciless skewering of the big time agency hustle; a tragicomic love story, that ends far more tragic than comic.I don't know who this Deborah Skelly is.

However, I was mistaken. The characters in this book never seem to be quite fully developed. The reader is left guessing and assuming what the characters are feeling. The plot is predictable, but worse than that it's boring. The so called humor is lacking, I only found a couple instances where I found the book funny, and one of them is already on the review page.

Some are histories of the entire battle, some have been entire works about a single day. I have read unit histories as well as the stories of individuals. None, however, have so completely engaged me as Mr. Trudeau's work. I have read his previous Civil War titles and was equally impressed. Mr. Trudeau is able to blend all of the smaller engagements at Gettysburg into one very readable work. The maps that are included are fantastic; quite possibly the best I've seen in any work of military history. This is a great work, and I highly recommend it to the serious historian or the casual reader who wants to know more about those three awful days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough one to finish","review":"Trudeau's writing style is very hard to follow. The book reminded me of the play by play of a football game...but with no color commentary. The historical context of events is not developed so you are left confused and frustrated. I guess Trudeau assumes that the reader is already quite familiar with the main characters and outcome of the battle, and what he is offering is new detail and analysis for those who have read other the other major works on Gettysburg. I could not get a handle on the events because just as some clarity seemed to surface, Trudeau jumped to another series of events and location. Back and forth, up and down, North and South, East and West... it was very hard to understand. The tiny maps were an additional annoyance, and often did not show the names of the participants mentioned in the preceding text. The book was heavily researched, but not particularly coherent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am SO glad I checked this out of the library!","review":"I have read many, many books on Gettysburg and have attended seminars and classes on the subject.

Rembert grew up, like too many Southern blacks, without education or any resources, was wrongly imprisoned for seven years on a chain gang long after chain gangs were illegal, and went on to raise a family of eight kids--while becoming a great artist without any training. \\"All Me\\" is similar to the book \\"Slavery by Another Name,\\" by Douglas Blackmon, in its examination of the truly oppressive policies in Southern states for up to a century after the Civil War, and it's also a beautiful personal portrait of an individual man who has a gift for storytelling on leather.

I'm not an uneducated idiot, but when I read a book I expect it to be written in language the public (me) can understand. Clarity is never inappropriate.

The book draws on extensive secondary source materials (mostly industry publications) and interviews conducted by the author. Flamm is not shy about criticizing the work of others with whom he disagrees (Laura Tyson and David Yoffie, for example), but oddly fails to cite others whose parallel analyses predate this book (i.e. Andrew Dick on forward pricing strategies or Fred Bergsten and Marcus Noland on the quantitative impact of the semiconductor trade agreement)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"Do yourself a favor and pass buy this book.

She illuminated those moments of quietness, gentleness and noble, feminine pride and elegance like no other soprano before and after her. This release of her \\"Spanish Songs\\" has never been surpassed. The songs of her homeland seem to have been written for her beautiful instrument alone, she fills every piece with special beauty and charm, religious flair and beautiful, noble simplicity. Buy this recording and see why Victoria is one of the best sopranos ever having come from Spain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars Aren't Enough!","review":"I got this CD set in the mail on October 4, 2010, and it exceeded all my expectations. I can't remember when I've enjoyed recorded music so much. When it comes to versatility, Victoria de los Angeles can hold her own even with Joan Sutherland. Sutherland sang everything from Bach to Wagner beautifully. De los Angeles' recordings of Spanish songs from the middle ages to the 20th century--including a few sung in Basque--are AWESOME. Every track on every CD is an absolute jewel. This lady truly deserves to be called Victory of the Angels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 sur 5 (la voix d'un Ange)","review":"Un splendide récital de mélodies Espagnoles et complète dans la production de la fameuse et extraordinaire Victoria de Los Angelès - LA VOIX D'UN ANGE Christian (France)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pylean Princess Cordelia is awesome.","review":"When Cordelia became a princess in the demon dimension, she helped to freethe slaves and to start a democracy.

It is written both with heart and with the correct information you need as a beginging student. You can feel the passion of the writers for the subject, and no wonder, Tappan is one of the most famous massage therapists America ever had. The authors write so sympathetically that you are pulled further into the book.This is an amazing accomplishment in a college level textbook. I am in love with this book! It integrates Eastern and Western styles beautifully. A beautiful labor of love. This book is also on the recommended study list by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Body Work. Not many books made that cut.

It's about a hi-fly construction magnate in 1950's where pressure takes its tool on him and he shouts at his wife. He leaves for scotland to have a quiet vacation where he meets a tempestous unmarried woman who's steep in scottish traditions. There blooms a delicate romance between the two.

I have a few bills and a handful of change in mine and it snaps closed with no issues.The card slots are a little tight, hoping they stretch out after a while.

However, I don't like that it doesn't have a zippered coin pocket. Also, the metallic edge on it was all scuffed up so I presume the finish is not very durable.

Alas, we had to still buy another vest that fit him better throughout his triangular torso and have the seamstress take the buttons from this one and put it on another vest entirely because altering this one would have cost too much or more than the new one which was $60. Tacky metalic belt hinge on the back, not pictured, when pulled (but unable to secure) pleats up the back and wrinkles the look. You want a clean backed vestment, than this is not the vest for you.

I would get a loud fast clicking that made hearing the station impossible & it would click faster the more I turned up the volume. The clicking was intermittent at first & very anoying when trying to listen to a game. Now it happens all the time.

Obviously I cannot recomend this large bulky radio with awful reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls in distant stations even on summer days","review":"If you like to listen to AM talk radion, sports or news this radio is unbeatable. I have the Sony ICF SW7600GR and the AM section can't hold a candle to the Superadio III.Personally I think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found. I am amased that this unit gets the job done for $40.00.It does what it says. Hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't your dad's Superadio......unfortunately.","review":"I had heard that GE farmed out maufacturing of the current Superadio III to another company, and that this current model was sub-par compared to the older Superadios. I rolled the dice and ordered one any way. Shipping was quick. My nostalgia for the quaint bulky design and big-speaker sound was satisfied. FM reception was always just okay even on the older models, so no big surprises there...but the real problem, and it is a big one, is that regardless of signal stregnth you'll never quite feel that you've tuned the dial to exactly the right spot to properly hear your station of choice, especially on AM (but FM too). There's an annoying hiss and other noise indicative of a poorly tuned in station -- no matter which station you choose. Using the wide/ narrow band switch doesn't help. If you don't mind the sloppy tuning and not-so-great reception, the Superadio III is not a total disaster; it does work. There's just nothing super about it any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bang for your buck!","review":"Nothing fancy about this radio except the am reception. It's tops.

I can pull this station in on my GM car radio anytime. Also wanted it to pull in a weak AM station less than 20 miles away after 6 pm. It will receive it but so weak and garbled that it is hard to listen. From 8pm til midnight there are so many stations mixed up on most frequencies on this radio and not many can you get clear. I would not buy this radio again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super FRUGAL radio!","review":"Received the radio almost 3 years ago from amazon and have used it nearly every day since for approx 1 - 3 hrs a day. I initially ran the radio on house current for about 2 hrs the day it arrived but then I went to the store to get the 6 \\"D\\" cells that power this unit and it has only run on those batteries since.

But before he gave it to us he tested the equipment. Well the flashlight only ran for 24 continuous hours, but the radio went for three months on one set of batteries, and he stopped because he had to give us the radio not because the batteries gave. For eight years I have counted on this radio to deliver all my baseball games that I can't watch on TV. It has never failed. It has more range than any other radio in my house and I have only changed the batteries twice in the time I have had it. The only shortcoming of the radio is that it has no digital tuner, but I'll give that up any day for the reliability that this product provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I couldn't wait to get this radio for my wife.

I have not found it to be much better then an older portable radio that I have which is much smaller and cost much less. IE: I am not able to pick up FM Stations 30 miles away, and can only pick up one AM station that is only 5 miles away. It is large and the sound is good. The receiver dial is way off IE: a station that should be at 99.9 on the FM dial is found around 101. This makes me wonder if that is one reason I can not pick up stations on the low end of the dial IE: FM 89.9 and that was my main reason for purchsing this radio. Basically I took a gamble that did not pay off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also Disappointed","review":"I must have gotten a bad one.

One of my co-workers has one in his office and he must have gotten a bad one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent radio for the $","review":"Not bad for the money. I am happy enough with it to not return the item. It replaces a Superadio 1 I bought back in 1980, and seems comparable in sound and reception quality. This, although it is considerably larger and has no better sound at the low end.I brought it to work, which is a really poor place for AM reception, and was disappointed to find that connecting an 80 foot antenna to the AM terminal had no effect whatsoever on AM reception.Other than that, reception is OK by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Owner of Two","review":"I've owned two of these units for over five years. They have excellent sound, pull in distant stations very well indeed, and run \\"forever\\" on a set of batteries.

My old radio never sounded or recieved so well after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and looks it","review":"I own this one. Well, it's cheap and it pulls in some stations that others don't, but it's nothing exceptional. If you buy it, expect the worst build quality you've ever seen.

I like to listen in the garden. My earlier strategy was to acquire old boom boxes from thrift stores, but with these, the signal frequently went fuzzy. On an inpulse, I bought a nice digital Eton radio for excess of $200. It was a nice radio and fairly sensitive, but it had features I did not need -- It seemed more design for Short Wave listening than for FM. When I acquired the GE Super radio, I did side by side comparison. The GE was better and cost a fraction of what the Eton cost. The Eton went back to the store.I love the sound. One quibble: The batteries keep falling out. The battery compartment opens too easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"no better than my throwaways","review":"after countless researching and reviews, I had to get it.

It was in all respects a great radio. So I bought this one expecting at least equal performance. But I was sorely disappointed. Not only can I not get the Ann Arbor station (for which reason I bought the radio) I cannot recieve the local NPR Station, one of the strongest FM signals broadcast in Detroit. I have tried many things including adding an FM antenna but the problem persists. I think the problem must be laid to GE's uneven manufacturing quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA Superadio III","review":"This was the worst radio I ever tried in over 60 years. It only tuned one strong local AM station and that took up a large part of the dial. Another local AM station that all 9 radios in the house receive with ease could not be tuned in.

A little heavy/bulky, but the sound that huge speaker puts out makes up for that. If you're a talk-radio buff or just an amateur BCBDX'r you'll be real happy with this. Tuning sensitivity is not great but is very good, and the range on the AM band is AWESOME. The FM sound is also very good! I haven't tried hooking up an external antenna to it yet (yup, its got a jack for one), but you can bring in stations from a long ways away with just the internal antenna. A dial light would be nice...that would be a big improvement.

Prior to getting this radio, I couldn't get it to come in on any radio in my house. Now, I can get it very strong and clear. The only complaint I have is that the dials on the front for volume, etc. don't seem well made and seems like they could break or come off. Since I leave it on the same station and same volume all the time, it probably won't be a problem. It also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels. It's pretty lightweight plastic.

Clear, bright and as loud as any reasonable person should need. I listen to NPR and it sounds like the people are in the same room with me - very nice. Music is also reproduced to my satisfaction. I have a Sangean that is a nice radio with bells and whistles. However, the quality of sound is muffled and the volume level is very limited. I can't fully comment on the RCA's AM reception because I prefer FM broadcats and rarely listen to AM. However, the AM reception seems on par with my Sangean.

Fisher is very clear in this text, that a method and the discipline to follow it, are what he views as the primary tools for success. He gives clear descriptions of his strategies, and he is able to relay his descriptions in an easy to follow manner.

I was lucky enough to participate in Mark Fisher's summer internship program, so I was taught be him and his traders at MBF. We used the ACD method during live trading, but it wasn't the only method that we used. In addition to the ACD method, we used technical and fundamental analysis to plan our trades. If the ACD indicators aligned with other indicators we used, then we could place our trades. Not every trade panned out when that happened, but it did make a profit more often than not.

I have to place and replace the controllers on the base in an effort to get them to recharge. Once I get one of the controllers recharging and then attempt to place the second controller, it usually dislodges the first controller and I have to start again. If I can get both controllers recharging in under 4 minutes, I consider myself lucky. And don't even get me started on where to tuck the wrist strap while attempting to load the unit. Yikes!I CANNOT recommend purchasing this product, however I would recommend the other unit I purchased which is a Psyclone brand that has the recharging connectors on the bottom of the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, buy rechargable AA batteries instead.","review":"I purchased this for convenience and to save money on batteries. The idea is great, the design and quality are poor. The remotes with the back plate provided do not make a great connection. You have to wiggle the remote in the stand to make the connection solid for charging. To date I have had to replace one rechargeable pack and the other one doesn't hold the charge that well anymore. I've had it for a little over a year and would recommend that you purchase rechargeable AA batteries. You will have less aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Bought this when first got my Wii but it failed after 3 months.

This product is not as good as he was expecting. Not sure that I would purchase another one if we purchased another Wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a month one of the battieres died.","review":"One of the batteries died on me after only having it a little over a month. It worked great while it work, charge your batteries in less than an hour and provide hours of play time, although sometimes while playing it would drop connection with the remote. Then it started to die (if it gets increasingly hard to get the charger to charge the battery it is about to die!) I suggest waiting to see what kind of solution Nintendo might offer. Only buy this if you absolutely must have it, because you risk getting a defective product. Or keep the package it comes with so you can walk into Wal-Mart and get another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth twice the price","review":"This charging station works very well. It is well worth the money because you will never have to buy batteries again. The only down side is that you cannot use skins with this charging station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware recharging issues","review":"In concept this is a great idea. The Wii remotes suck batteries like a hungry dog at a steak factory. The main issue is that the designers didn't consider the fact that there is a Wii strap at the bottom of the remotes. Thus, it is VERY difficult to seat the remotes properly to recharge the units if the straps are on. My son just places the remotes in the cradle - sometimes he gets them seated properly, sometimes he doesn't. Either way, it's absolutely stupid of the manufacturer to create a device that does not take into consideration a basic aspect of the Wii remote. And to expect the user to take the strap off with every recharge is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be worthwhile","review":"For some users, this product may be of little value.The Wii remote operates on 2 AA batteries. For anyone that already owns some AA rechargable batteries and an external charger, this unit duplicates that functionality. It does come with two battery packs and two replacement backs that expose electrical contacts to allow the batteries to be charged without the hassle of removing them from the remote.But that benefit is lost when a Motion Plus adapter is installed. That adapter extends the length of the Wii remote, and the unit no longer fits in the charger cradle until it's removed. So, turns into a choice of hassles: remove the Motion Plus adapter, or remove the batteries for charging externally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but....","review":"This is a nice thing to have to go with your Wii, I could not imagine having to use all those AA's. The biggest problem is that the new Wii's send the remote with a rubber like sleeve. This sleeve has to be removed in order to use this charger, which is more than a little annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Charger does the job","review":"This charger does the job. It charges the wiimotes nicely. It has a brightly lit indicator (blue or green) to let you know that it's charging and when your wiimotes are charged. The battery packs hold the charge. I played for 10 hours straight and the wiimote still had a charge. I don't think regular batteries would've lasted that long. The only thing that I have trouble with is when the wiimotes have the protective jacket on them, they have a hard time fitting in the charger so we have to take the protective jackets almost completely off. Sometimes it is also a little tricky to get the contact points in the right spot on the charger, but after a couple of minutes we find a position that the wiimotes like. All in all, I would highly recommend this product, it's definitely worth the money. We went through 2 batteries in the first 4 times playing the wii (15-20 hrs) (which would get to be very expensive)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great no problems with this and the charge lasts a long time!","review":"This is a great invention, I hate running out of batteries while playing a game and I haven't had that happen yet with charging the wii mote at night :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS","review":"Go on out and buy this if you are buying a Wii. We got a Wii about a week ago and this charger that we ordered seperate has nearly paid for itself already.The charging on this is so easy... and only takes about 4 hours to fully charge them, but the GREAT thing is they go for about 4-5 days on a single charge.Think of all the money you are gonna save in batteries. It is SO worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This is a must have! My children got a Wii for Christmas. The wii charge station is a life saver!! It sure has saved us a lot of money, by not having to buy batteries. All we have to do is dock the remotes and let them charge overnight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"The unit was given as a gift. When we plugged it in for the first time, we noticed that the LED indicators in the front of the unit were not lighting up. To test the possibility that it was a defect just with the LEDs while the normal charging of the batteries worked, we used both batteries until they were completely empty and then tried to charge them. After a night of charging, neither of them had been charged at all. Furthermore, when we opened up the unit, there were bits of glue sloppily placed all within the interior of the unit with capacitors bent in odd and disorganized directions with no clear indication of circuit-paths. The shoddy workmanship is likely the reason for the poor quality of these units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, horrible execution.","review":"This whole concept was a great idea, I love the idea of not having to constantly buy AA batteries. However the reality of this product is much different from what I imagined, I purchased this product about a week ago and have had nothing but problems with keep the Wii-Mote on with these damn batteries they are constantly losing power as the battery will not stay connected properly. Like the title says, great idea - horrible execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Bad Implementation","review":"The unit does work however many times I have found that sometimes the unit loses its connection and the battery is dead next time you want to use it. Other times it works fine. Should be redesigned to hold the unit more securely while charging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine when you finally get it to work","review":"The batteries work fine. The recharging works fine. I've never had a battery go dead on me, even after hours of play.HOWEVER, it is next to impossible to balance the Wiimotes on this thing for them to charge correctly. If you want to keep the wrist straps on, which I'm sure you do, good luck getting the metal chargers to line up with the Wiimote. I've studied this thing and looked at every possibility to get them to work correctly, including reversing the knot on the strap and experimenting with every possible placement. But simply put, this thing never should have made it past R&D.; Two stars for the batteries, three stars off for ridiculous design.I wish the Wii InCharge Dual Charge Station had been available when I bought this one. You don't have to balance anything when using the InCharge, and you can even keep the sleeves on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii-mote won't stay on","review":"I have had this charger since I go my Wii last summer. I didn't have the caughting on fire problem (that would be really bad), but this charger has a really bad problem of not charging that batteries because the Wii-mote had to be sitting perfectly on the base. This was no easy task especially if you leave the wrist strap on the Wii-mote. There were several time when someone would bump the table where I was charging the Wii-motes and I would have to go and set them back up perfectly so they would charge. I ended up just using some NI-MH rechargeable batteries instead. I have seen other base chargers that looked like they would hold the Wii-mote in place better. I would suggest looking around a bit more before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"After limited use both battery packs are dead","review":"We do not use our Wii often, so the wiimotes spend most of their time on the charger. This worked well for a short time, but after a few months of non-use we found that both the battery packs were completely dead. We cannot even turn on the Wiimotes.This product was a waste of money. We will be switching to regular rechargeables now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally an Electric Plug-in Recharger","review":"We couldn't find an electrical plug-in Wii remote charger anywhere locally. Once again Amazon came to the rescue. This does work quite well but you do have to place the remotes exactly correct for the charge light to come on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this item","review":"No more hunting around for spare batteries--this solves the problem of the battery-hungry wiimotes! The only thing I don't like is that I can't use the rubber wiimote covers with this, b/c the charger is in the back of them, not the bottom. That's a small inconvenience considering that these babies are always fully charged, which is key now that we have Netflix streaming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"We've been using this charge station and battery sets for some time and have been less than happy with it.Pros: Good battery lifeCons: difficult to fit the wiimote into the cradle and make the electrical connection.

This solves the problem for the first few uses afterward but they need to be \\"adjusted\\" constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome money saver","review":"I love this charger, it cost less than at the stores and believe me I looked around. It works great and charges Wii remotes like it advertises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I bought one of these when I first got my Wii right after they first came out. The first problem I found was that it was near impossible to get a good connection to the charger if the wrist strap is on the controler. Lately I've noticed that the rechargable battaries are holding less and less of a charge. If I want to play for a few hours I have to use regular battaries because the rechargables hold next to no charge no matter how long they sit in the charger. I know it's not just mine either because I've asked around and everyone else I know with this charger is having the same problem. Do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick this Wii Station","review":"This is the second docking station we have purchased for our Wii system.

It worked well for a few months and then began to be finicky over the placement of the remote in order to charge. I'd put it on the charger and it would turn to green (meaning doesn't require a charge) but the batteries were dead. Move it around a little bit and it would stay charging. Over time it became more difficult to find the charge 'sweet spot', and eventually it wouldn't charge at all. I'm not sure if it's the battery unit or the charger, but didn't want to replace either to find out. I think it was a couple of years before it's complete demise (and we don't use the wii as often as many folks do). Not to mention if they went dead in the middle of play, you'd have to replace with other batteries anyway or stop playing (and it only charges when in the remote).

Most of the reviews are from people who have just gotten this for their Wii controllers. I have had these units for months. I've lived with this for some time. I, too, loved them at first. That was, until the unit stopped working 60 days later. It doesn't take long to wear out the base because of the bad design on the metal prongs that carry current to the controllers to recharge them. If it were me, I would just buy some good rechargable batteries - not this unit. I am NOT happy with this product. And NYKO, the parent company, will not respond if contacted for replacement.

Nice not to even have to worry about replacing batteries or taking rechargeables out of the remotes.Also as others have mentioned, the two drawbacks are that you have to take care to ensure the remotes sit just right in the charger and are charging, and you can't use them with a skin on the remote. Given the success of the product, I hope NYKO comes out with their own skin that would be compatabile with the charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Must Have for Any Wii Owner","review":"This was our Nyko Wii Charge Station - we were so impressed by the first one that getting a second one for the other two Wii-motes was a easy decision.In the box:Charging StandTwo Rechargeable Battery PacksTwo Rubberized Battery Covers - have to use these for the rechargeable batteries to connect with the charging stand.All of feel well made, nothing feels like its going to fall apart in if you look at it the wrong way.

We were very excited to cut down on how often we had to buy batteries by getting the rechargeable battery packs. However we were disappointed to find that one of the rechargeable battery packs simply did not work. It did not hold a charge for longer than 10 minutes when we first tried it out. We have switched which side of the charging station that Wii remote was on and the outlet we plugged the station into. The results did not change- one battery pack charges, and the second one does not. Half of the product is useless and we are very disappointed with our purchase. We will not be buying from Nyko again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not stay sycned","review":"Ever since I purchased this charging station and battery packs I have had nothing but problems with my wii. They charging station charges the batteries, but the remotes will not stay synched with the WII. I can't even get them to resynch with the system. It's a pain to have to spend 30 plus minutes trying to get the remotes to turn on. All they do is continually blink. It's a problem with all of the remotes that have this battery pack on them.

But, when my unit came it must have been one of the older models that do not have the groove. It is my biggest pet peeve about the product, since it makes it teeter in the cradle and sometimes you really have to fiddle with it to get it to connect. If only I had looked through the packaging before I ripped it open, I would have seen if mine had the grooves, and could have returned it and repurchased it until I got one with the grooves.The unit does seem to get a little warm if you leave the controllers on forever after the light turns green when they are fully charged.

Reason being, the covers that come with this unit have an opening for the rechargeable battery contacts.Another thing you should know. As somebody here already mentioned, the Wii remote jacket does not fit in this charger. And quite honestly and logically, it is expected.

In fact, I wouldn't trust Amazon for any product in the foreseeable future."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO INSTRUCTIONS","review":"Okay, I'm not mechanically inclined. I admit that. But I also had a competent 16 year old try to help me on this and they couldn't figure it out either. So I don't feel so bad. There were NO INSTRUCTIONS with this device. No list of what was there, plus you had to put this into the back of the Wii in order to use it. Yuk! What I wanted was a recharger that plugged into a wall plug and not into the back of my Wii. Plus, instructions for us unknowledgeable people to show us EXACTLY how to use the darn thing. All in all, this was a disappointment to me. Perhaps after I figure it out I'll re-review it, but right now, I don't consider this a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It never works","review":"I bought one like 1 year ago and now it stopped charging the controllers.

It lasted about two days and then the little metal piece that charges the battery broke off. Another thing is the charger has a Red Led light and when trying to unplug it you cant really look at it, it hurts my eyes. I have three wiimotes and the battery pack doesn't really fit skins because of its \\"tight grip\\" Another thing it takes a long time to charge and dosent last long. Nyko is an okay product maker. But watch out what you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery is weak link","review":"I have owned this product about 4 months and have had to replace the battery pack for one unit already.The Battery pack lasted about 4 weeks and then it stopped working it would just get very hot but had no charge. Contacted customer service who had me return the batteries at my expense and they sent me new batteries in a previously used envelope (I mention this as it is indicative of an extremely small shoe string operation not a solid company). The new battery worked fine for awhile but now one battery pack is definitely getting hotter than the other so will probably not last and is out of guarantee. I think this is a good idea just not a quality product needs to be re engineered and made by a quality company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Rechargeable AAs instead","review":"I say you should forget about charge stations! The reason why is because Rechargeable AAs give you much longer playing time, take less time to charge, and there is a lot less chance that they will kill you Wii controller.Also they allow you to keep your skins on your controller. The rechargeable AAs are only a little more money, and they last much longer then the charge stations do!!! Please do not make the same mistake that many other people do!You on average only have to charge the AAs about once a week, instead of everyday to every other day! This is a review from Jesse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will damage your WII Remotes! Do NOT buy!","review":"Do not... I repeat Do not buy this or any other charging stand. Nintendo told me today (4/24/08) that they are getting many calls from customers to their help line regarding remotes that stopped working and have been damaged beyond repair.Their recommendation was to stop using these chargers with rechargeable battery packs immediately.Not only that, they also said they will void your warranty.A clear indication this is true is Nintendo does not offer recharge stations for WII Remotes. Think about it and if you don't believe me, call the Nintendo help line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea...poor implementation","review":"I purchased mine a month ago. After about 2 weeks, one of the batteries went dead (the other worked fine in either controller).

Beyond that I good solid product for the Wii. Saving me money on AA battries"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Be aware that this product is junk. The \\"gold\\" connectors do not make a solid connection with the remotes, which in turn causes intermittent charging. Additionally, the straps clearly are in the way, and the skins that we all have come to love are not compatible. Be prepared to remove the skins each time you drop your remotes into this charger.Unfortunately, this one was a waste of money; we are returning it promptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pays for itself!","review":"This product is a must have for a Wii owner. I saw some other USB charging devices, so I definitely feel one or the other should be bought the same time you buy your Wii or buy one as a gift for someone else. Just think of all the money you'll save on batteries this year alone!I am not sure why there are complaints about the strap getting in the way. I run it towards the front, so it is coming under the remote and hangs off the front of the unit, and the remote clicks into place every time without fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this piece of junk","review":"Purchased as part of a Christmas gift. Out of the box, one battery showed it was charging when in fact it wasn't. On third attempt to charge battery, battery light stopped lighting up. Returned battery to Nyko. Replacement battery wouldn't charge and then the other battery stopped charging. From reading reviews, it seems this is a very common problem. New batteries are DOA and others just stop working after a short time. I am returning this piece of junk.

I didn't give this item 4 stars because you have to remove the straps to charge the remotes. We purchased one of these a few years ago and ruined it trying to place the remotes on the stand with the straps attached. Other than that, no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad design all around","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift and was enthusiastic until I saw how it went together. The charging connection is on the back of the remote, which means that if the remote is in the rubber sleeve, you have to remove the sleeve to put it in the docking station and put the sleeve back on before you use the remote. If you have the MotionPlus mounted on your remote it's even worse because the charging connector is then out of position to make contact. In that case you have to remove the sleeve and the MotionPlus in order to recharge the remote, then reinstall the MotionPlus and finally put the sleeve back on. Either way it's less convenient than just using good high capacity rechargeable batteries. Really bad design all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived fun","review":"When I first purchased this charger, I thought it was the best thing to come out since sliced bread. The greatness however came to an end about 6 months into use when the batteries only held about a half hour charge.

One of my batteries completely died after a few months of very casual use.*Can't be used with any kind of skin.* As others have noted, if the straps are attached, you'll have to fiddle around with Wiimote in the cradle to get it to stay charging. It's beyond me why they wouldn't make a channel or something so the straps would stay out of the way.I wouldn't recommend this particular charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finicky and poorly made","review":"Sadly, I have to agree with the other 80 1-star reviews. This charger is finicky and poorly made. If you don't put the Wiimotes in the charger EXACTLY right, they do not make contact and don't charge. Now, after six months of use, our charger doesn't work at all anymore, no matter how carefully you place the Wiimote into the base. Amazon has this on sale today for a great price, but I will not be wasting another dime on it. Instead I am going to do like another reviewer suggested and purchase some rechargeable AA's."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I bought this about a year ago. Pros and Cons are simple and overwhelming.Pro - After a lot of work it actually will charge a batteryCons-1. One of two batteries died within months2. Charging a battery is near impossible. The easiest way is to totally remove the strap and totally remove the back cover. Even after this it is a balancing act to get the light to come on that shows it is charging.In the end this is complete junk. I wouldn't wish this thing on my enemy. I am looking for something else since we just started playing the Wii again. Maybe rechargable AA batteries is the easiest with these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to have rechargeable AA at hand.","review":"Well, I was wondering - before I bought it - that it would be nice and useful to have a way to keep the controls always charged without having to open and taking of the AA batteries for recharge. It should be like that. But it was not like that. After some (very few of them) recharges the problems started: erratic freeze of the wii hand control, smaller times of use between recharges and the worst happened. The lights start blinking blue erratically. As I have no way to sent it back since I am out from US, I have it dismounted and the problem I could see has something to do with the printed circuit board. As you dismount and handle with it, the problem goes and comes back. It is a problem with the design, the material that is being used and with the production itself. Buying it is like putting your money in a lottery. Better to put your money in some rechargeable AAs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery doesn't last a bit","review":"I really loved the idea of the charging station because I'm sick of buying batteries every other week.

It took me a while to realize what was going on, but in the end I stuck a small screwdriver in behind the battery contacts and bent them out more.

My Wii says one is completely dead (0 out of 4 bars) and the light goes blue in the charger (meaning its charging) for about 20 seconds then it goes green (stating it is fully charged) and stops charging.It is also difficult to get the controllers to fit in the base correctly. I would have given this heap of junk a 0 stars rating if possible. You can read my other reviews, I don't normally bash a product, I deleted my previous review where I was at 4 stars, but still didn't like how the remotes fit in the base.SAVE your $ and buy good quality rechargable batteries. This thing is a waste of cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...","review":"I must've gotten the only charge station with a faulty battery.

However, I have trouble getting the Wii Remote to seat fully into the cradle, so it always takes me a few seconds of jockeying the Wii Remote to get the solid blue light indicating that it's charging.

The battery charge time is about average for batteries of this sort (~5 hours from dead). The batteries are easy to install and impossible to install improperly. The included back plates make it a snap to just throw the remote on charge after gaming sessions. Also, the indicator lights are clear and bright (blue = charging, green = done). Well worth the investment it in the long run when the price of alkaline batteries are concerned.Cons: When the wrist strap is attached, getting the remote to sit properly so it will charge can be finicky.

I had been playing Animal Crossing and had my moves down. I had a hard time doing ANYTHING with the rubberized battery cover on the remote. I couldn't stand it and had to take it off.

The LED lights give you a status of the charging process so that you know if the remote is charged or not. The price is a lot better than I hade expected.The problem is that the Wii Remote cable gets in the way when the remote is placed in the charger and the charge light is too slow to respond. What this means is my kids go and put t in the charger but it does not always connect and start charging, and if I tell them to wait for the light it may mean they do not wait long enough to see the charge light go on before they adjust it's position on the charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make it last forever!!","review":"I understand people have been having issues with their batteries not charging after awhile but there is a simple fix that should help most of you.When it comes to rechargeable batteries of any type they are not meant to be left on the charger 24/7.

Then place it on the charger and let it charge all the way before removing it. As soon as the light shows that it is charged take it off base.I understand that at times you need to use more than one controller or one might be dying before the other is charged but I promise you that if you can follow these steps your battery life will last much longer.P.S.

It takes a lot wiggling around, and even when you get them in the right spot for a second, often you let go and the light goes off... and you have to start over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a long-term solution","review":"We bought this same model of charger for our wii remotes. The rechargeable battery packs have to be inside the remote to charge them, which is sort of a pain, and if you do not set them in the charger *just so* they do not recharge. Not terribly hard for me to put them in correctly, but seemingly impossible for my young children.The unit died recently and the battery packs do not accept a charge. Instead of replacing the packs, I'm just going to replace the entire unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed for gravity !!!","review":"I can never get the Wii remotes to sit in this correctly. I have had it for three years just have given up on trying to balance it in the cradle right for it to keep a connection to the back to charge it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"This item worked great - for about a month. For this price I would expect it to last longer but it has stopped charging the batteris even though the light tunrs green as if it is fully charged (how annoying is that when you go to play thinking the remote is charged & it's not!). My friend has the same system & the same problem so I know it is not a fluke. I suggest buying something cheaper, or as another posted suggested, rechargeable batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chargers as not to use battery power any more.","review":"Much better than batteries, however, the units are sometimes a pain to try to get in to charge. The outer shell has to be lifted and even then it is sometimes trial and error. I would recommend them just to save battery life and changing of batteries on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 1 year","review":"The battery pack stopped working for one of the two provided. And we had only had it for one year! One time we used it it complained that one of the remotes had low battery (we figured it was the two that have normal batteries, and replaced those but the message would not go away. ) The next time we tried to play, one of the controllers would not turn on! When we put regular batteries in that controller it did turn on. Thats how we knew it was the battery pack.Also, we always struggled to get the WiiMotes to sit on the charging station just right so that they would charge. The wrist strap gets in the way and prevents them from making a good connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killed my Wii Remote!","review":"I bought this about a year ago and it has suddenly killed my Wii Remote! I tried to sync it, but the lights will not turn on no matter what I do. I called Nintendo to complain, and they told me they received a lot of problems just like this with this specific charger! When I bought it, I knew it wasn't approved by Nintendo, but I never thought this would happen! Now I have to see if the store I bought the remote from will return it past warranty. Does anyone know if there is an approved charger? The Wii Charge Station by Nyko- great while it doesn't kill your remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Charge Station","review":"This item keeps your Wii remotes always ready to use.

Pero resulta que las baterías recargables NO duraron mucho (se dañaron) y conseguir el repuesto genera un sobre costo. Termine comprando pilas AA recargables (que se consiguen en todos lados) y hasta ahora no he tenido que botar a la basura ninguna de esas pilas. Considero que con esta unidad he mal gastado un dinero ya que la base de carga quedo para botarla a la basura y los módulos de carga nada se puede hacer con ellos por que ya no quieren recibir recarga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Charger station!","review":"This charging station is wonderful, I love that it has an AC adapter, most of the wii charging stations have to plug into the wii itself,and well, that's just silly. This one is great. It takes minutes for my wii remotes to charge and they last for days! I've had no problems with having to put my remotes in a certain way or anything like that. I bought this over a month ago and apart from the initial charge I've used it three times, cause the charge lasts that long! I prolly play about 10-15 hours a week and the charge holds all that, I've never run all the way out of battery so maybe that's why I dun have to charge for so long, but this station works great for me and I only wish I would have bought the 4 remote station, but I will absolutely be buying some more rechargeable batteries to use with this station for my other remotes!Great buy and great price!Totally Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"For the record, I don't have the rubber cover over my Wii controllers. All I have is the strap that is attached to the bottom of the controller. It's not difficult to place the controller onto the charging station. Just make sure the strap is to the left or right of the controller when you plop it down. Then gravity takes its course and the back of the controller touches the metal charging section of the charger. Seems to hold the charge pretty well. I've had this product for about 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice price","review":"i always appreciate the Amazon reviews. It helps me to make a wise decision. Although our WII is new and have not needed to replace the batteries, I thought this would be good to have. I am not disappointed.

This is a \\"must have\\" for your Wii. You'll save on batteries and you'll eliminate the many \\"I need batteries\\" requests from your kids. One downside - the rubberized grips for the Wii remotes will no longer fit once you install the rechargeable battery packs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I got this quite some time ago and was wondering why the charger packs were not charging while it was plugged in and the remotes in exact position! There was some problems with some of these chargers that did not charge due to some defect where the little button thing on the station that presses against the charger didn't always make contact with the remote, which seemed to be my case.I dumped it and simply rely on regular brand name rechargable batteries and my Duracell AA/AAA 4 battery charger instead as I did before I purchased this. I only did buy the charger to see if it would have been more convenient but it was more of a hassle to me.Read up on reviews and stuff before switching from a normal battery charger before buying this, because it may be more trouble than it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Charger Station","review":"The Wii charger station helps to economize batteries.

Just swap out the back plate, put the new batteries in and drop them in the charger. Easy as that.

Sometimes difficult to get the remote to sit properly and get an adequate connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger will ruin your remotes!","review":"We have had our charger for about 3 weeks now. We love the grips on the battery pack, and not using all those batteries! I do agree that the remotes with wrist strap attached require a little finesse to get them aligned and charging properly. A minor annoyance, really. The major annoyance? Our remotes do not work anymore! All of a sudden one day they won't power on, won't sync with the Wii. They just flash all four led's and stay dead. An email to Nyko is still unanswered(they broke Friday night and customer service is closed), but I doubt either they or Nintendo will replace our remotes as Nyko products are unlicensed accessories for the Wii. We will be using rechargeable batteries from now on- after we shell out for two brand new remotes, that is! Save yourself $110 for the charger and two new remotes and get a good quality set of rechargeable batteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, horrible quality","review":"I am not a heavy Wii player. I play it enough to make it worth the purchase, but I am not spending hours a week using the system. With that being said, I do not need to charge my wii motes that often. I bought this because the wii motes chew through batteries and it save me money, hassle, and the environment. Unfortunately, my charge station broke in 2 months. To say that this product is of low quality is an understatement. It really has no quality. Big disappoint, and I will definitively not make the same mistake twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well","review":"Overall, I've been very pleased with the Wii Charge Station. Essentially, you snap on a new cover to the back of your Wiimote. This cover has the contact point that, when set in the cradle, charges the Wiimote.I was disappointed at first that I couldn't use the rubber \\"sleeves\\" that I purchased for my Wiimotes, but this is compensated for by the rubber grips on the back of the Wiimote.It's EXTREMELY nice to come home every day to fully-charged Wiimotes. The only complaint I have is that it can be a little tedious to get the Wiimotes to charge. It usually takes around 20-30 seconds of playing with the Wiimote strap to get the contact on the back of the Wiimote to successfully come into contact with the base stations's contact and start charging.Other than that, a solid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging problems after a few months!!!","review":"Initially, this looked like the best product in the world. Our Wiimotes were always charged and ready to go. Then after a few months the charger stopped working. Now we have to take the battery cover off and CAREFULLY balance the Wiimote on the base. If the base is jostled at all, they will stop charging. Absolutely horrible!!! I've never had a more difficult time charging any other cradled cordless devices, such as phones and drills. In its current form, do not buy! They really need to make the contacts bigger and better. I prefer it even more if someone just dropped the cradle altogether and allowed a mini-USB charger to charge the battery, like a cell phone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient accessory","review":"Yes it's true a regular battery charger will do the same thing but I still prefer the Nyko Charge Station for two main reasons.1. It is convenient. You do not have to take the batteries out. After you are done playing you can just put it on the Nyko Charger and it will automatically charge it.2. It gives you a place to put your remotes, and it looks nicer when you have it on the charger rather than just putting it on a table or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly cheap junk that will not last more than a few months...","review":"We are now on our 3rd set. Every 2 months or so either the batteries stop charging or the cradle stops working. Yes, we know you have to push the controllers in carefully and yes, our kinds know how to be careful with their precious WII.All I can say is that this is not build to last and client service at NYKO is non-existent. Every time we ended up contacting Amazon in the end.JUNK JUNK JUNKUpdate after 9 months: our 3rd set has lasted but we have noticed a sharp decline in battery output, i.e. the remotes run on empty very quickly now. We ended up going to an online battery retailer and bout 48 2600mAh batteries and a 1 hr charger for a measly 75$.... Should have done that months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality","review":"I purchased two of these because I have 4 Wiimotes. During the first couple of weeks, everything was fine. Then one of the batteries failed, and I got a replacement. There was a defect in that one that did not allow it to make connection at the charger at all. Replaced again. Now it's been 6 months - two of them hold almost no charge, one is passable but definitely short lived, and the last one seems to work as new.The poor quality batteries somehow seem to be able to lock the controller out, so I have to remove the batteries, put them back and resynch.The stations themselves are touchy, and you have to be really careful to get the lights on so it's charging. Even then, the malfunctioning batteries can do some pretty weird things with the lights - blinking blue, then green, fast, then slow.This is a terrible product and should be avoided. I've given up on it, and plan to use standard rechargeables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to remove Wii Jacket to fit Wii Remote into Nyko charger.","review":"Nyko charger is slow.

The erasing feature allows them to use it over and over again without requiring additional supplies. The pen is attached to prevent it from getting lost, which is very helpful. It is an open-ended toy, allowing the children to use their imagination in drawing, writing etc., while the stamps give them an outlet for those times when they just want to have an instant result.

Like a picture of 3 balls are left behind when you pick it up. I purchased one of these years ago for my oldest child and I wasn't empressed in the durability department it does break easy but I really reccommend this for any preschooler or preschool class room. Especially since 3 magnets come with the bus a square, circle, and triangle and because of the magnet cards that come with the bus as well.

The screens will be quickly ruined if stepped on (even by very little people).

Well, I can't resist trying something like this so I picked up a 10-ounce package and had some for dessert with the evening meal. They were excellent and I ended up eating too many of them. The package was nice and fresh. The cookies had a nice bite to them and you could taste the fresh mint immediately. Perhaps it was a mint fragrance that did it. The exteriors were an excellent milk chocolate. I might have preferred a darker chocolate, but the total taste of the cookies was quit good.

The book was full of errors (note, the book jacket says \\"as easy as Uno, Deu [sic],Tre\\"). How can you trust a book that cannot spell \\"two\\" (due) right. The CD's were better, but I think they would be hard for someone who did not have a little knowledge beforehand. I did like having dialogues in Italian on the CD's: they were the most useful part as it did give one a chance to listen to the language.In comparison, I have used Michel Thomas CD's for Italian and German previously and really enjoyed them and would recommned them over this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of driver upgrade cost","review":"I have been a satisfied user of Instant Immersion's Spanish CD-ROMs, so I expected similar satifaction from the Italian version. However, as I started the installation process, I was informed that I would need a new driver (presumably for Windows XP) and was directed to a vendor support website -- where I learned that I would be charged $14.95 for the new driver. I will request a refund from Amazon. It's possible that the software is satisfactory once installed; however, there is no justification for such a problem with CD-ROM drivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend it","review":"I learned Spanish and Japanese with less audio than this Italian set of CDs. This was not easy for me without any written text to go with it, you really are missing out on the complete learning experience. I purchased a Italian dictionary to see how the words were spelled. It helped. I learned to recognize certain spoken words and phrases, but I had to listen to each CD many times. There must be a better choice. You may have to pay more, but it should be worth it to have a well written book to go with the audio. I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, NOT for beginners!","review":"I received this for Christmas and was excited to listen to the cd's in the car as well as use the workbook at home. I was into the 3rd track of the 1st cd and became totally LOST! I thought maybe I had put in the wrong cd, but no, it was indeed the first one. I kept having to rewind the cd and still they were speaking very complex sentences with obscure nouns and verbs. Not only that, there were THREE different women speaking, one of whom made annoying \\"clacking\\" and \\"smacking\\" noises when she spoke. It was like listening to someone with loose dentures trying to teach Italian. I'm not buying into the \\"instant immersion\\" theory. I have to start out SLOWLY with simple vocabulary and verbs, much like I learned English as a baby.

It takes you back to the migration of the Willy and Martin Handcart companies as they trek to the Salt Lake Valley. This movie was realistically done. You can see the suffering of the pioneers as they are nearly starving, losing loved ones, and dealing with the frigid conditions. The acting was quite good, and believable. And the miracles you witness really did happen. It's a very worthwhile move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This movie, by far, left me wanting to become a better person and to just be great.

Whether or not you believe in their religion, the story explains the depth of their faith and committment to escape the persecution and horrid treatment they received for nothing more than their beliefs.

Unfortunately the first third of the book is a rehash of parts of the last two books and the last two thirds lack the logic and direction of the series. Conrad plays no great part in this book and the action and characters are less developed and of much less interest. I would buy another in the series and hope it was better but this one is not a winner"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Sadly, this last gasp does not live up to the previous five in the series. Too many pages are spent rehashing what we already know, Conrad himself has been relegated to a back seat, and most disappointing of all is that the author has not outgrown his adolescent compliant-naked-girlie fantasies, but has intensified them to embarrassingly offensive levels. I might give Number Seven a miss if it ever appears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The beginning of the series starting with \\"The Cross-Time Engineer\\" is excellent, but this one has nothing new to offer. In fact it departs strongly from the theme of modern man succeeding based on superior knowledge and instead has him summoning up one deus-ex-machina after another. What's the point in a science fiction story where the hero has access to a magic wand?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Area 51 series of books have been great so far,The way they have tied earths real(believed Real)past and brought together ufo's and aliens, dragons together makes you think what you was taught was real Also the twist with King Arthur put another rethinking into our past"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book Ever","review":"I have read all of the area 51 books and have loved them all. This was by far the best because it answers all of your questions and leaves the opening for a book after. I was shocked to find out, what Lisa Duncan is!!!!! The book had a great ending I only wished that it had been a little longer and had a longer ending battle with both Aspasia and Artad. The thing I like most about the area 51 series is that it is orginal and keeps you guessing all the way through, it is by far the greastest book in the series. I also liked the fact that the Swarm finnaly came into it. That is why I rate this book 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Recording","review":"This CD took a long time to get here, however it is worth the wait.

In fact, you'll be pleasantly surprised at what you hear. There is a good diversity among the songs compiled on this album, but the classic Blackhawk sound and lyrical ideas are maintained. I defy anyone who can't relate to at least one track on this album. I for one related to\\"I Will\\". What it means to be in love with someone so much, that you will let them go if they need to be alone or in some other situation. The title track, \\"Spirit Dancer\\" is a fitting tribute to Van Stevenson. The song \\"One Love\\" has a great lyric, hook, and brings you back to a feeling of home, as it has all of the trademarks of a classic Blackhawk song.

If you are a beginner and seriously want to improve your chess with easy-to-read authors try Jeremy Silman's \\"Reassess Your Chess: Workbook\\", Bruce Pandolfini's \\"Russian Chess\\" describing six games move by move, Irving Chernev's \\"Logical Chess: Move by Move\\", and of course Aaron Nimzovitch's \\"My System\\".This Samurai book tells you to \\"Seize The Initiative\\" as one of their strategies. True, but how to do it requires you to work and practice, and the guidance of good chess authors. -- I give it two stars because of it's inspirational value and innovative idea. It's not a boring read, just not a very useful chess book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A basic approach to chess, but not a strategic guide","review":"This book will only appeal to the absolute beginner--almost half of its entire content is the basic rules of the game.

Very, very interesting. The author is a self-professed 'prison buff.'I learned an awful lot from this book. I didn't realize how big of an industry prison actually is. Inmates make everything from the stereotypical license plate to clothing for regular people! Industries sometimes fight to have their business put in a prison. Food and toiletry industries, among others, compete for the prisons' business. And I was completely not aware of the fact that there are PRIVATE prisons in the US. Private prisons, not run by the state or the government, prisons that are there to make people money. Convicts are now a business.

I work as a clinical social worker with juvenile criminals and have for five years. I am sickened by it at this point, and see that these even these juvenile institutions are rehabilative only in Orwellian language. If the public knew of the climate of fear, the cover ups, the struggle of those who still care to secure some form of treatment for the young, some only 10 or 11... and if they read book this they will know about the adults.

I put the disc into my computer and discovered that the sound is in MONO. That's right, single channel audio. It sounds atrocious. I e-mailed Jimmy Franks Recording Company about it and they aknowledged the bad sound and video. They said that the source files from BMG Finland were in bad shape, and Universal Records only gave them a week to make the DVD. Shows how much Universal cares about the band, and their fans. Thankfully their next (new) album will be out on Warner Brothers. Don't buy this DVD and support shoddy products from Universal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music videos in crackly mono","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this dvd. Worst sound I've ever heard on a dvd. The sound in the videos is in crackly mono in the left channel. The sound in the Bam parts is ok. Don't buy this dvd unless you're a kid who only cares about watching Bam on your little mono tv/dvd combo. The video sound quality is an insult to the band, I could not tolerate watching them.So if you're interested in the music, not Bam, here's what you want:Look on Ebay. There's an unlicensed compilation with more videos and better sound. The cover photo is a goofy picture of Ville in a Home Alone pose. Just make sure your dvd player can play a PAL dvd.

But Warner Bros. thought differently. They turned Freddie and Daphne into mean kids, added a recurring mean \\"bully\\" character, and made all the adults mean (in addition to being crooks, as usual).Somehow, with the original series, the writers managed to create a permanent money machine and enduring hit while making every character nice. Is that impossible today?This series is fine for adults who like cartoons but keep it away from your younger kids unless you want to teach them how to be bratty.For younger children, go with Kipper the Dog, the Wiggles, even Dragon Tales--but avoid this Pup series. It's a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Volume isn't Enough","review":"\\"A Pup Named Scooby Doo\\" is a fun series that will appeal to classic Scooby fans as well as today's children. The show is fast-paced, entertaining, somewhat educational, and a good \\"prequel\\" to the other Sooby Doo shows that follow the gang as young adults.An interesting aspect of the series is that we can appreciate how much Daphine and Fred matured from the time they were in junior high to high school/college students. The thoughtful, matter-of-fact Fred was once a boy who believed everything he read and jumped to silly conclusions. Daphine was once a little rich girl who anything \\"yucky\\" if it was posh.When the series aired in 1988 some fans groaned at the \\"babification\\" of their favorite characters.

This GE radio delivers on all counts. I live rurally but still close enough to town that I can't comment on long-distance reception. All I can say is that I get all the radio stations that I want to listen to, the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in FM music, and I don't get any frequency drift so that I don't have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob.

It's about ten paragraphs thinly stretched into 200 pages of fluff. For example, the chapter \\"Your Physical Makover\\" basically says to find someone with good fashion sense to advise you. The chapter \\"Blind Dating\\" simply says to go on blind dates! I expected more detail on starting a conversation with a stranger, but the best he can come up with is a few paragraphs with gems such as \\"Hi, you're beautiful\\" or \\"Say, that's a nice bracelet.\\"Despite his frequent boasting about being a high-paid dating consultant, he is no more insightful than your mom.For guys, I would recommend \\"The System\\" by Roy Valentine.

My advice to women out there: don't use this as a dating book because the main idea here - asking men out, won't work if a happy relationship is what you want! Sure the guy would go out, why not? But he would take it for granted even if he's a great guy. That's just human nature. I've seen women asking men out, and these women always end up doing all the work in their relationships.

Among the real pearls of wisdom contained in the book, the authors advocate cutting-edge dating techniques like mingling with other people and dressing nicely. They elucidate all sorts of sure-fire tips for meeting others like the dry-cleaner pick-up, internet dating and using props as conversation starters. Along the way, the authors also take time out to denounce introverts, traditionally minded women, urbanites and anyone else who they apparently don't like.Much of the book is common sense, and the rest is basically worthless in contemporary American society where everyone is automatically suspicious of people they don't know--most notably, women.

Useful for building up a demonstration circuit, or as an overview of the topic, but not 'meaty' enough for those who wish to gain something greater than a rudimentary understanding of oscillator theory.For those who want to design a simple op-amp oscillator, this book is fine. The RF oscillator descriptions are at best, anemic.Kamichik has done a wonderful thing with the book however, by providing problems to work (at the end of each chapter) AND SOLUTIONS TO EACH OF THE PROBLEMS at the end of the book. These problem sets (along with the solutions) are enormously helpful to the uninitiated.While I would not recommend Kamichik's work as a great reference for high-performance oscillator design, I would recommend the book for those who are completely unfamiliar with the topic, and wish to learn how oscillators work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious ways to celebrate your friends","review":"(Please note that this review refers to the deck: 52 Ways to Celebrate Friendship.

This is nothing more than the typical, and unhealthy I might add, red sox venom toward their hated rivals. They try to convince themselves its OK because everyone hates the Yankees, if they took their horseblinds off they'd realize the rest of the league doesn't look all that much more favorably on their second highest paid 'underdog' red sox team. Congratulations to the man who wrote this and the people who read it, well more to the ones that read it. You just wasted $12 to read about stuff im sure you already knew since your (baseball) lives revolve more around hating the yankess and being the underdog everyone loves than just appreciating a good team.

It starts out with a great premise, a sorceror bound by a demon is given a woman by his brother the king, and only she can redeem him. Unfortunately I think the romance took a back seat to everything else that was going on. Not only were most of the characters' thoughts and feelings not addressed, the heroine was basically a pawn who did no more than get moved about so she could be at the right place for subsequent scenes. That made the book lack depth for me.I was also disappointed by the lack of feel for time and place because I was really looking forward to a new romance setting. The book felt like could have taken place almost anywhere and any time before the Renaissance.So while the story worked OK as a romantic adventure, I didn't feel that it lived up to it's potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper For Me!","review":"The Shadow Prince is well worth the read. I, too have read all Ms. Zimlich's books and am nothing but impressed by her writing ability. This book sweeps you into a fantasy past and showcases Ms. Zimlich's ability to create refreshing and innovative plots. The tension between the forces of good and evil grip you until the end of the story which Ms. Zimlich ties up quite cleverly. If you are looking for richy drawn, sympathetic characters and a fascinating read, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracking CD, Gromit","review":"It seems like I have been waiting for a W&G; film forever. Why, You may ask? Because I have been chomping at the bit for a Wallace and Gromit CD!It was well worth the Wait! Every cue on this album is Golden! My only complaint is why did Hans Zimmer have to get involved? He seems to take Mr. Nott's thunder away from him! And why did they need some other Composers as well? As evident in the classic shorts, Nott is a very accomplished composer. Maybe He needed some assistance for an exhausting work load. Oh well.Despite the above gripes,I think this is one of the best soundtracks in years. I especially like \\"Fire up the Bunvac\\", \\"Brainwash and Go\\", \\"A Big Trap\\", and \\"Dogfight\\", not to mention the closing cue, \\"Wallace and Gromit\\", which is of course the wonderful and completely catchy theme from the aforementioned shorts.

I previously had the XM Roady 2 and didn't like all the wires hanging out the side or the FM modulation mode - didn't seem as clear as the cassette input - which was even more unsightly. The XM Commander in my current vehicle - Acura MDX looks like a factory install and the direct connect into the FM antenna line produces very clean sound. However, I may purchase the direct connect feed and use the RCA jacks off the Trek main module (which you can hide away anywhere to connect all the wires). Like I said, it's a very clean and professional looking application. Oh, and the remote is great too.

However the book seriously misrepresents or misinterprets some of the philosophical figures it covers. Misinterpretation by itself is not a sin. But what is objectionable about the misinterpretations here is that they seem to come with an almost total ignorance of some of the best, most meticulous historical research on the figures discussed in the book. The author might claim that meticulous historical research is not his goal. Rather, his goal is to present a certain unifying picture and teleology for the history of analytic philosophy. But these two goals are not necessarily mutually exclusive (though they might be in fact, in which case so much the worse for teleology). Whether or not you think teleology has a place in history of philosophy, surely you must agree that good historical research does. And such research is just what this book is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but not \\"pro\\"","review":"this weather station is fine, and it is very sophisticated, but what about its usefulness?: the sensors ranges are very very short, and not what we can wait from a \\"pro\\" weather station.

However, I will not be totally negative. There are a few of songs on this album that are decent and that rock, including \\"Save Me\\", \\"Yer Majesty\\", and \\"Trade Yourself In\\".

The fact that their main sound is similar to Alice In Chains, except much friendlier atmospherically and commercially, doesn't do much to win me over either. It's basic appeal-to-the-masses commercial rock at its very core. The band needs to reach within their musical abilities and find a creative direction to have a chance of winning me over in the long run. For now, that's not the case, and I'm highly disappointed in the band. Creativity is the key for personal success. These guys aren't doing anything about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"You shouldn't have to listen to a CD more than once to like it","review":"I LOVED Shinedown's first album \\"Leave a Whisper\\" like every sane person should.

I bought it the day it came out and listened to it on the way home in the car, it started out decently but after a while I had to take it out because the songs were so horrendous compared to the HARD rock in \\"Leave a Whisper\\". Now, some little sissies have been saying \\"Oh, it's a little different, you just have to listen to it like 500000 billion times before your ears stop bleeding and then you relize it's a good CD\\" These people obviously fell VERY hard on their head when they were young.

The new look at first turned me off, but after listening to the album for the second time it started to grow on me. Brent's vocals are, as always, amazing. He is the center of the band. My favorite track is \\"beyond the sun\\". I feel like they experimented more on this album, and what came out was a mixed results. Overall it was a good album. You can't expect them to follow up Leave a whisper with another platinum album. That was truly an amazing album, every song was amazing.

Then I decided to give it another chance and I'm so glad I did. Heros, a classic kick butt rock anthem. I Dare You, what can I say. The sound, the songwriting, the maturity of this band on their second offering truly amazes me. I keep buying new CD's, but I keep coming back to this one.

As a guitarist, I truly appreciate the extreme talent & tightness that guitarist Jason Todd, bassist Brad Stewart, and drummer Barry Kerch puts forth on each & every song on this album. Also, the incredible voice of Brent Smith will blow you away. If you liked him singing the Skynyrd remake of \\"Simple Man\\"... you will absolutley love track 9 \\"Shed Some Light\\", a ballad of his voice, guitars & cello. I will go as far to say that SHINEDOWN is the best band out there today, and the best that's come out in the last 10+ years.

The songs are great especially Beyond The Sun, Shed Some Light, Save Me, and I Dare You. As I mentioned in a previous review Brett Smith has one of the best voices in rock right now. He definitely has the power in his voice and he's amazing live. Brett Smith is right up there with Aaron Lewis, Chester Bennington, Josey Scott, Pete Loeffler, and Lajon Witherspoon as best male vocals in rock. Shinedown has made a name for themselves in Rock right now and they'll be here for a long while. Whether it's the slow songs to the harder songs Brett Smith can do it all.

Hell, there's even a couple of guitar solos on here, I should love it! But I don't. You can't listen to Leave a Whisper and then listen to this and not know which one has the better tracks.

There debut album from 2003 \\"Leave a Whisper,\\" was awesome filled with fast hard infectious guitar riffs. Sadly, there 2nd album doesn't possess the same qualites it had. Every song on this album is just plain, seems poorly written, and just not produced well enough to what it could or should've been. I gave the album one star for the bands first single \\"Save Me,\\" and this song is not even that good. It is a bit catchy, but only about on the first 2 or 3 listens.All in all, if you are expecting the Shinedown of \\"Leave a Whisper\\" which such awesome songs such as Burning Bright, Fly From The Inside, and Left Out, your not gonna get them. Maybe on there third album, (if there still around) but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF HAPPENED!!!!????","review":"I am confused. What the hell happend here. Leave a whisper is one of the best modern rock albums you can buy. I was so excited when this album came out..........then i listened to it. The only reason this gets two stars is because there really is only a couple of decent songs. And when i say decent i mean mediocre at best.I will be the first to say i am a shinedown fan but this album has me wondering if they have completely re-vamped thier sound. The music is very basic and the lyrics dont even flow with the sound. Its almost like listining to retards singing to polka music. C'mon guys pull it together. Hopefully this is just a sophomore slump. TRY AGAIN SHINEDOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore slump is an understatement!","review":"For months and months I have been anxiously waiting for this album. Although I was hoping that this band could avoid a slump it happened. I will agree with one of the first to review this disc it is weak! I felt like I was revisiting St.Anger all over again. There are no memorable songs on this disc period! The song writing is less than average and for some unknown reason Brent's voice ever so weak on this album, there are moments when I just feel as though he is struggling to stay in pitch. I just saw Shinedown in concert Oct,02 05 in Hidalgo Texas and they stole the show, but this cd is horrible. I hope that they make it though because i do believe that Brent can carry this band if need be. But I too would suggest a buyer beware, please borrow before purchasing this cd is really not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switchfoot wants their CD back","review":"This CD is an amazing disappointment after the fantastic \\"Leave A Whisper\\". The songs on this CD bear absolutely no resemblence to those on their debut, almost as if this were a different band altogether. Also, its not as if the songs on \\"Us and Them\\" are simply softer versions of those from \\"Leave A Whisper\\"; they're totally different. I have no problem with a band modifying it sound, but these songs are just plain bad. Also, I don't get the appeal of the track \\"Save Me\\" because it sound like a Switchfoot reject.Skip this useless waste of money. If you like LOA, I strongly suggest that you check out Cold's new CD \\"A Different Kind of Pain\\" rather than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophmore slump strikes again...","review":"This was a real letdown from start to finish. It was just too boring to sit through, and I returned it the same day I bought it (which was yesterday). Oh, but don't take my word for it, read the 2 (plus) pages of reviews with similar feelings about this record. I really had high hopes for shinedown after hearing LAW last year, but they couldn't come through. Skip it, it's not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"Yeah, so they didn't want to give us Leave A Whisper Part 2, but damn, they didn't have to drastically change. All these songs on here are poorly produced and sound bad. There mostly all slow and hardly any rockers.Don't recommend at all. What a waste of money. Pick up Audioslave's new album, \\"Out of Exile.\\" That album is actually worth it and is the best rock release of 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally sucks","review":"Okay, I've tried very hard to like this album. Leave A Whisper was a great debut for these guys, and I listen to it quite often. Brent Smith's vocals are amazing on that one, and the whole thing just has a wonderfully balanced, straight-ahead hard rock sound to it. So what happened with the second album? Smith's vocals are not as polished on this one, the quality of music is in the toilet, and what's with that spoken word piece at the beginning of the first song? Is that any way to kick off a hard rock album? That was an immediate downer. No, much as I've tried to like Us And Them, it truly bites. Sucks hard, shall I say. Let's hope the third album sounds more like the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Rocks!","review":"I bought all of these albums in LP format way back when. Finally being able to convert them to digital format for the iPod was such a thrill. In my opinion, these are some Phil's best pieces of music. Each album has it's share of great tunes. Some of my favorites are: Full Circle from Town to Town, Just A Moment Away from Ph'lip Side and Happy from Play Thru Me.I was inspired to take up the guitar from seeing Phil play live back in the late 70s/early 80s. Being a guitar player myself, I understand what it takes to play the instrument and yet Phil never ceases to amaze me with his AWESOME playing.If you're into guitar, this set is well worth the money! Phil Keaggy is in a very exclusive group of top players in the world. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Town to Town is fantastic","review":"I must first admit that I do not have this repackage CD; of the three albums represented, I only have \\"Town to Town\\"; hence I give this product only four stars out of my lack of full knowledge.That said, \\"Town to Town\\" is likely worth buying the set for. This relatively obscure album from Keaggy's catalog has some of the most interesting musical sounds and arrangements I've heard from him. Many of the lyrics tend to go along with the theme indicated by the title: life on the road as a musician, missing your family and your home.It does have a rather distinct \\"early 1980's\\" flavor, which I actually rather enjoy, but know that some people aren't fond of it. If you don't mind that, this is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","review":"I can't tell you how great this cd is...especially if you like the 70's style \\"christian\\" music as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be not the worst book I have ever used","review":"We had this book as reference for our graduate level Radar course. For those who are not a master in radars already, the word \\"Horrible\\" would be a close description for this book. I 100% disagree with \\"dargo2001's\\" review. This book is far from being useful as an introduction material. The writing style indubitably makes the otherwise not so hard concepts (which I later realized from another book) seam indescribably esoteric.If you are a beginner to Radars, I suggest borrowing this book from somewhere and going through it, and I guarantee, that you will not buy it. My very sincere advice is, get \\"Matlab Simulations for Radar Systems design\\" or any other book from \\"Mahafsa\\" and you would be pleasantly delighted by the fascinating world of Radars and in the end way more knowledgeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"good knife","review":"its not as wide as i thought it was, its one of the thinest knives i have seen, i was going to return it but it grew on me, so thin and sleek very cool actually cant beat the price sharp sharp knife very cool and shiny owww"},{"rating":"2","title":"xmas gift","review":"small ,compact but very sharp and stylish. it came quickly and in great condition. the swiss army knife is still one of the best knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Dark Shadows!","review":"If you are a fan of Dark Shadows with Barnabus, you need to get the Beginning Collections.

Dave Slomin's and Steve Conti's songs are straight from the heart, depicting situations we all can relate to.

It comes with strings that have the die in them, you tie them around the fabric and immerse in hot water. Easy to do, but we found the intensity of the die colors to be disappointing. The colors were more pastel than saturated.

It was my fault in reading only the rave reviews, however, I still feel as though I have been \\"ripped off\\". Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Kindle","review":"This may be a great crossword dictionary but it is unusable on the Kindle due to the lack of an effective indexing scheme. The index only consists of the first letter of clues (e.g. A, B, C, etc.) You then have to advance page by page, to find the clue you are looking for. With a million words, finding what you want takes a long time!Searching for the clue doesn't work either. For example, a search for the clue \\"Mail\\" returns 117 entries. Clues are undifferentiated from answers so you have to go to each entry to find if it is the clue or the answer.In addition to not having a usable index, it appears the publisher didn't make any effort to reformat this book for electronic use, which further compounds the problems.If you want a crossword dictionary for the Kindle, you're better off waiting until a better one is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all easy to use. I really don't want to give 1 star.","review":"I downloaded this dictionary to take on vacation. I love doing crossword puzzles! This dictionary is not at all user friendly for me. I don't know if I don't understand how to use it, but it was of little help in doing crosswords. One puzzle had to do with the movie \\"Gigi\\", and I couldn't even type in the word Gigi. The dictionary kept changing it to \\"yogi\\". If I type in one word, it takes forever to search for it, especially if it is near the end of the alphabet. Often, after waiting a long time, it will say it couldn't be found. It will not search for words using \\"?\\" in looking for a word with a missing letter. In general it is not nearly as easy to use as my hand-held A-Z Crossword Dictionary. I wanted a dictionary downloaded to my Kindle so I wouldn't have to take my dictionary on the airplane.

Everyone lacked any real team chemistry and the villain, some artificial intelligence chick called Rhona who becomes godlike after jacking Cerebro, has the most annoying way of conversing (trust me, you won't enjoy reading it).

We had a ball for hours at the park shooting these off. The pump was ok but guess who gets to pump all of the balloons. It is not the kids, it is Grandpa. So a solution was to take by battery operated Sears air compressor to blow them up. That seems to be just as fun for the grandkids as shooting the balloons off. Size of a drill but saved a ton of time and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Thank you for asking about my opinion. We used this product today for a science experiment demonstrating The laws of Newton. The bad part was that we demonstrated other laws by explaining the noise created when the balloons burst. Not many of the balloons lasted for a repeat launch in fact 75% of the balloons burst when initially inflated. This poor performance of the balloons greatly subtracted from the fun we usually have with these kind of balloons. I have used balloons like this before and the kids had a riot. Not this time. I hope that when I order replacement balloons that there will be a better effort to control quality.Good product but poor quality.Thanks again for asking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality balloons","review":"The price for the pump and balloons was good compared to the toy store, but the quality of the balloons was horrible.

Then I discovered that at least half of the balloons had holes in them in a spot that caused them to be useless. No, I am not going to buy more balloons as I am not going to throw good money after bad.

With especially fine performances by Jack Albertson, Yvonne Craig, and Cynthia Pepper (playing a hastily summoned stenographer in charge of keeping track of Lt. Morgan's [Elvis'] creative attempts at convincing distant relatives that their \\"Big Smokey\\" mountain home could be better utilised as a missile base), the under-developed script can be somewhat overlooked. Although one or two songs could have been cut and included only on the LP, the title tune on 45rpm remains a lost classic, with Elvis in full swagger. Elvis' first official \\"low budget quickie\\" is not for the more discriminating fan, but will bring a smile to most others.

Instead the ghosts of a geography dance with the coyote and serpents never fail to find prey and shed skin. . .and Johnette seems equally eager to shed hers.I am always eager to enter a new concrete blonde record and Johnette, Jim, and co. have never failed to transport.

Well the Mojave enveloped Johnette and glazed a patina that evolved her into a place where she lyrically and musically paints the most intense and beautiful scapes that play in your mind. Just close your eyes and listen. Its groovy. Its thought provoking. Its mood altering. Its not a series of songs you would play loud at a party, but would play it low to set the ambience to chill and relax.

Merging modern electronics with 70s psychedelic pop, THE HUNGRY YEARS has catchy tunes galore and plenty of spunk (thanks in no small part to Jessie Banks' versatile vocals). Banks can go from sultry (\\"Making Music\\") to high and bright (\\"Voodoo\\"), and, with the magic of time-stretching, she can even sound like a male R&B crooner (\\"Full On\\"). And even though the first three tracks have the upbeat thickness of rock songs, the slower tracks have no less soul. Banks channels Ella Fitzgerald for \\"Angel Eyes,\\" and her voice supplies a gospel-like chorus to the romantic strings, and she brings out the heartbreak on \\"Following.\\" But my favorite track, \\"We Love You,\\" sounds like the theme song to a vampire bordello -- Anne Rice with her funk on.

It does a good job at eliminating dust, but it was way to hard to work with. It's just too cumbersome, and just didn't do anywhere near the job that a normal hand sander can do.

Use can, like regular sanding, go to hard on the seams and you will go down to the tape. I found that the price was EXCELLENT for what this product does.

For the money it can not be beat. Sure if you are doing 10,000 SF of rock get a pro system. But this has held up well and captures 95%+ of the dust.

It's a little hard to get used to at first. Getting familiar with the hose hanging from the end is a little tough but within 15 minutes I had gotten the hang of it.

The supernatural horror that haunts the family is all powerful so its a bit like watching Final Destination but without the laughs....you just watch helplessly as people die in various gruesome ways. I think the author was trying for a Fall of the House of Usher sense of doom but it never really comes across. There is no explaination given why the horror is so powerful.

If \\"Rescue of Broken Arrow\\" had been my first, it might have been my only. The storyline moved extremely slow. The author's use of flowery prose seemed a little out-of-place for a true western (i.e., \\"Then the green of the woods closed over them, joining above their heads in green Gothic vaults, crossed with lierne and ogive faintly open to the sprinkling of bright stars above them.\\") The only plus I saw regarding this particular western was that the author did an excellent job of noting the transformation of the main character, Cashel, from a young eastern renegade thief maturing into a man who finds his niche in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This release is the sound of evolution","review":"Humo De Tabaco is the sound of evolution. With each generation music changes & grows; evolving into a form that is an invitation to others to get to know us all beter.

It was beautiful, and served it's purpose for 3 uses. But on it's final day, I poured the last glass of water and sat it on the counter. About 15 minutes later, we heard a cracking sound. I walked over to the pitcher and found that it had a long crack starting just below where the handle is mounted, curving upward about 5 inches.This pitcher was treated gently, and had very little temperature variations.....e.g. we like tap-temperature water with no ice. It was never put in the refrigerator. It was hand-washed.This product is not up to normal Luigi standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak product","review":"We also had the picture for only about 2 months when it got a huge crack along the side with the handle.

If you, like me, are forced to use this book in a class, get ready to spend more money on additional books.One reviewer who gave this 5 stars called it digital poetry. I recognize why he did so, and to one who already understands these concepts, it probably qualifies. But then, if they already understand, why would they need this book?

In this compilation of articles and musings, the reader will get a real sense of what it was like for a woman who had choices and took chances - while her faith in Judaism and living a Jewish life blossomed!Written in such an honest and personal way, this book stirred many thoughts and emotions and really made me think about life.This is a book to give to the women in your life, messages that we will all identify with.

The reality is that no acts of human sacrifice or the bleeding of cats took place among the women of Jacobs family and since none took place this read is mere conjecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Ballads!","review":"Best CD I've found that has all the great Christmas ballads of past and present performers.

Eventually I began to do birthday parties and the such and now, believe it or not, I charge $75 to $100 an HOUR for my face painting!! I am a PROFESSIONAL FACE PAINTER and I swear I have this book to thank for it.

The latest techniques practised in geology are explained. Especially noteworthy is the extensive use of GPS. This has greatly aided recording the location of interesting geological samples.Earthquakes are also well covered, and will probably be of interest to many readers, especially if you are in California. The history of the Richter and Mercalli scales is gone into. Unfortunately, predicting quakes is still very uncertain!The discussion on earthquakes is also used as a good example of plate tectonics, where the latter is probably the central idea of geology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!

Zac Kebron struggles to prove that a friend could not have committed the murder, even as all the evidence is stacked against his goal.Also in the book is an interleaved account of Mac and Eppy's Academy days, along with the very surprising story of how Mac performed on the Kobyashi Maru test. A link from an incident in the Academy years to the current event provides a satisfying double surprise for the ending.As is Peter David's style, there is plenty of humor in the book, some of which caused me to laugh or chuckle out loud. His style is always entertaining, never boring, and often humorous. As much as I've enjoyed books following up on the various TV series, the New Frontier books have over the years outshone them to become my very favorite Star Trek books. Kudos, Peter!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn this is good","review":"This book is a great mixture of what Star Trek has been, and what it could be. Each one of the main characters has to give up something to serve the greater-good, and also has to take a chance to prove that the system works. It's about being better than the easy way out - about doing what's right - even when no one can make sure you do.

I have never read and NF and that this would be a great deal. Unfortunately not all the ebooks display correctly and they have formatting problems and pages missing. After I bought this, the publisher said this is a known problem due to a new version of adobe. The fix is to find an old adobe program and use that. The only problem is we're not going to be able to do that for long as that older program won't work on newer operating systems.

I sort of want to say it was calmer, but that's only true to the extent that there were no giant birds erupting from planets, etc. The book's focus on the past didn't make it unusual--clearly, Once Burned shares that distinction--but it had a reflective tone, which showed a depth to Calhoun and Shelby we haven't seen before. Their previous relationship is brought to the forefront for the first time.The book also explored the new Kebron. I find the adult Zak just as entertaining as the adolescent one, and enjoyed being in his head as he struggled to clear Janos."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a good read","review":"In my opinion Torey have written better books, but none the less it wos still a good read, a must for all Torey Hayden fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I've read most of Torey Hayden's books and this one and \\"Ghost Girl\\" are my very favorite.

I thought maybe being a teacher would be nice, although I knew little of the consequences that job included. Being a smart child I read A LOT. And not just small books, I read some that were at a 8th grade reading level. One of the books I read was titled \\"One Child\\" by Torey Hayden. That book changed my life more than any other book has. It made me realize (still only in 3rd grade) that being a child psychologist was exactly what I wanted to do when I got older. Since then I have read each and every one of Torey's books a hundred times over, (my two favorites being \\"Murphy's Boy and \\"One Child\\"). I someday wish to meet this wonderful author/teacher/psychologist/woman, and I pray that when I become what I am very determined to become, I am half as great as she. Thank you, Torey L.

Torey Hayden is a splenid writter and, in this book, writes about her personal experiencs with a boy labled to be hopless.

Everyone thinks he is a hopeless case. Everyone, except Torey Hayden. A wonderful woman with expertise in elective mutism. Hayden works miracles with 15 year old Kevin and discovers his past, a horror story no one will forget! This book takes you through Kevin's life, his past and present. When all else fails and no one believes Kevin can turn his life around, Torey comes through once again. So sit back and relax with this book, and let it take you to a past unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the spark?","review":"I'm sorry to say but this book was agreat dissapointment for me. I've read two other books by Hayden, but I really missed the spark in this book. Maybe because it's her 1st one, but still, I love her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I was utterly disappointed in this book. Ms. Hayden's approach, if in fact she has one, was hopelessly devoid of any theoretical backing. She simply misses the boat on many crucial issues. Furthermore, her character development is completely lacking, and we spend 1/2 of the time hearing about her relationship with her \\"little sister\\" rather than exploring Kevin's history. At the end of the book, I was almost as unknowledgeable about why Kevin hadn't talked for so many years as I was when I started the book. While I am not completely discrediting the work that Ms. Hayden does, I found her book very frustrating. There are much better books that explain child abuse and what the victim is experiencing than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid guide to security for the systems administrator","review":"This thick security tome is a practical guide to security that seems ideally suited to systems administrators. There is a brief introduction to general security issues, then eleven chapters that cover tools and techniques. These include packet sniffing, data encryption, wireless security. An overall soup to nuts guide to practical security.This book doesn't go from computer science theory and architecture, it starts with descriptions of the problems very close to the metal (often times showing packet layouts), and then covers point by point use of open source software to fix the holes.The text is well written, if a little stiff, and the graphic are not overused but are not as sparse as O'Reilly.

It's the same wonderful voice - the only difference is that this time, the singer is also the songwriter. And boy, what a great songwriter he is! Ray Wilson writes pop music, but not this kind of pop music that is only written to hit the charts. His lyrics are thoughtful, his music is deep and rich and full of unusual ideas that make listening a pleasure. He doesn't write a chorus thinking \\"this one will get me a lot of airplay\\". He puts his heart and soul into it, only striving to make his music interesting and perfect. This CD gets better each time I'm listening to it, because I discover new nuances of Ray's songwriting each time. This guy holds all of my hopes for better, more intelligent, and more honest pop music in his hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ray Brings Us Change!","review":"Can't stop listening to this beautiful, brilliant music! After first hearing Ray on the last Genesis album I was knocked out by his voice and his ability to add depth and emotion to the tracks in a powerful and articulate way. Things are no different here, other than the lack of Tony Banks synths and the out-front heavy drumming, this is nearly a Genesis album without Banks & Rutherford. This is Rays own, with a slight Jackson Browne /country sort-of feel to some of the tracks, Ray went above my expectations on this excellent recording. Worth every penny! I just hope that someday I get to see him perform in the States."},{"rating":"2","title":"stays with you","review":"This was my first Jim Harrison book. Being from Michigan, I've been curious about him for years but foolishly stayed away because I didn't like the movie version of Legends of the Fall, which certainly isn't Harrison's fault. Now I have some catching up to do.True North is one of those books that stays in your mind long after you've finished it. The reader lives for a time in the mind of a naive, complicated, unhappy, yet hopeful young man who struggles to make sense of the world and his own place in it. His emotional isolation is mirrored by the remoteness of the setting; the depiction of Michigan's Upper Peninsula wilderness is completely accurate. The narrative is nothing short of poetic. Harrison is clearly a master of language. This is truly a beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got bored","review":"I liked Legends of the Fall and the other two novellas that were in that book but I got bored reading this, maybe after about 40 pages or so. I found myself getting depressed just thinking that somehow I should force myself to keep reading this rambling, pointless, overly detailed coming of age type story. Finally I just said the heck with it and turned it back into the library, so happy that I didn't buy it. I would have to have absolutely nothing else going on in my life in order to tolerate this kind of book.

The writing was also a bit sloppy; for instance the author did not keep track of his own timeline.

The \\"Solo\\" makes the perfect replacement. Although not as slim as the nearly paper-thin \\"Secretary\\" model, it feels much sturdier and the blade is slightly longer. Closed, the knife is slightly thicker than I had expected, but it is still far more slim than a typical Swiss Army Knife. If you want easy access to a reliable, versatile, single blade - this is the one.

Also, the book is extremely helpful when it comes time to outline courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a hoax.","review":"I have sent in my review of this book twice! Since it was not favorable am I to assume you do not print unfavorable reviews? I usually rely on your customer reviews and often buy books that don't necessarily have glowing reviews. It makes me wonder whether I should still buy from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album for Poco Fans and Poco Newbies","review":"Poco's first unplugged live album is a pure delight. The set features a great collection of music. Long time Poco members Paul Cotten and Rusty Young shine, as does relative newcomer Jack Sundrud. Young's \\"Nothing Less Than Love\\" appears for the first time on an \\"official\\" release and could have been a great commercial hit for them at another time. It would fit right up there with anything the Eagles have ever released. Other highlights include the acoustic debut of the rocker \\"Under the Gun\\", Cotten's \\"Every Time I Hear That Train\\", Sundrud's \\"Never Loved...Never Hurt Like This\\" and \\"Shakin' It\\" and the encore cover of Buffalo Springfield's \\"On the Way Home\\". All together a great live album and a worthy addition to the Poco catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"the right stuff, in a wrong setting","review":"I happen to own the set of paperbacks of which this is part. They are poorly edited, and ill printed on crummy paper. It also happens that the set prints several stories twice, and forgets some of HPL's not so minor works. A publisher who gives this kind of treatment to a writer and to prospective customers doesn't deserve your money.this volume's best redeeming feature is the inclusion of two of my favorite HPL tales : \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" and \\"The Statement of Randolph Carter\\" but in the light of the existence of better edited, printed and organized collections, this falls short of being enough for me to recommend itIf you like HPL, or just want to discover his works, do yourself and the publishing industry a favor, get your book somewhere else, there are some better collections and omnibuses around, just waiting for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"mountains of much","review":"All the hype that I had read and heard about it,just didn't measure up. I was disappointed at how repetitive it was, the long drawn out descriptions that added up to nothing,the first person narrative that was devoid of any sort of suspence with no dialogue throughout. It was comparable to something that was written by a high-school student without a Thesaurus. This is the longest it's ever taken me to read a couple hundred pages....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"...I thought his use of language was very layered and rich, if not even quite dated. It took me a couple chapters just to get the lingo down. I think the writing style here is quite dry and the story is only maddening in the sense that it bored my socks off. I kept reading with the expectation that it would pick up, and when I got 95% done I was expecting some fantastically creepy ending that would make up for such monotonous content. Again, I was disappointed. This book might give a 6yr old the chills but it certainly didn't do it for me, nor did it entertain me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovecraft's schizophrenic ramblings and the Necronomicon","review":"Howard Phillips Lovecraft is kinda sorta a bad writer, and he kinda sorta throws obscure pre-revolutionary era words at the reader which amount to an elaborate nothingness, and his bizarrenesses are kinda sorta the things a sexually repressed thirteen year old would think up, but I kinda sorta like him anyway! I'd recommend L. Sprague de Camp's biography of him, if it wasn't out of print. (Oh yeah, I should mention that despite what the title of this review says, Lovecraft was (probably) not insane . . . just a little eccentric.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"The only word that can describe H.P. Lovecraft's concept of universal horror and his unique writing style is \\"increcible.\\" HP Lovecraft's work, \\"At the Mountains of Madness,\\" reveals the true history of earth, when the Old Ones built their cyclopean city, deep in the arctic. There are three other very good stories in the book, as well. \\"The Shunned House\\" is you classic haunted house story, with a Cthulhoid twist that Lovecraft is famous for. \\"Dreams in the Witch-House\\" is very much like \\"At the Mountains of Madness,\\" for in goes into a bit of detail about the true first inhabitants of this world, the elder things. The bottom line is, BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stories are great, but............","review":"I'm a big fan of HPL and try to get everything out by him.

For instance, there is no highrise building on Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina, as the book states. The building that Hallberg saw apparently was Sugartop on nearby Sugar Mountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't find the soul of golf here!!","review":"This book should have been called \\"Me and My Neon\\".

All I kept asking myself was why go on this pointless trip with all the problems back at home"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well crafted prose reveals poor personal values.","review":"William Hallberg brings us many insightful, poignant and well crafted passages about golf, companionship, and his personal biography. Unfortunately, his efforts get lost in what seems to be more a soul searching than the soul of golf. While reading passages about a wide range of courses, companions and rounds of golf so well written that I felt I could almost hear him speaking, I was, at the same time, deeply troubled that what sounds like caring man would neglect meaningful, adult responsibilities and relationships in favor of a traveling golf fantasy and potential book sale earnings. Ultimately, for me the Soul of Golf became more a story of how a man with wonderful literary, golfing and, by his own account, interpersonal skills bemoans his well earned guilt about leaving the sufferings of several family members behind in pursuit of what is, after all, a game. Ultimately, I think it missed it's mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birdie on descriptions of golf, double bogey on the rest.","review":"I looked so forward to reading this book after it was recommended by a friend, also an avid links lover. However, getting past the authors liberal genre and his views towards certain people of the \\"christian\\" persuasion left me disappointed. As a Christian, I wish I could have read the book without the typical liberal diatribe of \\"religion-bashing\\" and received more inspiration of how one can learn of life through the study and playing of the game. Too much of a slice to the left side of center for me. Bill, just stick to the vivid and well laid out descriptions of the course and leave the anti-christian prosletizing to someone else (that is, if you want to sell books.) Can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lap suit!","review":"I was a little concerned when I purchased this item as I've never owned a suit made by this manufacturer before. I liked the style of the suit, however, and the price was too good to pass up so I ordered it.My worries quickly vanished after trying it on. The suit is a perfect fit. It doesn't need to be adjusted what-so-ever and is quite comfortable. I swim three times a week so suit stability and comfort were very important to me. So far, I've noticed no wear and tear and it washes well. I've only had it for about a month, so we'll see how it stands up to chlorine.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid, moderate lap suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size too small","review":"In my opinion the suit is not true to size.

Frog pond is a little frustrating but they love making the frogs jump. All in all, a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another great game from Cranium!","review":"This is our 3rd game by Cranium and we're just as impressed with it as we are the other two (Caraboo and Hulabaloo). My 2 sons received this for Christmas (4 & 6) and we played it last night - great design - love the box that makes storing the pieces easy. As far as the small pieces go - put 'em in a ziploc baggie and you're all set. There were a lot of giggles going round as we tried each \\"station\\" out. This is a great game to give as a gift or buy for your own family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family fun","review":"Cranium Balloon Lagoon is fun for everyone. The frog pond was challenging even for an adult. The board pieces could be put together a little better because it is hard to move it around for everyones turn. If you have a turntable, it works good. My 5yr old loves to play it, even by herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and learning, if it wouldn't fall apart.","review":"This game is a great option for the 5 to 8 year old range. The games are fun (if a little simplistic for adults) and a lot of different areas are addressed. Fine motor skills are excercised in the frog jump. Spelling and letter recognition in letter lake. Matching and pre-reading recognition skills are addressed in snack shack and tumbling sholls. I don't think this game if very sturdy, though. We have had this game less than a month and already the board pieces are not connecting with the center piece. A little bit frustrating, but the game is still playable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the fun of a carnival","review":"A great game for the family--especially with mixed ages. My 4 yr old, 9 yr. old and I all enjoy playing and have an equal chance of winning. THe other day, I had to pull away two 9 year olds from playing it. Great design and graphics. It sounds like a cliche, but it's FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for 3 year olds, too","review":"I agree with the other reviewers on how much fun 5 year olds can have with this game. Just wanted to add that my 3.5 year old loves it, too. She plays by herself without the timer for half an hour at a time. The challenge is much reduced if the time pressure is gone, and therefore the game is no longer frustrating for younger kids. When she plays with her almost 5 year old sister she is given \\"double allowance\\" for time to complete the tasks and she actually managed to win some games. The game is not that \\"academic\\" but then not all games need to be. Instead, it trains coordination and quick responses. It does have many small pieces to lose, but then, it may be used as an example to teach children to be mindful about their toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranium has done it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What I, a mother of 4 (3 who can play the game) heard right after we started playing this game was, \\"Mom. We want to play again!!\\"They played it at LEAST 4 times in a row the first day. They love it. Both of my 7 year old twin girls say the best part of the game is that you have to go fast. One of them says, \\"It's a RUSH!\\" We look forward to all of the Cranium games. I say, spend the extra money. Get a Cranium game. The kids love them!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranium Balloon Lagoon","review":"My kids love this game! The board sometimes comes apart when moved, but otherwise excellent. The music is infectious, but not annoying. Fun for all ages; challenging enough for my 7 year old, but simple enough for my 5 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful game!","review":"I love this game. We have many and some are just too repetative or too many rules for the little ones. This game is wonderful and I can guarantee I will be taking a second look at all the cranium games. Its hard to set up a game and read directions when young children are waiting and \\"helping\\" sooo much. I was amazed that the directions for play were so simple and took less than 3 minutes to read and we were up and playing. My children love this game and my son is only 3 and this is the only game I can play with him without him getting so distracted hes making up his own rules. I think they should have lowered the recommended age cause younger than age 5 can play without a problem. I think so better than candyland or plenty other younger games. You must buy this its a great family game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Lagoon","review":"Balloon Lagoon is a cool game. I like the frogs, snack hut, and the mermaid match. It is fun.

This kit is more durable than the smaller kit, but as with all plastic models is still rather fragile. The gundam is made from colored but would benefit from some detail painting. The included figure is unpainted/uncolored as well. Definitely a great display item though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good battery charger","review":"I bought this battery charger when mine went out.

This is incorrect. The product charges 12-volt systems only, as stated on the box and very clearly in the user's manual. The charger *looks* very well-made, and the review system makes me give it a rating, but really I can't comment on overall quality because I needed a 6-volt charger and had to send it back without using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy J.

Hope she continues a story for each and every on of them. Definitely recommend to All who like a fast action read. Absolutely LOVED IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of action","review":"This is the first book that I have read by this author. After reading a lot of the reviews I purchased this in hopes of a good action romance. There was a lot of action but not near enough romance (IMO). I would've preferred a lot more interaction between Alexa and Killian but of course that would then have changed the story. The story had numerous characters and I found it a bit difficult to keep track of them all. Perhaps all of the secondary characters were needed in order to set up the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lexar Media MS128-132 128 MB Memory Stick","review":"At first I thought it was a good deal.

Then, days later the \\"formatting error\\" message re-appeared when I went to use it. I took the camera and memory stick to Best Buy to see if they could figure out what the problem was.

Normally I like to go for Sony products but because of the huge price difference I thought I will give it a try and so far I have had no problems whatsoever. I also have a Sony Memory stick that came along with the camera and I cannot tell the difference between the two. However, to be honest I have not actually tried comparing the two products for the read and write times or the time to transfer the images from the stick to the computer, so there well might be a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blind man wouldn't know the difference..","review":"The Lexar memory sticks work just as well as Sony's, but at a much lower price.

Great price after rebate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything the same but the feel","review":"I purchased a Sony 128 MB memory stick and the Lexar 128 MB memory stick in the same order to compare. Function appears to be the same; however, the Lexar simply does not feel as \\"sturdy\\", and does not come with a case and labels like the Sony brand product. Minor differences, I know, but worth noting. Also, I have not experienced any problem with reading the memory stick in my Sony laptop or in my SanDisk 6-in-1 card reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Works great just like the original memory stick. I gave it 4 stars because my previous Lexar 128 MB memory stick (bought 3 months ago) came with 5 years of warranty, this one comes with a 90 day warranty. I don't know why Lexar cut back on warranty. Also Lexar is kind of slow in processing their mail in rebates (through rebatesHQ), I sent the rebate request in January and still waiting to receive it.

Then, they admitted to me that they weren't made anymore, which I knew but figured that the manufacturer had started to make them again, since a company from New York was apparently selling them off Amazon.

I've seen it several times since, and the action sequences remain fresh and exciting, even exhilarating. For that reason, it makes an excellent addition to my DVD collection. The plot is essentially a variation on a Western: Man-with-no-name type (albeit in this case he has a name) earns redemption through an act of selflessness and courage. The chase scene, which occupies the bulk of the picture, has never been topped. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. And there's even a bit of a twist at the end . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie ever","review":"this was the greatest movie i have ever seen.

You can watch this movie over and over again. this is by far the greatest movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Aussie action film.","review":"If you can get passed the fact that Mel Gibson has become what he's become then I think you would really enjoy this movie. It bears no real connection to Mad Max near as I can tell even though it is considered a sequel. The look of the film influenced a lot of post-apocalyptic movies from this era. Lord Humongous remains one of the most intimidating bad guys you're likely to see in a movie. The stunt work and car chases are top notch. Gibson shows just enough of the character's humanity to make him sympathetic but not enough to make him unrealistic for the harsh world in which he lives. Buy this but I'd avoid Beyond Thunderdome; it's inferior to Road Warrior and Mad Max in every way and has too many child actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie of All Time!","review":"The first time I saw the \\"Road Warrior\\" was in the mid 80's when I was a teenager. I loved it then, I still love it today a hundred or so times later. The chase scenes, the old 70's muscle cars set across an apocalyptic background with the daily war being waged on fuel. A genious plot to be derived from the original \\"Mad Max\\" and as being told be from an older \\"Feral Child\\" character. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Apocalyptic Cocktail","review":"An incredible apocalyptic fairy tale, George Miller's THE ROAD WARRIOR paved the road for lesser films that followed this mini blockbuster about an ex-cop named Max daring the wastelands of the Australian outback.The film depicts a world gone mad, where those in power maintain their agression not with money but with gasoline ... the only remaining source of power left on the planet.Wandering into a Hatfields/McCoys fued between the last outpost of humanity and a bunch of leather-clad crazies, Max has to decide whether he'll stand alone ... or he'll stand for a purpose.The film's climax is a frenetic truck chase sequence that will, quite possibly, never be rivalled on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hyperkinetic masterpiece!","review":"In \\"The Road Warrior,\\" George Miller made his mark as a great director right after the opening credits with a superbly chilling montage of old industrial/war footage and violent moments from \\"Mad Max.\\" He followed this with many of the greatest action sequences ever. In a way, this film is in a league with Stanley Kubrick's \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" Both are immensely entertaining yet you never forget that they ponder the destruction of civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. They did a great job!","review":"I actually own the Blu-Ray of this movie and I have to say for an older movie they did a fantastic remaster of the transfer. Most older movies don't get the clarity this movie has on blu-ray. It's like seeing the movie for the first time again and thats from a person that is VERY picky about what blu-ray's to own. This one you will NOT regret owning on blu-ray. Go for it!I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that they do as good of a job on the \\"Alien\\" trilogy thats coming on blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I'm saying \\"finally\\" because we've finally received a version of the Road Warrior that looks outstanding! The picture looks the best I've ever seen and while the sound isn't as great in terms of bass reproduction, it still sounds very clear, just a tiny bit lackluster. Several of the scenes have a bit of softness to them probably due to age but I'd say about 95% of the film looks crystal clear. There aren't many extras other than an introduction by film critic Leonard Maltin and a filmmaker commentary. A bit lacking in the extras department but the commentary is informative enough for film enthusiasts and fans of the film. It'd be nice to get a retrospective documentary one day on this classic.At the end of the day, the movie is delivered in an above average presentation and definitely worth a peek in HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the way it should be, butnot quite.","review":"Despite what one reviewer said, the widescreen version on this disc is true widescreen. I am guessing that the reviewer did not watch beyond the first five menutes, which is in reduced full-screen mode as it was originally shot for the cinema.One the down side, this is not the full-length European version which is around a minute longer and has a more graphic boomerang scene, rape/murder scene, and chase scene at the end.It's worth the $10 I paid for it, even though it is the original US release version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie No spanish subtitles","review":"The Road Warrior is a classic, but doesn't have Spanish subtitles on the features. I hate when a good moviecomes without this feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Of A Cult Classic","review":"The Road Warrior (or Mad Max 2 as it is known in Australia) is a non-stop rollercoaster ride of a film. Better than the original, which most sequels fail to do (this sequel has no soppy romance that was necessary in the original), this film explodes with total action and carnage. The final chase scene is the most exiting in the anals of motion picture history. The original Mad Max is set during the fall of civilisation...In Mad Max 2 civilisation has gone, and a new order has taken over. With more crashes than the original, and more action, this film is a classic action flick...the third film is, in my mind, nowhere as good as the original or this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action flick, but flawed.","review":"Mel Gibson at his best. Definatly one of the best action movies ever made, along with Aliens and the Indiana Jones movies. Action packed the whole way through, [tough] characters, and exellent storyline. It overall is a great movie, but it has some seriously (...)acting! But the bad acting in Aussie is certainly better than the horrible acting of the actors who dubbed over Mel in Mad Max! For people who love good action, you got it right here. For people who are obsessed with violence and action look no further. Road Warrior is a classic action, worth the money and space on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUNAWAY FLIGHT SIMULATOR!","review":"Before Riggs, before Braveheart, there was Max. The Road Warrior is one of the best, if not the best action film in history, Austrailian or otherwise. Sequel to the blockbuster Mad Max, this is the pivotal road rage flick. Set in post-nuclear holocaust Austrailia, Max is a wandering survivalist who ends up defending a group of refiners from the savage Humongus. The chase scenes are some of the best ever and the crashes make you want to walk to work for a week. The characters are memorable and the story keeps you asking for more, and you get it. Mel Gibson performes incredibly as the merciless Max, who's character has evolved into a cold, indifferent persona, thinking only of himself. The film begins perfectly with the narrative opening and conlcudes in a race for survival in one of film history's most exiting chases. Generally, The Road Warrior is a welcome treat for movie fans around the world. Nothing quite like it has been made before or since."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will we get to HEAR the ORIGINAL?","review":"I'm not sure how many people realize that when \\"The Road Warrior\\" was first released, it was given a DUBBED soundtrack. The Australian accents were deemed too difficult for the average American moviegoer. As far as I know, this is the ONLY version available. It would only be fair for this listing to indicate that Mel Gibson's voice is no where to be heard. (Incidently, the dubbing was done by actors of modest talent.) Now that Mel Gibson is an international star with a highly recognizable speaking voice, and now that Australian movies have been popular in the US for decades, would it be asking too much to have \\"The Road Warrior\\" remastered with its ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, plot and action!","review":"I agree with all the previous reviews. The action in the final chase scene was incredible. The Road Warrior is an awesome DVD to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, Grainy on Blu-ray","review":"The title says it all here folks. I've been a long time fan of this series (and by series, I mean 'Mad Max' and 'The Road Warrior', not that abortion of a movie 'Max Max beyond Thunderdome'). Anyway, this is the Australian release titled 'Mad Max 2', not 'The Road Warrior', so it has a slightly different intro, and they do refer to Mel's character as Max, not as the 'man with no name' like they did in the U.S. version.Not a lot in the way of extras here. The picture is very grainy when viewed in hi-def. Not anything you can do about it; it was a limitation of the time since it wasn't filmed in hi-def. Still, the film looks good despite it's age and the sound is good. If you don't have it on DVD, you can certainly pick it up in that format cheaper than this was ($13).BTW, if you haven't seen Mad Max, I'd recommend it as it schools you as to why he's mad (angry, not crazy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film !!!","review":"This film definitely gets 5 stars. It was awesome. Max is back and nobody can mess with him and get away with it. This is definitely the best of the 3 films. Max wanders through the outback, looking for gasoline in his black Ford Falcon Interceptor and helps a small colony of people defend themselves against a gang of vermon that are out to kill the colonists and take all their fuel. This is a great post-nuclear war movie and it really makes you think about what it would really be like, if we did have a war. There are great stunt scenes in this film that still haven't been topped today. I would definitely recommend this film and if you buy it, get the letterbox edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best Mad Max film","review":"Not only is The Road Warrior the best Mad Max film, but it is also one the best action films of all time. This movie has some of the best action sequences involving tons of cars going incredibly fast, plus some extraordinary crashes, which equals one heck of a movie. The script however is lacking but it doesn't really matter since there's so much action. Also, you could watch the movie with the mute on and still figure out what's going on. A very satisfying film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Classic and a Film Masterpiece","review":"A fan of action films will undoubtedly side with The Road Warrior as an all-time great. And that person would not be wrong in doing so, either. In my opinion, The Road Warrior stands beside Hard-Boiled as the greatest of all action movies.But I think what so many people fail to consciously recognize is how The Road Warrior stands the test of time not just as an action film, but as a film, a term which is not limited to genres and categories. The Road Warrior transcends the conventional action film by creating a completely believable setting of the cliched post-apocalyptic world. The setting is imperative in a film like this; and Max's world of roads and desert wastelands is as believable as the far more popular one that happened \\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\\"The Road Warrior is not to be missed, not only by action fans, but film fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was quite surprised by this film, which I only saw for the first time about a week before this review was written. I've seen a lot of early-to-mid-eighties action films, such as Commando and Invasion U.S.A., as well as the original Mad Max (albeit in its messed-up American version), so I wasn't really expecting too much from this. It completely blew me away. George Miller and company took aspects of some of the best genres (e.g., samurai, western, etc.) and made a modern myth. They also managed to make one of the most satisfying climaxes in film history with the final chase involving the tanker truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!","review":"I have always been a fan of the Mad Max series and I was very excited to hear of The Road Warrior on Blu-Ray.

The film and sound quality are barely better than VHS, it is presented in fullscreen format which reduces the brilliance of the cinematography, and there are no decent special features to speak of. If you really feel the urge to see it, rent it, and wait for the special edition which I'm sure will come out eventually. If the MadMax special edition is any indicator, it should be a great SE DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road Warrior","review":"This movie was also known as Mad Max 2.

It's actually interesting and engaging. Also, I like that it is only multiple choice, one-word or one-sentence answers, so it doesn't take forever and you don't have to be THAT original or poetic. It's designed for 2 people to fill out (one is A, one is B), so each can provide their own answer. My idea was to fill this out and give it to my boyfriend for Christmas, with a note requesting that he fill out his part and give it back to me for next Christmas.If you're looking for something unique, fun and special to give to your other half (or a way to bond by going through it together) this is the way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"My finacee and I have had this book for a couple of years now and we take it along with us on road trips.

We were given this book as a \\"fun gift\\" and at first it seemed harmless enough. However, the more I look at is, but more I think that there are questions in here that delve into areas that can potentially really hurt each others' feelings. Why does my husband need to know the reasons i don't like being in the relationship, or who my last sex dream was about, or what the best thing anyone ever did to me sexually was and who did it? i am all for asking new questions and exploring uncharted territory, but i also think not every single detail of one's life needs to be opened up to questioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I bought this for our one year anniversary and wish I would have picked something different.I expected a more general and sweet way about telling the \\"story of us\\" and while there were some questions along those lines midway through it got to more sensitive questions that could be hurtful for each other to hear.

It included too many negative questions that can lead to arguments and hurt feelings even in the most happy/healthy of relationships. This book advertises itself as some kind of relationship builder that is suppose to \\"deepen our love\\" but we found ourselves answering too many questions about our exes and each others' shortcomings.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem this book is for people who have been faithful to each other or who are deeply in love. There are questions such as \\"list three qualities you wish your partner had\\" and \\"Have you committed an indiscretion on vacation or business trip that you have never revealed to your partner?\\"Far too many \\"check one box\\" answers, which don't allow for expressing individual feelings or sharing memories.This book seems like it's more for couples with unresolved issues, or ones that are trying to save their marriage.Definitely not for the happily-in-love--you'll find a lot of it doesn't apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected Surprises","review":"I ordered this book with the intention of making a weekly ritual with my boyfriend where we could sit down, fill out the book together, and reflect on some good memories. I read through the preview provided, and thought that it seemed perfect for us and would incite a lot of laughter. But when I got the book and glanced through it... there really are some sections I could do without. Going through past relationships in great detail is not something that I want to bring up again with my boyfriend, and this book definitely asks you to delve into these previous times.

The bar eats a lot of batteries. My wife and I get a game we bought actually enjoyed together and between the two of us, the fresh batteries died in two days.2. The bar's 'auto-shut off' does not always shut off... leading to further draining more batteries.3. When the bar does auto-shuts off, sometimes it is during play break time which often leads to issues with continuing game play (some games will not \\"unfreeze\\").4.

Not only was it cheaper than a \\"wired\\" sensor bar, but also it provides the freedom to move it around without tangling cords. Well, I was wrong. This item is a piece of junk! It worked ok for the first week or so, but then it just crapped out. The so called \\"sensor\\" didn't pick up anything from the Wii remote (and yes, I was closer than the allotted 25\\" away).

It's the worse most frustrating piece of technology I've ever owned. To start it uses 4 prehistoric double A batteries and it consumes the 4 batteries at a ridiculously alarming rate. Another con is this sensor bar doesn't actually turn off even though there's a power button, it's rhetoric and very very inconvenient having to remove all 4 batteries from the sensor to turn it off. Yes, all 4... This junk somehow SOME WAY manages to kill itself even if the incorrect amount of batteries is in place. It doesn't work from far away (yes, I've played with the sensor settings) the hand mouse on the screen shakes making it hard to confirm tasks. It's overpriced. There is absolutely, positively no Pros to owning this monumental overpriced piece of crap.

Unfortunately for me, it did not. After calibrating the remotes with the new sensor in the Wii menu, the jumpiness was reduced minimally and the delay still existed. I measured the location of the sensor bar from where I was sitting and it was almost 25 feet. I moved up a bit and it worked fine (just like the stock sensor). I plan on returning the item tomorrow since it simply did not deliever the distance it markets.

One night my husband played the Wii before bed and after we'd turned out the lights and gone to sleep the alarm on the sensor bar went off - it was loud enough to wake us up and the Wii is in a different floor of the house than our bedroom.

Then I tried World of Goo, Bit Trip Beat, and so on, but to no avail.I never thought I would have so much trouble finding a suitable replacement for my original sensor bar.

The drawbacks to this wireless version are that it requires batteries and that it beeps in an annoying manner when its timer nears the time you have set for it to turn off (to save batteries). I haven't explored the issue thoroughly, but in the several seconds I spent looking it over, I couldn't find a way to turn it off manually once it was on, and thus there is no way to stop that beeping or to turn it off before the timer runs out, other than to open the battery case and dislodge a battery.As others have pointed out, a Wii \\"sensor\\" is not a sensor; it is two LED IR emitters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and easy to use","review":"I have this and it works great. Main reason I bought it was to move the sensor closer to the Wii controllers since they act erratically around 12' or farther away from the Wii's sensor bar.

The original sensor bar's wire is too short to be routed through the wall and still reach (like all my other wires). It's also mounted high on the wall. SO I NEED the sensor bar to be mounted on the bottom so I can reach the ON/OFF button because it needs to be turned on and off independently of the WII (that kinda sucks). The thing needs 4 AA batteries = it's too heavy for double sticky tape to hold for very long. And you can't permanently mount it because the battery access is on the bottom that is up against the TV. I tried several ways to try and keep the thing mounted but ultimately had to DRILL into my TV's case (underneath) to make holes to run fishing line to hold it from falling off. I'll be looking for a better solution.

I found it helpful to look through and reinforce some of the things I'd been learning on the slopes. My boyfriend (who taught himself how to snowboard) used this book to teach me. It was great because before we had this book it was difficult for him to help me out because he just went out and snowboarded without any formal instruction. This book gave him the steps to use to teach ME. I'd recommend this for people who are just learning, especially people who have a more experienced snowboarder they can ride with. You can have a little personal instruction for free (or maybe the price of a beer!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall if you want to learn...","review":"This book is great if you really want to learn how to snowboard. In my opinion nothing can take the place of one-on-one or group lessons... but this book is a great compliment to help reinforce what you learn (or figure out) on the slopes.The illustrations are also really really helpful, so you can figure out what should be where and what it all looks like.

The performance and image are very good and naive: Emerson, in his brand new suit, fighting with the oscillators of his new MOOG synthesizer; the absolutely breathtaking acoustic solo by Lake; and Palmer trying to get into the rhythm on a part of The Great Gates of Kiev. Very nice film, that's why I recommend it.ELP's segment on the film about ISLE OF WIGHT and MASTER FROM THE VAULTS(from french program Superstars in Concert) are a couple of additional DVDs to be a good companion to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"For people who like this band","review":"If you do not love ELP, but you like them, do not buy this CD.

Only Pictures is on this CD. Over 95% of the video from Blues Variation through Great Gates Of Kiev consists of cartoon drawings and various colors spattered quickly across the screen, so you don't get to see the group (too bad the editors back then didn't realize the great thing about ELP was sitting back and watching their live performance -- they were unlike any other group ever; if we didn't want to watch them, we could just close our eyes and listen). Too bad they couldn't find the original video before the editing. The camera work is far better than that of Wakeman in the Journey DVD, as we get to see close-ups of the members playing and the interaction between Emerson and Palmer. Emerson was much more of a showman than Wakeman. Great video, anyway, even with the crappy visual effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the performance on \\"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\\"","review":"I suppose that if you are a committed collected of everything ELP, you might want to add this to your collection. But if you are just looking for a good live performance of \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\", the performance on the \\"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\\" DVD is far more inspired and exciting. I am quite certain that ELP would tell you the same thing. The vintage performance just lacks maturity in musical performance, which the latter performance has in spades. And with the other DVD, you also get excellent live performances of a lot of other ELP stuff, including Tarkus, Knife Edge, Prokofiev, Pirates, and \\"Fanfare for a Common Man\\". The other DVD, of the performance at the Royal Albert Hall in the early nineties, is just infinitely superior in every way. But if you are a diehard collector of ELP stuff, you might still like this, but you'll also get some cheesy vintage '70s video effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it Lake who said,","review":"\\"They call us pretentious and pompous - so we are!\\" Indeed. One must be quite adventurous to put one's name next to Mussorgsky's, co-authoring his masterpiece acclaimed for more than a century. The good musicianship softens the blow somewhat; not to confuse with good music, it was more of a fashion statement. With regard to the vogue of experimenting with classics, Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra was the most honest effort of them all (albeit futile too). While its musical and compositional merits could be debated, the idea behind combining rock with classical (in this case, rather pseudo-classical) music was of much greater ingenuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"To take a performance from a great band like ELP and ruin it with crappy special effects is unforgivable.When I watch this I get so mad I want to scream.Royal Albert Hall and Masters from the Vaults are both excellent DVD's and a must for any ELP fan.Don't waste your time on \\"Pictures',one of the worst rock movies ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Silly Mess","review":"Although ELP have their moments and they were the first prog group I got into back in '72, this is not their finest hour. Come on now, adding their own lyrics to a classical piece and \\"Blues Variations\\". If they wanted to do anything right to begin with, they should have made this a studio album, where the limitations of being a three piece would not get in the way. My opinion of ELP has always been; take side one of Tarkus, most of Trilogy, and throw in \\"Lucky Man\\" from the debut and you've got a pretty listenable disc. Pictures was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mussorgsky would roll over in his grave","review":"I'm not a huge ELP fan but I do like a lot of their stuff. However this just didn't cut it for me. Mussorgsky's original piece is a work of geniuses, and Ravel's version is good because it just adds power and color but keeps the spirit of the original work. I think it would have been possible to do a decent rock version of Pictures, but this version seems more like a hack job to me. I realize that not all of the original music may have been suitable to a rock format, however several parts that could have been adapted well, were missing. For instance why was Bydlo left out? This would have been a perfect fit. Also ELP's version of the old castle is just about unrecognizable and has none of the feel of the original. Finally I thought the lyrics in the great gate were just distracting, and almost all it's glory was missing. The only good track was Blues variaions which had little to do with Pictures. Maybe this is why it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, well....","review":"Okay, quite curious about progressive rock, and ELP, I picked up this and Tarkus. I had heard of ELP through research on the Italian band Goblin, which I love. I was hoping this would be similar, and from the many reviews I read, I was anticipating something great.Well...I don't know what to say.Okay, I'll start with: I was dissapointed. And I'm sorry I was, but I just wasn't thrilled. I don't really know what about it all I didn't like, I just wasn't thrilled. I mean, everyone made out ELP's music to be \\"mind-blowing\\" and \\"huge,\\" but I just sort of felt like it came off sounding sometimes like music to an old Nintendo game. There wasn't much that was huge about it. Sure, some of this was good. The Hut of Baba Yaga was interesting. But most of the album lost my interest. I'm really sorry to say that, too, because I sort of wanted to like ELP. But I was let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respectful disagreement with the Aussie fan","review":"As one who was trained in classical music (voice) but lives for rock & roll, I heartily agree with Aussie Fan's take on the energy of ELP's rendition of \\"Pictures\\" - however, I must say that that energy, which extended to the encore (\\"Do you want some more music?\\") added a tremendous coda to what must have been a memorable evening of music. As a frustrated piano player, I have always loved \\"Nut Rocker\\" (along with \\"Bumble Boogie,\\" the other U.S. hit by B. Bumble and the Stingers - I actually have both)and to top off the night with a rock-style remake of a \\"classical\\" piece was, for me, sheer joy.

This band wrote the book on progressive music. If these guys were born ten years later they would have been hessians. Carl palmer is way ahead of other drummers from this period in music. The guy is like the first death metal drummer. All that heavy kick, blast beats, this guy was doing it years before anyone else. Greg Lake; such a good song writer. The Sage has to be one of his best. The emotion just flows out of him. Then you got Keith Emerson. He wasn't ahead of his time because no one has yet to dublicate his grotesque keyboard rantings. This band is one of the best things to come out of the seventies. This album is a prime example of this bands genius.

This is a very straightforward counting book. There's no real text, entertaining rhymes, or engaging descriptions. Just the simple format of 1 one ball, 2 two bows, 3 three pots of paint and so on. The joy of the book are Mr Falconer's expressive Olivia illustrations, rendered in black and white with his signature splashes of red for highlighting. This is enough for toddlers just learning to count and recognize their numbers, but preschoolers over three will be bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say CASHING IN?","review":"We were looking forward to more adventures with Olivia.

I laughed out loud about a dozen times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"This book had the potential to be very good but in the end, it is quite average. The author's worst enemy is himself. For some unknown reason, Reidy feels the need to make some sort of joke or wisecrack once every six sentences. This interrupts the flow of the story and, most importantly, the jokes quit being funny around Page 12. And on top of that, the constant attempts at humor create a sense that the author is lying about many things.I am not sure why Reidy felt the need to constantly make jokes (self-deprecating and otherwise) but it absolutely ruined the entire story.

He spies on her and the family, rumages through the house at night, and tries to put moves on Mimi and fails. Thought Mimi does look good, she is not naked at all in this flick.

Stupid cast, screenplay, and story. 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Years","review":"I bought ATB's Seven Years basically because I knew 9:00 (Til I Come) and had heard his name as being highly regarded in the trance/dance genre. So I didn't know a lot about him going in.After a couple listens though, I have to say, this is a really good CD. It's very upbeat and the beats are top notch. The textures to his music create a very warm sound. It doesn't sound too synthesized. During one of the slower songs, it kind of reminded me of Robert Miles' classic \\"The Children\\".Another thing is that this music has been recorded over 7 years since 1998, but you really wouldn't know it. If you told me this was all brand new music, I'd probably believe it. ATB's music has definitely aged nicely over these last 7 years. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is ATB music","review":"I am going to put the facts to end all your worries of this Cd.This cd is packed with vocals so if you hate music with vocals skip this one.This music is not good trance or probably not even trance.This music should not be compared with other djs like Oakie, Tiesto cause this music is really different.For me this was very enjoyable and was my first Cd to try to introduce myself to trance and this might be a good place for Americans to be introduced.This really has the American feeling even though ATB is not american.This cd is full of great songs that some would consider classics.But this genre should be more like trance-pop or stuff like that not trance cause then people would expect this on other djs.Verdict: 4.6 out of 5.0 Buy it if you have been listening music from the radio and want to start to go to trance slowly. Probably avoid this if just a trance lover. But I listen to all type of music so for those that are open to everything must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Get It","review":"I'm relatively new to the dance scene and I have heard a lot of hype about ATB so I finally picked up this cd figuring a greatest hits would be the way to go. I understand that ATB is a vocal trance artist but I have a massive complaint: it seems like the ONLY thing that makes ATB distinctive is his use of vocals. If the vocals were stripped away from the music we would be left with boring fills and substandard beats. I'm not saying that it is bad because it has vocals, I'm saying that all it has are vocals. I became bored quickly with most of the songs. The only highlights to me were: Ectascy and 9 P.M. I'm hoping that I just didn't get it and need to hear some of his other work to understand and appreciate ATB. But until I do I'm going to list this as massively disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good flick","review":"This was a pretty good little ghost story.

I passed the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary material, but too much attitude","review":"Having just successfully completed the 65 today, I can say the test material is reasonably covered, though I was thankful I had my CFP exam studies and some free on-line tutorials to fall back on.As many people have commented, there is 'humor' scattered throughout the book. This does help liven up what could be a dry topic, but many times I found myself wanting to scream- 'Enough already, its not necessary to have some smart-a**, sarcastic comment in every paragraph'. It got to a point where the sarcasm was a distraction and actual impediment to me getting the actual material I needed from the text.Its apparent the author knows the material in depth. However he just has a bit too much attitude for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be too cute!","review":"I started studying for the the Series 65 using this book. After a month, I was not doing very well on the practice exams and bought the Kaplan Financial study material. After two weeks with Kaplan I passed the exam.

I do not recommend the book; you can do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Style","review":"I've only gone through the first two sections so far, but the book is very well written.

I had heard it was a tough test to take, but I passed by a long margin. The author manages to keep things easy to read and understand, while still conveying the meaning.

I would recommend this book to anyone preparing to take the 65."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Great Content","review":"I researched long and hard before I purchased this book, and I am glad I did.

I then studied hours on end each day for another month, and failed with a 65% (second attempt), effectively losing my job.

If you want to pass the test, look at a different study guide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps dry material interesting but didn't prepare me for the 65","review":"Although the book engages you enough to get through some fairly boring material, it just isn't detailed enough as a stand-alone study guide for the Series 65. I never even finished it because I didn't learn enough to do decently on the practice tests from the more serious vendors (STC, Kaplan). Read this if you want to learn some general concepts but I do not recommend relying on it as a serious study tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done. And the humor makes it all bearable!","review":"The Series 65 exam is a beast, but this book prepared me as well as can be expected. Here is the bottom line: study this book, do all the practice exams at least twice, take the exam seriously, and you will pass. The 65 is trying to flunk out as many 'tire-kickers' as possible, and they play 'hardball.' Many of the questions on the exam cannot be found in ANY prep book. That is why you need to overprepare if possible. But, the PASS THE 65 will get you where you need to go.

I have been speaking spanish for about 3 years now daily because it is my wife's native language and I was hoping that this product would be more advanced in that it covered the more difficult verb conjugations and maybe some sayings that don't translate well.

You can use a program like XMuxer to transform the MPG2-TS Sony file into a standard MPG2-PS file usable by 99% of editing programs. There is no quality loss since there's no recompression involved.

I was impressed with how beautifully straight the stitches were, compared to Singer and other more modern machines, and the great strength and simplicity of the mechanical design.

BUT - EVERY TIME I TAKE ONE OUT OF THE CABINET I STORE THEM IN AND TAKE THE TOP OFF, ONE OR MORE OF THE EIGHT SNAPS (TWO ON EACH CORNER) ARE UNDONE AND THE BOX IS ALWAYS ON THE VERGE OF FALLING APART!!!!I AM NOW CONSIDERING EITHER GLUING OR TAPING THE CORNERS AND SNAPS SHUT (THINGS I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO IF THESE WERE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED CORRECTLY) - OR JUST RETURNING THESE BOXES AND LOOKING FOR BOXES IN THE SAME DIMENSIONS THAT ARE MORE SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem snapping one button","review":"It looks good and assembly is very easy.

Then I went for the vice grips with the hope that it would snap it together and I would never need to un-snap it in the future.

The lid is a bit bigger than the box but I find that to be true for all Snap-N-Store products so keep that in mind. Snapping together the boxes is totally simple and the snaps create a nice accent to the box. The black coloring is a matte finish so the shiny accents pop against the subtleness of the color. These boxes create a much better look for use on shelves or even on the floor than would a bunch of DVDs stacked on top of one another.

Are they fine top grain leather, water tight to 600ft below the ocean's surface, anti-corrisive, and come with a hot date? Heck no! That's not what I expected either.One thing that isn't true in the advertisement about these boxes is the number of DVDs they hold. The ad says 26. It lies. It holds 28 very comfortably.If you plan to open and close these boxes all of the time and want them to last forever, you might want to consider something else.

On the other hand, it is a super profound look into how and why we are what we are through the lense of Evolutionary Biology.

And boy, is it beautiful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I bought this movie like many others because I love Alexis Bledel. It was very disappointing and I think I could have found something else better to spend $5 on. 15 minutes in I was completely bored and wondered where Alexis was and when she will appear. Then the whole it being a movie in a movie was just weird. I did not care for it and now it will sit on my shelf collecting dust. I wanted him to end up with Kate not Jill and the whole way they broke up before the wedding was strange and I just did not care for any of it. A normal love story would have worked just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I couldn't even finish watching this movie. Jay Baruchel is a horrible actor and actually seems nervous and unsure onscreen. The whole plot was stale and tries to force viewers to care about mundane characters in a mundane scenario. Baruchel's character is torn between his fiancee and an ex. Been there, done that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I didn't watch the movie for the cinematography, I watched it for the actors because there are actually a lot of big name actors in there- not Brad Pitt big but still Alexis Bledel, Shawn's dad from Boy Meets World, guy from She's out of my league, girl from Roswell, etc. They all did great acting jobs (I wish Alexis Bledel had a larger role)but the story kinda faded in and out. They dragged some things on and when they fade out in the middle of the movie I thought something was wrong with my dvd player!Overall, it was a cute movie. If you are having girls over for a girls night in this would be a cute movie. If you recently broke up with someone or had a love crisis and want to watch a movie on it, well than this is for you. Everyone has one of those moments where you second guess everything- this is a story about that. Great gift for older teen or twenty something and it is not that expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked this movie!","review":"I just came across this movie on cable the other night. I'd never heard of it, but I just loved this quirky little movie! The songs were amazing.

This is totally different from the cover, whereby features her as if they are the main role of the show, which the actor is, but not the actress.Thankfully, \\"Tuck Everlasting\\" is not a disappoitment, there is a story line and Alexis play a \\"real role\\" in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking the best songs in the movie","review":"The highlight of the delightful film \\"I'm Reed Fish\\" is Schuyler Fisk's bar song \\"From Where I'm Standing\\" followed by her wedding song \\"On Your Arm.\\" The movie revolves around her character as well as her lovely composition and performance; yet, inexplicably, neither song, nor any song by her is on this so-called soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"just weird.","review":"the only reason i watched this movie was because alexis bledel was in it. and that is the only reason i would ever watch this movie again.the whole plot that he made a movie about his life is just weird. he in a way embaerassed his ex-fiance by showing he didn't choose her. i personally liked katie (bledel) better than jill in the first place.and to top it all off the main character (reed fish) was just plain unlikeable. though alexis did a great job playing the town sweetheart getting dumped... i would next time just skip this movie and watch her in something better. don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"It has too many characters and story is fair.

We had been doing our best to follow the national debate on Afghanistan in the major media, but never could seem to get beyond a certain very general level of talking points and propaganda. We had nothing to answer people with, who would smugly state that the war in Afghanistan is hopeless and a waste of lives. This movie changed that for us. Here is real information, presented by those who have done real research, which lays out a real plan. I am now able to point out a few things to my friends about the surge in Iraq and the lessons it holds for Afghanistan. Making information accessible to the lay person, the way this movie does, is an important service. We now understand much better, rather than simply having to rely on blind patriotism, why these wars are necessary and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great back story","review":"Following the war over newspapers, one never got the big picture view - all of the stories seemed to be human interest stories.This documentary has candid interviews from very knowledgeable and thoughtful people and allows someone to understand how the Surge unfolded in a really unique way while remaining accessible and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety Strap","review":"I love this toy for my daughter.

As I happen to have an original LP copy of the album in question, which I bought over 35 years ago, may I make a purely selfish comment? Bullocks! The one truly inspiring track on this platter that catapulted Cat Mother to national notoriety was \\"Track in A\\". For nearly four years the track was in constant airplay from New York to LA on most of the then \\"Truely Awesome\\" FM radio stations which unfortunately now cease to exsist. The production quality of this LP was quite good for a fledgling Jimi Hendrix at the \\"boards\\" but the lack of fresh and exciting new songwriting abilities doomed this otherwise bright group of musicians to future obscurity. Don't buy this fake. For some reason it lacks the one track that made this band momentarily famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCOMPLETE!","review":"Although I have not actually heard this CD, I must comment on the fact that, based on the \\"13-track\\" listing appearing for this item, this is NOT the same thing as the original album. Those 13 tracks collapse into a much smaller number, since all of those old-time rockers listed (e.g., \\"Chantilly Lace\\") are only sub-sections of the song \\"Good Time Rock 'n' Roll\\". Several songs are missing, such as the 9-minute instrumental \\"Track in 'A'\\" and the song that previous reviewer Mountain Man is searching for, called \\"Charlie's Waltz.\\" If you want to hear the full, 50-minute album as Cat Mother intended, I'm afraid you'll have to get hold of a very rare CD--not this import--for mucho dinero, or else obtain a 35-year-old scratchy piece of vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoring","review":"RT rated this story with 4 stars out of 4 1/2. I never trust the opinion of Romantic Times or well-known authors that put their spin on a book just for selling purposes. Riviting to the last page. Well, that's a matter of opinion. Chapter 1-4 lacks tension and adequate conflict. The heroine is wishy-washy and is willing to marry a man that simply wants to use her to take care of his kid.

It was unavailable for quite a time, but is now in print again, thankfully. Sorry this is such a non-review, review, but it's a book that seems to touch each person differently.

Ethel's constant snarky criticisms of human beings as unintelligent and the human race as a distinctly sub par species quickly grow tiresome. In Ethel's defense, however, Jay really is as dumb as a post. Most of the suspense as the two quest across the quirky future landscape is obviated by the chapter one revelation that Ethel is capable of, say, shrinking Jay to the size of gnat and teleporting him halfway across the galaxy, but won't (unless Jay is in real danger) so as not to interfere with Jay's Grand Destiny to Save Humanity From Itself. If Jay is about to do anything to jeopardize the mission, the chicken quickly intervenes, but doesn't let Jay know.

But what is really VERY annoying is that the editor, who according to his introduction pretends to give a philologically reliable text of the novel, obviously has dispensed himself of a serious proof-reading.A great number of misprints have not been corrected -- in some instances, the sense of the text has been almost perverted (e.g. because quotation marks are missing so that you don't know that it is a person of the novel and NOT the narrator who is talking).Things like these shouldn't occur in a text edited by a professor of philology."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHIRLWIND WEDDING","review":"I ALWAYS LIKE HER BOOKS.

I would think it would last a few years if it wasn't used every day. But, in my opinion, it's a cheap piece of plastic made to be replaced every so often. It's called a revenue stream.

Nobody like him covered with such fruition yet with such depth, all aspects concerned with this issue. In some ways, he cemented the Western conferring it a mythical atmosphere.It's about the migration of a half-starved Cheyenne Indians from their barren reservation in Oklahoma to their home ground in Wyoming. The treacherous journey tests the stamina and courage and their trek is further endangered as the Cavalry sets out to prevent their exodus.There is more on the script. The natural contradictions between a renegade Captain and a devoted teacher (who really likes him), the honor of the tribu and of course these backstage formulas in which the power is exerted.Compelling, original and vibrant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of John Ford's best ever movies","review":"Another great John Ford Western, except for once, someone shows the Native Americans true plight, instead of being bloodthirsty savages....Highly reccomended for those of an I.Q. of 75 or above...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheyenne Autumn","review":"The last western by John Ford focus on the indian decline on the frontier. The John Ford stock company is back minus John Wayne. Notable stars, play cameo roles such as James Stuart, Arthur Kennedy, Edward G. Robinson, Gilbert Roland and Carol Baker. Richard Widmark's sympathy with the Indians treatment by the Govenment leads to corrective action. This picture was shot in beautiful Monument Valley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted To Like It","review":"I had never seen this film in all of my years and always wanted too. Unfortunately, I have to agree with most everyone. It moves so slow. I kept thinking that it HAD to get better, but it just plodded along like an old tired horse. The Dodge City scene leaves you scratching your head. It did not match the rest of the film at all and wasn't even funny. Now, the photography is beautiful, the scenery is beautiful and the transfer is beautiful. I made myself watch it to the end, and even listened to some of the commentary. One very interesting moment of the film and commentary (SPOILER) is one of the very last scenes when the Indian chief shoots his son. This was filmed on November 22, 1963 at the very same time as the JFK assasination. This troubled Sal Mineo for years. Interesting trivia, and unfortunately, this is all I will remember about the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"uggg! terrible movie!","review":"historically inacurate. about only thing correct are the names of the 2 chiefs and also they had horses. not much else is correct. they bolted from the reservation area in Oklahoma, near fort reno, not the desert sw?? also contained unneeded silliness with James Stewart's segment as the marshall of dodge city ks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheeze and crackers","review":"Well, there's good cheese and there's bad cheese--this was Cheeze Whiz. Sitting through it was an ordeal. The intent may have been good--i.e., John Ford's \\"apology\\" to the Indians--but other than that it was one bad Hollywood cliche after another. Richard Widmark, who can't act to save his life, plays a sort of prototype Oskar Schindler who risks his army career to go to bat for the Indians. Karl Malden plays a Prussian authoritarian sociopath, an easy villain. The Cheyenne themselves might have been humanized here if their leaders hadn't been played by stodgy, middle-aged white men with pointy noses and mall bangs. Ricardo Montalban is in mediocre form as usual, and Sal Mineo is, also as usual, an Italian-American version of Elvis. The only Indians with any dignity are the extras, who appear to be real Indians but probably not Cheyenne. And on top of everything else, this had to end as a love story. Pass the barf bag, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Waste Your Money On This Dog","review":"Absolutely the most STUPID movie ever made. No historical accuracy whatsoever.

Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaat??","review":"This was I guess supposed to be a serious story of the awful treatment of the American Indians- and the first and last thirds of the movie do that quite well. HOWEVER, right in the middle of the story-the middle third- is a total comic western. It has only the slightest connection to the rest of the story and totally destroys the mood and feeling of the main story. It's almost like they had this unfinshed comedy western footage with expensive actors that they had to use up so they just spliced it in! Sorry, no thumbs up! Two stars only for the main story OR for the comedy, not the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic, but worthy of a look-see!","review":"Legendary director John Ford's last film, while not as good as earlier efforts, does possess some striking photography, a brilliant Alex North score, and good acting. Stalwart Richard Widmark does well as the cavalryman with a conscious; Karl Malden is fine as the duty-bound fort commander; and Edward G. Robinson does his patented perfection as a politician who tries to placate the situation. Even the politically incorrect casting of non-Indians Ricardo Montalban, Delores Del Rio, Sal Mineo, and Gilbert Roland can be excused as a sign of the film making times. Veteran character actor Sean McClory is also quite memorable as the fort doctor who confronts Captain Malden about the mistreatment of the Indian prisoners."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAST WESTERN PORTRAIT FROM A MASTER","review":"This was the last Western film done by John Ford, who was considered by many to be the genre's greatest director. Gems like \\"The Iron Horse\\", \\"Stagecoach\\", \\"My Darling Clementine\\", \\"The Searchers\\" and \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" would certainly validate that consensus. Perhaps it wasn't the West of Frederick Remington or Charles Russell, but Mr. Ford's results are just as vivid. As is his custom, Mr. Ford rewards with viewer with beautiful visuals and stalwart performances from a star-studded cast. A fine tribute to the West of America ... and of John Ford.

They need to keep it simpler.Some of the pictures are downright creepy. The little girl being given tea looks like a zombie, and the lack of pupils in some pictures are offputting. Some of the messages are a little odd like those stars are millions of miles away when the closest of them is, I suppose, 25,000 million miles away, and the suggestion of mountains decaying strongly suggests that all mountains just decay and glosses over most plate tectonics when it shouldn't even bring it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manseau yes... others, uh uh!","review":"A recent dynamite book I really enjoyed is Peter Manseau's \\"Songs for the Butcher's Daughter.\\" It was totally engrossing. \\"A story of love, hate, Jews and typesetting.\\" I laughed, I cried, I did all the things critics say you should do with a good book.So now I am slogging my way through Peter Manseau's \\"Killing The Buddha - A Heretic's Bible.\\" It's a compendium of variously authored pieces dealing with the religious experience in America; Which could be a helluva book. But this one is just pretentious BS for the most part. The stuff Manseau (or Sharlett) writes to connect the pieces is good reading: i.e., interesting, timely, well written, accessible, etc., but the actual articles are mostly just some artsy-fartsy folks getting a kick out of making simple things needlessly obscure and pedantic. Also, despite the title, there is not a heck of a lot of Buddhism in the book, either.

The authors' focus is primarily on fundamentalist christian culture and a retelling of the books of the old testament from a contemporary sometimes controversial viewpoint. I think readers looking for insight into vanguard spirituality in America will be disappointed. The writing is very good, often funny, but more clever than authentic. One or two stories of unusual holy rollers would have been interesting, but there are far too many here.

The book then provides photos and drawings of specific German aircraft and brief bits of intelligence, each entry following the other in chronological order as new information became available, to piece together the development and use of the aircraft. The problem is the information was often fragmentary or incorrect, being limited to the time period in question. The book also gives a behind the scenes look at the way the Air Ministry collected intelligence. As a Luftwaffe enthusiast, I found a few obscure items worthy of note, such as the locations of crashed German aircraft. I don't believe the public would find this book interesting at all since much better books with accurate information have been published.

I was assured that staff at Gaiam of my size used the chair at their desks and were comfortable. I bought it and after a short period am looking for a replacement. Even propping the \\"balance ball\\" up with a firm pillow underneath (an unsightly solution that needs constant adjustment) my hands are still too low for comfortable use of my computer keyboard. Might be ok if you are around 5'5\\" or higher, but if you are small, I definitely advise against this for a functional chair requiring access to desk-high functions, and I believe Giaim ought to say something about this in their ads and through their phone reps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance Ball Heaven!","review":"Gaiam's balance ball chair was shipped quickly, lightweight, and was easy to assemble.My only complaint is that the ball they shipped in the box was not as large as what is pictured on the box, this site, or even in the manual that comes with it. I ended up going out to Target and purchasing a $9 Medium sized ball instead. Any ball will work on this chair, it is all a matter of how high up you need to sit.For me to be sitting ergonomically correct, I needed the Medium sized ball.Other than that, I love it! You feel your core/abs working almost immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiam balance ball chair","review":"I am VERY impressed with my Gaiam ball chair. My daughter had suggested a \\"ball chair\\" (which I had never heard of) for my bad neck and back, knowing I'd set myself up for a lower back spasm by sitting in a regular chair, slumping toward the back of the chair for hours. My back let me know for an entire week that my wooden chair position was exactly what it did NOT need. Now that I have my Gaiam, I sit up straight (because it forces me to do so) and I can spend hours and hours typing up a storm without a back ache EVER! It's a fabulous chair. When I first received it, one or two trial and error stints with filling or deflating the ball a bit were sufficient to find my exact, perfect height. The Gaiam ball chair really a marvel...especially for those of us with back problems...or anyone who wants to sit properly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ball Chair","review":"I love this chair. I thought it would be uncomfortable but it isn't and I can sit on it all day. It helps my posture and keeping my back straight.

They put it aside after using it for a year, so I called to ask why. They just got a fancier chair, but she wasn't yet ready to unload it, so I bought this for Christmas for my two tween children, who spend alot of time at the computer for school and for online activities. I have extensive experience using the ball for exercise, so I knew what the ball can do for you. Voila! They think it's cool and they get core strengthening action at the same time. The bonus is a nice full color booklet with suggested exercises for breaks from your desk work. I've made posters out of these phoots and posted them at eye's level to remind them it's a good idea to take a break. Not sure why the chair needs to be so expensive, but I'm pretty sure if I'd set a ball there for them, they'd not think it as cool, so the outcome is worth the cost for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"A perfect chair for what I wanted.

The chair comes with a thin metal rod with threads at each end that is designed to be bolted to the body of the chair. I presume this metal rod is a key safety feature to the chair to hold the ball on the base. There are four nuts provided with the chair that are supposed to be used to secure the rod to the chair housing. Unfortunately, not one of the nuts would screw onto the rod. They were too small or possibly the paint job on the rod made the treads too thick for the nuts to screw onto. Not even using a wrench other than the flimsy one would allow the nuts to screw onto the rod. I am returning the chair tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This product is garbage","review":"This product is a great idea and I would love a ball to sit on as an alternative to a chair. However, the ball that came with this is ridiculously small and doesn't come above a bar that's designed to keep a bigger ball in place. As a result, it's impossible to sit on. Doesn't look at all like the picture (ball is about half the size). Seems like others have this problem as well. Perhaps you'll get the correctly sized ball. Perhaps not. Roll the dice if you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair!","review":"I really like this chair - it does what they say in that it corrects your posture when sitting and forces you to use your core muscles to balance. I use mine in the office and love it - you can even bounce on it a bit when a good tune comes on the radio! I don't have the pain and tightness in my shoulders and neck from hunching forward to my computer and my lower back feels like it has a nice stretch to it. My feet and rear end don't fall asleep or tingle from sitting too long - so to me it was a good investment in myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bouncy posture, 2 in 1 solution (or more)","review":"My coworker had this chair, I tried it out and was like wow cool. I use it to sit on and exercise on. An occassional stretch is performed as well. I sometimes will use it as bench for weights :) becareful!Pros:1. it's a chair2. it's an exercise ball3. it rolls4. supports good posture5. A stretch and exercise guide was included!Cons:1. it's a little high, with no height adjustment2. you need to keep the ball pumped otherwise it's a saggy seat3. the wheel locks lock too easily4. this ones on you, good posture still needs to be a conscience effort, so sit up straightI recommend this chair/exercise tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short for a standard office desk","review":"We bought this for Father's day for my husband. Like the chair but the ball it comes with is too small. It's way to short to use with a standard office desk. Now we will have to buy an additional larger ball so we can use it with the desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair","review":"Don't be discouraged when you first inflate the ball. The ball is going to look too small for the average desk. Let it sit a few days and then you can inflate it more. At home, in my big living room, it still looked too small. I thought I wouldn't be able to reach my keyboard. Once I got it to my office, I found that it's the same height as my executive chair.It truly made me realize how immobile and rigid my regular chair has been all these years. Now I'm constantly moving my spine and flexing. What a wonderful change from sitting in the same position ALL day and getting stiff as a board. My back pain hasn't disappeared (probably never will) but this is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defeats the purpose","review":"After sitting on a true yoga ball for 3 years as my office chair the Balance Ball Chair sounded like a fancy upgrade for my new job, but I was disappointed. The quality of the product was fine, assembly was easy and it looked fine. But the base that the ball sits defeats the idea that you must use your abdominals to balance because it is completely stable. The rollers don't work very well on carpet and the wheels get locked very easy which makes motion even more awkward. I have returned the ball chair and am back to my yoga ball.Also, if you are tall, I would not recommend the balance ball chair. It says that is good for people up to 6'-0\\" but I am 5'-10\\" and it is very short. The exercise book that comes along with the chair has exercises that are only possible if you are 5'-2\\" or shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and stable","review":"This chair pretty much provides what it says; frame gives stability, but rolls with wheel resistance. Is low for most desks though and with ball inflated is not cushiony; I had to add a pillow.

When it was received, it seemed the ball chair was too low. so i had my desk altered and now its \\"almost\\" a perfect fit.its very comfortable and keeps my posture straight, and i dont like to sit on hard flat surface as its not good for the Bootie anyways. I think that the ball chairs??? come in different sizes for certain heights and weights? i cant recall if i read that before buying it, i am 5' and this one was a little too low.i tried to put a bigger ball but it didnt work out.All in all.I like it.

One suggestion, make sure you FULLY inflat the balance ball; it will make a difference in how you sit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair","review":"The chair takes a little getting used to, but once you try it you will like it. The chair does make you sit straighter creating less stress on your back and shoulders. Friends look at it oddly at first, but once they try it they like it too. Only drawbacks are that the ball deflates frequently and the wheel locks are very sensitive. Every time you roll around in the chair you accidentally knock the lever with your feet and lock the wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"plain ball is better","review":"I had this chair but switched to using a plain ball which was more comfortable. The chair and the ball were too short and didn't move easily. When I bought it they just had the black ball option and the whole chair was too small. The \\"backrest\\" wasn't doing anything.I ended up buying another (larger) ball. Even though it fit into the chair it was just easier, more comfortable and less hassle using a large ball by itself than using the chair. The plastic is cheap and the wheels don't move. The issue I found with all balls (in or out of a chair frame),is that standard desks can be too high (perhaps more so if you are a short person) and height adjust-ability is very limited with a ball chair. I ended up getting a desk where I could vary the height."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Worthwhile purchase. At first I didn't think it was anything more than an uncomfortable chair. However, after spending a week away from home I can see noticeable difference in my posture and core strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must if you're a 24/7 sitter","review":"I bought this on Amazon's Deal of the Day and figured it was worth trying.

If your job or your interests keep you tied to your computer, make your sitting habit a healthier one and try this chair.

He put the chair together but he hasn't used it since he constructed it 4 months ago. I am thinking about taking it apart and selling it again. The reviews for the chair seemed like a great ergonomic solution to back problems and too much sitting in the office. However, at 6'2\\" the chair just doesn't work for him. The ball also seems extremely small, even for me at 5'4\\". Reviews that I read said that with wear the ball would stretch out and would allow more air to inflate the ball and increase it's size... but we haven't even gotten that far since no one wants to sit on it. Looks cool in the picture, but looks cheap in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I purchased this chair a couple weeks ago and I wished I wouldn't have spent the money. Not worth it.

I have used a balance ball and thought owning one for a chair would be awesome but there was a major flaw with my chair and I am returning it today. The bar which is suppose to hold the ball in place comes with 4 hex nuts and they do not fit on the bar. I sent an email to Gaiam for help several days ago and they have never answered my email, I also called them and they were not helpful just basically told me to try harder to get the nuts on the bar and neither my husband or I were able to get them to go on, they are too small to fit and I find it hard to believe that anyone could get them on the bar. My experience with this company is they don't care that there is a problem with the chair. Glad that Amazon is great with returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair for the office!","review":"I'm an accountant and I sit ALL DAY! So, what better way to get in some core training than with a balance ball chair. When I initially pumped up the ball it was small and I mean very small. I let the chair sit over the weekend with as much air as I could force into it. On Monday I added a lot more air and it was just about right. Today, Tuesday I added a bit more and I cannot be more pleased. As others have said it really seems as if the ball is too small for the chair. Give it a day or two to rest, add more air and you will be amazed. Fully inflated and sitting, the balance ball touches the back of the chair as well as the front metal retainer. I bought the black chair and have not had any issues with inflation. Remember, if the concept of sitting on a balance ball for 8 hours is new to you, BEWARE! You WILL have back pain for the first few days! However, that is your body becoming stronger. Cheers to better health!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong ball!","review":"I purchased this after my coworker bought one. I got it and the bag is not the same one as hers.

When I first inflated the ball I also noticed it wasn't quite full size, but after letting it sit inflated overnight I was able to inflate it so large that it was difficult to re-seat (pun intended) into the base, and I had to let a little air out.

The pamphlet that comes with it shows a different sized chair and ball that does fit adults. This item is totally misrepresented. And a larger ball does not fit correctly on the chair base with the back in place. An adult cannot do the exercises nor sit up high enough to utilize this product as advertised.

When it came it had the small balance ball in the kit and not the medium ball which is required to properly fill out the base of the chair and give you proper height. The product picture shows the chair with the medium ball. The small ball they sent is pretty laughable. I called the customer service number I found online. I got someone in the Phillipines and we had difficulty communicating due to the accent. He told me he would send me out a new chair but when it came, it was exactly the same with a small balance ball which will not work in the chair. Now, I will have to call him back and get a return label to send the chair back. I have decided to keep the first chair since I have a medium balance ball that will work, but the price of the chair includes a ball. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny","review":"This chair is tiny, not sure who the target audience is for this product or its use.

Reality was far less appealing. First, I always felt like I ended up slouching, vice the promised good posture. While I am certain I burned extra calories during the day, fighting to stay on my chair wasn't my idea of \\"exercise\\" at all. The back on this chair, which is really a misnomer considering the fact that it doesn't function like a chair back, broke after I leaned on it... which was both difficult and uncomfortable.Best of luck to anyone that feels the need to try this.

It has two locking wheels, that I suggest you lock when getting up and sitting down, so you don't fall. The chair will roll out from under you if you don't. I learned that the hard way. I am 5' 0\\" and it is the perfect size for me. The height is not adjustable. There are some stability ball chairs that have adjustable height, but most people complain that the legs and wheels tend to break more easily. You have to use your legs and core to keep balanced, so it gives you a work out to some degree. It took me a few days to get used to it, but once I did, I will never sit in a regular office chair again. I also recommend getting a stability ball cover for the ball. Without it, it will make you sweat since the ball is rubber. You can use a towel over the ball too, but the covers are nice to have and washable if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Balanced","review":"I have some pretty serious back problems which are compounded by a 3 hour (back and forth) commute and sitting at a desk for 95% of my day.

A friend told me about the balance ball chair with casters and said it was not terribly expensive. I looked on line the very next day and ordered the chair.

After having back pain, I decided to limit the use to an hour a day & gradually build up the time. I now use it until my back, my feet or my thighs start hurting. I'm up to an hour and a half at a time after two weeks.I may be more cautious than most; I started using a balance ball for a chair two years ago & then developed plantar facitis because of the stress that I ended up unwittingly putting on my feet.I'll keep trying to build the time up, but I think there should be some warnings about taking it slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy little chair","review":"I am a teacher and my students are able to choose to sit on exercise balls during class if they wish.

It was delivered within a week and when I removed the pieces from the box, I was amazed at how quickly I was able to assemble it. The pump was fantastic and didn't wear me out before it pumped the ball sufficiently. The chair is comfortable, has good back support, is on rollers that you can lock in place and is light weight.

I tried this product during finals and it was just as hard on my back as any office chair ever was. It also hurt my hips because there was less give than if it had been placed on the ground. I tried alternating between this chair and other ones to give my back a rest and to try to adjust to hardness of the ball. It continued to pain me, so I returned it. If you're into the idea of sitting on a balance ball to improve your posture or strengthen your core, just get a big ball. This product's height is problematic because it works against all the benefits of sitting on a ball: you don't have to balance yourself and it lifts you too far off the ground (your thighs should be parallel to the ground when you sit but they can't be with this thing). Also, it looks like a cheap commode, which is kind of embarrassing to have in your workspace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not really use it","review":"I bought it because I have back problems, but it ended up filling up space and hardly ever being used. I should have known the difference between \\"I want it\\" and \\"I really need it\\". The ball deflates, one of the brakes broke off (even though it has not been used much)... I also do not like the cheap plastic finish, it clashes with my much nicer furniture.I have just sat on it to try it again, but the back support is not very comfortable and it moves if you lean on it, but I will admit that it does prevent me from slouching.Update: I have thrown the base out and kept the ball, in case I decide to sit on it one day. A lady who lives down the street picked it up and uses it as a transport for her trash can. So I guess it's useful afterall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball is too small","review":"I am in Afghanistan and ordered this chair in an attempt to help me with the back pain caused by 15-16 hour days here at work. I received the chair three days ago and unfortunately am unable to use it. The ball is half the size as the photos depicted here on Amazon and also on the box/instructions that I received. I wish I could take a photo and upload it. The instructions indicate that I was supposed to give it 24-48 hours and allow the ball to relax so I could inflate it more. I did so and it still isn't big enough to fill the space provided and therefore be used. Because I am in Afghanistan, it's not easy to just rush right down to the post office to send it back. I thought about trying to just order a replacement ball but am afraid to spend another $20-$30 and have that be a waste as well after I just wasted $80 on the chair. Highly disappointed that I have this $80 piece of junk just sitting here alongside my desk collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have yet to like a Gaiam product despite their hype","review":"I had a temporary office job where the only chairs available were these. At first I was excited because I've heard about these and very much wanted to try it. After using this product daily for 6 months you couldn't pay me to sit on one now. I soon found myself slouching worse than ever to compensate for the complete lack of back support. Just sit up straight in your normal chair and you'll be fine. Oh, and it's a cheap, plastic, poorly designed thing that should cost about $15.

The only minus is that the ball is somewhat hard to pump up to full tautness, which means that when you sit on it, the ball will sink down a little and make it lower than a standard chair.

Every pastor or lay person who has ever or will ever (think everyone) converse with a broken soul needs to read this. I would caution however that the content of this book is not for those whose souls are freshly damaged. Use wisdom with these concepts and allow some healing before imparting the hard truths of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would I worship God if He is the author of evil?","review":"Gene Edwards' description of God is very disturbing. God is not the originator of evil. Jesus' purpose for his crucifixion does not equal the \\"purpose\\" of our trials. Edwards never addresses the issue of dealing with the Christian who has wronged another person. Apparently they are not held responsible nor are there consequences for their actions. Edwards' theory is weak and is based on his own opinions and not based on sound biblical principles. This book will do more harm than good for those who are seeking answers for the hurt they have experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cake Stand!","review":"This cake stand is just beautiful!

They are very absorbent and easy to use. Great for quick changes because my son can be changed standing up. When it's really messy and he needs to lie down, the sides tear away easily.

After two days I received the replacement....but....for my surprise, it was also expired! I called amazon again and let them know my disappointment and they refund the money.

To see an author write with simplicity and clarity was a joy. Dr. Bingle's ability to relate in understandable terms the pitfalls that many people face on a daily basis provided great insight into my personal shortcomings. Often times I heard Christians blaming the devil for their problems and in reality, they should have been looking into the mirror for their problem.This book brings a spiritual reality to the arena of personal responsibility. Each person must be responsible for their actions and quit looking for an easy excuse for improper behaviors.Thank you Dr. Bingle for your tremendous insights.

I was thrilled to find that this world enchants today's youngsters. I cannot recommend this book, and, really, all of Thornton W. Burgess' books too highly.

But the book lacks imagination and excitement. It is almost weird to read. I've been reading to my little boy since he was a newborn and needless to say, he loves being read to. He knows what he likes and will pick out the book he wants me to read to him. He was intrigued by the book cover and asked me to read it to him. Not one minute into the reading, he was already picking out another book! I thought it could be the age factor so I read it to my friend's 6 year old- the result was the same! If you're looking for a good book that will capture your little one's attention and will contribute to his/her bilingual needs, this is NOT the book- However, this is my opinion, and it is not necessarily what you may experience if you were to read it to your child.I hope my review is helpful =o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"This is a great story in English or Spanish...but does an excellent job in teaching beginning Spanish words....great book!

The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that all the songs aren't written by Gary (Jules) Alexander. I wish they were. Every single song he ever wrote is pure, raw genius. Where or where is his solo effort?!Anyway, these songs are simple and yet also quite other-wordly. They are unique. The arrangements are masterful. When most people think of the Association they think of \\"Cherish\\" or \\"Windy\\" which are cheesey, poppy, gooey, pieces of musical sentimental doo-doo. This album conatins a more raw, honest sentiment. And is even radical in places. Buy it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the debut...","review":"I know the above isn't a popular sentiment by any means, but heck...I know both albums pretty well, and I think this blows away most of \\"And Then...Along Comes...\\" The good songs on that were great, as are the good songs on this, but there's less general filler, in my opinion (although No Fair At All *is* pretty lame). The import price--and lack of bonus tracks--could mean that one should wait until some domestic label inevitably reissues these albums, but if you're interested in the Association, this album, self-titled, and Birthday are the ones to get...get Along Comes Mary and Windy on a Greatest Hits disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues fans MUST own this!!!","review":"If you are a St. Louis Blues Hockey fan, then you MUST own this book.

At other stores, for just the car charger, it was more than this due pack. Not only that, but it included the plug-in for me to charge my Nano through my iTrip. I have yet to use the wall charger since I am in my car quite a bit but I love that the plug folds in. I keep it in my travel suitcase for when I know I'll need it. Amazon's free shipping was an added bonus that I just couldn't pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charging on the road","review":"I use this often and it is great. With the included mini-USB cable you can charge other things that charge from a computer's USB port and with the parts that you either plug into the wall or car power-port you can charge anything that you plug into your computer's USB port (if you have the cable).

There are over 100 pages devoted to ice creams, each taking one or two pages for the basic recipe and a number of variants; for example, the peach ice cream entry also contains recipes for peach ginger, peach macaroon, peach melba and peach thyme ice cream.

Ice Cream should be made using only fresh ingredients and only those that are necessary to make good ice cream. The addition of flour to the recipe seems unnecessary to me. I have made several batches of ice cream without adding flour and they are very good, especially the mint chocolate chip.This book is very disappointing! If I wanted unnecessary ingredients in my ice cream, I would continue to purchase my ice cream from the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must cook before making ice cream","review":"I read the reviews and many people complained about the recipes having eggs in them. I thought that I could just omit the eggs and still have good ice cream. Well, I have owned the book for over a year and have yet to make a single batch of ice cream. All ice cream recipes must be cooked in advanced and then cooled. Probably 95% of them have eggs in them. While the recipes may be delicious (I don't know), it is far too much effort for me. I exclusively use the manual that I got with my ice cream maker and have played around with that instead. The author has some great ideas for unique types of ice cream and the sugar cone recipes are interesting as well, but I'll probably just donate this unused book to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than useless","review":"This book is basically ten recipes with 'variations' (\\"Add walnuts!\\"). Instead of doing a technique section followed by individual recipies, he went crazy with cut and paste, including the same paragraphs about technique in each recipe on every single page. I don't know if this is because he's a bad writer or if the publisher was trying to pad the length and make the book appear more substantial than it is, but either way it is very annoying. There is no background whatsoever, no nice pictures or interesting sidebars, just page after page of the same recipe in the same format using the exact same sentences. Many of his recipes also produce a bad result (e.g. the green tea recipe) so I have to wonder if anyone actually tried them or if he just had a brainstorm and thoughtlessly wrote it down.Do not buy this book. It's an insult to your intelligence. You would be so much better off with \\"Everybody Loves Ice Cream\\", the Williams-Sonoma book, or the Ben & Jerry's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Kidding!","review":"I purchased \\"The Ultimate Ice Cream Book\\" due to the reviews and WOW - did the 5 star reviewers get it right!

The recipes are mouth-watering, different, and easy to follow. My only disappointment (as the book was purchased as a gift for a friend) was the quality of the paper used in its publication. It would have been helpful to know before purchase that this paperback was produced with 'rough-to-the-touch' paper, as the superb contents would have been greatly enhanced by glossy or at least smooth quality paper.

I have even purchased the extra bowls for the maker so I can be ready to begin making my own family favorites such as Green Tea Ice Cream and Creme Brulee Ice Cream.

I followed the instructions carefully and I've made ice-cream using the same machine but different recipe book with no problem but this recipe is just awful, the ice-cream tasted like bad quality butter, it was salty and the texture has a plastic chew to it... I actually bought both this book and the ultimate dessert book, really regretting it now, I will never trust these recipes again.

The latest was Raspberry Ice Cream, which was an interesting variant of technique (the egg yolks actually cook in the processor by drizzling boiling hot simple syrup over them... THEN comes the cream, etc...) -- delicious. As to reviews which bemoan the book's explanations of techniques, well, I didn't have that problem. Then again, I'm probably a fairly savvy cook, and it could be a challenge for a beginner. But in all, I give the book high marks -- every recipe in myCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Makerhas worked beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for beginners and experts","review":"Now that I own about 25 ice cream books, I can say this is one of my top two or three. What Weinstein excels at: devising the perfect base for each flavor. That is, each ice cream has just the right texture and intense flavor, based on the right ingredients and technique. Especially amazing: chocolate truffle ice cream, based on mixing custard and ganache; even more amazing with the concentrated-cabernet variation. Delicious ice creams with lots of personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"This book was recommended to us by an employee at Bed Bath and Beyond as we were purchasing an ice cream maker.

I don't have time to think ahead like that!!!!

However it was a joke. Completely worthless, it did absolutely nothing to support her when she started sitting on her own. I tossed my after about 2 uses. Your better off with the old fashioned plastic ring seats. Seriously don't waste your money. I can't imagine how anybody could find this prodcut useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a seat instead","review":"I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all! This seemed like a good idea, but my little guy was kicking and moving all over. It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath. It also says that it is for 0 months on up, but I definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than plastic","review":"I purchased this for my daughter when she out grew her baby tub. I didn't like the plastic rings because if she fell back she would get hurt. This is a very soft ring. It is definately for kids that can sit up on their own. I had other friends use this and they loved it enough that they also purchased one. It also comes with a nice hanger to hang it on the towel bar in the bath tub -- I didn't find it too heavy to hang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you want your kid to sink","review":"I've never written a negative review... if I could give this zero stars I would. First of all, it sinks the instant you put it in the tub... like all the way to the bottom of the tub. The tag says to ring it out if it sinks... hmmm... how do you do that when your kid is in it? Second of all, it weighs about 100 lbs when you take it out of the tub. I swear... this is the worst baby product I've ever owned (and I've owned a LOT)... My 6mo son sits up great on his own, was slipping and sliding around in this, falling backwards, I had to hold him the entire time with both hands... pathetic. Don't waste your money. Tomorrow we will be going out to get the traditional plastic bath seat... good grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!!! This is horrible item!!! Don't throw your money away!!!","review":"I have twins and I used this once. Thank God my mom was visiting, because we had to hold and watch each baby very close. Babies are 5 months and this pillow is not giving any support, seat is huge and it sinks. You cant even take it out of tub when is wet because is soooo heavy!!! worst item ever!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I agree this is a waste of money! It does not float like package says. It sinks immedietly. I don't see that it would work well with a sitting baby. It worked ok for in infant, just lay across like you would a boppy pillow, but it is heavy when wet and takes at least 24 hours to drip dry. I am returning mine to the store, as soon as it does dry.

Soon no ink, even pure black and white MS Word documents would not print despite what sounded like the print heads working fine.I called HP and spend 45 minutes on the phone with a tech. He was a Windows tech and could not help with a Mac running OS 10.4.10, but graciously tried. I wish he didn't. All he could do is read from HP's web site (badly) and do the obvious print head cleaning, re-seating of the cartridges, and the like. To no avail.

It would be annoying to have to put the battery on the camera everytime you wanted to use it, or have to carry the camera outside of the bag all the time (which defeats the very purpose of the bag, right?).

The badguy is *so bad*, almost from page one. He basically does everything except kick puppies for fun. I couldn't take him seriously as a real person. His notion of his own influence is also overlarge; a couple of times later in the book he executes some cunning plan (which isn't very cunning) only to have it fail, and he has no backup.I was disappointed by the heart reading, because it didn't seem to be particularly insightful. I mean, the heart readers weren't telling the people anything they didn't already know. It didn't feel like magic, it felt like pop psychology. Also, the prince who wasn't \\"pure of heart\\" was described by the heart readers basically as unable to know love, but that really doesn't fit with the novel's end.To me, it just felt like there was some gratuitous violence and no real character development.

The tweezers are the best I've ever used, the toothpick works well, and the corkscrew and screwdriver are both quite functional. If you want a nice cheap utility tool this is a pretty good deal. The bad news is that the blade does not lock open so it can be somewhat dangerous depending on how you use it. It's also not very sharp and needs to be honed when you first get it.

I was glad to try to answer questions about \\"Robocop\\" and \\"Tank Girl\\" instead of the usual \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" but I couldn't. The questions were about forgotten \\"famous lines\\" and nameless \\"starlets.\\" The instructions seemed like they were translated (poorly) from a dead language.

Willow and Spike share the cover of \\"These Our Actors\\" and I assume that the authors thought they were being clever by switching from current Sunnydale (2000) to Spike early vampire days in 1880. We learn nothing new about Willow other than she finds Spike attractive. The characterization of Buffy is insulting. The authors write her as a dumb jock who couldn't lead a flock of sheep towards the gate let alone bring the Scooby gang together to fight the Big Bad. Spike was much more interesting. Angelus helps Spike through his early vampire days and he had genuine like for old Spike. The ending was disappointing and the plot line was uninteresting and confusing.

The only downside that I can find on this LCD is it doesn't have different presets, for night use, day use, gaming, etc, which some LCDs do. Also the OSD menu is a little hard to navigate.Speakers are not very good at all, but at this price, it doesn't matter. If you want good speakers, you're going to buy speakers, not a LCD & Speaker combo unit. It's common sense.Overall, this is a 4 Star display, only because of the cons above.

This product, however-- was easy, not messy, and my under arms are smooth and clear looking. I would reccomend this to anyone that is wanting to try waxing at home. Thank you Moom! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great product. Product easily washes away with water. I did not experience the redness/bruises that I do with normal wax. Will use again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"Moom Hair Removal Kit with Tea Tree did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Do not waste your money or your time on this product. I carefully read the directions and exactly followed them, and tried again on 3 separate occasions. I don't think it even removed one hair. I can't imagine how there are any reviewers who this actually works for. This product did smell good and was not at all irritating to my skin, but it does nothing for its intended purpose. Shave, wax or save up your money for laser treatments, but don't spend it here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it doesn't work on fine hair","review":"I've now had this product for six months, and used it about six times on my eyebrows. Each time there are a good amount of hairs left over that I have to pluck. I follow the instructions to a 't', and have tried every which way to get it to work (leaving the strip on longer, using more, using less, re-doing it, rubbing the strip harder, softer, etc.,) and it DOES get rid of some hair, but definitely not all of them. The results also don't last long - two weeks max and they're all grown back. Maybe it's b/c I have fine hair, but I'm hugely disappointed. It's also kinda messy to apply ('strings' everywhere), but cleanup is easy enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Does NOT Work","review":"This is not a wax but rather a sugar-based product. It just does NOT work -- on the legs one would have to do the same spot over and over again to see any good results; and for eyebrows - simply useless: it does not pick up the tiny hair -- which is the whole point of waxing eyebrows. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most horrible product EVER","review":"Do not buy... It does not work AT ALL! I have been in the beauty industry for a LONG time and have tried several types of waxing. Thought it would work as well as NADS, was completely wrong. Doesn't even take off the fine hairs!!! VERY UNHAPPY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me..","review":"I bought this item after reading others reports who had tried it. I had been hoping to use it as an alternative to shaving. They recommended first doing it with a certain length so I let my hair grow which wasn't easy. Once I started using it, I was very displeased. It doesn't heat well at all and was very difficult to use/apply. It did remove some of the hair but left areas where it didn't. It hurt and was uncomfortable. I stopped using it after the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"grabs about 60%-70% of hair","review":"I understand why some ladies can love this, its WAY cleaner, and less irritating, then regular waxing, plus you can wash the muslin strips afterward instead of throwing them away. Honestly it doesnt work the way I want it to, there is pain of course, and the pain does not condone the results... which is not satisfactory to me. I feel as though the only parts Ill be able to use this is on my upper thigh (except where theres spider veins, they say it on there for a reason, definetly didnt follow direction spider veins more prominent now) my arms... and areas like belly button, toes, upper lip where hair is fine, WILL NOT be working with lower leg area (just cuts hair, instead of pulls) and definetly does not work at all for underarm. I am of hispanic decent, and will continue using Parissa Warm Wax instead, Im going to try Zip wax though, Parissa is messy and does irritate, but it gets the job done, just do it before bed time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is crap!","review":"I bought this product because of the good reviews and because it is natural.I opened the instructions and read them, and used the product exactly as directed. It takes like three applications to get the hair to come off and it doesnt do it thoroughly. It's messy, sticky and it doesnt work very well.Save your money and buy a wax heater and wax, not this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I received this as a gift and could tell right away that the product worked as advertised. What I like the most about this is that it is such easy clean up when you are finished and you dont have any gross residue. I can find it everywhere and know that I can quickly clean it up with water. It works really well for removing hair also. Make sure you use a thin layer, especially in the bikini area because otherwise you just waste it and it is more clean up and could be irratating. If you don't it will get stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disapointed...","review":"This did not remove hair well at all for me. I'm so disapointed! I even purchased an electric warmer to go with it, thinking I was really going to love this method. I had been using an epilator on my legs and underarms so it's not like my hair was stiff, and it is certainly not thick. I waited until the hair was long before I started using Moom but would have to apply and remove over the same area two to three times and still not remove every hair. What a shame.Toni"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT Work!","review":"It's funny, because we all read the reviews and have to take the most popular statements and decide to go for the purchase or not.These reviews seem plausible, but truth be told I was able to get maybe 50% of the hair after the second try. I followed all the instructions, and went to Mooms site and watched the video directions.If it doesn't wax all the hair it doesn't work!!! I tried my bikini, my lip hair, eye brows, no one area worked and all hair types were different.

Don't waste your time friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess to use","review":"I purchased this product with high hopes. I had tried this same type of product for unwanted facial hair before without success, but decided to give this one a try. Sadly, it does not remove the unwanted hair as advertised. It would remove the very fine hair but even with repeated uses, still did not remove the stubborn coarse hair which is always the most annoying to deal with. It is messy to work with, hard to apply, even when heated, does not spread smoothly and an all around a dud! Don't waste your hard earned cash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOOM is a great product","review":"Great product. Simple to use. Wax strips can lose their stickiness or the wax can stick to your face so much that it can cause wrinkles. Sugar works very well and, with just a little water, the sugar's removed. No problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"I tried this with high hopes that it would work for me and it did nothing but give me little red bumps on my chin and upper lip area. I had to heat it a just a bit because right out of the container it wouldn't spread at all, but heated just a bit it spread nicely. I followed the directions completely, a couple times, but it wouldn't remove the tiny hairs I have. I am not a hairy person so maybe thats the problem, you need coarser hair then what I have. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"Product was sticky and fairly messy, It didn't apply smoothly because I don't believe it was warm enough even though I followed the directions precisely. It ultimately removed about half the hairs, at best. Even upon repeated application I could not get all of the hairs as I normally would with regular wax.

I pulled the strip off and almost no hair was removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with large fabric strips","review":"Moom is a great product, have used it for years and love it. My issue is with the large fabric strips in the kit I received from Vitacost. Normally the fabric for the large and small strips is of a lightweight muslin; however, in the kit I received, the large strips are of a heavier weight muslin. When I used them, I had considerable bruising which I've never had with the lightweight strips. I spoke with the Moom company directly and they said that they still use the same fabric for both the large and small strips. To verify this, they also suggested I check out some of their kits at a local retail store. I did and found that to be true. Vitacost claims they don't know how this could be. Unfortunately, I didn't discover this problem while it was still within the guarantee time frame so I have no recourse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little tricky at first!","review":"Amazing! i have THICK COARSE facial hair and MOOM kit takes care of it! Be careful to only put a thin layer on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I hated this stuff. It was very hard to work w/. The stuff was a mess and didn't want to spread. The strips they provide are so small, it would take 100 of them to wax 1 leg. Also my hair is very course and it simply didn't work.I threw the jar out after the first attempt. Maybe the wax was old or something, but I wouldn't try it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for course hair","review":"I purchased this product hoping to switch to a less messy product. The hair on my calves is more course than the hair on my thighs, which is a problem for using this product. I used nearly every strip in the box trying to remove hair from my calves, and it removed a total of 12 hairs!! Works great on my thighs, however that is not worth the cost of this product. It does rinse completely away with soap and water and so do the strips as promised. If you have course hair, especially if you are a woman of color, this isn't for you. Sadly I will be going back to standard wax. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I tried this after reading so many great reviews, however my experience was anything but great. I should have known it was going to be bad when I couldn't get the seal off because it had stuck to the sugar. when I heated it up, it constantly went on way too thick and cooled faster than I could even spread it around. When I put the strips on, they never took all the moom or all the hair off. And it hurt like hell. My skin was raw, red, bumpy, and irritated. It also took over an hour, and the majority of the jar, to do one lower leg because I kept on having to stop and reheat it in the microwave. I could only do half of the other lower leg with what was left in the jar. This was horrible and I know now that I shouldn't trust all the good reviews I read on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This wax doesn't have a good grip of the hair. I have to use it on the same area multiple times to get rid of the hair, and my hair is not even thick. The only thing that I like about this product is the cloth that comes with it which I use it for another wax. The wax itself was not a really good one, and it gets cool down easily.

I tried a few different times, but I still wasn't happy with the results. It was painful and didn't even remove all of the hair from the few spots I tested on my legs. I also sent the company an E-mail reqesting to return it and they never wrote me back. I will never order from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy","review":"I started using this about two or three months ago, and i just love it! I don't shave at all anymore, I just use Moom. I love that it is super easy to clean up if I get it on anything (it's like cleaning up syrup, just use water). If you don't follow the directions, it won't work as well. Only microwave it 5-10 sec. at a time, apply a very thin coat, use quickly so it doesn't cool down too quick. It was super easy on the legs, armpits were very painful. I should have done smaller sections like they said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"This product is amazing.

I have been through tons of products (Nair, Gigi, Nad etc..), all unsatisfactory for my money. Either they don't work, or they cannot be taken off with hot water, or both. Plus, they have strong (and often ridiculous) perfumes, which causes me allergy.This one is much better than all the others I have tried. It works pretty well, does not irritate the skin, does not have a strong perfume, and is washable with water. It is still very expensive in comparison to my usual wax in France, but is the best I know on the US market."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTABULOUS!!","review":"This is the best hair removal product.

She has used an Epilator for years now but wanted to try something new. She said that the pain from Moom was about the same as using an Epilator. After she got done using Moom however there were no bumps or any irritation that she usually experienced with plucking. Both her and I were happy about that. :) She has used the whole 6-ounce jar, which took around a month to use. The hair grew back within 2 weeks but interestingly enough it grew back a lot thinner. She was very pleased about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at all","review":"I'm used to waxing. Have used wax, sugar based products, the whole spectrum, this really doesn't attach well at all, and you have to do each area 2-3 times before you get the desired results, which means more time, and slightly raw skin.I switched to Nair's milk & honey rollon, which is also water soluble, much better results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I don't know for other people but this product was really harsh on my skin. I tried it after carefully following the instructions. It hurt so much that I even bled a bit. This was awful for me, and If I wish to continue with this product somebody else might have to do it for me. I will not buy this product again...I'd rather shave every other day :(I gave it two stars because it actually removes all the hair (of course, if you are bad enough to yourself and pull it out quickly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is liquid....& UNRETURNABLE .. trashed","review":"When you look through the reviews all you see are the five star reviews on top- but it's the one and two star reviews that are actually helpful and TRUE. This \\"waxing\\" kit is cute, but it's LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. It's not watery liquid but it's liquid enough that when you apply it to your skin and place the cloth over it, the two things don't adhere to each other. Not to mention, unless you're a corpse your skin is warm and this thing is made mainly of sugar which liquefies even more on warm skin! At first I thought I just wasn't following the directions, but I read it, reread it, re-applied the wax over and over again, but this item is totally trash. How they have so many positive reviews I can't imagine, but it wouldn't be difficult to fake them. What a waste of ten dollars- such a scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wax formula did work like Moom Original formula","review":"I have used original Moom Wax in the past, which worked perfectly. I purchased the tea tree formula hoping it would work just as well. This wax barely removes any hair! The muslin strips just remove the wax from skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work on Fine Hair","review":"I have waxed quite a bit before. I have gotten it professionally done but I mostly do it myself. This was the most ineffective kind of wax I've used. I tried it on my legs and it only pulled out a few hairs. I am Asian so I don't really have that much body hair to remove and the hairs that I do have are extremely fine. Perhaps if you have thicker hair, it will work. If you have Asian or fine hair, you will most likely have the same results that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I followed the directions exactly and even though it removed some hairs it left A LOT and my eyebrows still look un-waxed. I am very unhappy with the results of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT Doesn't Work No way!","review":"I have had some experience doing my own waxing at home, so i wanted to try something new, well... i followed al the instructions and it just removed like 5% of my total hair!! it didn't work... i tried several times and it just didn't remove any hair!!! and watch out if you heat it too long, it might just burn your skin! literaly! i got a burn on my leg for over 2 weeks! save your money !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"I am pretty experienced with all types of hair removal, especially waxing. This product is extremely inefficient, in fact, it didn't work at all for me. Not sticky at all: I tried different temperatures, and applied different quantities - it didn't grab any hair every time. I find this really frustrating given my experience and the other reviews, so my guess is that I was sold an old wax or something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moom review","review":"I ordered moom for my daughter who suddenly had hair growth on her face and body. I had tried other facial hair removers and they actually burned her face. Looking for an alternative to tweezing, I ordered moom. A little messy and took a little bit to do it correctly, but this product works great!It's not like hot wax I've used on myself in the past. Left her skin soft and its been 2 weeks, no sign of regrowth"},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is terrible!","review":"I have no idea how this item has such great reviews. I trusted the reviews and tried the product. Since it was my first time using an at home wax (or waxing at all), I thought my first failure may have been my fault. So the following week I decided to try it again now that I had a bit more experience under my belt. This wax did not pick up anything! I tried it everywhere, bikini, legs, armpits. My hairs are very soft and thin. They are not thick, so I am not sure if this would work for someone with thick body hairs, but it definitely did not work for me. After multiple attempts, my skin was left red, raw and irritated, and yes, still hairy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perpetual Home Waxer","review":"In 16 years worth of leg waxing experience (the last 9 being 100% home waxer) I have never found a product better than Moom wax.- it smells great- heats up in 10 secs (I like to have the whole pot as a warm homogenised liquid before use)- SO incredibly easy to clean up... off legs, and strips or even that wayward drop on the floor- It doesn't hurt as much as all of the other waxing I've ever had. I really don't know why that is... but even waxing at the most painful times of the month is better- A jar lasts a long time- It doesn't leave my legs tacky or so red and irritated. You can barely even tell.Waxing at home is so efficient with Moom, I just can't understand why there are any other products left on the market anymore. (I realise I sound like a total advertisement right now - I really am just a fastidious home waxer!)Remember... the thinner you spread the better the hair removal (and the longer your jar lasts!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skin broke out horribly","review":"My skin broke out really horribly, as a result of using this product. I still have bumps. When I emailed Moom Customer Service, they did not respond. In fact, it's been more than a week since I contacted them, and I'm yet to hear from them.The skin problem aside, the product is very messy. It feels like honey, which, as you know, is sticky. And finally, this not does not remove all hair. Even with repeated use, some hair remains, which is very frustrating and annoying.Will not use again.update: Customer Support NEVER responded to my email. This predisposes me to think that their \\"money back\\" guarantee is totally bogus."},{"rating":"2","title":"I won't use anything else!","review":"Moom is by far better at removing hair than anything I've bought from the store. I bought the starter kit years ago and from then on, I only use Moom for removing hair along my bikini line. It's really easy after you get practice, the wax washes right off the strips and body with warm water and I always get great results every time I use it. I don't have to put any sort of lotions on afterwards either; I just wash off and after half a day the reddness is gone and I'm hair-free. I usually stay that way for about two weeks even though the packaging says longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough for this beginner!","review":"I have no experience with waxes or creams or any of those hair removal products other than those for shaving, and I tend to be clumsy and messy with this sort of thing, so I was a little worried about using Moom. After a couple of practice strips I found this product to be easy to use, easy to clean up, and effecient (even on my stubborn asian hair). It also didn't hurt as much as I thought it would. Finally, since the strips are durable and made of thin fabric, I could rinse each strip in a little bowl of water immediately after I used it and it would soon be dry and ready to use again or to be put away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves too much hair behind","review":"I wanted to love this stuff. It sounds wonderful! Less mess and gentler on the skin! But none of that matters if it does not actually remove all the hair. I followed the directions exactly. (No, really, I did!) I thought I might get better with practice. I tried over and over again for months. And still, it leaves behind 25%-50% of the hair on my upper lip. My hair might be slightly more tenacious than average, but not THAT much worse. The people giving this stuff rave reviews either have the wimpiest hair on the planet, or they're paid to post fake reviews. I'm asking for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Products react differently to people, so maybe my body chemistry just didn't agree with this product, but I tried several times to use the product on my legs, but maybe the hair is just to coarse for the product to handle but at any rate it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me","review":"I have tried this afew times and followed the directions. I made sure to do everything the package said and it did not take off hardly any hair. I tried it on my face, neck, bikini area, and legs. It worked ok on my face and my legs. It took some hair off my legs but only light hairs on my face but did not take hair off anywhere else. I will try again on my legs one day when I have more time. The only plus for this product is it did not bother my skin so I will try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Not Remove All Hair","review":"This product works, but it does not remove all the hair. Perhaps it's just my hair texture, because it's difficult for me to find hair removal products that work. It does get quite a bit though, and if I use the product, then shave, I have noticeably smoother legs. It's worth trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"sticky!","review":"I got this product because I am a sucker for organic products. I was very excited to use it but then the first time I put the wax in the microwave for the amount of time on the directions and the wax burned me. That wouldn't have been much of a problem since you can just put the wax in for less time. However the wax itseld was very sticky and messy and the strips did not work very well. Also it's kind of nasty to wash the strips each time because you're supposed to soak them in water and all the water and wax comes off. I prefer the strips that already have wax on them, they are much easier to use and way more effective!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very painful compared to wax, and doesnt work as well.","review":"I bought this thinking it would be very similar to wax, removing the hair with not too terribly much pain. When I tried it out it had the complete opposite effect, this does not remove the hair very well and is VERY PAINFUL. Yes, this product is natural, but its no fun to bleed copious amounts every time you wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"fail","review":"the product didn't work waste of my money. wish i had saved the money instead of spending it on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I followed the instructions to the letter, and while it was undeniably easier to clean up, when I pulled off the strip I found a strip full of moom, and all the hair still on my skin.I tried this multiple times with thinner applications of Moom, and different/smaller areas of skin. No luck. This went in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moom---30-day guarantee inaccurate, and truly difficult to use","review":"This sounded to good to be true. it is extremely difficult to use alone,m effectively. Unless you have someone you really want to see your most intimate parts, and that, for me is not going to happen..somethings are better left unshown.A PROFESSIONAL WAXER DOES A MUCH MORE THOROUGH JOB AND WITHOUT THE INCREDIBLY MESSY AND INCONSISTENT EFFECTS.Due to a very understandable no return policy on Amazon for this product, I went to Moom itself to get info on shipping it back. The costs for me to absorb for shipping and offering only a fraction of what I paid to do so, meant I would literally take a LOSS financially.Amazon is amazing - truly. But from my standpoint, Moom (and likely many other home waxing kits are simply not worth the time, mess, and poor results -- beware--you lose $$$ when trying this at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like Crude oil Do Not Buy","review":"I ignored other reviews that referred to this smell problem, thinking that there are people on the Internet community that just are complainers.OK, add me to the list, I have had this ball for 60 days, I have washed it with warm water and soup, I have left it outside under the sun to get rid of the smell to no avail. My purpose for writing this review is for you the reader to take the review feed back seriously. I take a lose on this one. Amazon is not at fault here, this is just a poor Chinese manufactured product. I bet Amazon would have taken it back, had I not ignored my own judgment. What a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for, a medicine ball with a handle and it was so much more reasonably priced than the others I found. My only critique is that it has a very strong odor of industrial plastic...hopefully that will go away with time...otherwise perfect and does the job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good ab tool","review":"I bought this ball for quick ab work-outs in the mornings before work. The beginner workout is plenty to get me going and tighten my abs. It's simple and compact enough to keep handy and not take a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Ball","review":"Have had the ball for a month and it still smells as awful as the day when I opened the box. I don't think the smell will go away unfortunately. Strong rubber smell that's hard to ignore when you're trying to work out. Video tape is ok--nothing special. I think I wasted money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"The ball is very oily and after a month it still has that oily smell and feel to it. I have a wooden floor and it leaves oily spots on the floor, which can be very slippery if you don't clean it right away.The workout dvd has a decent workout (the advanced one I'm talking about, they beginner's workout is hardly a challenge after a couple of times)."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last","review":"I purchased this a few years ago from gaiam. It was great for a couple of years. I rarely used the video and just did my own collection of moves, mostly situps and upper body raises to work on abs. The seam has now completely separated along one side, so it completely is deflated and no longer useful. Now I am online searching for another brand and thought I would post a review here.

The two prior reviews couldn't be more WRONG! This guide has tons of color pictures of collectible CDS and information on just about every aspect of the compact disc and CD collecting. The book also has a huge listing of collectible CDs from around the world (more so than most record guides). This is a book that I have read over and over again and always find something new. I give this book five stars and is a must for every CD collector. (Plus it only cost me the same as a CD.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall source available","review":"Because of cd collecting being relatively new there hasn't been an established price guide so some pricing may be off. However this guide cotains a great deal of cd information and goes a long way in identifying rare and collectable cd's. When I first purchased this book about 6 years ago I wasn't even aware of collectable cd's. Since then I found countless rare and valuable cd's in used cd bins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Guide -- and the only one out there","review":"Admittedly, some of the pricing is way off and could use a refresh. But this field of collecting is so new (even the author points that out) that it is very difficult to establish pricing. For overall layout and identification of early CD's, there is simply no other guide out there. Great coverage of things like the \\"Edison Sampler\\", which was the first compact disc ever pressed in the U.S. As a bonus, Laser Discs are covered as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible resource!","review":"This book contains an extremely detailed history of digital media. The listings are out of date but the information contained in the first half of the book MORE than makes up for this shortcoming. Anyone interested in collecting cds NEEDS a copy of this book. Because of the date of publication, the prices need to be reviewed. There is however much information about the technology that is not covered well elsewhere therefore it would also be useful for students of history and technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as I expected it might be.","review":"Aside from the numerous errors and inaccuracies I found just skimming through the book, I found that it lacked information that might be useful to collectors who wanted to know about dealers and internet sites that specialize in the kinds of CDs found in the book. Their much touted web site proved to be a wild goose chase too. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"informative, but lacks listing information","review":"for the curious CD collector, a nice book to read. however, for the collector, you will not find accurate values, and the listings are lacking severely. there are complete band discographies not listed. more than half of my rare CD collection is not found in this book, and many, many titles are very well known. on the other hand, if you want to see some nice shots of promo, press kits, and limited CDs, there are some good ones here. also, CD technology, care, specifications, and history, also a good source. but im sorry, for identifying, and pricing....not a chance this book will be of much use to you. this book should be retitled not to include \\"price guide\\". decide what information you need before you buy this one, i wish i hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life With Elizabeth, Volume 3","review":"I have been in contact with Amazon.com about removing their recommendation to buy Life With Elizabeth, Volumes 3 and 4 if you have already bought volumes 1 and 2.

Could only use the speakerphone if all other phones in house were on hook. If even one other phone on hook and the volume on the speaker was so low that you could not carry on a conversation (even with volune on high).2. The hook-flash mechanism jammed. The phone was thus always on hook. This was after only 2 months of use.Save yourself the aggravation; stay away from GE phones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One fatal flaw","review":"I bought this inexpensive phone and thought I'd found a great value. The speaker worked very well. Then I dicovered that the phone would pick up a local radio station. Specifically, it was something about the way the phone base interacted with the handset and handset cord. The longer the cord was stretched, the better the reception! A second phone of the same model did the same thing. I tried using the handset and cord from a different model, but it still did the same thing. Disconnecting the handset elliminates the problem, but who wants a phone without a handset? Since the main reason I wanted a speaker phone is for those pesky times I'm put on hold, this inadvertant radio reception is a double whammy. If I'm on hold and somehow get cut off, I don't want to be hearing a local radio station and mistake it for on-hold-muzak. The engineers should have caught this one. Back she goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent phone, speaker and otherwise","review":"Both the speakerphone option and regular phone options work well on this phone.

This revised edition expands upon the original version of Civil War in the Ozarks with many more pages of fascinating details and scores of real-life colorful characters involved (many of whom will be a surprise). The accounts of each battle and what happened in between make you realize just how important this region of America was during this time and the impact it had over the entire war. One of the greatest things about this particular book on this subject is that it is very readable for adolescents to adults, letting everybody learn and enjoy American history in a way that's not dull. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Overview","review":"Disappointing. Well-written overview but not enough specific information. I had hoped for so much more.

For starters the character names are so ridiculus that I had a hard time getting past that . Next there is no plot to speak of and the characters are completely 1 dimensional. Half way through the book you dont know anything to speak of about them and frankly you dont care. Please dont waste your time or money with this book. Norah Hess has some wonderful books out there unfortunetly this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Hess's best","review":"This book actually has no plot, no suspense, and very poorly written. The outcome of each situation is so predictable as to delete any interest you may have. Storm and Flame have very little repore' and very little interaction. Then there is Shilo and Little Bird. One minute he hates her and the next he's crazy about her. When Shilo and Flame try to make Shilo and Little Bird jealous we never find out if Storm every actually understands what they were plotting.

Whenever my daughter and I want a good pants-peeing laugh we go straight to the library for Norah Hess books.

Wonder who her editor was?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover is the Best Part","review":"The uninspired names of the main characters give the first clues about the writing level of this book. Stone and Flame are our hero and heroine, Rebel and Lady are their horses, and Shilo and Moonlight are their Indian friends. A litany of other simply-named-simply-drawn characters also appear, bobbing in and out of a meandering and whatever plot.This author may have more of a career writing for preteens with this elementary style of story telling. Just take out the sex. For adults, it's virtually unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Having read and enjoyed all of Norah Hess's previous novels, I had a difficult time believing this was written by the same author. It read like a first novel by a not very talented author. The characters lacked proper developement and while the story line had great potential it was more like reading the first draft or outline for a potentially great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jenny, one Lucky Girl","review":"This is a tale of mystery and suspense. The main character is well developed and the plot is well constructed, RTC is good at leaving the reader guessing while suplying a healthy load of information. I admire the author's ability to construct strong visual descriptions and with her depictions of the character's emotions she really brings any story she writes alive.This is a particular favorite of mine because of the obsure and fascinating subject matter. Silent Stalker is a well written story about a teen age girl coming to terms with her family and herself. Experience her terror as she goes on an adventure with her neglectful father and stays in an ancient castle with many secret passages that lead to all kinds of horrifyingly good and romantic trouble.

I can not stress how unbelievably talented each member of this band are. These are their earliest recordings that I know of. It reminds me of a huge blast or a sonic boom right in your face. Skinning Pit is my favorite on here, the guitar playing is amazing. I would highly recommend this album along with Nurse, Troublegum, and Infernal Love. Each one is different musically but none the less intense and aggressive.

Just exactly what does it have to do with manhood? Is it a coming of age story? Is it a comedy? Some of the characters are so over the top they border on unbelievability, unless this is just a tongue-in-cheek approach. But the movie eventually hopscotches into some not-funny drama, carrying a sense of urgency that begins to endear us to some of the characters. Then out of the blue, the movie lurches into tragedy, not well placed nor well explained. I know a movie can portray a number of different themes, but this one is not done well. And that's too bad, because there is the possibility of a story here. It's just not executed well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad piece of dookie","review":"If this is what manhood is all about, I think it's time to rethink our existance on this planet.

That's all.Bill Doolittle"},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for the audio cds","review":"I borrowed these cds from the library because I'm interested in corporate governance and case studies. I'm not an expert on Enron, but this felt like fiction from the first couple of minutes. When the narrator speaks for Ken Lay, he uses a deep, fatherly voice. Andy Fastow's voice is whiny and child-like. Its content is obviously biased and selective. So from a factual standpoint, I'm not learning a heck of a lot.As fiction, it's way too long at 25 cds; should be abridged by about 2/3. There's just not that much content, and it's often painful to listen to. If I didn't have a one-hour commute to fill, I'd have given up on it hours ago.I highly recommend The Smartest Guys in the Room instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only fools are those who believe this book is accurate!","review":"I hope Ken Lay gives Kurt Eichenwald a share of his proceeds, because it is clear Ken wrote this favorable bull@#$% and Kurt merely signed his name.

This one seems to take great pains to exonerate Ken Lay. Everything is someone else's fault.There is a lot of interesting and factual information here, but most of it seems twisted to protect Ken Lay and lay all the blame on Andy Fastow. While Fastow is certainly a crook, the main problem with Enron was not the end-stage shenanigans, but the way the company was run, the way commissions and bonuses were paid for lousy deals, Enron's system of robbing California and other states of billions of dollars, that really caused the problems. Ken Lay ran Enron the way George Bush ran the US economy, and got similar results. (It didn't help that Lay/Enron was Bush's biggest financial backer since the early 1990's, either.)[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"This is a great Enron book---I couldn't put it down.

Just don't make this your only Enron read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corrupt Corporate America","review":"This book is very well written. Since it is true, and the author did extensive, in-depth, research, the story envelopes you.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great business book","review":"I could not sleep. I could not eat. I could not think. I became obsessed with this book. Yes, we know the ending. Yes, he clearly talked to Skilling and Lay, and had to give their side of the story due. What he has done is to unravel the myth that smart people make great decisions. He shows that in fact Skilling created a culture and perhaps even more where fraud, deception and deceipt became the norm. He shows that Enron was a monumental testament to stupidity and greed. He shows how a culture of greed destroyed transforms a company. It is an epic story. I also liked that he stayed on message and did not go off searching the purient side of things. He stayed focused and wrote one of the most exceptional business books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Best investigative & literary journalism piece I've ever read.

Both books are very complete in telling a historic story without the histrionics attached to the event. Absolutely fascinating books. While they tell the same story, there are differences in deatails prsented. Both are written by professional journalists in very good narrative; they seem to tell a story by presenting the facts, and without hyped-up excitement.Since both books are long (over 600 pages), I found that I read them in record time.

What a blast of a read (tragic story though). After reading the book I became so interested in the Enron debacle, that I actually skipped class and drove to houston (two years ago) to watch Fastow get cross-examined during Skilling and Lay's trial.So yes I fully reccomend and endorse this book.

The parts are snap together making it easy to assemble but the kit itself only comes in four colors: white, grey, midnight blue, and a light almost turquoish blue. So to make it look right it does require some painting.

Here's my review as a hobbyist.The pictures of the model you get are very nice and show very good craftsmanship, but the amount of effort required to even get similar results is too much. Some parts are loose and one instance is that the upper arm piece did not fit the elbow joint in the forearm, the opening is too big so the arm simply falls out. The model isn't the same colors as the display pictures or box art, so you need to do some painting, a LOT of it. The model requires a lot of touch up, and you shouldn't use the stickers, unless you just want to build the model, just for the sake of putting it together. Again in my cast the model won't even be complete unless I glue the arm in, or do some extensive fixes.

One Man Force was extremely similar, and in fact I found it difficult to decide which of the two efforts made it to the far end of movie execrability, but finally decided that Hangmen just had the edge on OMF, because the plot, or non-plot, of OMF was almost comprehensible, unlike the plot of Hangmen. Also, the star, J.Matuszak, under expert direction, could almost be envisaged playing the Incredible Hulk, with or without green paint. His character had motivation.

This Film does an outstanding job of explaining how the Japanese Army changed from a good solid outfit to one of the worst things to hit Asia since the Mongols Wars of the Middle Ages. The use of Survivors interviews and the very scary interviews of Japanese Veterans was highly effective. I was also very impressed with the additions of films on the British/Indian Army and its mighty efforts. They also did not shy away from the Renegade INF Army which I thought took some guts to tell. Also kudos toward the short section on the extremely brutal Burma Campaign.

And get much worse. Not quite up to the Coen brothers, but a lot funnier than most alleged comedies.

Travolta is hilarious as a loveable, small-town star weatherman in Harrisburg, PA. He wants to make the big time as a game show host and will do anything to get there --- including an attempt to fix the Pennsylvania Lottery. By the way, what makes this film's plot quasi-believable is that a similar event did occur in Pittsburgh in 1980. Lucky Numbers is set in Harrisburg in 1988. The film has a great late 80's soundtrack and sharp, crisp, funny dialogue. Travolta makes the weatherman's mishaps funny and visceral - you can feel his conflict as he gets drawn deeper into the Lotto fix. He's redeemed in the end in a surprise ending and that is what this film deserves --- a happy ending with a comic twist.

While race does not exist, according to Graves, and humans don't have separate genetic lines of descent, The Race Myth: Why We Pretend Race Exists In America explores why modern definitions of race are wrong, and how they can be overcome. Racism as social invention, not biology reality, is explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science and Tunnel Vision Too.","review":"Fast, easy, not-too-techincal read.The Title is misleading. The book is about race. It is a political screed the basis of which is that racial differences in the U.S. are cultural and not genetic.The author presents scientific evidence that there is little racial difference in DNA from one race to another to show that all races have more in common than they have differences.The book moves from science to an attack on Europeans. According to Graves, Europeans are subjugators of others. Those Anglo-Saxon males seem to be the worst! Graves conveniently forgets some non-Europeans who have not done too poorly when it comes to subjugation: Ghenghis Kahn, Mao Tse Dong, Hirohito, and Pol Pot come immediately to mind. Even some Africans have done their part: Idi Amin, Sani Abacha, Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and Zimbabwe's own Robert Mugabe, who is now \\"cleaning out the trash.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the rest of the world?","review":"If race is a hoax, it has taken in all people of every recorded epoch, from Herodotus down to ourselves. It is not simply America, nor is it recent. A focus on our society in our century is far too myopic.Graves has drawn on good sources. He has drawn somewhat different conclusions than writers whom he cites, such as Cavalli-Sforza. His book would be better if the bibliography were better ordered. Along with Cavalli-Sforza he might have mentioned Spencer Wells' \\"The Journey of man.\\"The book is flawed by a number of non sequiturs. Graves develops towards a point in a logical sequence of ironclad and well supported steps, then ventures one step beyond into thin air with no support whatsoever.

The rpint is big, it sort of looks like it was self-printed, and it has little research to back up what it says. It offers idyllic, utopian notions of what teaching \\"should\\" be. It doesn't ground itself in the real world, and the only saving grace is that the author admits that many of his ideas are more ideal than realistic. He occasionally uses phrases like \\"I would be willing to bet...\\", as if somehow making guesses based on personal preferences counts as quality educational theory. There's nothing new offered by this book; it's the same issues being rehashed by another author. It's not that the ideas are bad, it's just that there's nothing here that will surprise any teacher with more than a week's worth of experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and too idealistic blah blah blah","review":"If you're an education student or already a teacher this book is mildly inspiring, however it does not offer anything you haven't already heard or read.

The bulk of the author's career is as a school principal (he only taught for a couple years) so the text is written from an administrator's point of view, therefore there are idealistic philosophies and it lacks applicable classroom strategies or solid case scenarios.

This collection of \\"motivational\\" anecdotes serves simply to reenforce the idea that teaching is an anti-intellectual profession.

Then there are some other French arias that have never been sung as well -- one from Castor et Pollux, another fromRichard Coeur de Lion, and the sleep aria from La Muette de Portici -- Gedda is inmuch better voice than when he recorded the complete opera, maybe ten years later.So a must for lovers of French opera and song -- no texts but you hardly need them--gedda's pronunciation is near perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD THIS BE JACK PALANCE'S WORSE FILM?","review":"This appears to be a bad knock-off of a gangster film.

No where on the online discription of the product does it state this.

This is important because the TiVo Series 1 lacks a network card -- it needs access to a standard phone line. I didn't relish drilling holes and running RJ45 all over the house just to support my TiVo, so I went looking for a wireless phone jack system instead. I bought one of these RCA 926 systems, and it worked brilliantly for about two weeks, and then failed entirely. As far as I can tell, the base station has ceased to transmit, so it's useless. I've gone for the RTX DualJack product instead, which is slightly more expensive but seems to get much better reviews.

The definition of H E L L is being strapped to a chair for an eternity to watch this garbage over and over again.

Just because it is impressive for something made so cheaply doesn't mean it's actually worth watching if you want to see an actually well-made movie. It is creepy, but I had guessed the whole stupid plot by 10 minutes in. So all the crazy flashbacks were just annoying to me, & not as confusing and ridiculous as they were for my friend.I LOVE indie film when it doesn't stink. I hated this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Women Voices","review":"This book is a collection of women poets whose work developed within an all female workshop meeting for a consistent period of time. The books presents not only their work in their completed poems, but their experiences of how their poetry and their lives were changed by their intense communication and reciprical support within the workshop setting. Very different voices emerge in this text, some witty, some ghosts from the past, some haunted or haunting. Overall, the work in this book is very strong. All the women have carved out their own styles, so it's interesting to hear in their own voices how their peers helped them come to these final poems. Anyone interested in writing in groups or starting a workshop should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these glasses","review":"This is the third pair of Maui Jim sunglasses I have owned and I will never buy another brand. These glasses fit great; very snug, comfortable to wear running and other activities. Absolutely great sun protection and stylish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glasses, terrible case","review":"This is the third pair of these same glasses that we have purchased in the last 2 years (one pair was lost). They are crazy cool. We wore them on a cruise and were awed by how they cut sun glare on the ocean. The thin glass lenses are top notch and the whole pair is very light and easy to wear for long periods. This product would rate an unconditional 5 stars if not for the case. All 3 have been exactly the same - the threads that hold the zipper in place unravel constantly causing the zipper to get stuck at any place along the length. Constant trimming and zipper wax help but sunglasses in this price range should come with a decent case. One of the original cases lasted about 3 weeks until the zipper head just came off the zipper altogether. And it would be a good case if not for the shoddily made zipper. Great glasses from Italy; junky case from China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stingrays","review":"I really like the style of these glasses. The lenses are good quality and the fit is supurb.

The plot is far too easy - any kind of rhyme works exactly what the guy wanted to happen, except in one case, when the oversight he made *helped* him. Convenient, eh? Then there's the cheesy and poorly developed romance subplot. If you could suspend disbelief to ignore all the easy solutions and plot oversights, the book would be interesting enough, but I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone who likes *real* fantasy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light entertainment","review":"A university student from 1980s Earth is sent into a fantasy world, where he finds himself its most powerful wizard and must quickly adapt to the role. This world is build on an alternative reality concept: a medieval Europe where magic is worked by reciting poetry. Naturally the hero's vast knowledge of Shakespeare et al. comes in handy.Had I taken the book too seriously, I would have been disappointed with magic where any rhyme will do and always works according to plan. The book could have been much shorter if the hero had simply said 'Yawn, yawn, evil's gone'. Fortunately the magic doesn't get overly abused. The battles involving magic were great, it's only the rules that need adjusting.Stasheff is clearly a talented and well studied author. He's a bit too heavy on the religious angle, but that aside if you're looking for a read to just relax and have fun, this will do nicely.[ Similar (and better): Terry Brooks, \\"Magic Kingdom For Sale - Sold\\" ]"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Surprised Me","review":"When I bought this book I expected a farcical fantasy adventure, perhaps something along the lines of Robert Asprin's \\"Myth Adventures\\" series. What I got instead was an intelligent approach to portraying a truly medieval fantasy setting, complete with churches, priesthood, sacraments and powerful symbols, all laden with magic. While the romantic thread through the story felt a little forced, the character development otherwise was fairly deep. Of particular interest to me was how he dealt with the underlying humanity of the \\"evil races\\" and their potential for redemption. In fact, aside from the sorcerer of the story, all are presented as redeemable. This is something lacking from many novels across numerous genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"What I can say about this book?

Alot of background history was given, that in the long run was needed to get the overall affect. But being inpatient as I am, I wanted it to hurry up and \\"be good\\". It was, at long last, a very good mystery. The person (or persons) that I thought had actually committed the murder were not the guilty parties at all. The actual murderer was a complete surprise.

It shows how the seven seals in the Book of Revelation symbolize the seven spiritual centers (chakras) of the human body and how they are related to astrology.The chapter called \\"Edgar Cayce: American Psychic\\" is a good way to introduce someone to Edgar Cayce. It includes one of the best astrological profiles of Edgar Cayce that I've ever read.The chapter called \\"Seven Keys to the Soul\\" is the heart of the book.

Falconer's trademark black and white drawings, highlighted with splashes of red are engaging, and Olivia's personality and sense of style always shines through.

Ya gotta do it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Have bought all the Jake Adams novels to date and EVERY one is a great read! Thank You Trevor. Now I'm off to try the rest of your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in writing failed fiction","review":"Unfortunately, Trevor Scott attempted to use the ingenious style of Tom Clancy in writing a complex international intrigue spanning several characters scattered throughout a multitude of countries. Somewhere in the process he lost his focus on the plot. Good guys and bad guys pop up like targets at a shooting gallery. The plot is lost in the mesh of characters that don't seem to remember which side they are on. The characters are lost in their lack of clear identity with the plot.So, all-in-all, I, as the reader, was simply unable to follow who was after what; I kept hoping that that the story would resolve some of the confusion as it went. Instead, to the last page I never found out who \\"won,\\" and who \\"lost,\\" nor what they gained by the entire saga.....and ultimately, I did not care.Find another book. This one is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this book???","review":"The overall story was, as many have said, fairly one deminsional. Its not difficult to see what is coming, where the story is going, and what exactly is going to happen. That being said, it wasn't an aweful story to read. I did read it through to the end, so that has to say something.My major qualm with this book was the seemingly arbitrary punctuation. Primarily the use of exclaimation points. They seem to crop up at very unordinary and irrational points throughout the reading. It made it borderline painful to read. I really wonder what the hell the editors were thinking when they allowed this to go to publication with this seemingly basic \\"mistake.\\"For a dollar, not bad buy, but there are definitely better books out there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Loved the story, kept me wantng to finish so I would know what happened! Jake Adams is a good character"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh.......okay I guess.","review":"Found several places in the book where a sentence was lost from one page to the next. It would not be completed and another would start. Plot was scattered all over the place. Action was to slow for my taste. Found I had to force myself to finish the book. It became more of a chore than enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"This is not a good read. The characters are very one-dimensional, the writing is average at best and, most unforgivable of all, the story is boring. To call this book a \\"thriller\\" is totally inaccurate. There was nothing - and I mean nothing - thrilling about Fatal Network. I would recommend avoiding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I found this book to be very interesting and informative....and it is always interesting to find out (possibly) what really happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"I was required to read most of this book for grad work in Urban Education. Interesting material (for a required reading). The best of the books I've been required to read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you think?","review":"This is one of those books that your liberal arts elective class requires you to read. I have to say that this book is ok but not inspiring enough for me to get up and do something about immigration. This is one of those topics that people are passionate about but I just didn't read it in this book enough to get me into action."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful product!","review":"I should have known better since I saw the other negative reviews before I purchased this toaster. But after looking at various other toasters, it seemed as though all of them were more or less despised by the review writers. So, thinking the reviewers must be just natural born complainers, I went ahead and bought it anyway - twice. The first one toasted only on one side. The second one would not keep the toast down without holding the lever. Both failed to brown the toast on any setting below 10 (the highest setting). So I returned both of them and gave up.KitchenAid seems to have no quality control whatever! (They could learn something from Amazon.com, which was pleasant and helpful throughout the ordeal.) I certainly won't be purchasing any more of their appliances. For those of you reading this and thinking I'm a complaining kook, think again. All these negative reviews are accurate. This toaster is a piece of junk. If you buy it, be prepared to be toastless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I own a KitchenAid Mixer, Food Processor & Blender. I figured the toaster would the perfect addition. So far I have been extremely disappointed. Even at the setting 9, the toast isn't done. It takes at least two cycles. I also have had problems with the edges being burnt. I know it's only toast, but geez for $90 you wouldn't think you would have to worry. Also disappointed in the size of the slots. I think this may go into the appliance graveyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"High on features, low on quality.","review":"Good: The digital display and defrosting features are nice. The cord wraps up nicely under the unit as well.Bad: Plastic case feels cheap. Lifting mechanism feels cheap. Mine doesn't lift food all the way up when done. Manual lifting is required as the automatic mechanism only \\"pops\\" the lift up about 1 inch. Slots are not long enough to accomodate two pieces of wide sourdough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This TOASTER STINKS","review":"This toaster is awful!!! I would rate it 0 stars if I could. It has major variations in the toasting. One side will be barely toasted, the other side will vary from light brown to burnt! I'm not exaggerating. According to KitchenAid, it's not supposed to work this way and there is nothing I'm doing wrong. KitchenAid has been nice enough to replace the toaster a number of times. All of the toasters so far, have worked the same way more or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"two slice toaster","review":"Purchased aver a year ago. works great simle and easy to clean very happy with purchase. Was quite hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen$$Aid","review":"Too much money for a two slice toaster that toasts unevenly and always needs a little more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't a toaster toast?","review":"I bought this to replace a similar Panasonic model. My Panasonic cannot get toast dark enough in one \\"cycle\\" and is inconsistant from cycle to cycle. On the darkest setting \\"9\\" this toaster barely browns the toast and a second cycle is required -- I already had a toaster that could do that!!! Don't fall for the hype like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the performance I would expect for the price","review":"I purchased this toaster because I needed one that was narrow and because it had received good reviews. Although it's adequate, it's certainly no marvel. It browns toast irregularly - the top of the slice gets brown while the bottom remains untoasted - and the settings seem inadequate. If I place a thin slice of bread in the slot, it does not get reasonably toasted even if I put the machine on its highest setting. I don't have any other complaints. It's certainly a satisfactory unit, but nothing I would recommend or purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bad toaster","review":"Bought one, didn't work, sent it back. Got the second one, and it toasted half the bread on one side, and not the bread closest to the end of the toaster. Really poorly made!! They offered me a buy back. I replaced it with the cuisinart toaster which works very well. What a disappointment. I have several kitchenaid appliances, including my stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen Aid KTT460WT 2-slice tpaster","review":"Very poor performance. Does not toast evenly. Very disappointed in this product. Would never buy one again. Warming Bagel function is the only part of this toaster that is worth while. So, if you only warm bagels, it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks aren't everything...","review":"I loved the look and the profile suited my counter space well. I also liked the controls and digital setting display. But what I did not like, he-l-l-o, two slices of supermarket type bread did not fit in the single slot. When I turned them on their side they stuck out of the top. What is that about, not much use to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only If","review":"This would be a great product only if it did what it promised. IT DON'T! Memory, HUH! It will not give uniform results. The settings are not close enough. But, the worst is you never know how the toast will come out. When it does give you the shade you want the setting will be up around 7-8, but, sometimes it will come out too light. So, you have to plunge the toast down again and manually stop it. The most uniform results come when you set it around 3-4, and, as a matter of course do it twice at that setting. Great idea, lousy execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witches & spells!!","review":"An engaging story, the heroin is strong & magical. The story is original & light. This book follows Gaultry -the Glamour/Witch- in her fight to free Teilmark from The Bissanty Empire's clutches. You get to know more about Bissanty & the way the people live & feel. I was intrigued by the religion they follow. I still want to know more about Mervion, Gaultry's sister & Martin.My only remark is that sometimes Ms. Reimaan writing is a little distracting, like she is trying a little too hard to convey a thought or describe a scene.All in all a very good story. Thank you Ms. Reimann. Can't wait to read the 3rd book.Get it & READ IT!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book, just waiting for the third","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading the adventures of Gaultry and her companions.... once i had finished the two books in the series i just wanted to read more- there are so many questions i have about the characters. Katya really brought life to her book, to her story but i urge her to write the third book- i'm waiting with others to find out how Gaulrty lives the rest of her life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical envelopes","review":"I found the envelopes typical of what I usually buy. Not to thin... just about the same as always. Has a tab in back to lock the flap in place. Not sure if this is a plus or a minus. It prevents the flap from opening by itself somewhat, but also may allow dust particles in when utilized. Also if the tab is easily torn off, it will expose the surface of the disk to potential scratches. So far, so good for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"There's little to say about a flimsy paper sleeve. It's the flimsiest of them all. Just don't buy these. They're flimsy. They wrinkle by themselves. And one last thing, They're flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Great Album !!!","review":"The newest ARP album, and one of the better ones. Its not full of amazing catchy tunes like some of the older ones, but its still up there. Legions Of Hell and Sea Of Evil are each over 8 minutes long and are great songs. My favorite on this album is Forever Angel, its almost a power ballad, just a great song by Axel and Johnny on the vocals. Overall this album could have been better and really deserves a 3 rating, but since I love ARP im giving it a 4.For anyone who likes ARP this is a great album, for those who dont, get out there and listen to the other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nature's Three","review":"This is a great fiber supplement. It has a pleasant apple taste and works well. It is easy to prepare and the container is easy to open and store."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to read","review":"Vamped was a fun read, includes a lot of detail without bogging down the reader. The characters and the story evolve in ways you don't expect. It's a fresh take on the vampire genre and one that I'm eagerly recommending to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this book sucked (heh).","review":"If the Lifetime channel went out one night, and you were in desperate need for a heartwarming father daughter tale, here is where you would look. If you were looking for a dark, wry look at a world of modern vampires, please keep on walking. This is book has the fuzzy light on it the whole way through, and there are so many intelligent questions that go unanswered- for example: A mortal child, alone in a world of only vampires, and no one is even going to try forcibly abduct her? Puh-leeze.It's a sweet book if you're a goth father with a daughter, maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and strange","review":"Just like he did in \\"Rapture\\", David Sosnowski shows that he has an eye for the hilarious details that make absurd situations seem mundane. This novel actually bears a lot in common with \\"Rapture\\": The protagonist is an alienated citizen living in a world he helped create, who rediscovers his humanity by connecting with someone equally isolated. But this time, it's vampires, and they've taken over the planet.So, yeah, \\"Vamped\\" made me laugh a lot. And there were sections that were genuinely moving. But still, it could have been a little better. Things go a little too easy for Martin and Isuzu (the main characters) at very convenient times. And, frankly, I wonder if Martin has really learned what he's supposed to by the end.Still, the book is HIGHLY original and extremely funny. I waited years for David Sosnowski to finally get to follow up \\"Rapture\\", and I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story...","review":"One of the better vampire novels I have read lately. Usually when I choose to read a vampire novel it is one that borders on horror, such as Anne Rice or the absolutely divine Anita Blake series by Laurell K Hamilton. I read about this one in Time Out New York magazine, gave it a spin and was very glad that I did. This novel is so sweet in places it will hurt your teeth, and so touching in others that it will tug your heart strings. Definately a good 'weekend read'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much mental contemplation for a vampire that isn't human","review":"I saw this book in Barnes and Noble and was captivated by the cover. It seemed interesting even when i read a couple of line from the first chapter. But after having read 71 pages, I just can't get into this book. It is well written, but at the same time, he just thinks too much. Every second flashing back to memory because of the present. Also housing a little human girl for the sake that he might still be human or have some shred of humanity seems dumb. I just can't read anymore, for me there's nothing to keep going on with him and little Isuzu Trooper Cassidy. What a shame how I had hopes for this book. I have never really given up on a book so quick, shame to say this is my first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholic Vampires!","review":"How much more awful is it when an author whose previous novel you've loved writes tripe like this? This book was stultifyingly dull with occasional humor in the background. Not recommended. Try RAPTURE instead. Or try anything else, either. This is an overlit half hour television sitcom padded out to almost FOUR HUNDRED PAGES! Now THAT is HORROR! And ETERNITY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book just plain stuck, sucked, boooooooooooring. Thankful for me I got it from the library and didnt spend a dime on it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was shocked","review":"The book drips (no pun intended) with anti-Christianity, and anti-Catholicism in particular. Really, I find it amazing that people put up, or enjoy this kind of trash from Mr. David Sosnowsky. It's offensive, to the point of being unkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great twist on an old tail!","review":"I just loved this book. Anyone who likes their horror fiction firmly rooted in 'reality' should enjoy it. The characters are a little 2D but you don't care as the story grabs you and takes you on a great ride. The premise is clever and a great twist on the legend for anyone jaded by all the hackneyed re-hashes out there.Now that they've made \\"Vampire$\\" into a movie I hope Shapes isn't too far behind (especially now that effects technology is at the required level)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's cat goes nuts of these treats","review":"My daughter's cat Mattie loves Kitty Kaviar. Mattie is a big lovable Maine Coon cat. Mattie sure loves to eat, but finding food/treats that Mattie is willing to eat is a Herculean task. Mattie is one finicky eater, but one whiff of Kitty Kaviar and Mattie's tail shoots straight up. He immediately runs over when he sees the Kitty Kaviar can. On top of that, Kitty Kaviar is healthy and nutritious. Kitty Kaviar is the best cat treat that I've ever purchased. In the end, I bought six cans, to keep Mattie and my daugther happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money for us","review":"I was really happy to find another cat treat that was natural and free of fillers/preservatives/chemicals.

To hear all of these great band members teamed up with others from the Roadrunner roster is so great. Of course, I wish they could have brought back some of Earth Crisis, Biohazard, etc. Again, the work that they've completed is great and I hope it don't take another 25 years for this to concur.

The problem is that it goes on and on about the traditions, carols and spirit of Christmas and absolutely leaves the birth of Jesus Christ out. It subtly suggests that the birth of Jesus is not the primary reason for celebrating at Christmas time. The book jacket describes the author Chip Davis as the composer and musician who introduced New Age music. This book would bear that out because it is a very new age story. I cannot recommend this book unless you want to know more about New Age philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't quit making these!","review":"This is the funniest stuff that I have heard in a long time.

The strong point of the album is the attention to detail in songwriting. The overall song structures and chord change are subtly complex, the horn lines and vocals are oddly phrased, and the whole thing is still pleasing to listen to. The other reviewers who said this is upbeat and happy are whack. I quote from \\"Wishing for You:\\" \\"Second guessing all my thoughts / makes me feel so bad / It's the only thing I have.\\" Dark to the point of psychosis; I love it. But it's not all gloom, there are some upbeat pleasant numbers, particularly the excellently-executed cover of Marcia Griffith's (Johnny Nash's) \\"Hold Me Tight.\\" Other favorites include the lead off track \\"Change Up\\" and the deceptively simple \\"Mixed Blessing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cover roll bandage","review":"Cover-Roll Stretch 2 Inches X 10 yardsProduct was exactly what I wanted and needed Price was excellant and itwas delivered faster than expected"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as needed","review":"I need to tape my ankles daily due to chronic ankle sprains and this cover-roll stretch tape works great as a base under leukotape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was purchasing from my physical therapist but much cheaper!","review":"This was the same product that I was already using but at a very good savings.

There's even a reviewer who says it really happened because he lived in that town (was his liver removed after a party by enterprising Med students as well?) Doesn't Dr. Sparks make enough money off of Go Ask Alice? Why is this book in print and a perfectly fine fraud like Mike Warnke out of print and hounded by Christians?

The fact that Ms. Sparks is trying to pass this off as fact is shameful. Maybe I would respect it more if she put a disclaimer in the front--that real Witches respect all life and don't do anything stupid like blood sacrifices. This author is just cashing in on all the propaganda. The Occult isn't evil by nature. \\"Occult\\" just means hidden. The fact that this woman is making money off of some poor boy, real or imagined, that took his own life is just plain sad. And the fact that kids are reading this and being brainwashed is worse. I'm not a Satanist and don't know many, but I do know that most don't call themselves Witches, and none do the crazy things the kids do in this book. I do know many Witches (Wiccans) and they are NOTHING like the kids in this book. If this story is at ALL true, the poor boy was just crazy. More likely, the author is the crazy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good book, people should read!","review":"I bought this book because I read \\"Go ask Alice\\" and thought This book would be just as cool!

Jay committed suside at the end from unhappyness, sad, but some kids do get sad at this age trying to find themself so they do commite suside,every 17 seconds,someone commites sudide,Maybe by reading this book and learning that your not alone,other people feel the same way, just maybe with that 17 seconds someone commites suside we can change someones mind, save someones life."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY SO SCARY?","review":"I read this entire book today and was expecting more. I'm 16 and thought it was rather tame compared to what I had heard about people having nightmares and such. I did like how the book tied itself together at the end but it also left me hanging. Because of this book's religious content and my lack of religious knowledge, to that of occult in nature only, I had to do some research in the nearest Bible to figure out some of the religious points but it was all together good. I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in anything different. Especially those who like to study about religion, it will give you a good base for what goes on inside someone's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"It shows how horrifying life really is..","review":"I am in Junior High and read this book.

This book is sooo scary, and its TRUE is what shocked me!! People actually DO this stuff!! If you are a sensitive reader DO NOT READ IT!! it has really ruined part of me I am afraid.

I read this & felt like they were blaming the boys problem on the occult, which in truth really felt like they were trying to convince me that he was involved in the occult. All religious families with teens have the same debate in their heads, right vs wrong, want to do the right thing & follow the teachings etc. I was not impressed with the book & would not suggest teens to read this book, it doesn't go into any depression issues, which was really more of a reason I suspect mixed with hallucinogens to the boy. I am sure we all feel bad for the boy & his family, I had the feeling the author was trying to make us feel if he went to church he would have been saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, at best","review":"This is another Sparks book that disappointed me. I understand that she writes fiction. I understand that she sensationalizes her stories. However, I believe this book would have been much better if she left out the whole occult aspect. There was a lot for her to go on without having to make that part up about Jay. Here again she messed up dates and times so that you could tell what entries she was making up. If you're going to make it a journal at least get the dates and times \\"correct.\\" Also the timeline throughout the story wasn't correct, even for a work of fiction. Jay would write about numerous things happening over a span of days but the entries in between would only be a day apart (particularly the entry about drinking the cow blood......the entries didn't add up at all).This story actually left a really bad taste in my mouth. The things she described and the thought sequence was really disturbing (especially towards the end of the story).

This is a young kids journal. I grew up in the same town that this happened, which makes it even sadder for me. The poor kid doesn't even have a gravestone. His parents had it removed because it was being desicrated by satanists, satanists who worshipped Jay for being such a troubled teen that had fallen to satanism. I had to read the book to fully understand what had happened in my community. I sat and cryed when i had finished it. I would not reccomend this book to immature readers, but i would reccomend it to EVERY reader mature enough to handle it. It would be impossible to read this book and not be moved in a very profound way. This book makes one realize that there are forces in this world which are not of this world, forces with a single purpose: To ruin life for those of us fortunate enough to live.

Scott Barrett includes a facsimile of jay's original journal. Alden was a troubled boy and did kill him self but no satanic items at all.so this book was scary to read but it is mostly fiction.. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book written by a fanatic with a personal vendetta","review":"This book claims it is a true account, and the fact of the matter is that it is amply distorted by adding false facts in order to accomplish the author's desire to push her religious beliefs to the reader. I believe that any author who deceives her readers in order to push a personal vendetta should be penalized, no matter if she is right or wrong. I assume that through this book she wants to scare those who are tempted to become Satanists, druggies, etc, but I wonder what her religion has to say about tricking people into being close to God? This book is terrifying, and shockingly enough it is supposed to be for kids; in my opinion, it harms a teenager's mind, rather than accomplishing anything else. I wonder how many teenagers have been traumatized by this book. It is definitely not a read for someone who does not have formed criteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"All of this about witchcraft & the occult is ridiculous garbage.

It's one case where the public school system actually got it right. A well crafted story about the very real threat of nucler weapons of mass destruction that we faced back then and now, as opposed to the catastrophic global warming nonsense that has currently captured some Americans (including one ex-vice president and one computer programming scientist who claims to have invented a weather predicting machine) imaginations.Word to the wise. Avoid jewelry (particularly precious metals) if you ever survive a nuclear holocaust. You'll know what I mean when you read this awesome story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A striking, attention-grabbing tale of nuclear war.","review":"I first read this book as a sophomore English student in Titusville, FL. Since one of the locales mentioned in the book was Patrick Air Force Base, FL (very near me), I imagined this story happening to me and the people I knew. It was an eye opening experience-would we be able to survive such a thing, and if we did, what kind of people would we become? It is now 33 years later, and the questions remain the same. This is a very thought-provoking book. It makes one want to never be a part of mass destruction of the human race. I think it should be mandatory reading for all high school or college students. It is a tale significant for those who retain their humanity, against all odds, vs. those who display animalistic tendencies as soon as they are challenged by adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic!","review":"\\"Alas, Babylon\\", written over 40 years ago, is as fresh and frightening now as it was then. Because it has stood the test of time and \\"reads\\" as well for the first generation of the 21st Century as it did for the Cold War generation, it has my seal of approval as a true classic. The characterization is excellent and believable. You really find yourself pulling for these people. The book is well-researched and militarily accurate. It is obvious that the author, Pat Frank, really did his homework. As the true \\"granddad\\" of the apocalyptic genre', \\"Alas, Babylon\\" set the stage for later works in this area, such as, \\"The Stand\\", \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" and \\"Warday\\". And, by the way, does anyone else find it coincidental that the protagionist in this book was named Randy Bragg, yet the villain in \\"The Stand\\" was named Randall Flagg?

I think there could've been more action, like in the part of the book when the American pilot shoots a missle at the Russian pilot and misses.

I also think they shoudv'e said whether Mark died or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"My first complaint is that the story is unimaginative. Prior to buying this book, I had read the summary and formed a general idea about how such a story would go. The story ended up matching my general idea almost exactly. Nothing unexpected happens. There were no plot twists and few clever moments.My second complaint is that the characters all have the same personality and speak in the same voice. The dominant personality trait of every character is that they speak plainly about matters both great and small. It drove me nuts.My last complaint is that the story is not well researched. The effects of nuclear bombs and radiation are grossly inaccurate. The portrayal of the US government and military was simplistic. The author seems to have nothing more than common knowledge about nuclear war, military, and government. I learned almost nothing from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an acceptable book","review":"When I opened the book, I noticed many unnecessary writtings and drawings.

In the aftermath of thermonuclear war, he becomes the leader to rally his family and neighbors to survive in the desperate situation.I'm afraid I can't say much to recommend this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, with persons of color and women portrayed as the barest of stereotypes. Far too much time is spent in the beginning of the book describing the chess-like moves of the USA and Soviets that lead up to the war. This book is probably typical of the mentality of the 50s, but seems extremely dated to a modern reader. The \`group of survivors after a world-wide catastrophe' has been done much better by other authors; for example THE STAND by Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to get into, hard to put down!","review":"This is one of the best books in the post-apocolyptic genre.

It was the first time I realized that the way of life I was used to and assumed would always continue, may not. I was really intrigued by thinking of all the dangers and challenges of life without so many of our luxeries that we take for granted. I found it again years later and reread it and still find it a very good book. I would recommend it. In the present day, I think there is still a risk of dramatic change in our society, either from something like a large solar flare or economic collapse, and thinking of these possibilities and planning at least a little for this would be wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read rediscovered","review":"I first read this book as a high school reading assignment. I chose the book from the teacher's list by ruling out the other listed books that I did not have an interest in reading. I had no idea what I was getting into, it was just an assignment. I still remember the first time I read this book. It was a library book, so I returned it. Later, I searched Amazon for the book - remembering only \\"something about Babylon.\\" Since rediscovering this book, I've read it several times. I don't think about the historic nuances or the authenticity of the plot. I read it for the story of ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances.

This is their story - not a story of how the world is coping.

Randy was more believable at the beginning of the story as a washed-up lawyer than the packs' leader at the end.

What makes this such a powerful piece, and why, like all classics, it will last for all time, is the interactions and relationships of the characters, both with others and within themselves. The fact that Fort Repose was not destroyed in the nuclear war forced people to make a choice. Survive or give up. Who digs deep to become a leader? Where do all those silver spoons go?

It made a great read though!One more thing I loved about this book, and was very impressed by, was the fact that the main character ( the hero ) was not at all racist, while many of the other characters were very much so, and the author made a point to make that known.

When I read this, i couldn't stop. The description was fantastic. I even had to readjust to reality after putting the book down a few times. I had thought things like \\"Oops, i gotta turn the lights off; we're wasting all the power.\\" then seconds later i laughed at myself and those around me gave weird glances.

Wide scale looting is also presented which, I would say is pretty realistic in light of the recent events following hurricane Katrina.I would reccomend this book to anyone who takes their survival seriously and wants a realistic view of how drastic their life would change due to nuclear war.

With modern weapons we know that there is no hope of survival but it is still good to read about the skills, attitude and trials that people would face in the total breakdown of civilization because as we have seen over the last decade the line between civilization and wilderness is very thin indeed.

It portrays the thoughts and worries that filled the minds of those living through the Cold War. When a small town is trying to survive amongst nuclear war, you get to read about the means of survival for these civilians. The creativity of Pat Frank is phenominal and it's one of the only books required for students to read that they will actually enjoy reading.

I am 14 years old, a Freshman in high school, and I had to read this book as a report. I didn't want to because it was to boring, but now I can't put it down. It's amazing how some people survive without things that people really need in life to survive( I am not telling any of you what they lost, or if anyone died).

Pat Frank does a great job of describing what a nuclear holocaust might be like. He describes the new life that the few survivors would have to lead, and the hundreds of problems they would have to face. This story focuses on a small group of individuals who live in the Florida town of Fort Repose. The book shows how they collaborate their efforts for survival in order to make a life for themselves they enjoy living. Throughout the story, various problems are described and how the characters solve them. Pat Frank uses excellent description and dialogue to enhance this wonderful story. The characters are all great and likable and there is a great theme.

The novel dissolves the impalpability of a nuclear holocaust, unearthing the probable xenocide of the human race by its own fears, anxieties, and phallic determination to exceed its predecessors in size and strength. Pat Frank's stark portrayal of the microcosmic Florida town's survival after nuclear fallout heralds a warning for many supporters of the \\"preventative war\\" mentality. By understanding the past, it is possible to protect the future. By understanding WWII and its descendents, perhaps we can prevent military suicide in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"I want to write a long review on how I love this book, but I want you to read it for yourself to see just how awesome it really is.I was originally like ,\\"this book was written a long time ago with no technology!\\" but I soon forgot that.

Interesting story of survival and what might happen if life as we know it suddenly ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARY AS HELL, BUT ULIMATELY UPLIFTING","review":"Given the current world stage, this book really scared the hell out of me. Frank wrote it in 1957, but there is very little about it that feels dated. A dogfight gone wrong sets the stage for global disaster, which we live through in our hero, a wayward ex-Army borderline alcoholic living in a serene Florida small town. The characters and situations that play out in the aftermath of total nuclear war are amazingly true and captivating. The attention to crucial survival details never flags (you'd never know how important salt would be until you really need it). But in the end, it's really a tribute to the human spirit and a testament that we are, by nature, mostly good at heart. I loved this book and wish there were more out there like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great book!","review":"I came across Alas Babylon, when I was working in a bookstore a few years ago.

The KWIK definitely cures faster but the hold doesn't appear as strong. For example, I've used the original JB Weld in the past to attach metal hasps to metal ammo cans with fairly good results. The hasp's staple will stay affixed and will only detach using a cold chisel and hammer.I recently attached a hasp staple to a metal ammo box with the KWIK version and the bond failed miserably. The KWIK set quickly but after one rap on the outside of the box (i.e. no chisel needed) the staple detached immediately. I performed this test three days after the the bond had cured.My main complaint is that the packaging does not clearly indicate that the KWIK version (part no. 8276) is less strong than the original (part no. 8265).

In it's defense, this was a heat sink that would get up to 140 F, but the ratings say that this should be no issue at all. Would not stay on. In fact, when the piece fell off for the first time, I just picked the rest of the JB kwik fragments from the surfaces with my fingers to clean it up.Next was gluing two 18650 cells into place, long side down. I slathered the entire length of the cells, not to mention filled in the giant void between the two cells with the stuff. This should have made a massive surface area contact, more than enough to hold the light weight cells. Two weeks later, it fell off.Never going to touch this stuff again.Also, it smells weird unlike the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"i mixed it up just at the consistency it said 1:1 to fix back together an aluminum hinge on my laptop computer that had broken. said it sets in 4 minutes and cures in 4 hours. i mixed it up and applied it came back to it the next morning 11 hours later and it almost dented with pressing my fingernail into it. nevertheless the hinge adhesion did not hold. this is like using bondo dent filler as a glue. jb weld must do better than this because i've heard rave reviews but i hoped this would be comparable. i broke the latch off on my computer so it would close and went about my business. i don't have time to play games with expensive glues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use it to fix car radiators","review":"Tried to fix a leak in my car radiator and to put it simply it did not last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this called Fast and Furious?","review":"This movie doesn't not follow any themes of the previous fast and the furious.

This movie has highly trained professionals and is not to be preformed by anyone at any time or place.

I guess that is a teenage thing -- anger. I believe a lot of 1-star had been giving to this film and I am not going to eleborate any more.I found it has a real bad influence to anyone who loves cars and those who always wanted to race.

It goes without saying that the first one was the best, but both Four and Five were also very entertaining.

I went to see this movie for the simple fact that I figured there was no way I could not like this movie. Bow Wow is a pretty charismatic dude and I was hoping he pulled this movie off like he did in \\"Roll Bounce.\\" Fat chance. All of the actors in this one seemed to be out of place, and even the stunts didn't amuse me much. The plot was too shifty, and it moved too slowly for me to even want to pay attention.

Sean is supposed to be in high school, but as old as he looked I guess he was on the 10 year plan. On top of that, he talked like Forrest Gump. In order not to go to jail, Sean moves to Japan to live with his dad. Sean was able to find himself a crew real quick. And if he and his friends were suppposedly in high school, how come they had so much time to race, fix cars, and go to parties? Shouldn't they have been studying for entrance crams?

First, there is no way to retrieve an erased message. This is especially a problem because the system doesn't really pause after messages as you're playing them back. So after listening to a message you can't hit erase, or you will end up erasing the next (unheard) message. This has happened to me on more than one occasion. Second, the unit often clicks loudly when you pick up the phone, presumably because it's trying to get the caller ID. It's extremely annoying and also has interfered with dial-up connections I was trying to make on more than one occasion. Bottom line, I'd suggest you shop around for something built with real consumers in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice except for intermittent caller-id problem","review":"With configurable outgoing messages based on caller ID, this machine would be real nice (although you can't configure ring/message options for anonymous callers like you can on the Casio TA-140 & 145).

For example, for about 25% of the calls it doesn't record any caller ID information (on the same calls, other caller-ID boxes in the house work just fine). I bought two different 29992 units for my relatives last Christmas and both units had the same intermittent flaws.

The material is written and produced by Andrew Williams and I have read the book which he published on the same subject. In one hour and a half it is not possible to cover all aspects of the subject so that the focus is on the duel between U-Boat command and the Royal Navy. In addition there is a fascinating section on the role of the codebreakers at Bletchley park who broke the German Enigma-machine code and were able to anticipate the U-Boat movements. The human cost of this struggle was horrendous with great loss of of life on both sides and this DVD shows the tradegy of war with no punches pulled.

The cities CJ walks through, the characters he interacts with, and even those interactions, seem so subservient to the monstrous weight of adjectives they bear that they are effectively flattened into sameness and indifference.

His tasteful use of words paints realistic, satirical, fresh views of everyday life. He makes sitting on a couch seem profound and colorful. At times, I felt like Johnson has gone though my e-mails and memoirs to create his characters.At times, his style of prose riffs so far in poetic strokes he loses the true content of his narrative, leaving the reader to wonder what is literally or figurative. The ending is borderline contrived but surprising.This book made me feel less offset by and more trusting of strangers and those in my community. I felt hopeful and humbled after reading this piece. This book showed how brotherhood can still exist and a human spirit can grow despite shortcomings. This is required reading for anyone who wants an example of creative prose at it's best.

I've never seen the TV show, but I CAN see that these fake dentures have a LOT of uses!For instance, the teeth shown on the model, (and he is NOT a child!), could be the latest in vampire-fashions!
