One of Mr. Benner's early suppositions is that since (he believes) the Tower of Babel was a literal event, then early Hebrew writing evidences that Adam and Eve, as well as God, spoke Hebrew which was not confounded at Babel. This is a striking assertion with no supporting academic material.His efforts at linking Hebrew writing with the Hebrew mentality that concentrated on action over abstract thought is a little better thought out, but that's been done before by Hebrew scholars in better books.If you're a fundamentalist Christian, then you'll probably accept what Mr. Benner has to offer.

If you are going to order Preggie pop drops and have celiacs or a form of a gluten allergy, order the organic version, they state that they are gluten free. These were not the greatest thing to vomit back up. The relief didn't last long, and left an awful aftertaste. Very much over priced.

Just vomiting will make the nausea go away a lot longer than fighting it with these over priced candies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver Depending on the Flavor","review":"I bought these drops in desperation, hoping to find anything that would ease my constant morning sickness. As soon as they arrived I tried a sour raspberry and felt better almost immediately. I was singing the praises of Preggie Pops to everyone I knew! I also really liked the green apple drops. However, I did not have as much luck with the sour tangerine. In fact, this flavor made me feel worse. The sour lemon didn't seem to help or make me feel worse. I am sure the way the flavors affected me are an individual preference and I would recommend anyone struggling with morning sickness try the variety pack and see what works for them.

That seems to be something that's setting me off, so although they may be helpful to others, they are horrible for me.

So even though I've bought this material in numerous reprints before, I will support this project. Just think.

No one who uses this inspired volume will be disappointed.

When I read all the papal encyclicals on the riches to be found in this seemingly simple prayer I vowed again and again to try. But my efforts would soon peter out because I could not figure out what to do with my mind while praying. Comes along this wonderful book and I think I have found my solution. What happens now is a sort of symphony: I'm saying the words of the vocal prayers, my spirit is with Mary before the throne of the Trinity, my mind is occupied with the words of scripture I've read just before starting the Hail Mary or Our Father I'm praying. This symphony is perfect for me. And, as another reviewer pointed out, because there are seven joyful, sorrowful, and glorious scripture sets, I never get tired. As for the Luminous Mysteries: I'm saying them on Sunday with another of the author's books: The Suffering Servant's Courage. But for all the other mysteries this book is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Genesis to Revelation","review":"I had hoped in the Seven Scriptural Rosaries collection to find meditations on the Lumious Mysteries as well, however this must have been an earlier printing and while the booklet contains seven versions of mysteries itis limited to the three traditional mysteries: Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious. It arrived in good time and was wellpackaged. I certainly will make use of it, but I was sorry it did not hold all I hoped it would. I should have studied the Look Inside feature more closely. Still, it is a lovely devotional book with beautiful scriptural reflections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you order this book","review":"Beware if you order this book, that it is a workbook companion tothe hardcover.

This book consists of a menagerie of weird artificial creatures and punchy ideas, woven together with an emotionally engaging multi-perspectival narrative. In hindsight (I read it a few months ago), the ideas really got under my skin, but as a story it just doesn't hang together as well as I'd hoped. More than a couple of chapters are masterfully executed, but others are vague and unfleshed. The book runs out of page-turning gas about halfway through. I got the sense that the author did not know where he was going plot-wise, and just kind of let the story spin out of control. Still, if you are looking for an intellectual mutagen, this is very worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass.","review":"I give up.

There are FZ albums more amusing, more musically daring, but when considering what Zappa did with the state of American pop in 1965-66, the results can only be called astonishing (no wonder the Beatles were inspired by it). There was nothing even remotely like this album back then--from the proto-rap \\"Trouble Every Day\\" (to me the best track) to the schizo-dirge \\"Who Are the Brain Police\\"? to the avant-nut \\"HELP, I'M A ROCK\\", FZ laid the groundwork for his signature complex orchestrations here, albeit in lo-fi sound and doo-wop form, shredding fuzz guitar throughout (and shredding the occasional kazoo, too). His equally satiric liner notes fittingly illuminate how each song was its own flavor of commercial suicide while simultaneously poking fun at the burgeoning counterculture and any theoretical resistance against the \\"great Midwestern hardware store philosophy\\" (short of Freaking Out, that is). A tremendous debut album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 1966- poor for now","review":"Okay, this was a pretty wild debut album in 1966. While everyone was listening to British pop with sentimental themes of teenage love, these Americans released a sarcastic, political, noise filled double album which was all over the place and proclaimed Zappa a talent with acute intelligence. \\"Trouble comes everyday\\" is the David Bowie \\"Rebel, Rebel\\" riff/hook ten years before Bowie but while Bowie sings of drag queens, Zappa is singing about race riots in the streets. The rest of the album does not hold up well and has aged poorly. The sound is poor and many of the pieces sound sophomoric today. So, who should buy this? If you are just getting into the Mothers of Invention, this is a must but everyone else can pass it up as a time piece that is unnecessary to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help, I'm A Rock","review":"This CD is worth buying just to have the timeless classic hit \\"Help, I'm A Rock\\".

The styles range from doo wop/50's rock to blues to left-of-center pop to R&B; to avant-garde to EVERYTHING! and it is just amazing how one band could pull that off.Being an experimental-rock and avant-garde fanatic, it's no surprise that my two favorites are \\"Help, I'm a Rock\\" and \\"The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet\\", but I also like \\"How Could I Be Such A Fool,\\" \\"Trouble Every Day,\\" \\"Who are the Brain Police?\\" and \\"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\\".

It is as advertised: A step-by-step introduction to the art and science of creative thinking.It shows the reader with a staple of de Bono's -- his graphs and diagrams - how to get over the threshold from just ordinary (right brain thinking) or \\"linear thinking\\" to (left brain thinking) or \\"lateral thinking,\\" that is to pure creativity; and most important, how to consistently find the \\"launch pad\\" to ones own creativity.Critical to the organization of this book and to making his points here (the same as in his other books), is giving the reader a basic understanding of how the mind works. This provides the framework for setting up and recognizing the special situations in which ones creativity is most likely to come into play.Like, others in the de Bono series, these techniques work so well that it is scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE EDITION--DO NOT BUY--NO images referred to in the text","review":"The book itself is thoroughly thought through. My negative review is not about the book itself, but about the Kindle Edition, which, for some poor reason, has NONE of the apparently copious visual illustrations referred to throughout the book. Lateral thinking requires the ability to visualize, so De Bono's conceptual framework and his intent to offer teaching exercises are thwarted by publishing the book with no images!There is, apparently, no way to return a Kindle edition for a refund, so I will purchase the paperback edition as I do want the book as a part of my visual problem-solving library of resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful who like to think.","review":"It's a book written on serious things in a very light style.

The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross chips","review":"I thought these were terrible. I couldn't finish a whole bag. However, the nacho flavor was there. I just thought they were so expensive for the taste. I brought them to work and a couple coworkers like them, but I really don't. They'r not cruncy enough and they feel a little soft. Blah, didn't like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average chip, but decently tasty","review":"This might not fill a craving for \\"chips\\" but if you don't go in expecting that, these aren't bad. And the nutritional info on these is great. They are much more filling than other similar calorie snacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"These taste horrible. As a diabetic it is difficult enough to find foods that I enjoy but these are disgusting. I couldn't even pass them onto my 15 yr old vacuum cleaner of a son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't eat after best buy date!","review":"Bought a bag of these today at a local Walgreen's. I like the parmesan version so thought these might be good. I was totally grossed out on the first bite: bitter and rancid tasting. Ugh. Checked the date and saw they expired a month ago. In my experience most packaged foods like this don't get that bad so soon after the package date, but man, these were SO bad I went back and told an employee at Walgreen's. They let me return it for the parmesan ones, which were fine.I'm not sure I'll try the chili cheese again, as they left a really nasty taste/memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protein Chips","review":"The Kay's Naturals protein crispy Parmesan pack of 12 protein chips tasted aweful. I would not recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SALTY!!!","review":"If you are all about eating salt covered chips, you'll be OK. For people who don't like the taste of salt poured in their mouth. Might want to move on. The flavor would be ok, with a less salt flavor. Part of the salty flavor probably comes from the cheese, but it's just too much. Won't be buying these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Change! NEW Packaging, Less Cals, Less Protein, Less Carbs, Less Fat","review":"......BUT, same great taste! These Kays Naturals Better Balance Protein Parmesan Chips are different though. I have these on Subscribe and Save and the entire old pkge equalled 1.5servings, 165Cals, about 5.2gFat, 16.5 Net Carbs, 15gProtein, 4.5gFiber.But, this has been changed with the current NEW packaging:NOW1serving= 1whole bag!And, NOW an ENTIRE bag has120Cals11(Net)Carbs12gProtein2.5gFat4gFiberSo, that's probably good news for those of you who didn't want to divvy (sorry, no time to check if this is a valid word per the dictionary) a bag up into 1.5servings and try to compute the nutritional facts for the whole bag.But, ahhh, a little less protein and that's one of the main factors in purchasing these. But, still, no complaints: Overall, a great move!"},{"rating":"1","title":"echhhhhhhhh","review":"I am anxious to find salted/cheese flavored snacks.....well the salt/grated cheese shakers are a lot more appealing. The aftertaste may send you right for the Hershey bar. There is also a funky stomache feeling too. I was desperate enough to try this stuff twice (I did have a box of 12)....it wasn't the result of a bad first impression, these chips are just awful....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this product","review":"This is the first product I have ever reviewed. I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me. This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others. I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack. First off, the package says low fat. They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come. Next, the chip has no snap too it. It is soft and melts. Not something you want in a chip. Worst of all is the taste. The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty. Overall, avoid this product. I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative especially for fitness fanatics","review":"When I opened up the whole case of protein chips, I was quite overwhelmed since I thought, WOW. Did I go a little overboard with this? I could not believe I bought a whole case without trying it first.Anyway, I opened up one box just to taste it and it did not taste good at first. But as I kept on eating it, it just got better and better. I ended up eating this box all day periodically from morning till the end of my work day. Uh-oh, one box equals 5 servings. YIKES.As a fitness fanatic, I keep a high protein-low carb diet. This is an excellent substitute to my craving for potato chips and salty snacks. Unfortunately, there aren't that many healthy, salty snacks to choose from (I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of the world). The Chili nacho flavor creates a party in my tummy, I wish it was spicy though but it does the job.So a whole case of Kay's protein chips?? Yeah, no problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to love these things...then they changed the recipe apparently","review":"I started eating these about a year and a half ago and really liked the taste and texture. They were crunchy, much more 'chip like'...but about 10 months ago they batches I started to receive were significantly different. Much more of a soft, puffy consistency. I was hoping that I just got a few bad batches in a row but it is now clear that they must have changed their recipe. I still enjoy the taste...but am really disappointed in the texture now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy AND tasty!","review":"I love these chips. I used these on my diet program to satisfy my \\"munchie\\" cravings and lost 40 pounds. They make a great healthy snack.

I ordered this tape out of a magazine and had no idea when I paid $34.99 that the qaulity would be so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and time consuming, not for beginners.","review":"I was interested in a work out that would lengthen muscles as The Method boasts of. However, I found many of the excercises difficult to complete, and straining the neck.The entire tape focusses on the lower body abs, thighs, and back side. The first part of the tape is 15 minutes, focussing mostly on abs. The second part is 30 minutes which begins with a repeat of the first ssection, then goes on to a focuss on the legs. I feel 45 minutes is a lot of time invested in toning without working out the upper body.I do enjoy the leg work out and have used parts of the ab and the entire leg work out in my usual toning routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carefully thought out instructions yeild a better workout","review":"Jennifer spends a lot of time explaining form (i.e. keep that hip on the mat) while you're doing the workout. It helps tremendously to adjust form while you're working out (kinda like she's actually there helping you). Also, she gives suggestions for how to pyramid down or up the intensity. This video is excellent for beginners or more advanced. I love Pilates, and this video keeps me motivated to work out (almost) daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a workout!!!","review":"Well this was a surprise. I bought this videos during the first wave of \\"Pilates\\" and figured it would be a nice mix of Yoga and Pilates. I was amazed at how Jenniger Kries skillfully blends to two into a real intense workout. You feel every area each workout intends to hit. It does take a few sessions to get the positions and forms down but once you do...lookout!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"effective and visible all-over toning; emphasis on abs","review":"This is one of the best tapes in my 70+ collection. Based on ballet, yoga, pilates and the Alexander Method, Jennifer's instruction will leave you energized and fully sore! Every muscle in the body is used in very challenging positions. All excercises are done on a mat, using your own limbs and body weight as resistance. Excellent results were noticable after 5 workouts. Great for lengthening the muscles, also stresses the spine and abs for posture perfect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Method to her madness","review":"This is without a doubt...the best video I have ever bought! Jennifer Kries is a very good instructor. I sweat more doing this 45 minute tape, than ridding the stationary bike for an hour. Through my own experiance, you MUST regularly do this tape for at least 2 months before you will REALLY see results. I think I spent the first 2 months mastering the different moves. Then when I had done so...I could start concentrating on feeling the burn in my muscles. This tape WILL change the shape of your body...and you will see a difference, but you must stick with it. The Method Precision Sculpting video is also really good. I have been incorporating both tapes into my routine...and seeing the results I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"I found this tape to be a refreshing change from the aerobics and yoga videos I normally use. The exercises were very interesting and challenging and never made me feel bored. I noticed results after a few sessions. I felt taller and stronger and even more flexible. My only complaint is that the tape is marketed for beginners, too, and I was a beginner and found some of the moves a bit difficult at first. However, if you stick with it, as Jennifer says in the video, you will notice results in a few sessions. I have pretty weak abs, but after a few times I mastered the ab exercises which I thought would never happen! I was pretty sore the day after I did the tape the first time, so be warned if you have out of shape abs. Jennifer is a great instructor and not at all annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't recommend","review":"Sorry, unless you're really fit, this is not for you. It says it's for all ages and fitness levels, but I disagree, it's extremely difficult. It doesn't have a pretty location, her voice isn't soothing, and worst of all, doesn't end with a good cool down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont purchase this video!","review":"I was highly diappointed with this video. Although the instruction in the beginning is valuable the first time, you have to fast forward through it every time after that. It would have been better if they gave you an instructional video separate from the workout video. I would recommend buying a DVD so it is easier to skip the instruction. Also, cheesy set. Too slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"increased flexibility","review":"I had the pleasure of taking classes with Jennifer in Philly and she is so inspiring. When I moved away from Pennsylvania, I was sad to give up my classes and flexibility. Needless to say, I am thrilled to have Jennifer teaching me again. I have all of her tapes...the best benefits are increased flexibility, increased ab strength and BETTER posture. A few weeks with this tape and you'll be looking like a ballerina! It's important to keep your spine in contact with the floor and your abs engaged, otherwise you may strain your back. This tape is not for wimps. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"frustating.","review":"This tape is not for beginners. I consider myself a perfectly fit girl, I work out 4 times a week at the gym but I found this tape impossible. In addition to being lousy and boring, the transitions are not that smooth. She talks between counting and you never know whether you should still be holding your breath or relaxing. When she started showing off her advanced moves like that of a professional ballerina, I knew I shouldn't have bought this. Nonetheless, I got a good ab workout which I could have achieved with other ab specific tapes. Ms Kries is boring as an instructor and I found her a little annoying and in her counting and giving of directions. I found myself saying \\"get on with it!\\" a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Yoga","review":"I'm not saying this is not a great tape. I think that she has these moves mastered. I'm just saying that Pilates is not for me. I am a vocalist and some of the breathing techniques in Pilates are counter-productive for me. I spoke to an instructor and she seemed to think that they were not but how can you hold your abdomen in and get a good breath going?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating...","review":"If you are not that flexible in hamstrings and not that strong in your abs, you can pass this tape. It is purely frustrating to watch and follow the exercise Kries is showing. Pilates was first created for injured dancers and that's why it has been popular among dancers whose range of motion is far beyond normal person's. I am sure Pilates can be beneficial if learned properly with a good teacher, but just watching & following this tape might bring nothing but injuries, especialy in the back. I used to have many Method tapes, but the only one I have now is \\"Target Specifics\\". That's the only tape I can follow without frustration. And one more thing about Kries's tapes....how come all her tapes are more or less the same?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast","review":"I read the back of this video and it sounded encouraging with emphasis on the body parts that I wanted to work out. However, halfway through the video, I wanted to quit.I assume the first part of the tape is for beginners. It was okay. After doing the first part, I didn't feel as if I had worked out though.The second part of the tape was too long and she kept doing the moves too fast that I couldn't do it properly. The moves were definitely too hard to perform the first time and I felt as though I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what. Jennifer does an okay job in giving cues, but she doesn't remind people to inhale and exhale everytime. Sometimes, I didn't have time to breath.Even though she reminds people that they won't be able to do the moves as far as she does, I still felt intimidated at how high her legs stretched. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't done pilates before."},{"rating":"2","title":"I sleep without pain when I use this video.","review":"I'm 56 years old with pain that wakes me up at night, going down my hip and leg--BEFORE this tape. The first time I used this tape, I started sleeping without pain--no medications either. After about 3 1/2 months, I can touch my head to my knees and, do the situp with my feet in the air. My posture has always been poor. I went to see a chiropractor for the first time in my life about 2 months after starting this tape, and she said my posture was very good, and I was in very good shape. I wondered if she could do more for me, but I found that this tape made a chiropractor unnecessary--so why spend the money? I feel like it's given me a younger body."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toning workout","review":"I've tried a lot of workout videos, from step aerobics to kickboxing to yoga, and this is definitely one of the best I've tried. It's a deceptively hard workout, but easily modified for different ability levels. I especially like how it is broken down into 2 segments, one 15-minutes long and the other 30-minutes long, so you can do either or both if you like. Also, instructor Jennifer Kries is very motivating and not annoying at all, like many instructors on fitness videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tape","review":"I was completely satisfied with this purchase! Exacly what I was hoping for. A Pilates/Matt instructor suggested that I look into the Jennifer Kries tapes...and I am very happy that I took her advise! This workout is challenging, easy to follow & something you can do in segments, or as a whole. Ms Kries' instruction is precise, easy to follow. No need to have to fast-forward through too much \\"chat\\". Be sure to check her other tapes as well...I purchased another tape (focusing on abs & thighs) as was equally as pleased. (and I'm not easily pleased!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A++++ Simple to follow and so effective for abs and legs.","review":"If you don't have a lot of time and need an effective toning method,this is the one tape you should have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this work out!!","review":"This is a great video! I cant say enough good things. I just had a baby and was in a car accident while pregnant resulting in back injuries. I thought Pilates may not be for me because I was so out of shape and injured. Definatly not the case! Another person said there were no modifications to the moves and you had to be fairly fit to even try this work out. Not so!! Several times she says to go only as far as comfortable, you have to follow her directions- then you have a completly tailored work out.True there isnt a whole lot for arms...but I have a baby for that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout, non-annoying instructor","review":"I love this video. The workout is easy to follow but challenging and gets results. Jennifer Kries is easy to listen to and follow, and the video doesn't have annoying camera tricks or music to distract you from the relaxing yet challenging workout. I've had this tape for a couple of years and it's the one I still reach for first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Great material from an incredible practitioner of the art.

The quality of the DVD is horrible--both sides were scratched all over, and it does not play on any of my new DVD players! It would go in the DVD tray and started to spin like crazy and making the \\"wu--wwwu--wwwuu-wwwuuu\\" sound like 195 mile per hour wind in hurrican, yet never registered to play at all, but the seller listed it as \\"used but like new\\"! I wrote to the seller, but never got any response from them, yet I was only requesting for an even exchange for a better copy! I am now thinking about requesting amazon.com to help me get my full refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"The sound in the Beethoven Choral Fantasy portion is excellent and is the only redeeming part of this DVD. It's too bad there wasn't more of the same to fill out the DVD. There is not much worth watching or hearing in the Liszt portion. The camera work leaves much to be desired, focusing on the perspiring face and fingers of the pianist ad nauseum. He plays a boring program of Liszt, as dull as anything we've ever heard. We nearly didn't watch it to the end. It ranks as the most disappointing DVD that we have purchased to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pinnies for older kids","review":"I bought these pinnies for my under 9 soccer team. They are definitely too big for them, the kids always complain when they have to wear them. These would probably fit kids 12 years old and older just fine. I don't really care for the plastic feel either. I wish I would have purchased mesh pinnies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Good & Evil is the Phoenix, this album was the ashes","review":"I'm a Cult fanatic, but I pride myself on being able to separate my personal feelings toward a band and the way I would review an album. Admittedly the self titled 'Cult' was a dramatic creative departure for Ian Astbury and crew, however, the album is essentially \\"Coming Down\\" and a lot of mediocre filler that never really gets you going. Even \\"Coming Down\\" is aggravating at times as the intro is too long, and the time between verses needed to be shortened (thankfully, the single version is MUCH more listenable, you'll find it on \\"High Octane\\")in order for it to have been radio friendly.Credit them for trying something different at the time, but I think they needed to hit bottom before a wild comeback in Beyond Good and Evil..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only Cult fan who didn't like this album?","review":"First and foremost, I am a great Cult fan, I have all their stuff. For a little perspective I would bring the \\"Love\\" CD with me if I were going to be marooned on a desert island with a CD player.That being said, I thought they really diverted way out of their league. I seriously had a difficult time determining who was playing their songs. It sounded earily similar to R.E.M.'s CD \\"Monster,\\" since both came out at the same time.What's the Frequency Kenneth?What's the Deal Ian Astbury?I understand why they sold about 589 albums across the USA when it came out, I actually returned mine for a full refund (I was a starving college kid in '94) so I thin I bought 2 days worth of food for the 13 buck refund.I think its very telling they didn't make another alum for 7 years after this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cult\\" is NOT The Cult","review":"nothing but a flat prelude of Cult's dissolution.if you're a CULT first-timer, pick LOVE, ELECTRIC and SONIC TEMPLE... and SKIP this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing in its power and intensity","review":"The Cult is a great band, and this is their best CD. This CD, \\"The Cult\\" doesn't throw itself at you suggesting greatness on a first listen, but stick with it, and let it work its magic. What stands out is the intensity, commitment, and sheer power of the music, performances, and lyrics. You can't help but conclude that this CD cuts very close to home for Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy. \\"The Cult\\" is one of those moments in any band's career where everything they've ever worked with comes together at the right time and place, producing a transcendent work that far exceeds the sum of all the parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cult - Cult","review":"I think I own every CD The Cult ever made. This is a good album, and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cult's Ultimate","review":"I have always liked the Cult starting with Love and through Ceremony. It seemed that they would get a little more polished and figure it out a little more with each album and with Cult they reached their peak and got it perfect. Rank's in my top 3 albums of all time (Living Colour-Time's Up & King's X-Gretchen Goes to Nebraska)and it is a crying shame that hardly anyone ever heard this masterpiece. Today's music is littered with no talent humps who strike it big by having someone else write a hook for them. This album shows what song writing and musicianship is all about. Do yourself a favor and step into the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great creative team gets its going :)","review":"This is one of the very best creative team to ever tackle Green Lantern. This book is delightful. Some great Silver Age moments here. This is a warm up for the next volume which is even better. I certainly hope DC continues this series; I'd love to see them reprint all the stories up to the Neil Adams run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Something Worth Listening To","review":"This is an instant hip hop classic. New style, new flow, and a new attitude. It feels good to hear hip hop going back to where it all started yet pushing it forward at the same time. This album has a diverse song line-up, hot guest appearances, and is an overall very confident entry into the industry. If you like Ludacris or anything creative and fast paced you'll def. like this one. Cop this album. Mad props to Mullyman for this effort. Salute."},{"rating":"1","title":"delete delete delete","review":"This book was for the most part entertaining and dare I say almost cleverly written. But things just began to unravel as the book continued. For one, the stupidity of the novel's protagonist was just too unbelievable. I too was a huge fan of Stine's Fear Street and Goosebumps series. Sadly, although this one is an adult novel, it just didn't seem like it when everything was said and done. It started out pretty strong but that's about it.Really, the only thing adult about it were the cuss words and sex. The characters were all too juvenile for their ages, Lindy, how blind and niave can you be?And the so-called twist were so silly, not thrilling at all. The ending, completely flaccid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and long","review":"When I first bought this book I was excited because R.L. Stine's books are good. I really liked the synopis but when I got the book it was really juvenile. I thought it was young adult it was more junior high and just plain foolish. Who is going to keep chatting with someone bc they are scared they are going to get them. Maybe she should have got the police involved instead of her ex's boyfriend friend who had a crush on her. If you want to read an adult book about adult themes this is not the right book. Fear Street series is more adult than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"More twists than a bowl of rotini pasta!","review":"R.L. Stine does it again in this entertaining, edgy entertainment fraught with unexpected twists. Bravo! Bravissimo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"But not great. Initially, I was thinking this would be a good book because it's sooo hard to find books w/ relateable characters to ourselves. Well, at least that's what I thought based on the back. I open it up to reveal the stupidest, annoyingest dumb blonde ever. She's so busy being sweet, dismissive of other's mistakes, and overly modest that it makes her seem like the \\"good girl\\" that only thinks she's better than everyone else. You TELL your friends if they have a skeezy guy, and you don't tolerate everything she did. Her stupidity is what got her in trouble in the first place, trying to make herself friendly w/ everyone. I don't remember her being a southern farm girl..."},{"rating":"1","title":"...wow....","review":"...Yeah, I went into this knowing that it wouldn't be that great, and I wasn't all that disappointed. It was easy to read, and it certainly was a shocker at the end. I read it in maybe... 3 days. so, at least I didn't waste all of my time on this piece of fluff. I suppose I felt as if I were reading a children's book that was a bit more edgy... I don't know. I guess what gave me that feeling was the parts where you get to see into the mind of the killer, or whatever. It was just funny. He freaks out, at one point, and thinks some girl's hair is out to get him. He kind of reminds me of this really old creepy guy who stalks me on the internet.All in all, it wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't good, either. I thought it was cheesy, but at least it was a fast read.So, RL Stine, go back to writing kiddie books."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOSER","review":"If I could have given this a negative, I would have said -5. How anyone could say that this is a thriller and that they could not put it down is brain damaged. The writing was absolutely high school, the characters shallow, the plot stupid and the dialogue boring. If anyone wants my copy, send me $2 and I will gladly mail it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettin Loud with Timo","review":"Wow, this guy really is brilliant when it comes to writting music. My favorite track has to be the second one with the samples from American Beauty, man is it cool. He really covers almost all genres of electronic music on here from trance to techno and beyond. This is a must own if your a fan of Timo!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very very disappointed :(","review":"Timo Maas is a great DJ in person and his previous albums were ok, but this album is horrible. It lulled me to sleep the first time I heard it. I was so disappointed with the repetitious beats that I wish I could have returned it to the store that sold it to me. There is only one track on this album that I like. I suggest you don't waste your money on an album that is obviously lacking in so many ways...no energy, no rhythm, no sense of what the producer was thinking when he produced this utter and pathetic work. Loud: Rated 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper","review":"Loved the track with Kelis but I find the rest of this CD unlistenable.Why? Because it isn't that different than alot of the faceless producers putting tracks out on vinyl are doing. That isn't to say the tracks are bad, but I can go down to my local Satellite Record shop and pick up music better than this in the quarter crate any day of the week.Again, I'm not knocking Timo, but I'm upping alot of the people who haven't gotten a break yet. This is definitely an album made by a DJ, versus being an album made by a musician. Almost all the tracks were definitely made to be worked into his sets. Who knows, that might've be his intent but it doesn't resonate with this person. If you want more mediocre music by a DJ who releases full albums, try Oakenfold.Awesome cover though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...ok.","review":"Just so I'm not covering ground already mentioned, yes this album ....., but my main disappointment was with the guest appearances of the lyricists (singers, whatever...). Not only are they truly, horribly uninspired on this album, but they really don't move in with the music. I almost felt like I was listening to improvised karaoke lyrics. The music itself is ok, but nothing really new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... keep on the turntables and away from real music gear","review":"This is the worst album I've heard in 2002 so far. Bland melodies, [bad] vocals, ridiculously repetition... there's just so little variety within any of the songs that the whole thing sounds like 14 locked grooves. What you hear at the beginning of a song is generally what you hear at the end.My advice: skip this one and get Oakie's new one, Bunkka, .... No word on a domestic for that one yet, but definitely the best album I've heard in 2002 yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Either Love It or Hate It","review":"This is definitely an album that you'll either love or totally hate. For me, it was the later. I find the never-ending repetitious beats obnoxious and incessantly uncreative. The only thing I found interesting in the least was \\"To Get Down\\" from which the words \\"What Goes Around\\" were changed to \\"Here Comes the Ram\\" for a series of Dodge truck TV commercials. It was interesting for a few seconds. I marvel at how one reviewer of this album remarked, nearly as soon as this album came out, \\"You can just see this one being used for various television soundtracks...\\" Obviously, he hit it on the money with a commercial at least. Personally, I think the techno riffs are at best decent for a low-budget Sci-Fi flick. There is much better music out there to blow your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice computer at a great price","review":"I purchased a Presarrio Athlon 1600+ this summer and was impressed by its speed so I when I saw this one I recommended it to a friend. Computer was easy to set up. Paired it up with roadrunner high speed internet access and web surfing is super fast. Compaq seems to have worked out the kinks with java windows. Compaq has also added some nice desktop themes. Set up was easy without any calls to technical support. The only disappointment was that it came with a black keyboard with grey keys instead of the silver internet ready keyboard with black keys, which much nicer. Also Compaq now requires you to make your own restore disks - however the process was pretty easy (provided you have some blank CD-R disks on hand) and seemed pretty fool proof. Computer also comes with a very readable user's manual. All and all a great computer experience at a nice price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was very disappointed with this tape.

I've owned CDs were the remaster was not noticeably better, but I suspect that the original hits cd might sound as bad or better???? somebody else might know.

It has all of their good stuff and even a couple of OK tunes (This Ain't Love and Keep Pushin').

So meets up with some interesting characters along the way only to realize that Tokyo is not really the place she belongs. I watched this movie all the way until the end, hoping that along some point it would get better. I think it is basically just a typical 80s B movie.

I had thought they would cover the cost since the problem involves a flame about 2 feet high blasting out from the grill - it burned all of the hair off of my arm and nearly took off my son's eyebrows. The Lynx people chastised me (!) for allowing the propane to build up (I was following their extravagant instructions exactly), said it was heavy and I should not use propane with their grill - that is what it is made for.

In keeping with the Mighty Ducks/Disney/Mickey Mouse squeaky-clean environment he works in, his words, even his direct quotes, are cleansed, leaving only adjectives along the lines of \\"making comments about my ancestors\\" as a euphemism for swearing, a phrase only my own ancestors used.

I was expecting to read about the \\"inside scoop\\" but I felt that the true stories were manipulated to make each seem more entertaining.

If you've ever been to an NHL hockey game and sat behind the penelty box this book is for you! I couldn't put this book down when I got it. The author is a brilliant writer and is very entertaining. I loved the different stories of him in the NHL. My favorite story was when he was in Colorado and had to site in that goalkeeper box on wheels and it started rolling backwards. Film at eleven!

Not only would someone who has played the game for many years enjoy this book, but it is also for the fan that has never stepped out onto the ice. I couldn't put it down until I finished it.

I want to hear good juicy stories from an NHL insider....and there are precious few in this book. And Freebergs posture of cowering in the corner everytime his penalty box door opened got real old, real fast.

The one my Dad had always had a good coat of rust and mud on it. it was one of the first tools we used when starting a new house. Compared to a fiberglass tape, there's no comparison. With a fiberglass tape, the windier the day the harder you tend to pull, to stop the tape from fluttering, this causes stretching. Read\\"inaccuracy\\". A steel tape has weight. This weight helps reduce flutter and WILL NOT STRETCH! Lay out your new house,room addition,garden spot,driveway or whatever you need 100' of measuring capacity for with a tape that you can drop into a tool belt pocket or a jacket pocket. Compact, efficient, there's one in my truck right now and I think Dad's is in my shop. You buy two and leave Dad's alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived with faulty winding mechanism","review":"I never had a chance to try the tape.

I had to return this tape for a refund.Very poor quality control when the mechanism does not work right out of the box. Another piece of junk made in China.I've come to accept that Stanley no longer makes tapes that last the test of time. I typically replace my tapes every couple of years when the winder invariably fails to unwind or wind. In contrast my fathers Stanley tape measure has been working great for over 30 years! If anyone can recommend a tape measure they still make with the pride they made in my fathers day then please post a comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"It is frustrating making cards with this product.

My wife created a fully personalized card (i.e. from scratch) and printed it in less than half an hour. Granted, you will not be getting all the bells and whistles that other packages out there have, but at this price it's quite a bargain.My only qualm is that the program is indeed a bit \\"heavy\\" on system resources and if you're doing an extravagant piece of card, it will be slow to work with and print.Over all, it's a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better","review":"This product is ok in that it saves you money on buying cards, but I have NEVER been able to make a calendar.

If you purchase this, it will inevitably break, and if you try to fix it, you will finally end up with nothing left of the cable as you will have to continually fix it.My recommendation is to look for a kinsington or some other third party adapter. I am currently looking for a different one, however, in the mean time, I'm probably going to have to suck it up and buy another one.Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"AC adapter for T61: 42T5008","review":"Today I saw the break in the cable.

It is not a real hat, that would have been fine if the crown fit like it did in the picture. There was no depth on the bonnet so the hat was useless.My daughter with out any prompting was so disappointed. She said \\"why did the company lie and send me this dress? It is nothing like the picture and the color is a different green\\" (much brighter), she said. I packed up the dress and still need to mail it back for a refund.

The lyrics are thoughtful (Rik always writes great lyrics) and the music beyond the talent level of almost all of the current, popular musicians we have today.Give it a listen, you won't be disappointed! I have quite a collection of old Triumph and other recordings featuring this artist, and this is by far my favorite.Emmett's own description is interesting. \\"It is a collection of 14 cuts, 12 songs and 2 guitar pieces, all pretty much centered on the theme of the three abiding graces, faith, hope and love, and trying to find my way to them through the spirit of music, songwriting, and the arts and crafts of guitar playing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Overproduced, but excellent","review":"Coming from a long time fan of Triumph, this review may be a bit biased.

Though it had a good run, I would have expected more from it (especially for the price) The drive almost never reached it's max speed of 52x, and the drive did produce many coasters (ruined cds). The drive was also very picky about the kind of disk it liked to burn on, and would often come up with disk errors while closing a burned disk, or sometimes would not even start burning. I have used this drive with Toast and iTunes, occasionally with successful results, though often with not. Now it won't start burning, though my computer recognizes it, and it won't even read disks. I have plugged it into other computers to double check (making sure it's not just my computer) and it simply would not start burning disks. Avoid this one. The two stars are for the 80-100 successful burns I had with this (at a cost of about 50-80 ruined disks).

Without question, I went back to Stanley for a new Level Lock. My new lever lock is always sticking in locked position and the last four feet of tape rarely zips back in without help.

I remodel kitchens and bathrooms...also have a shop for building cabinets. My partner and I used the old style Leverlock until the new improved version came out. I bought as many old styles as I could find at hardware stores and on eBay when the change was made. Now we are out of good tape measures. My partner buys a simple green locking tape from Wal-Mart, and I struggle with the old remaining tapes looking for a good replacement tape insert that isn't the cost of a case of beer. I have used a few of the knock-offs from Sears, but they seem to have stopped making those too (black wasn't any good anyway). One of the biggest problems I had with the ball shaped new style was I couldn't quickly set it on a counter or bench. It would roll off. The old box style just stayed there. Sorry Stanley, get some new engineers to re-think the tape measure. This is like the New Coke."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCAM","review":"The picture you see is NOT what you will receive.

When they changed to the inferior new version, I stocked up on a whole bunch of the old ones but I've broken them all now. The new version INFURIATES me, on a daily basis. I agree with all the other excoriating reviews, and will add new reasons to hate it: 1) I am absolutely dependent on after-market tape measure scratch pads - but they are ROUND, and the place to put it on the new LeverLock is oval. UGH 2)For inside corner measurements, I like to lay the tape and tape measure out and add 3\\" (conveniently the width of the old LeverLock). But the new one is all rounded-like, and it isn't possible to do the add-3\\"-trick DAMMIT.It wasn't broke - Stanley oh Stanley why did you have to fix it???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, junk, junk!","review":"Stanley: Why do you sell such poor quality JUNK!

This one broke after 1 week because the spring could no longer retract. In addition, the gauge of tape and its coating was not as good as the one I had before.

The tape is flimsy and is constantly bending even at a 4 foot interval. The markings are vague even when new and wear off easily. The retract design requires your fingers to be where the tape retracts and often pinches your fingers. I have lost count of how many times I've thrown this thing across my shop in disgust. Too bad, Stanley used to have a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the worst but sad for a famous name","review":"I must agree with the majority here. I'm always ready to try an \\"improved\\" model -- but this has broken now after very little occasional use and will no longer lock. I'll be looking for something like the old style to replace it. You can certainly buy worse/cheaper tapes than this but it's sad to see what has become of what used to be a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage!","review":"I'm a professional carpenter and was a loyal user of the old model of the Leverlock. This new version completely and utterly stinks. Moreover than just the design being pitiful, I believe the tape itself to be of poorer quality now as well - I had two break off right near the 1\\" line within three weeks time. I gave the new style an honest chance. NEVER AGAIN. I wish I could give less that 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sure don't make them like they used to","review":"I had the old neon leverlock tapes for over 6 years. Until I used them to do outside work in the mud they were the most dependable tapes I had ever owned. Unfortunately, they're no longer manufactured or available anywhere and they replaced them with crap.The new leverlock has some major flaws. Among them are; excessive play in the hook end, uncomfortable new case (too rounded), leverlock looks and feels flimsy and doesn't look as though it would survive a drop from an 8 foot ladder although i didn't get a chance to test a drop. This did not have a chance to fail from the previously memtioned gripes. The tape was stepped on and tore in half instantly. Extremely unusual.I recommend you stay away from the new line of leverlocks. The only good ones were the Neon models from years ago. If anyone knows where to find the Neon Leverlock Tapes (25' or 30') new, please post it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"old style leverlock was much better","review":"I do estimates for a living and spend a lot of time measuring. The old style Leverlock was far superior to this new version. The button that allows the tape to either stay locked or reel back in seems to have a mind of its own and makes it difficult to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old style rules. New style stinks","review":"I have also been using the old style of stanley leverlocks from there original production.I am a professional plumber and use a tape constantly in every type of situation. When i saw the new style tape stanley created I thought that it looked great but soon found out that they were a peice of junk the aforementioned button was a big hang up for me i would cut off the clip that would hold the lever in place. but over all the whole design is flawed. The old style of leverlock held up much better. I keep my old leverlock case and purchase the stanley powerlocks and change out the guts but my old case is almost woreout and no longer locks with the lever so i am looking for a replacement now. i wouldent have a new style leverlock if you gave it to me to much of a headache when it fails on the job.i have had the case i have now for about four years and changed the blade about once a year. I suggest that you steer away from this tape if you use one a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"twisted tape","review":"I too agree the old neon leverlock tape rules were better. Aside from design defects with the casing, the gauge of the tape appears to be thinner. Mine is twisted out of shape for the first 12 inches. This makes it impossible for it to grab as you drag the tape along an object. The \\"tooth\\" no longer faces down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great tool gone bad!","review":"The bulbous shape makes accurate inside measurements nearly impossible. That goofy little sliding button determines whether the blade will lock or not, regardless of user preference, and on mine, stopped working entirely after about a month (permanently unlocked).

However, I'm a professional carpenter and I use a tape measure daily. I loved the old style of this tape - I HATE this one! It's awkward and fits in a tool-belt tape holder like a round peg in a square hole. I wish the \\"think tank\\", that probably never cut a piece of wood in their collective lives mind you, that had the idea to change the design of this tape, would just change it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I've not used the old style leverlock mentioned here but the new model on its own is junk. My complaints are similar to many: poor retraction, the lock button has a mind of its own, the lock mechanism (not the button but the portion that secures the tape from retracting) on one of my 5 leverlock tapes failed and lastly the blades are flimsy. Two of my blades broke after a few days and replacement blades cost more than the tape measure itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lever Lock became Lever Almost Lock","review":"I am a professional carpenter and have used the LeverLock tapes since I was a sales clerk in a hardware store 25 years ago. The only problem that I had with the original was that the case would crack after repeated drops, and that the clip would then spin on the case. I never had any other problems. The new one is ALL problems. My biggest one is that it doesn't quite lock (the case continues to slide away when suspended), and that the first couple of feet of the blade become illegible after a few uses.

The songwriting, clean vocals, and guitars are second rate in comparison to earlier releases. I truly miss Ole's voice, guitar playing and influence in the song writing on this album.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal...?","review":"I don't want to go on a curse course about Extol, just quickly point out the things that made me rate this the way I did. The guitars are noticeably less skilled than when Ole and Christer were playing. There is no distortion to make this a \\"metal\\" album, it's really just a watered down set of strummed chords in each song. It's nice to know that Peter Espevoll can sing cleanly, and it makes you wonder why he didn't do it before and Ole had to do it all, but nonetheless ... Ole's voice was so epic and noble seeming. Peter does okay, but it doesn't really save the music. The double bass drum kicks are completely gone. I read somewhere a comparison to newer Deftones, I would say that accurately fits this album. I listened to Extol to be what they were, or at least still resembled it as they progressed, this is really nothing like Burial, Undeceived, and in all reality is considerably less heavy than even Synergy.

Excellent buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bird book around, perfect for beginners","review":"This book is fantastic for new bird watchers. I have a copy in my house, one in my car and have given several as gifts! The book is organized by the color of the bird so you don't have to guess where to start. Find a bird, if it has color on it turn to the appropriate pages and identify your bird.

After 3 years, I am down to three (I lost two and bent one*), but they have been sufficient for most jobs. They are made in the USA, they are relatively inexpensive, and they get the job done.

This only happens if you use a screwdriver that is too small for the intended target, so it was user-error."},{"rating":"1","title":"not acceptable","review":"the book was admitably a first edition paperback, but was missing pages 73-80; if it had the missing pages, i would classify it as readable, not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"These wings are not white","review":"These wings are less white and more fleshy pink with purple highlights. I bought them with the matching tail looking for costume parts to go with a silver dragon mask, and they're not the right color at all. Very disappointing!The wings are only textured on one side (the front) with the other side being mostly smooth. It's not noticeable from a distance, but once you're up close, it's not a great effect.The rubbery texture is durable, and looks like it would last quite a long time. I've used them for two halloweens (without the non-matching mask) and they hold up well to abuse. The harness that holds them to your back consists of two velcro straps, and it is quite sturdy. I would recommend hiding the harness by cutting two wing-holes in an old jacket or something for a better effect.Now to find some white dragon wings that actually match my mask. Maybe I'll cut these wings apart and use the sturdy wire frame inside the rubber to build something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book gives you all the important information that you need.

However, it does not give any information on what percentage of admissions are legacies, siblings, students given preferential status for being children of faculty, board members, etc. That would certainly be very interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4-year-old daughter is enthralled by this book!","review":"What makes this book great is the manipulatives -- the removable, miniature items like the comb and brush, mirror, lipstick, and so on. The pieces are lightweight cardboard and will perhaps become dog-eared over time, but only with the huge amount of pleasure that they will bestow upon my daughter. She received this book 2 weeks ago as a gift, and although she can read every word of it herself, she asks me to read it to her every night at bedtime. Along with reading it to her, I take out the comb and pretend to brush her hair, open the makeup case and pretend to put blush on her cheeks...we have a lot of fun with pretend play with this book.This book would be a perfect recital gift for a young ballerina or a sure-to-please birthday gift for any young girl who loves to dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"good story, poor quality product","review":"Cute pictures, nice idea, but manipulatives are not quality materials.

Everything he sings whether good or bad it's beautiful,because he's Sinatra. No one can touch him no one ever could. Nat King Cole is the only other artist who can sing something and inspire a feeling. Sinatra can take you to a place, that no one else can. He's the best and this is a wonderful collection of some of his most memerable works. Though some of my personal favorites are \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\", \\"Under my Skin\\", and \\"Last Dance\\", but this cd does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, Frank's the Man!","review":"This is the Sinatra material that gets the most play at my house. All of the material is pure gold: Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn, Harold Arlen, Hoagy Carmichael, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern. It's got the arrangers, too: Nelson Riddle, Johnny Mandel, Billy May, Quincy Jones. It's from the early 60s, and I really prefer his voice at this point, it's a little warmer and more knowing, more sophisticated, the voice of a grown man, not a kid--he's been around the block a couple of times, and he knows what he's singing about. His timing, pitch, and nuance is the stuff of legend, and here it is displayed so well. I can't think of a better collection for newcomers, but it should also satisy the aficionado (my mom is a former \\"bobby-soxer\\" and she loves it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless pleasures","review":"All the faves are here,....\\"Summer Wind,\\" \\"Strangers in the Night,\\" \\"That's Life,\\" \\"Somethin' Stupid,\\" AND the best - \\"Night and Day.\\" Glorious music, powerful emotion and endless thrills. Sinatra remade a lot of his early stuff, and the fire is still evident in these nuggets. even if you are not a Sinatra fan, this is an excellent buy...and a great way to get into the music, and learn about the American pop classics. Nancy says bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank is the Best Ever","review":"By far one of the best albums ever. You can't help but fall in love with each song, not to mention Frank's sweeping voice. This album is great for listening, singing along to, even dancing too. I've never liked any artist more than I like Frank Sinatra in THE VERY BEST OF FRANK SINATRA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentail listening....","review":"To be short: I agree with all the 5 stars recommendations, and if you are looking for some of the greatest music of all time, this is the compilation!I recommend this double cd more than the one cd Very best of, just e.g. because the song Stardust is included in this one.But its not the only breathtaking song.I never listened to him so much before, but now I am a fan.Very very higly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect collection of a perfect crooner","review":"This is not so much a review of the \\"Chairman of the Board.\\" There are very few people who would dare do that! What I liked about this compilation is that they went for songs that are really close to my heart.Even though 2 CDs are not enough to exhibit the repertoire of this genius, Reprise Records has done an admirable task of compiling a nice cross section of songs between 1960 and 1970. This fits just perfectly in my Sinatra collection for that decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra brings down the House","review":"Nobody has or had a voice like Sinatra. \\"The Very Best of Frank Sinatra\\"is a fantastic collection.

With Sinatra's music, you can't lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a beautiful thing","review":"I am an artist of more hands on work, but I know artistic style when I see an hear it. I recently fell in love with the song \\"The way you look tonight\\", by Frank. Ever since I heard that song, I have loved every other song that he has sone. Although I love the song, for some reason it is very hard to find on any collection or CD of his. This collection offers me this wonderful song, as well as all of the other classics that I have grown to love. What an Artist, and unforgetable one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable CD","review":"This is a great CD set, especially if you are a Frank Sinatra fan and don't already own a lot of his stuff. I only have one complaint (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). When I listened to these CDs on my stereo at home, the balance between Sinatra's voice and the band was fine. But when I listened to it with headphones on my commute (on an MP3 player), the band way overpowered Sinatra. But this flaw outweighs the overall quality and enjoyment of the CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love You Frank !!!","review":"Ahhhhh they dont make em like Frankie any more and they sure broke the mould when they made him. I was taken by surprise recently, having watched the movie \\"What a Woman Wants\\" and I was totally hooked. I got Sinatra fever and found myself playing New York, New York and Strangers in the Night so loudly reality melted into the background. What's even more scarey is that younger and younger generations are enjoying his music and are not afraid to confess it. So yes, I'll do it my way and confess I get a kick out of you, a passion I dont think I'll lose to the summer wind and I want to be a part if it. Cliches aside, this is a wonderful double cd with all the old classics that thrill and remind you of an age when singers like Frank were common.Definately one that you'll get under your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know it was \\"like New\\" used.","review":"I was going to give it as a christmas present but the CD case is broken! it was packed with another order and probably got banged around. will have to try and find another case it may fit in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fank is the best.","review":"This is a great cd and I wish that today's young people would acknowledge him and realize that he was and is still the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice But Not All Original Recordings","review":"I'm a stickler for getting original recordings, preferably remastered. Still, there are lots of great song titles here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the VERY BEST!","review":"Music is suppose to transport you in a sense, and alter your mood. These discs have that effect. I have to admit I am a little dismayed with today's musicians, many of whom focus on bitter, or degrading lyrics. This classic CD set is filled with romance, hope, optimistism and a classic voice that resonates beautifully. These are definitely Frank's best and I was not disappointed.

The volume is literally silent at one and two bars and then jumps to quite loud at three bars (of a possible sixteen). I suppose this means you could really crank it, but I can't find a station that isn't nearly all static.

Verdict = spend more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Portable","review":"I received the Radio Shack-branded version of the same radio for Christmas.It can fit in your pocket, clip to your shirt or belt, or you can wear it around your neck. It does what it's supposed to, with fairly intuitive controls. The audio quality, though not perfect, is pretty good for a small unit; a bass boost function is included.It works best outside; using it inside might compromise signal quality and strength, but that is true with every other portable radio of this type I've used.

Its digital tuner works well and has lots of memory to save stations to presets. Has a clock display when turned off. All push button control, and a lock button, so nothing 'moves' while jogging with it, even without the lock on. Decent reception, but it seems lose reception if carried in a pocket. The belt clip works OK, but it came off once; I used the lanyard as a safety tether so it didn't hit the ground. The sound is pretty good, but not 'high end', the DBSS switch adds subtle bass. The included earphones are cheap, and better replaced with something decent. So far, the battery life seems good.

In the age of MP3 players finding a good radio is like looking for the holy grale. Anyway, I bought this one at CVS for $10 and it works ok for it's price. However, even the station broadcasting only 10 miles away are fuzzy, especially if it's cloudy or going to rain. AM stations are the weakest and I can't get the stations in from only 10 miles away either. I would say as a general rule, don't buy Coby, not even for jogging purposes, the stations don't stay put, they get fuzzy or fade out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"Don't waste your money.

It's upbeat and cheerful, with music that let's my mind wander into very real imagry. The first five pieces alone make the CD worth the investment. But the entire package is a delight, and a monument to the musicians behind it. MacBrides is a wonderful rolicking storm of sound, and Call to the Dance won't let your feet or your head rest until the last note plays.Try it. It'll open a whole new world of music to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor production from a talented group","review":"After seeing Leahy on PBS's \\"Gael Force\\" , this album proved disappointing to say the least. Ten painfully repetitious tunes, of which only half could be called Celtic. A few are downright depressing. Definitley not an album to play at parties. Look for my copy for sale on Ebay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this recorded in MONO","review":"I'm afraid I was dissapointed with this CD. The music while having momentum, lacked energy. I admit it was fun watching them on PBS. One easily was taken up with their fast pace performance. Seeing them perform though, masked the fact that the album felt very flat. There was little heart behind the music. I'm sorry to say this is one album that I should not have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"A very powerful and moving CD. \\"B Minor\\" opens the album and you couldn't ask for a more explosive way to start, while \\"The Coulin\\" brings the set to a mellow finish. 5 Stars and two thumbs up to the Canadian family."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly mastered","review":"fiddles drums synthes I was at the concert and nothing compared to them intel this it moved me Buy it thats all to be said"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Leahy CD is catchy at points, but misses a central theme","review":"Listening to this CD is refreshing... it starts really well, providing catchy tunes up 'til track five, all following a somewhat Irish tradition. The second part of the CD leaves the Irish music and goes to more general violin-based tunes (gipsy-music and the like), still good stuff, but in general having less quality than the first part.Therefore I rate this CD only a 7: were the second part in the same style as the first it certainly would have been higher; now I unfortunately have the impression the group \\"had to fill the CD with in total 10 songs\\".Still, the violin-player of the group certainly masters his instrument, no doubt from me in that area."},{"rating":"1","title":"much better in concert...not on a CD","review":"I thought the music was rushed and not capturing the true talents of the artists.

The locking mechanism is terrible, the crank is sticky, and it makes an obnoxious creaking noise. The Irwin is far superior and costs less. I'm going to try a Tajima next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I got this line because it came with the String level, which I have yet to use. I'd recomend a cheaper string line, this one reels in quickly, but it's not that big on an advantage, I find it difficult to get the handle out to reel in the line, and it doesn't lock very well.It does the job but so to many less expencive chalk lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elsewhere","review":"I didn't even get past the test stage before I found out how bad these are. Wish i'd read the reviews here first.I bought it yesterday, filled it today and thought I'd give it a quick test. I pulled the cord out to its extent and began reeling it in. I got about 3/4 of the way when the line started to bind. I thought it was the chalk interefering. Well, one more try - pull it back out and start over. Once it started binding again I tried to push through it. I stopped when I thought I'd snap off the handle. When I tried to pull it out again, it wouldn't. I unscrewed the cap and found it was binding in the foam. Apparently the foam rubbed on the line and caused a ball of fuzz to form ahead of the line that then caused pressure on the line. This then stripped the first few cords off the line, rendering it useless. Strange but true. I'll be looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it 0","review":"This chalk line can be summed up in one word: terrible. Like other reviewers, I have numerous other FatMax tools, and all work well. This line is extremely sticky, making it VERY slow and cumbersome to let out and reel in. Chalk goes everywhere, line sucks, basically as soon as I get to the hardware store to buy a new one, this is going in the trash. Gimmicks include some Sharpie and a viewing window to see how much chalk you have. Do not fall for it.A true waste of 8 dollars or whatever it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I bought one of these last year, and when I went to use it, it is terrible. When you pull the line out, chalk goes all over the place, and it is a big, fat, fuzzy string that leaves a big, fat, fuzzy line. totally worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for 8 bucks","review":"A lot faster to use than my old irwin, the handle is out of the way when stringing it out, has held up for 6 months of daily use on the job, I've seen a lot of irwin chalk boxes with broken handles. The line level is relatively useless though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter sweet comedy in a classic sense","review":"Jack Lemmon and Barbara Harris were a perfect match in this classic comedy. The special effects with the cartoon drawings incorporated into the movie were excellent. I first saw this movie when I was a kid and it still makes me laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"All That and Thurber, Too","review":"What most reviewers miss about this romantic comedy is that it's primo for its style -- Good Neighbor Sam, Please Don't Eat the Daisies -- and they decided to spice up the montages by animating Thurber comics (since the central figure is a misanthropic cartoonist who falls in love in spite of himself). It's an old fashioned comedy, funny like they used to be: two dimensional characters, a conflicting love interest (Jason Robards taking a break from O'Neill for a change) interjected to put the heat on and help things come to a boil, and a flock of children each responding to the situation in a different way -- like the second tier comedia del arte characters. Give yourself a break, get a bottle of wine, a pizza, and a friend with a sense of humor and make an evening of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Havn't seen it since I was a kid.","review":"The product came on time and in excellent condition.

A tragedy had occurred in my neighborhood and I could not sleep at night. The book had been recommended by a friend who said it had also come into her life at a much needed time. I read from it every night before I sleep. The peace and comfort it provides is immeasurable. It is the most comfort I have found. The language, the quotes, the references are splendid examples of a talented writer and this talent ministers well to others. It is a blessing!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"glad I tried it","review":"I enjoy reading different books written about the 23rd Psalm. This one, though was not my favorite, although it's just me.

I was halfway thru the book earlier in the week and was going to give up, but I hate not finishing a book. There is nothing more unsatisfying than a bad book.

I'm sorry, but this book just did nothing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Debut","review":"Strand's novel captures with sympathy and sharp insight the delicate machinations of family dynamics. No character is stagnant and no one gets off easy in this drama that spans only a few days, but which, through the elastic spring of the characters' memories, uncovers the motivations and mysteries of several lifetimes. A wonderful work of elegant naturalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guide can help you live a better life","review":"This is an important book. I would say it is especially important for those whose conception of Judaism is limited to learning and learning alone. It teaches the importance of walking in the way of G-d, doing kindness to others, showing consideration for them. ' Derech eretz' is required of every Jew.

I was not disappointed. This movie is made like the comedies of the 80's... a genre I happen to love. Sure, this is not a genre of high art, it is bathroom humor, and great bathroom humor at that. Bazookas achieves what todays teen comedies fail at, Non-PC, gratuitous laughs. If you liked movies like \\"American Pie\\" or \\"Superbad\\", bazookas is for you.The girls are beautiful, the guys are hilarious, and the whole movie took me back to the time when my friends and I would \\"sneak\\" in to R rated movies.If you are looking for a fun escape for an hour and a half, I highly recommend Bazookas, The Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny movie","review":"Bazookas is a solid comedy kinda like National Lampoon movies. There are some pretty funny parts and there are some good-looking girls who end up showing their \\"bazookas\\". I rented this first on VOD and then I ended up buying the DVD for the extras. $15 is a little steep but I got it for a few bucks cheaper from another seller. I gave 5 stars because the movie was funnier than I was expecting (I laughed out loud 2 times which is kinda rare) and for the eye candy. The first scene of the movie was probably worth the price alone when a hot busty girl plays strip raquetball. (That might be the real reason I got the DVD! Haha.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive for True Independent Filmmaking","review":"I was impressed with this little film form independent filmmaker Thundercrack. It had pretty good production values for such a true independent filmmaker. The characters where endearing, yet funny. The stereotyping was fine, it didn't take away from the plot or the intent of the movie. I want to see a part two. I was thinking of way to help Angus the whole time. I will definitely look for more films by them, and just hope and wish upon a star that we can see more of the actress whole played the gym's accontant on screen. I don't mean the nudity either, although there wasn't much and they didn't use it gratituously. Overall I gave it a four out of five, because frankly I wanted more of the accountant on screen. This is definitely something to check out if you don't mind the low budget stuff, it's kind of in that realm of risky business for fast times at ridgemont high. I look forward to more stuff from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible and the script is even worse.

To be concise, too much froth and not anough pith. While I loved the premise of this book, I was sorely let down when it wasn't developed. I think Tom White gets too bogged down with long and rambling descriptives and loses site of the message he intended. The reader gets glimpses of awe, spirituality and a genuine epiphany but these are few and far between and the surface is just scratched and interest peaked when drowning by words, takes over. I wanted to love this little book with a giant message. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply einstein by Dr. Wolfson","review":"I read all the reviews.....bought the book......but on page 137 I finally threw the book down in disgust. It does not clarify relativity.It is totally confusing as to which frame of reference he's using.Its use of diagrams as examples for clarity is laughable and not helpful. I made it through medical school so I can't think that I'm unteachable. I have Dr. Wolfson's teaching company dvd's and like him. BUT.....this book is of no help. I am utterly at a loss , using what I learned from this book, to explain relativity to someone. I cannot recommend this book. Those that have read this book, I defy you to explain length contraction to me clearly.I'm sending it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, Sorry. Keep looking.","review":"I bought this book with the hope that the reviews were true. Oops. Wolfson has a problem with two things: punctuation and clarity. The punctuation can be forgiven as the overexuberance of the non-professional writer. (His use of exclamation points reminds me of a bad paper in a freshman lit. course.) The main problem here is his clarity. He's just not good at explaining things. Further, he has a tendency to meander away from the point and toward minutiae. The result is that the reader is left muttering, 'Hey wait a minute...Go Back. WHY is it that way?' The book promises to clarify relativity - and while it's clear that the author is just having a wonderful time - the book fails. Keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing ive bought this year!","review":"This is by far the best purchase I have made all year.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Special Relativity!","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers. This is an outstanding book that clearly explains Special Relativity. In particular, it has simple examples and outstanding figures that clearly explain Time Dilation and Simultaneity and the what is so special about the speed of light.With General Relativity, this book is less successful because GR is far more complicated and requires high-level math. But it still summarizes the key points.I've read a number of other books on SR and this is the best by far. I recently read \\"It's about Time\\", which is highly rated by some but I found it to be near incomprehensible compared to this gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Clear, and Entertaining","review":"The book was a very enjoyable for the layman. I didn't have any difficulty in following the discussion. He not only discussed Einstein's Theory of Relativity, but also presented some of the previous theories throughout history. For instance, he describes ether which was at one time believed to be the medium through which light propagates.By the time I was finished with the book, I felt like I understood the intuitions behind relativity. I could also answer the questions I had about relativity prior to reading this book. An example: If a space ship is traveling at near the speed of light and an object inside the ship is accelerated, why can't it reach the speed of light?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I never thought I would say it, but - I really don't care for this new album by one of Hawaii's premier vocal groups. They mention in the liner notes about \\"going in a new direction.\\" Well ladies, in my opinion it's the wrong one. They've hooked themselves up with a new producer, and guess what: it's over produced! Synthesizers, unnecessary string arrangements, etc. - you get the idea. Na Leo has gained many fans over the years with their great vocal harmonies and they just don't need all this extra junk! They even felt compelled to remake one of their most beautiful classics, Flying With Angels. This whole album ends up coming off like just one more pop song confection with little substance.

Thinking it might be a bad unit, I returned the product and took home a replacement. Well, this time, I was about 1 hour into my first movie when the unit again began vibrating, freezing up, etc. In portable mode, the unit played OK.

As teacher candidates, we quickly realized that this book could be integrated into all subject areas. This book helps children of today relate with Hattie and the struggles she faced in the 1800's.

And the way the author made the charectors and events real captured my attention throughout the entire book! Though the book was great, I reccomend it for readers ages 10-12. It's great for people who already know about the oregan trail, and especially for those who don't. Out of all the Dear America books, I say this was the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great story, of Hattie Campell and her journey west","review":"This is a wonderful book.

I love to study history, so the books are perfect. Some other idea's that I have thought of for future books are a diary of a girl during the war of 1812, or world war 1&2.

Across the Wide and Lonesome Prairie just brings the hardships and toils of the Oregon Trail to life, like a movie or event you've never seen before. This book has a lot of romance, suspense, and shows a lot of dept for history.When I first read this book, all I could do was just sit back and imagine what Hattie's family felt when they saw Oregon looked like for the first time. Or how they felt when they crossed rivers and rapids. There's a lot of dangers and adventures in this book, and it just makes me admire the courage of the pioneers of the 1840s. How they made it to a new land still amazes me.This book is so fantastic and amazing. It just brings the year 1848 to life all over again. Great job Christina Gregory!!

I remember at night I would open up my book and I'd read about 30 pages or so. For most eleven year old it's a hard task to read that many pages because most kids are to busy playing Play Station or something but to me it was quit a pleasure because this book just really captured me. Sometimes I'd just get so caught up in this story and it felt like I was traveling on the trail with Hattie. I just can't tell how much I love the book. I would recamend this book to anyone who loves a little adventure and who loves the Oregon Trail. This book truely couldn't be put down! Awesome book Mrs.Gregory.

The next Dear America book that I want to get is Early Sunday Morning, The Pearl Harbor Diary of Amber Billows. I want to read this book because I like Hawaii and I want to live there someday.

The captin of the steam boat felt sorry, so he said he would give Pa and the family a free ride anywhere. Pa gathered up all their belongings and headed to Oregan. Hattie and her family went through so much when traveling to oregan. Her friends died, oxen and mules died. Mrs. Kenker stole when folks weren't looking.

Miss Sutherland, because of advancing years, is not in the same vocal form as she was when she was younger. That's life. But, even so,her singing here is amazing. She brought the house down after singing The Mad Scene, and rightly so.Pablo Elvira is an excellent Enrico, as is Paul Plishka singing Raimondo. My carping is directed at Alfredo Kraus singing Edgardo.This is purely subjective and there probably will be many who will disagree, but I always found Mr. Kraus lacking innate fire and also chemistry with his leading ladies.

There, she was in glorious voice and sang so beautifully. I'm always amazed. Here in this performance her voice is thick and mushy. It's really inferior if you contrast the two. And as always, her acting is below par (which is unacceptable, once you've seen fiery performances by Callas in the role). I'm sorry, I'm just plain disappointed. By the way, is there an earlier performance by sutherland as lucia?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a pretty voice like a million others....","review":"Sutherland was in her time a very famous soprano, and arguably still is. And that just boggles my mind. I'm sorry, but to me, she is nothing but a canary...and not a very good one either. If you think sutherland is magnificent and can think of nothing better, boy, are you missing out on the beauty and splendor of opera. Once upon a time there were \\"singing-actresses\\" - sopranos who knew opera was more than just a pretty voice - Callas was one of them. Compared to Callas' dramaticism and incredible ability to convey every heart-felt emotion, Sutherland sounds like someone reading off a grocery list. Ask yourself this - is opera ONLY about hitting the high notes? Take my advice, listen to callas, and you'll never be the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sutherland is not Lucia -- she is far too old in this version","review":"and too large (compared to Edgardo).

By the time this DVD was recorded, Dame Joan no longer had the beautiful high notes she once possessed. Her voice is now droopy, her Italian slurred by some strange force of nature. In other words, her Lucia is a maddening disaster. Callas and Sills and Moffo at least brought some justice to the role, and throughout their career, the good Lucias were preserved on record. Sutherland was a vocally good Lucia, but she lacked drama, an essential component to the bel canto school of singing. Thank goodness Alfredo Kraus was there to save the performance.And for the demented Callas basher, don't bring your [...] around here. Callas' genius does not deserve to be insulted by the despondent pool of dumbness [...] that you come from. She can sing Lucia around dame Joan and you know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Prima donna","review":"Joan Sutherland as Lucia. I guess the only reason I can't give it a five star is because I have tapes of Sutherland in the 1960-1970 that puts the voice in a totally different category. Yes, she was still great here, 1983. But her performances in the complete bell telephone hour is so superior to the one here that you would not recognize it. But as huge fans of the Dame, of course we have to have everything that she ever did. But for the new opera buff who wants to see why Sutherland is widely regarded as the greatest coloratura of all time, I suggest he look elsewhere, such as the bell telephone hour set, or the age of bel canto set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best presentation of International Trade","review":"This book is horrible.

He's blind (figuratively), obstinate, and a taker. Lane makes the mistake of telling us what the characters are like rather than revealing them by their words and actions. The latter rarely match her descriptions. Some might say that her characters are flawed, but I found them unsavory (except Richard and Sophie). Yes, a good villaness, but it's hard to believe she got away with all she did. So often, I just couldn't believe that things happened as they did, or that so many characters were so clueless -- and repeated the same mistakes so often. Lane even threw in extraneous obstacles that had no basis in the story. One at the end, in particular, is suddenly held up -- out of nowhere -- as a possible reason for Emily to refuse Jacob.

They were my first favorite band. I watched MTV hours on end just to see REO on TV. This album has one of the best power ballads of all time in \\"Keep On Loving You.\\" Gary Richrath's \\"Take it on the Run,\\" is one of the best songs about infidelity I have ever heard. \\"Tough Guys\\" featuring the Little Rascals (TV show) beginning is neat. \\"Out of Season\\" is one of REO's best rockers. This album even has a neat Bruce Hall song \\"Someone Tonight.\\" It has it all. Of course, the hits \\"Don't Let Him Go\\" and \\"In Your Letter\\" are included and make this a great novelty record.

Couldn't find this one at the Depot or Lowes, so I Amazoned it. Heavier hammers make my arm fatigued after a brief period, so I like the 16 oz.'er. This one has a nice foam handle, good for no-mar tamping of boards and fine work. Rip claw is great for demo. Grey shaft matches my hair. All in all, a nice hammer, but time will tell. Will review it again after another 30 years or so. BTW, Stanley sent me a replacement for my old hammer, but they sent me a 22 oz. Fat Max. Will probably use this as a mini-sledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for Yankees fans","review":"The New York Yankees are the greatest sports franchise ever.

It's great for beginners or advanced sewers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only fitting book!!","review":"Before I puchased this book I was almost ready to give up sewing. I only made clothes that were bulky and not stylish and still was not very happy. I now have clothes with sleeves that are big enough and sholders that don't fall off.

The problem was, I have specific, difficult fitting issues - flat, low seat, small waist, big thighs - which this book does not cover. So, if all you need to do is add width or length, this book is probably ok. It sounded great in theory - slide, mark, trace - but in reality I could not even come close to a good fit in pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting Finesse","review":"Order came quickly and the book was in great condition.

It's taken a bit of time, but here it is, and it's definitely worth the $12. The CD stays true to their low-fi sound, with grinding guitars and biting social commentary from Casey Chaos; I don't know where anyone would get that amen is one person, with a touring band-- there are credits for a whole band in the liner notes, but opinions aside, this CD is worth your money if you're willing to subject yourself to something as brutish and solid as Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone got a safety pin I can borrow?","review":"Oh I seeee, its a SPOOF of a punk band.Sorry I only just got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star to many","review":"Amen seems to be like any other punk rock band to grace us with its unnecessary pressence, power chords, bad vocals, and of course, not quite correct English in the lyrics. With all that aside, it is fair to say that Amen sucks. Yes Amen sucks. I feel as though there is another way to describe it, but the best suiting description for this band is \\"they suck\\".Although Amen tours with a full band, Casey Choas performs almost every instrument on the album. Casey is unlike many other solo performers that bear names of bands like Steve Wilson, Trent Reznor, or Dan Swano. Casey Chaos is a bad musician. Dan Swano, Trent Reznor, and Steve Wilson created original, innovative music. Casey Chaos makes the same noise that sounds like every other punk rock band in this modern day.So if you're into wasting money, you're a so called hardcore punk, or you just like bad music, check this CD out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst archive that DC has put out","review":"The art and Bob Haneys stories make this just pablum.

First of all, yes, it is a big book, but it doesn't provide what it says it does. All it is is a big book of labels that you can copy to place on candy that you can give as appreciation gifts. The labels have messages that thank people in Children's Ministry for their service. This book is ONLY FOR CHILDREN'S MINISTRY VOLUNTEERS - it does not include appreciation ideas for any other areas of ministry. It is not at all what I thought and I will be sending it back right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a complete waste","review":"I got this book for free and I still feel like it was a waste. Honestly this book is nothing more than one idea presented in about 200 slight variations. The basic idea is that you take a piece of candy/whatever and attach a cheesy generic message to it. Not the worst idea I've ever heard, but certainly not a good one. In my opinion, giving someone an Orange and a tag that says \\"Orange you glad you volunteered\\" might make some laugh, but it's not exactly going to make people feel overly appreciated.The one thing this book does do is remind me that I need to put actual time and effort into appreciating my volunteers. It's a big purple reminder on my shelf that my volunteers deserve better.Come on, Gospel Light.

You will be much better prepared to tackle Nietzsche's own writing after reading this overview than you would be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Walter Kaufman is a scholar with a thorough knowledge of his subject.

It's best to stick to Nietzsche's own books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid, laughably prejudiced","review":"Kaufmann is a bore, and all his criticism and exposition is ludicrously inadequate and born from politico-theological lunacy, the kind Nietzsche intensely despised.

This to me is one of their best. I originally had a copy recorded on tape, then I decided to buy it on CD. I was very disappointed to hear that they redid all but 2 of the songs and cut out a lot of parts. Especially on \\"Save a Prayer\\" they took out half the song. I also really enjoyed the longer intro on \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" but that too was taken out. Which is really a shame. Overall it is still a great CD, there really is not a bad song on the whole thing. My favorites are \\"My Own Way\\" and \\"Save a Prayer\\".

Although the album has its share of weak moments, such as 'My Own Way' which is as banal as it ever was, this still stands as one of the best albums of the 1980s. 'Rio' is a happy, catchy, sing-along affair, but the album's truly great moments are 'Hungry like the wolf' 'Save a Prayer' and 'The Chauffeur', the latter of which is a truly interesting and original tune. Nostalgia aside, the Duran's have continued to be critically underrated in this decade.

These are truly LRB gems. They are a true down to earth band with a big sound to them. Reminiscing is about a man who wants his girl to go walking through the park with him and reminiscing about all the good times they had together. Happy Anniversary is about a man wishing his wife a Happy Anniversary and he can't get her off his mind. These two are true love songs. Lady is another love song. This man is telling his wife or girlfriend that he loves her reguardless of what she thinks.

Pollini (too cold for my taste), Arrau (too slow, unfortunately losing the whole picture), Gould (too inmature, he stays on the surface), Schnabel (too delicate, this is not Schubert!), Rosen (too standard, almost impersonal), among others, are good, don't get me wrong, but they can't compete with the other three.

A conspiracy is in the works that dethrones the Jurai Royal Family. Ayeka and Sasmi are now fugitives. A military force comes to arrest them for treason, but the Masaki home has 6 girls living there that can rival any military power in the universe. They thwart the plot to arrest Ayeka and Sasami, and take off in Kiyone's ship to overthrow the false emperor on Jurai. This is a great volume, we learn a bit about the princess' past and the mysterious new emperor, who was thought to be long dead. What is he after, what connection does he have to Grandfather, and can he be stopped? The action begins here.

I just can't stand the recordings. The songs sound distant and thin. They lack any kind of depth.

No complaint whatsoever on the material here. But what about the material that wasn't included? Nothing from \\"Venus And Mars\\" (a cardinal sin in my opinion) and tracks like \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" are missing. I understand that this album contained only the #1 hits, but there was plenty of great material to make this a double set. Fortunately, the upcoming \\"Wingspan (Hits and History)\\" does just that. For the cover art, Sir Paul directed that the statue be photographed on snow in Scotland. Points to anyone who can tell the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Introduction to the Works of Paul McCartney","review":"This is absolutely one of my favorite greatest hits releases of all time. Out of all the CD's I have purchased since I started a CD collection back in 1985, Wings Greatest is very likely the one I have played the most.The songs are timeless, and the instrumentations are very nicely arranged. The whole collection is ideal for the individual who wants to find inspiration and to look at the lighter side of things. This CD is quite therapeutic, for as I listened to what the man sang, it helped to calm me during some very turbulent and tumultuous times in college.Anyone who merely thinks that McCartney reduced his abilities to writing asinine, silly love songs after his collaborations with John Lennon fails to read the emotional depth conveyed between the music and the lyrics. Such people just ain't got no soul, man."},{"rating":"2","title":"not totally a wings package--but worthwhile","review":"WINGS GREATEST contains' two songs that are not Wings tracks \\"Another Day,\\" and \\"Uncle Albert.\\" And for some reason Paul left off \\"Listen To What The Man Said,\\" a 1975 Wings # 1 hit, (he did include it on later compilations). He also left off two more USA top ten hits \\"Helen Wheels,\\" and the live 1977 version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed-(which can only be found on the pricey \\"WINGS OVER AMERICA\\" live album). Paul must consider all 1970-1985 singles to be wings--even though technically Wings recorded from 1971-1981, for on his Wingspan collection from the late 1990s, he also mixes solo and wings tracks. Regardless, this is a worthwhile collection, there is not a \\"Hey Jude,\\" or \\"Yesterday,\\" in this collection, but in fairness to Paul--the 1970s were quite different from the 1960s.

For the record \\"Instant Karma\\" was released in the 1960's, not the 1970's. It was released while the Beatles were still extant. John Lennon's first solo album is absolutely brilliant. \\"Imagine\\" is a great album. George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is a very good album. Nobody but especial McCartney fans thinks that there is a McCartney album that comes close to these three, and the critical consensus has been all these years and remains that Wings was on a par with Abba, Barry Manilow, and Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in my home","review":"I guess I'm out of step with the other reviewers of this book.

Turns out that lifetime does not mean lifetime on everything. What's the most important part of a folding saw -- the ability to actually cut.

At first I put too much pressure on the push and bent the blade. Once I wised up, I love it. It cuts through some pretty big limbs, up in the tree where I cannot safely use a chain saw.

It's thin in that it's half the length of the first installment, it's thin in that the characters lack depth in what should be times of great tragedy. It's thin it that it looks for explanations for horrifying events OUTSIDE the pervue of Deep Space Nine's characters. Thus, since Deep Space Nine has always been character driven, Simpson's approach undermines the show's legacy with senseless and uninspired action and dashes hopes that the violent cliffhanger of the third book would lead to a better understanding of Bajor and its place in the Federation. The DS9 relaunch has steadily cranked its characters through various personal and professional ringers, stretching and challenging them in fascinating new ways in the process. This default to brainless conspiracies is deeply disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I was actually lolking foward to reading this!","review":"I found this final installment of the Mission: Gamma series almost comical compared to the first three books, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The re-released and re-mastered audio CDs along with bonus tracks and tons of near remixes sound amazing and clean. The DVD with videos from the era of this album plus a few before and after to fill the space make a great collector's item as well and are a fun watch if you want to be transported right back to the 80's to relive the bizarre era of concept videos and DD's specific anthem-style videography. Also includes some interesting throwbacks like individual mini-posters of each of the band members which came with a rare edition of the original LP album, includes the jewel case booklet from the original CD case as well. The box is well produced, neatly printed, and conveniently fits into any CD rack.

When I had the joy of attending Duran2's 1984 Seven and The Ragged Tour, I will always remember Tiger Tiger playing as a Tiger's face appeared on their giant video screen. The screams and cheers for the band was incredle! The energy of the band and audience was a constant barrage of fireworks and electricity. Waves of power! Pure magic!

I sang the lyrics at the top of my lungs, not knowing what the hell they meant, and frankly, I still don't! I majored in literature and am great at discovering the deeper meanings in poetry.

It's totally horrendous.What makes little sense to me is that I picked up Big Thing and Notorious remastered and they sound good. This hurt my ears. The songs from this album sounded much better on the Greatest album. Even the bonus disc comes out worse for wear. I just don't understand how the engineers involved couldn't hear how bad they made this sound.

Union of the snake is probobly the worst \\"first single\\" from any on they're albums and the version of \\"the Reflex\\" is not as good as the single version.

But \\"Seven\\" is simply their worst album, marred by poor songwriting, lumbering beats, and heavy-handed production that drove the music into the ground.The only reason this album sold was the world was in the midst of Duran mania. It's clear the album was recorded when the band was worn out by the previous tour, and rushing to get back on the road for the next.The best tracks on the album are the opening track, the undeniably exciting \\"The Reflex,\\" and the second track, the smiling pop of \\"New Moon on Monday.\\"As for the rest of the album, I'd skip it.

New Moon on Monday, The Union of the Snake, Of Crime and Passion, and Shadows On Your Side are cool! \\"Tiger Tiger\\" is a good instrumental piece, and \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" is a dramatic song that makes me want to cry. Also, when I hear Le Bon singing that song, it sounds that it makes me feel like I want to cry.

Awesome value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugabootoo has a lot of bugs","review":"The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year.

In total I have three major separations at the seams, and 6 other large cracks in the rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections.

Buy something else made by someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleaas do *not* buy this product","review":"Worked OK for a few outings, but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings.

Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality worthless boot","review":"As with others I have had the same problem with the bottom plastic/rubber coming undone from the upper fake leather. Also the plastic/rubber gets stiff in the cold and then cracks in multiple places. Worthless boot made in China for a few dollars and then marked up by Columbia to 75 dollars. Avoid at all costs. Columbia will not fix or replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Purchased in late 2006 to replace a pair of Sorels that I had worn for 8 years for snowplowing, showshoeing and winter hiking. Did not start wearing the Bugabootoos until winter 2007 and was surprised that the seam between leather uppers and rubber boot separated within a few weeks. In 2008, the seam pulled apart entirely, allowing moisture through. Although I like the boot styling, I expected better from Columbia. This year, I will go back to Sorel for the long term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty stitching","review":"So I spend 75 bucks thinking I'll get a quality boot. The false security of thinking big bucks means quality. Not so. The boot as designed has a major flaw where the rubber(plastic) is stitched to the leather uppers. Just won't hold. Also the plastic(rubber) cracks and splits. Once that happens the waterproof boot becomes a disaster. Here's the fact,Jack. If you want a waterproof boot, buy a complete rubberized boot. The galoshes of old. The bastardized approach of leather and rubber means problems down the road, say in 5 weeks.Also I notice they are made in China, probably some big factory that turns out the same bugaboot that costs 20 bucks. Save your bucks and buy the pull on galoshes. Or stay out of the water and wear Timberland leathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read these reviews...","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this tape. I am an experienced aerobic kickboxer and found the instructor's lengthy \\"teaching\\" segments boring and absolutely non-energizing. Watch this only if you are at a beginning fitness level and want to learn about basic punches and kicks. Can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone, but worth trying...","review":"Although I have to agree with several of the reviewers that this workout isn't exactly motivating and Stephanie Steele is about the MOST boring instructor around, the video does have some virtues.I personally found her instruction clear and no nonsense. I wouldn't recommend it to beginners because it doesn't really make you want to come back and do it again, but it's still a challenging workout and leaves my shoulders feeling tender the next day!If you're really looking for some fun aerobic boxing/kickboxing, I would suggest Kathy Smith's Aerobox and Kickboxing videos, but for the more serious exerciser I would give Stephanie Steele's video a fair chance. Rent it first if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good workout but uninspiring and almost boring.","review":"Although Stephanie Steele has the personality of a cucumber, I was semi-satisfied with the video because I felt like I got a fairly good workout. If you put forth the effort, you will definitely sweat and feel tired-out by the end of the tape. The video definitely does not inspire you to do the workout every day (or even a second or third time), and the music stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this tape!!!","review":"This tape is not challenging. The music was dubbed in after the tape was made. The instructor does not move to the music which makes it tough to get into the groove. The only person in this tape is the instructor. There was no motivation. Most exercise tapes have people in the background moving in sync with the instructor, not this low budget production! After one workout this tape found the garbage and I got a better workout throwing this tape in the trash. Do yourself a favor and buy a different video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This workout is very repetitive; I got bored doing it the very first time. The instructions aren't that hard to follow, but the moves require turning around a lot so you can't watch what you are supposed to be doing. One of the kicks that is repeated many times requires turning and kicking at the same time while this move isn't that difficult, it puts strain on my knees. The instructor could be intimidating to beginners because she is always kicking to the ceiling without giving much encouragement for less experience people. I'm sure that this workout does burn a lot of calories if you can get through it, but then again so does jumping up and down in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is the first video I bought when I started working out at home. After a couple of months, I got so sick of it, I had to get a couple of new ones, but I just recently went back to it. The other ones weren't as good of a workout, weren't as long, didn't have the good warm-ups, cool-downs and stretches, and had just as annoying music and instructors.Now, I do what one other reviewer said, I just go faster than she does on the slow parts, and rewind to re-do the end section if I want to do a longer workout.After using other videos, I suggest this one, especially for beginners, because of the excellent instructions and the graduated workout levels (it makes you feel like you are really gaining ground when you get through the whole tape.) And, I've lost 12 pounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout, but not really for beginners.","review":"I have been using this tape for almost a year now and I love it. However, it does have a few problems. Ms. Steele does not adequately explain the correct stances you are supposed to use. If I had not already taken tae-kwon-do and known the basic moves, I think I would have had great difficulty figuring out the correct moves. Also, she continually instructs you to fully extend your arms and legs and to lock your legs when you are doing the various kickboxing moves. I have always been taught that locking your legs and arms when exercising will lead to injury. Since I already know how to exercise correctly, I know when to ignore such questionable advice when doing the tape. But someone who is not familiar with exercising and how to avoid injury might have a problem with this tape. If you already know kickboxing and how to exercise without injuring yourself, this is a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"too difficult to follow","review":"I have problems in following Ms.Steele's instructions. She was too quick and I didn't get much of an aerobic workout. The punches, hooks, and kicks were demonstrated nicely, but very difficult to follow. It's definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like unique workouts you'll love this!","review":"This is an excellent workout tape. The instructor really goes over the moves so that you know them before she puts them into a routine. I love new and unique workouts and this is great. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love of workouts and an intrest in martial arts!

I have done it a few times since then, but I have to say that it is so dull that I usually quit in the middle of it. It is cheaply produced and has awful music, plus it is very repetitive. The moves are not by any means complex or exciting, and you have to stretch them pretty far to feel like you're getting a workout. Additionally, the eighties-feel of the decor in the video is nauseating, and most of all Stephanie's tacky red leotard is just too cheesy. Overall, this video is not even good for a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when this is over!!!","review":"This was by far the most uninspiring workout video I've ever purchased.

I've done real kickboxing as well as cardio-kickboxing, and the sport is very exciting, but you would never know it from this video. The instruction is slow and boring, and the attempts to cater it to different levels just don't work. I can't imagine anyone reaching for this tape on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Uncoordinated","review":"This may be a good video for those who enjoy kickboxing, but for the beginner I found it difficult if not impossible to do.

He analyses our bad habit of interpreting the Bibel through the glasses of our preconceived ideas about what the Bible would or should say. In following his argument very closely we learn how to read and interpret the Bible according to its own standards and rules, and this cuts quite through many of our cherished concepts of Bible teaching.

I think somethings could be added to the book like sections of foreign policy and voter participation, but overall it is an amazing book. This book definitely helped me get a good score, at least I think so.It wasn't too long do so it didn't take long to review as with Barron's some of the review chapters were over 20 pages. Princenton's got right to the point and put in the most simple terms as possible. Like the other guy said the practice test are a bit easier than the real one, but I did really good on the practice AP exam we took in class.

It had a powerful effect on me. I felt that someone, at last, understood what *I* experienced - the feelings of abandonment, of not fitting in, of not being liked, and of not giving up despite all of that...Aside from the emotional impact, it was a fun book to read, almost a three- dimensional puzzle. The pages come in different shapes, and have a variety of cut-outs. It's fantastic! I have read this book so many times, I had to tape most of the pages back together.I have treasured my very well-worn copy of LOVE for decades, and I have searched the used-book stores for another copy. I never found anyone who had even heard of it.I am so excited to find that LOVE is available again!

You might get an uncontrollable urge to throw either yourself or Mr. Bakshi into traffic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I would love this.....","review":"I used to go to sleep watching one of the LoTR movies almost every night. I still have most of the lines memorized.Long story short: this movie is bad, but if you love LOTR it might be worth renting to check it out. Be aware that you'll probably spend an hour waiting for it to get better, then realize you're halfway through and want your $3 and 1 hour of time back. Most of the lines are either passive-aggressive, cranky, or just don't fit; other parts are rushed and not fulfilling. I didn't expect any flashy graphics (the movie was made in 1978). I expected a good story telling experience, and this movie does not deliver that.I'm still glad amazon had this online because I wanted to see it. I couldn't find it on netflix stream or blockbuster on demand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"One word - Horrible. Do not waste your time watching this movie or most of all, your money buying it. The animation is atrocious, and the acting on the part of the voice characters is very bad. I cannot come up with enough adjectives to describe how bad this movie is. Someone who has read Tolkien will be left feeling angry, and someone who has never even heard of LOTR would disapprove. Wizards by Bakshi was terrible and this version of LOTR is terrible. The rotoscope animation mixed with the regular animation looks ridiculous. I had to fast forward to the end and force myself to watch it - Only because I was unfortunate enough to waste my money buying it. My favorite part was when Sam and Frodo were in the canoe - paddling in opposite directions! When it ended, I was speechless. Now that I think of it, maybe it could be useful as a disciplinary tool for misbehaving children - just force them to watch it and whatever it was, they'll never do it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACE TO THE STORIES!!!","review":"This Warner Bros. version of the classic J. R. R. Tolkien books has got to be the worst adaptation. First of all, the animation is dark but nicely done in a way. But sometimes it's TOO dark that you suddenly begin to lose interest. Second, the Special-FX are just dumb and pathetic. They try to mix poorly made realistic images in with the animation. And finally, some things in the books were obviously left out in this! The story goes through the entire \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" and half of \\"The Two Towers\\", making it incomplete! OVERALL: The fight scenes are cheesy and poor, and most of it makes the wonderful books of the series look BORING! I recommend \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" on DVD and the \\"Two Towers\\" (now in theatres) instead of this dull film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Note: THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ANIMATED HOBBIT!!","review":"I purchased this DVD with the thought that it fit with the animated Hobbit and Return of the King, and I was rudely shocked. This was done by a different director, and is nothing like the other two. There are no clever songs. The animation is much poorer, incorporating some live action. This is not a quality film by any means, however, it is kind of amusing from a bad movie standpoint. Be forwarned before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cared little, cared little still","review":"I first saw The Lord of the Rings 3 or 4 years ago. The first hour was rather intersting, but after that the story became disjointed, confusing, and boring. Plus, it relied TOO MUCH on rotoscoping to the point when it seemed like the whole movie was in rotoscope. Needles to say, I left the room to get a snack and never came back. The recent release squashes this early effort to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's story to the screen,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Maybe if you saw this when it was new, it was impressive or entertaining. Today, the animation is jittery and the rotoscoping is jarring, distracting and doesn't mesh with the rest of the animation. The storyline doesn't flow well, but jumps in fits and starts. And the character design is utterly atrocious and at in many cases is blatently at odds with the depictions in the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Fun!","review":"This is certainly one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen! The animation is so bad that even a 5-year-old could do better drawings, but most of the time they don't even bother to draw it, but use tainted live-action instead or try a combination of live-action and animation, which is especially annoying.Aragorn is a Native American (why?), Sam a ...madman & all characters are constantly overacting and cross-eyed. I watched it with a friend of mine and we were laughing for hours afterwards..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok now they have gone too far.","review":"worst movie ever never agian i am going to see this oh no! harry potter is a most better movie [....]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucked","review":"This movie really did a horrible job of depicting what Tolkien ment by his books, or book and 1/2 since this didn't even finish the story. I mean obvious low budget, but who would have thought that low budget. It's cheesy, bad anamation makes it all the more stupid. It's a story about a ring, and once Gandalf gets into the war part of the story, the producer of the film (so we will call it even though it's not worthy) doens't come out. Forgot all about the ring I guess. The loser who made this story is one to be pitied. He needs to go back to the drawing board (literally), or better yet back to art school, if he ever went there. I know I'm harsh on this, but making such a horrible film that they called based on the greatest novels ever they brought this on themselves. Peter Jackson did it much better anyway, but even if you don't compare them this movie still sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.

As much as I wanted to like this movie, just couldn't"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings Animated","review":"When I was a child, our family had over-the-air television. One day, the local CATV company broadcast programming via antenna in an attempt to lure viewers to CATV. During the promotion on channel 6, Showtime was airing all sorts of adult themed animation. When I tuned in, the LotR scene I caught was when Gandalf was preventing Balrog from pursuing the rest of the Fellowship in the mines of Moria. That scene came to define the LotR in my impressionable mind. I remember the LotR coloring book based on the animation. I remember Gollum frozen on the page as he was confronted by Frodo and Sam. For many years, although only half of the story, this movie was the only adult oriented interpretation of the LotR. To this day, I still prefer the animated film to the Live Action trilogy done masterfully by Peter Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK. Decent Retelling, Interesting, sometimes obnoxious animation.","review":"It is a fairly decent telling of the story. However, the animation alternates between very crude and what I've been told is \\"rotoscope\\". The switching between the two is especially distracting in my opinion. I would have preferred straight animation throughout. While I would not watch it again, our five year old liked it and liked trying to figure out what parts matched his LOTR Legos game. If I could, I'd probably give it 2.5 stars.My primary complaint is that this movie should be included with unlimited prime streaming. Definitely not worth an actual purchase, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember liking this movie...","review":"I also enjoyed another Bakshi movie called \\"Wizards\\". I justwanted to relay what I heard years ago: the profits from Bakshi's first movie,which covers half of the Lord of the Rings, was supposed to finance the second half,but the first movie either lost money, or did not make enough to finance the second,and so the second was never made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show no mercy, for you will recieve none!!!!","review":"Do not tell me this movie is at all good. I have read LOTR 8 times and i am 17. I saw this movie before PJ's version came out so I didn't compare it with his films at the time. Lets get one thing straight.BAKSHI'S LORD OF THE RINGS IS THE HORRID!!!!Do not watch this movie. Spare yourselves. They change peoples names, for example Saruman to Aruman. Grima looks like a jawa straight out of Star Wars. Everyone has pounds and pounds of hair. Boromir is a viking. I will admit that some of the dialogue was decent but on the whole its a great dissapointment. Rankin\\\\Bass version of ROTK is better than Bakshi's version.If you want a good version of LOTR, SHUND THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!! It is not good.If you want to watch a 70's comedy with LOTR charactristics, by all means watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stupid","review":"I had the unfortunate oppurtunity to watch the animated version of The Lord of the Rings from 1978 that my sister rented. [...] It felt more like 5 hours long instead of just 2! Even my [...] sister thought it was terrible! Anyway, buy the awesome LIVE ACTION The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring instead. Then you won't have to endure [awful] voice acting, strange, distracting animation and [mis] representations of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange graphics and even stranger hair","review":"Okay, first of all, these people have huge hair. Every last one of them. Don't even talk to me about Saruman (or Aruman, as Bakshi the Banshee half-puts it). I understand why he's leaning over like he is in the cartoon. Plus, that new animation they were trying. I can see why it never took flight. It really stinks. The Return of the King had better be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distinctively Not Good","review":"Having recently read Lord of the Rings for the first time, I hoped this would be an enjoyable little adaptation. If my mother hadn't given it to me for Christmas, I wouldn't have felt the need to watch it all the way through. The animation technique is annoying - with the inclusion of BADLY traced live action and unexceptional drawn-on \\"makeup\\" for Orcs and Trolls, and general human activity. It gave me a headache.But one of the more annoying features is that halfway through the movie, Saruman suddenly becomes \\"Aruman\\" for no apparent reason.Badly drawn, poorly directed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Tolkien Fan","review":"As a Tolkien fan, it was painful to watch. So many things were wrong when compared to the books. I believe that it was a waste of my money, and I should have never bought it. At least I have one more LOTR item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we all see the same movie?","review":"I am no 'die-hard lotr fan', but I know a rotten movie when I see one. The quality came nowhere near 'THE HOBBIT' or even 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'. Gandalf and Saruman were horrable, and those orcs---. This is the kind of film that gives LOTR a bad name. On the good side...Gollum was as interesting as in the books, and (better still) therer was no sequal! This film is o.k. if you absolutely MUST watch all Tolkien-related stuff, but don't show it to the uninitiated. It will ruin any chance for you to get them to read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is hostile to the viewer","review":"This movie is openly hostile to the viewer. Unless you have a good understanding of the books and you like painfully bad animation, avoid this \\"film\\". There are those that will tell you this film is a \\"misunderstood work of genius\\" or a \\"flawed masterpiece\\". They are lying. They only want you to share in the pain they feel from having paid good money for the privilage of getting poked in the eye by the horrible animation. To be fair, substantial inebriation will lesson the impact on the soul, but even being tanked to the gills is no panacea to the harm this film can do. And too much alcohol is never a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELP!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i last so this movie when i was ten...even before i read the books....and i really loved it....

The Animation is too dark and sketchy, as if painted by a child. You can see the animation budget shrinking as the movie progresses. I give it one star because it follows the book so closely, but it ends with at least 300 page of the book missing and Bakshi never completed the second half. I own this film, I think it's a waste of time and even if he did finish the sequel, I would not want to tarnish my memories of the book with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"This was a wonderful movie from so long ago, I had it on VHS and now I have it on DVD.

B: in this ... atempt of a movie Boromir is some sort of furry viking, not to mention Grima Woumtounge looks like the love child of a human and a jawa from star wars. C: not to mention they start to highlight the best part of tolkiens work without the \\"boring things\\" wich hold the story together. D: finaly during the last part the movie all they show are gory fights. On one last note my personal thoery is that when this movie was released tolkien didn't turn but started to spin around in his grave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"For some reason, despite the year this was released, I had some great expectations for this movie. I was sorely disappointed. I can now see why they ran out of time in finishing the whole story; they dwell way too long on certain scenes! The scenes with the wraiths takes forever to get through, while other parts of the story are simply \\"skimmed\\" over... The technology used for certain animations (like the riders of Rohan and the orcs) was just a distraction in my view, it did not blend well with the rest of the \\"hand-drawn\\" animations.I cannot bring myself to recommend this to anyone. If you are not a fan of JRR Tolkien, you will not care to see this movie. If you are, you will just be disappointed with what you see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this","review":"I loved the animated Return of the King and The Hobbit, so when I saw the Lord of the Rings DVD I got all excited and bought it. IT WAS AWFUL!! The Frodo and Sam are completely different and I don't know why they even try to pass this off as part of a set. It was terrible. The presentation is totally different from the other two. I was only able to sit through the first hour, and it was a WORLD OF HURT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Characters","review":"I think the movie was hilarious but it had a lot of faults with the characters like Aragorn,he looked liked like an indian. Legolas was such a snob.He looked at Sam like he was an idiot when he said Frodo needed to rest. Gandalf moved his hands so much I thought he was trying to do sign language.Boromir looked like a viking with those horns. Pippin looked so much like Merry that you couldn't tell them apart. The Black Riders looked like they were crippled and they looked brown instead of black. The orcs looked like bulls. The Balrog looked like a lion with butterfly wings. I think it would be very funny if it were a comedy but it wasn't, so it stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment for a Tolkien fan","review":"I suppose I was expecting too much. My friends and I were such fans of the movie that we eagerly anticipated it when it first came to theaters (now long ago). We were all greatly disappointed.The animation is cheesy and boring. The images do not remotely capture any grandeur or spectacle nor do the evil minions inspire any fear or loathing.The acting was lame. The adaptation of the story was hideous with gross omissions and many bad choices.The music was the best thing about it, and to be honest, I found it too strident."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappoinment on so many levels","review":"Poor character development, simplified drawings, jumpy animation, bizarre editing choices, weak adaptation. And to end the story in the middle and NOT produce a sequel is tantamount to a felony!For Tolkien-addicts: a true disappointment. For Tolkien-novices: PLEASE read the original... it's better, deeper, stronger, faster..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered Deluxe RIP-OFF!","review":"This \\"deluxe re-release\\" is in fact a rip-off of the highest order.The original trailers for the film are entirely absent and the documentary is rather more of an homage to Bakshi then any sort of in-depth analysis of how/why the movie made a contribution, did what business it did at the box office, and (more importantly) why they never made Part 2 (and more importantly why we then had to wait for the Rankin-Bass cap-to-the-entire-series and then another 20 or so years until Peter Jackson's version came out).There are some nice bits on the filming in Spain that was later used for the rotoscopic animation work but not nearly as much material as there should be.Additionally, the restoration work on the film print doesn't seem to have done much for it's quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"The only reason I gave this film 2 stars was because alot of the dialogue was used by Peter Jackson in the live-action version and I can't love that without liking some of this film. But really, that's were it ends. The animation was bad, the score was bad, the characterizations were bad, and the storyline stunk.Aragorn looked like a freak. Samwise was brain-dead and Legolas looked less like a elf and more like a little girl.I saw the documentary in The Two Towers and in it, Peter Jackson mentioned that he borrowed from this animated version. Clearly, that's what he did but he also improved upon it. By doing so, he made his task alot easier.Anyway, there's really no point in buying or renting this cartoon because there's nothing that this version does that beats the live-action films. Don't waste your money, stick with the Jackson versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing animation, the movie's coming soon!","review":"The animation in this movie is quite a ways ahead of its time, and the mixing of three or more different animations styles is very interesting. Tolkien is not only the greatest fantasy writer to ever have existed, but he is one of the best writers of any genre to ever has existed as well. I'm pleased to inform you Tolkien fans that a three movies shall be coming out within the next 6-8 years: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and the Return of the King, all live action, with modern advanced special effects, and they are rumored to be a work of genius that is in progress. I look forward to it with great anticipation and I am sure that you all do too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More accurate version of LOTR","review":"This is definently more accurate in terms of the actual book, than Peter Jackson's films. While this may not have the greatest animation and voice acting. It is still good and it was definently a worthy effort. If you are a new fan however this movie may be a little confusing. I suggest you read the books before watching ANY of the movies it will give you a more accurate view of the taleThe movie was very fun to watch. I really enjoyed it. The sad thing is though it is incomplete. That is why I gave it 4 stars.But overall it was worthwile to watch and it is a must for fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is NOT very good!!! It focused on the story well, and followed the book, but the animation was terrible; it looked like they rushed it. Also, they end the movie in the middle of the 2nd book, with nothing concluding at all. They're in a battle near Rohan, and it just ends and says something like, \\"They won the battle and conquered all of Middle Earth!\\", and Frodo and Sam are just left there on Mordor's border, without getting rid of the Ring, which is the whole point of the story! It sort of makes me think that they ran out of money or funding at the end of the movie- I wouldn't be surprised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loyal adaptation doesn't mix with confusing execution...","review":"Ralph Bakshi's 70s film based on the first and some of the second books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. While the adaptation is very loyal, the animation, particularly the retroscoping, lacks feeling or scope. Some of the scenes seem very hastily put together and many sequences are incredibly confusing, making this film hard to watch. The runtime, a lengthy two hours, stretches this movie out and soon the story drags on and gets very boring. Watching the film, one wishes Bakshi would have been given more money so that a better and possibly brighter look could have been presented. Instead, we get a long-winded and confusing couple of hours with animation that is very subpar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"I have been trying to get my hands on this film for a few years now, as it wasn't released on VHS in England.Even though it is an extremely shabby representation of the book, watching it as a child turned me on to Tolkien and reading books in general.I think I like the film so much because of the childhood memories that it evokes and watching it now makes me laugh (why on earth is Saruman called Aruman in the film?).The musical score is absolutely fantastic and well worth buying on CD but I was a bit disapointed by the complete lack of extras on the DVD.I don't think the new generation of Tolkien fans will appreciate the film at all if they have seen Peter Jacsons' effort, but as a nice trip down memory lane it's well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I didn't like this movie...It was kind of boring and the painted on people really looked stupid...I prefer the hobbit and the return of the king animated movie over this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Movie.","review":"this is a very bad movie.

From the start with the silhouettes of actors which went on a little too long for my tastes. I was relieved when it finally went to the animation of the Hobbit village but then I saw how strange the animation was for the characters and what was up with Gandolph's googly eyes!!?? Also, Bilbo's voice was odd too.

Bakshi was a talented animator but he just didnt have the budject for this film. The anamation is horrible in over half the film. Boromir's viking costume is absurd. The live action scenes are laughable. The only part I found impressive was the battle at Helms Deep. But the abrupt ending and butchered stroyline doesnt do the film any good. John Hurt, as Aragorn, was the only voice actor I found to be convincing as a character, but Aragorn's character design was so terribly bland that it just didnt work. The rest of the voices are terrible. Bad film stick to Jackson's trilogy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Went well until the end","review":"Well, I must say, when I first started to watch the movie, it was pretty good, and by that I mean faithful to the books. What killed it for me though was horrible animation they tried to put in. I am not sure exactly what it is called, but it involves substituting animation with live people who seem to be scribbled on. What I don't understand is why did they do this? It just slaughtered my enjoyment during the movie. Maybe for 1978 that was considered top of the line animation, but they should have just stuck with the original animation.The ending killed me, it was like the person who made the movie only made it halfway through THE TWO TOWERS and decided to make a movie on it. It left so many loose ends I don't know where to begin with. My advice is to read the books and if you have 2 hours of spare time, watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a waste","review":"Just as a movie, I enjoyed it but compared to the books it is a shamble.

Most of the voiceacting, however, is very well done--there are a few line readings that I really prefer to Jackson's version, however better done that is overall.It should also be noted that this movie has the WORST Sam you will ever see. Apparently, the filmmakers couldn't get around the idea of there being working-class people in the Shire, and so, to explain his deference and devotion to Frodo, they turned him into some kind of dopey idiot with a bulbous nose. Honestly, he's an idiot. For the BEST Sam, see the Rankin-Bass Return of the King."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's good","review":"All the characterization is just SO over the top.

I mean the thought of an animated Lord of the Rings is cool because you can do more with animation than with live action but this version was poorly done. I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings and I really wanted to see what Ralph Bakashi did. Boy, did he mess this up real bad! First how dumb is it to put only Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers in this one and make a seperate Return of the King movie. Second, this movie is absolutely horrible. Don't even bother buying or renting it or anything, it is not worth it! It sucks! END OF STORY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version, but wheres the second half","review":"Being a Tolkien fan for several years, and having seen the other versions many times, this is by far the best of the bunch. With the possible exception of the impending Lord of the Rings coming out in december, this is the best possible adaptation of Tolkien's works. The only problem with this version (like all its competitors) is the lack of completion, that is this movie was slated the first of two but the producers did not fund the second half, and so this movie only tells the story up until the Two Towers, leaving the Rankin-Bass videos (a much more \\"kid-friendly\\", happy version) as the only copy of Return of the King available to viewers. Buy this video if you love Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But Ends to Early","review":"I saw the animated version of the Hobbit and while it was accurate to the book, it bugged me how Bilbo and all the other characters looked like cute stuffed dolls. The Lord of the Rings is bascially an animated version of The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. This movie really captures the spirit of the book. But it ends in the battle of Helm's Deep, which any Tolkien fan knows is the middle of The Two Towers. I thought Sam was portrayed as a fat idiot in this movies, which he was not in the book. Just listen, \\"OH WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE ELVES?! OH BOY! OH HOOOOOORAAAAY!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"This was my first contact with JRR Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings.

However, this does not mean I approve of it. Here's my list:1) WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO TO SAM?!?! As stated by many, he is supposed to be a sturdy, loyal hobbit, not some weird, buck-toothed, babbling moron that is apparently gay!! He is my favorite character, and Bakshi does not do him justice by any means (for the best Sam, in my opinion, see PJ's film).2) Why was Boromir a Viking?? I don't ever recall reading about Vikings in Middle Earth...3) Gollum--enough said (again, see PJ's film for the best interperetation).4) Why was the Balrog a 8 foot tall man in bell-bottoms and a lion head? Again, does not do it justice.I know I am repeating many other reviews, but I wanted to stress this fact: don't buy/rent this movie unless you are in the mood for a laugh and have over 2 hours to spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT BURNS US, IT BURNS US!!!!!!","review":"This is just a poor film. It covers the FOTR and TT portions of the LOTR, just ending flat with no warning despite the title of LOTR. The characters here are just plain ugly, many are historical Earth (not Middle Earth) stereotypes that don't fit in or reflect the descriptions in the book at all. Samwise feels more like Dopey the Dwarf than the hobbit that helps save the free peoples of Middle Earth. The Balrog looks like a bipedal chimera in bell bottoms. The orcs look more like a cross between dogs and apes than elves taken my Melkor, tortured and aruined over the ages as is told. Many more such horrors abound through out the film, only they are perpetrated by the film makers not Sauron.If you are a collector you may want to buy this for completion of your collection, but I really wouldn't recommend watching it. It was a painful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of ...","review":"I'm sorry, but I don't understand why people constantly defend this film. \\"Oh, it's not so bad. It was good in it's time. It's not fair to compare it to the new one.\\"I don't compare it! I saw this years ago, way before the new version came along, and I thought it was horrible then, by any standards! And I'll explain why in one (or two) words: roto-scoping!Here Bashiki had the hard task of cramming an epic story into what he originally thought would be one film! Then he wastes time and money with this animating over live action technique which does nothing but distract and detract precious screen time. Look, if he wanted to test out this new style, he should've done this with another film, not one as pressured of LOTR.And when he decided the film would not fully capture the whole epic, why stop at the battle of Helm's Deep of all places? At least stop in a place which seems right to stop at (like the places where the trilogy was originally divided, for instance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Delight!!!","review":"I stumbled onto this book in a used bookshop, and I am very grateful for that random purchase.

It begins when Totto-chan ( Tetsuko's nick name) was expelled from the first grade because of her disruptive behaviour. She was then transferred to a very unique school ran by a headmaster who had his own teaching philosophy. The school itself was not in a building but in discarded railroad cars. The book also includes other adventures Totto-chan had been involved in, and also previews what life had been like as a small child in Japan during the outbreak of World War II. I recomend this book to parents, and teachers because of Mr. Kobayashi- the headmaster's philosophy of education. It also makes fun reading for children, as I myself have had this book since I was twelve years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every parent every teacher should read this book","review":"I first read this book in Chinese and I was deeply touched by it.

And when Joe sings 'Didn't you know you had to cry sometime' his voice takes you most enjoyably to the very pit of pain and despair. If you understand the blues, you'll understand the album.

If I wanted this kind of story (which I don't), I'd go to the \\"back room\\" of a video store! I mean, don't bother with true love or even having the character know each other.

Plus the pain of having to ship it.Other than these gripes, it has been a good player with a decent user interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"All other shortcomings aside, like small storage space especially compared to newer models out now, simply transferring music to this device is very limited. Most operating systems do not recognize this device and the manufacturer offers very little support for patches to alleviate this problem. This can leave the product completely worthless unless you have access to a computer operating system that will recognize it and/or you're willing to jump through all kinds of hoops to try to get it to work even with limited abilities.Shop around, there are much better products with far more storage and no hassle to use and transfer files to it, and for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"I bought a 6gb Micro in 4/06..after several months the screen locked up...I tried everything including a new battery...$200 bucks in the trash!Don't buy Creative anything..terrible product....... terrible company.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable ... but good while it lasted.","review":"As with everyone else, I have to wiggle and jiggle my headphone jack to get it even remotely close to working.

I sent it back to Creative Labs and they sent me a new one in September. Four months later the hard drive failed in the replacement unit, and now that it has been more than a year since the first unit was purchased, Creative Labs will not replace it unless I pay them $122 (a new one costs $180).

Both had to be returned for warranty work and after a lengthy wait they were returned. The replacements are sent without current firmware and driver updates in place which means that you will have to figure out which updates are needed thru the Creative website. There is an Autoupdate feature that allows you to just plug the Zen into the USB cable and the link decides which updates you need. To bad this doesn't work either.

It has a shape that fits great into your hand, not too heavy, looks good, and easy to navigate. Many people think that it is an ipod. It is not!!! It is better!!! Some dislikes about it are that the backlight doesn't stay on long enough, sometimes the vertical touch pad can be annoying.Instead of scrolling up and down, it likes to act as an enter button and go to another screen and you have to undo. If you have very large fingers, it may get on your nerves. Also the belt clip is not as secure as you would think. It sometimes slides off when you unclip the Micro."},{"rating":"1","title":"*** UPDATE *** No USB, no charging","review":"*** UPDATE ****In the US, ZEN Micro's are now shipped without AC adapters.

Unfortunately, this thing is so poorly made that it's been defective since the first three months. First the screen went out and what good is it if you can't see the titles of songs? The earbuds broke soon after. Then the thing just started turning off for no reason and having to re-build.

In the middle of playing a song, it simply cut off. The thing wouldn't even shut down any more. Tried taking out the battery and putting it back.

I live in the Chicago metropolitan area and I cannot get any of the radio stations I normally listen to.

In fact, I bought one for my girlfriend's birthday. BUT, that one had to be returned to creative after less than 2 weeks, when it just froze.

Obviously mine is well past the 90 day window and even though its still within the 1 year warranty period, Creative wants money to fix it.Thats rich.Save yourself the headache.

If I was able to fix mine, I'm pretty sure you can fix yours too. I'm a girl.Update September 4, 2006: After fixing it with the soldering iron, the problem came back about a month later. i probably didn't fix it that well and the headphone jack thing became loose.

Overall, I'm satisfied with the zen micro but I have to admit that the ipod is a much better product. Here are my thoughts about zen micro pros and cons:Pros: Great sound, good battery life, works with Yahoo music, good integration with windows XP (some other players are more finicky), nice size, comes with good accessories, standard USB charger that allows me to carry one cable for my phone, camera, and mp3 player, comes with plenty of accessories.Cons: interface is less intuitive than ipod, very very difficult to control while running (unlike ipod mini that you can control with your eyes closed), freezes occasionally (this happens to all mp3 players I've owned so it's not a big deal)Overall, I am pleased with the product but wish that I could just use my ipod with my yahoo music subscription instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!!!!!!","review":"I have never written an online review before but I feel compelled to do so.

Others on this site have described the many technical problems with the Zen Micro. I will simply say I traded in my first one when it died only to have my second one become very sick in less than one month.

Now it's locked up, apparently for good. When it worked, I really liked the sound quality when I used some better earphones than what it came with. The random play is a good function, but they all have that now. The touch screen concept is cool, but sometimes a bit hard if there's a specific song you want while driving or jogging. I've purchased several creative products in the past, including the Nomad II series, which eventually broke. Creative apparently does not have good quality control, although they are pretty innovative with the designs. Got a few months of good use out of this thing and the earlier crashes were fixed using the Creative website so I will give it two stars.

The touchpad is a big pain to use. Too sensitive to the touch--could not adjust the sensitivity though I followed the instructions in the manual, and you can hardly use any other menus except the ones highlighted by default. I decided to give up on it, after trying almost an hour of useless firmware update to 1.1. Tech support article said there is a version 2.1, but when I clicked on it, the file could not be found. Did they decide to delete the link to that file, after finding some problems? Very bad firmware, touch pad feature.

While the battery life is definatly not 12 hours, the backlight is mezmerizing and the capacity and extra features of the mp3 player are outstanding. Infact the backlight is so bright I could use it as a flashlight at night. While I hear all these bad reveiws about the Creative Zen Micro I have expireinced none of the problems everyone else is talking about. The touchpad is extremely simple after getting use to and you can get a new battery that lasts longer. I've never used an Ipod but I can't imagine a device any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best yet","review":"I recently recived this product from my dad because he didn't have much room on it for him. I haven't had any problems with it. I started out with a small sandisc 512mb mp3 but the screen went out so I got this one. I like the part that it has a removable battery (unlikeinthe ipod's you hav to send it into apple to replace the battery which could take weeks,and it cost $80.00 to replace a battery in an ipod while in this creative it only costs $30). Ipods also dont have the fm radio (unless you drop another $50.00 into it). And the creative has easyer controls and seems to work better. The music player also comes in verriety of colors, and the neon light adds personality to it. So if going to by an ipod ipod mini any other ipod save your money and spend it on the creatve zen micro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty in Pink!","review":"I purchased the pink Creative Zen Micro 5gb about 3 months ago and I have had no difficulties with it so far.

Music Unlimited and upload them to my mp3 player (reallyy convenient...it beats paying .99 cents a song for Itunes..) I really do love it. You can buy a new battery for it once yours goes dead (IPOD's must be sent to the Apple Store for $100 to get a new battery installed in it...that sucks..)However, CONS: the ear plugs are horrible...dont even try to keep these around.Overall, I would still buy it today if I had to make the decision all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great MP3 Player... when it works","review":"I got this thing and I loved it. However, its built very poor. Yeah, its got alot more features than the iPod and it costs way less, but the thing falls apart.I went to Creative's website and it turns out that ALOT of users are having problems. The display ceases to function, the player freezes... and this is from 100% standard/official usage of the player.Great features but its built at a trash can quality levels. I was shocked actually. Creative/E-Mu have never let me down. I've been buying their soundcards since like 1997 and have never had a problem with them. They need to implement the same standards of quality control across their entire product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be a loyal fan","review":"I am trying to be a loyal fan of the Zen Micro but it is getting increasingly difficult. I am having the same problem with the head phone jack. I sent my original purchase back because it was within its warranty but then the replacement product began having the same problem. I don't know, I may have to go over to iPod just to get a working product. I was really in love with the Zen Micro (when it worked) because the features were awesome. I don't think I will buy another Creative product because a functioning product is not too much to ask.Just recently I purchased the Zen Micro Photo. Itis a great looking product.

I am not an Ipod owner but have used one before and the one thing I like better about an Ipod is the control. The Zen Micro can be difficult to control for someone with large fingers, like myself. I have to say that I am impressed with the audio quality that you get from the Zen micro. I also like the fact that you don't have to use any software to operate or put songs on the Zen Micro, although software is included with the player. The 12 hour battery life claim is bogus but you can expect 6 - 7 hours of playback on a single charge. I have seen several reviews for this product that complain about the headphone jack going out so beware if you plan on purchasing this product.

The battery life on this thing is a joke, it is rated at 12 hours, but in actual use, I get about 2 hours from it. If I don't charge it for 2 days, the battery would automatically lose all charge and the unit won't even turn on.Hardware needs improvement too. After I used the unit for about 2 weeks, the plastic panel on top fall off, turns out it is only secured by glue, not screws. Now I get why Ipod Mini uses the metal finish.

Next day still sounded great. Charged it again, then tried to download more songs onto it. My computer won't even see it. Plug it in, it lights up, but no joy.

I do think that a basic understanding of the Spirla Dynamics model is helpful before you view, as this is not a primer approach to the material. I would rate it as an excellent adjunct to the book or a well-presented live introduction to the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mud, Moon and Me","review":"This book was purchased for an eight yr. old girl who is extremely bright and loves to read.

I pulled out my copy and my new BFF and I had a blast reading the poems together. Her birthday was approaching & I found her a copy on Amazon...used and reasonably priced.

I mean, it has some good information, but it is kinda smug. I also really, really hate the intelligence-insulting \\"translations\\" of British phrases. Hello! Even if, unlike me, you're not a devoted anglophile, these should not give you to much trouble. Gah...One specific thing that bothered me was John Inman's disingenuous claims that his character wasn't meant to be gay. I mean really. Even if there weren't numerous blindingly obvious admonitions to such in many, many episodes, that woudl just be completely untrue. Come on, people. What is this, retrospective homophobia? Get real.

Full of interesting facts about the actors, producers and directors and bits of trivia, this companion book will be more than enough for any fan of Mr Humphries or the hilarious, cat loving, Mrs. Slocombe. There are summaries of all of the episodes, that also include the second series, \\"Grace and Favour\\" and the movie that follows the gang as the go on vacation together. It even includes the episodes of the Australian version, which lasted for two seasons.

From the resonant \\"B-13\\" to the peppy, self-effacing \\"my guitar\\" to the unnervingly timely \\"come out clean\\" the cuts on this album maintain the eclectic styles that have made JLC a favorite of fans of intelligent, fun, regional music. I hope people will hunt down previous JLC releases (\\"licorace tea demos\\" and \\"buzz\\") to catch tracks like \\"easter parade\\", \\"opium\\", and \\"heart on the ocean\\".

Holy crap, it's wonderful. Unlike it's successor, Vertigo, it seems more well-rounded... it has some beautiful ballads, some up-tempo riffs, and one track that comes off like a monologue from a play. Vertigo is excellent as well, but it comes off kinda Radioheadish. Magazine has a more well-defined identity. It is a CD that requires many listens all the way through. Each song adds to the CD - they are all very different, but as a whole make a great compilation. \\"Not Today\\" is a great opener, \\"Cathdrals\\" is numbingly beautiful, \\"Body Parts\\" is a great unleashing of frustration, and it just doesn't get any better than \\"B-13.\\" Then the last track, \\"Close Your Eyes\\" could soothe you to sleep. Great, great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, well-rounded CD","review":"Jump is an awesome band, and each CD they release reveals a new aspect of their character.

I certainly hope enough people find out about this album for it to really take off and spawn more great CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in itself","review":"This cd, magazine,by Jump Little Children is indescribable. If you're from Charleston this makes you very proud about your redneck infested land. I'm so disappointed that they didn't get majorly popular, they've just gotten raved and praised by the locals. This is the type of cd you put in and either you're rocking or almost crying. If you've just lost a major piece of your life(a beautiful woman) then maybe this isn't your cd, it will bring it back up. This band is just part of the people of Charleston that are actually not racists or sexists or homophobe rednecks, and it makes you proud of Charleston, just like Hootie and the blowfish and The Working title.

Their album, Magazine, has proven that the classically trained musicians can succeed in yet one more genre of music. While still upholding much of their musical roots, the band has become a member of today's enormous music scene, in creating new sounds from their oddly alluring array of instruments. Among those instruments there includes the following: a cello, upright bass, tin whistle, harmonicas, an accordian, mandolins, the melodica, and the moog, (as well as multiple guitars and rockin' drums). Check these guys out. Do it now. You will love every second of every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, one of the best CD's I've owned","review":"I've actually now owned this CD three times. It always manages to get left in a friends car, and it seems to be one of the few CDs that never makes it back into my hands. Such is life.I was hooked on the CD after hearing Cathedrals a couple years back, and was pleasantly surprised by how different most of the songs are from each other. There's only one song I regularly fast-forward through, being My Guitar (seems you either love it or hate it, based on the other reviews I've seen).Habit is another one of my favourites- it's very... fashionable, without being pretentious.I don't believe I'd go through the hassle of buying a CD three times for any other group than JLC. Vertigo is also a good CD (particularly Lover's Greed, I think), and I've loved the older stuff that I've heard as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS A MUSIC LOVER>>>YOU NEED THIS CD!","review":"This is the greatest CD! J,LC is a GREAT new sound (which is so refreshing given the latest \\"new\\" talents to gain national attention.)

It combines a little bit of something for everybody: rock, classical, pop, alternative, even a smidgen of hip-hop and industrial. This should go up there with classic albums like \\"Sgt.

Magazine (JLC's third release) is extremelly good compared to the rest of the music in its genre, but not so much as where they really shine, such as on The Licorice Tea Demos or even Buzz (so long as you ignore the screaming girls). A great band live and definately worth keeping track of."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome","review":"This is the first cd i have bought from JLC and i love it.

It's enough with the targeted age group just to say, as the book does in the beginning, that you and God are there to guide and love him or her. But laying the ground to expect bad grades and mean teachers (just one example) is not productive. And saying that you will \\"always be on the child's side\\" sets the child up to believe that you don't think he or she will ever make a mistake or be wrong or deserve punishment or correction from you! Better just to say that you will be there to help. I was disappointed because this book has some very nice parts, but I would not read it to my grandchildren. Life is hard enough without setting them up to fail. Two thumbs down on this one. Good Night God is a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent except for.....","review":"Ok, I'll be the one to do it. I gave this book 1 star.

And I want you to know that... just in case you ever wonder.\\" The images are in soft colors, which again I think will appeal to my daughter more when she's older.Overall, it's a book that I personally appreciate very much, but will need to wait a couple of years for my daughter to appreciate it.*I received a complimentary copy of this book from Booksneeze.com.

I love it. Hayden liked the book too. I asked him what he thought about the book and he told me that he was special and so was everyone else. And of course that we love him.

I'm not sure if Pink Floyd meant Seamus to be a song like they did Wish You Were Here. or Time It may be an inside jokes among band and company or a Brittish/early 70s thing that we don't get. I like the dog, though. My dog barks back at it. I never really liked Pillow Of Winds until I listened to it in the dark at 1:00AM. That;s the only time this song works and it does work well.

The rest of the album is great, with it's aim at achieving a subtle mood throughout. I especially like \\"One of these days\\" and \\"Fearless\\". When I think of Meddle, I think of a far away land full of caves, mountains, and oceans. A great pre-dark side album, and album to lounge around to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it immediately, if not sooner","review":"Do you ever wonder what it would feel like to experience sonic perfection? I don't either...but if such a thing existed, this would be it. The album's highlight is the 23-minute \\"Echoes,\\" considered by many to be the band's crowning achievement. Somehow, the song is able to keep your attention for the full duration...even though it's mostly instrumental. Also on this album are the (absolutely hilarious!) track \\"Seamus,\\" about a dog who would howl when he heard blues music, and the hard-hitting \\"One Of These Days,\\" in which Nick Mason's growling vocals make you wonder if you're in danger of being chopped \\"into little pieces.\\" If you don't own this album, I must apologize profusely for not asking you to buy it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"nostalgia","review":"Pink Floyd is one of those bands I don't get. By that I mean I don't get why everyone has such a boner over them. Whatever I'm not here to judge.Picked this album up on the cheap recently. Its very nostalgic for me. I used to love it when I didn't know any better and that's what my stoner friends listened to.I still appreciate the sound of the songs vs. the songs themselves. For example \\"Fearless\\" has such a clean sound its sorta blissful. \\"San Tropez\\" has a coral feel, close your eyes and you can see fish swimming by and a fat bastard in a Hawaiian shirt drinking a fufu drink.The actual song portion of Echoes has a nice sound to it but buyer beware 10 minutes of the 23 minutes is complete unlistenable swill,not even in a artsy fartsy Sonic Youth kind of way"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pink Floyd classic!","review":"While not flawless, Meddle is certainly an enjoyable prog/psych album.One Of These Days ***- Good bass driven song, but could have been shorterA Pillow of Winds *****- One of my favorite tracks on the album.

From the haunting opening One of These Days, on through the various mellow acoustic pieces that follow, this is an album which presents grand artistic range, and one disc not to be missed. The recording quality is good and it helps showcase the multi-talented gents making up the ubiquitous and never to be pigeon-holed Pink Floyd.

I discovered new sounds, and my perception of music became more acute. Pink Floyd let out Meddle: what an album! All songs seemed to blend together in a perfect package destined to awaken feelings in the listeners.The last song of the album, incredibly long for the time, has always been a special treat for me. I have never gotten tired of listening to it.

Simply, it combines wonderful lyrics with sounds (crowd in Fearless, dogs in Seamus). Music that shows incredible creativity (One of these days).

I agree that this is what is known as a midnight album\\" meaning that songs such as \\"pillow of winds\\" sounds so much better in the silence of the moonlit night Other songs such as Fearless are fantastic and otherworldly. Finally there is \\"Echoes\\" that sounds so haunting at first but after several listens one can admire the beauty of it. This album is for the person who wishes to expand their knowledge of Floyd beyond DSOTM and WYWH and The Wall.

Gone are the wildly experimental guitar and synthesizer sounds that graced every record before this one. What has taken its place is a controlled and planned sound, where improvisation has taken a back seat to orchestration. The epic 'Echoes' is a 23-minute \\"rehearsed\\" jam session, much like 'Shine On' and gives listeners insight of what's to come. All the songs are good, but \\"Echoes\\", \\"Fearless\\", and \\"One Of These Days\\" stand out as most memorable. \\"San Tropez\\" seems like it belongs on another album, like Piper or Atom, but so did \\"Have A Cigar\\" from Wish You Were Here, and \\"Seamus\\" is a humorous bluesy tune by Roger Waters about a dog.- Zack, 16 years old"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GOLDEN NUGGET OF REMASTERS","review":"AS AN AUDIO PERFECTIONIST FOR THE BEST AUDIO REPRODUCTIONS, I AM FIRST IN LINE WHEN A NEW REMASTER IS RELEASED.MOST OF THE REMASTERS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WERE JUST OK, THE BEATLES CATALOG ALTHOUGH IN 2009 WERE AN EXCEPTION.THEY WERE PROBABLY THE BEST REMASTERS TO COME OUT AT THAT POINT IN TIME.NOW FOR THIS CDJAMES GUTHRIE IS THE MASTER OF THE REMASTERS,WHAT A GREAT JOB HE DID HERE ON THE DISCOVERY SERIES .THIS PRODUCTION IS AMAZING,THE CLARITY,THE VOCALS,AND ALL AROUND SOUND IS JUST IMPECCABLE,ESPECIALLYTHE ACOUSTIC GUITARS.

We're really starting to see a more cohesive Pink Floyd at this point. David Gilmour has really found his own voice, with his guitar playing, Roger Waters's writing is settling into that sound that is easily definable as being Pink Floyd, and the band is, generally, in very good form. A great album that you won't likely hear on classic rock radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Great to hear tambourines in 'Fearless' I've never heard before.

Fearless just has a mindblowing riff and spectacular melodies.Echoes... what can i say? Echoes was composed of about 40 music ideas. It is one of my favorite songs, nice lyrics and a great riff at 18 min and 30 sec. How come the radio never plays these songs? THanks Floyd for the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not the Best Floyd CD, but very close","review":"This is would be a great CD by any standard except when compared to Floyd's later works. If not for the mediocre \\"Seamus\\" and \\"San Tropez\\", this release may rank with their very best, but instead it lags just behind DSOTHM, WYWH, A, and TW. You can really hear David Gilmour making a bigger impact on this record. \\"One of these Days\\" just rocks and the accoustic \\"Fearless\\" is the best radio song on the album. But \\"Echoes\\" is a masterpiece. Clocking in around 18 minutes, it sets the stage for their future music on DSOTM and WYWH. I describe it as kind of a jammier, rawer version of \\"Shine On..\\" (but maybe better?). Meddle is certainly a must have and is worth buying the whole CD for Echoes if nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie","review":"For my money, this is the best post-Barrett Pink Floyd album.

In this movie, Pink Floyd premiered Meddle's \\"Echoes\\" - as a prologue and epilogue of the movie - and the heaviest sound they achieved in all their career: \\"One Of These Days I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces\\", transforming their astral sound in a bass-driven hard rock. Gilmour was consolidating his position as guitarist making a fine slide guitar work on this track.This is, along with \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\", the best pre-Dark Side album of PF."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BOTHER ME WITH BEATLES.......ECHOES","review":"When you can buy an album for one song, you know that song is obviously the best song ever made and that ever will be made. There are no words to describe the song echoes. I've heard epic masterpiece and work of art. These phrases do not even give the song echoes the time of day. It is truly the greatest mind capsuring experience of all time. I do not know how p.floyd came up with this tune, but I do know that the beatles or zeppelin or whoever has never made a statement such as this. One of these days and fearless just set you up for the song that you know is coming. Even though it is over 20 minutes long, that is not long enough for me. And with that statement, I challenge non-floyd fans to buy it. Some of you will disagree openly just to sound like you don't have to be bothered with psychadelical music, but inside I know you will admit to yourselves that you just heard the greatest collaberation of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless and hauntingly beautiful masterpiece","review":"With Meddle, Pink Floyd achieved for the first time, and arguably the last, the consistent and astonishingly high level of sheer psychic power that they had been striving for with all their previous releases. Meddle became the benchmark for all the masterfully recorded albums that were to follow. On these subsequent releases, however, Pink Floyd gives us only brief, but compelling, glimpses of their true sonic abilities.My tastes in music have changed from the days when I first started listening to Pink Floyd, but they have remained one of my favorite musical experiments, especially with their earlier, more artistic albums (A Saucerful of Secrets through Dark Side of the Moon). These are the albums that have most affected the evolution of my music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am not much of a Pink Floyd fan.....","review":"...but having drowned myself throughout life with alternative, punk, ska, jazz, big band, etc. I have begun digging back into classic rock.One day I was listening to Music Choice on cable and the song \\"Fearless\\" came on. I recall hearing the song back in high school and most likely dismissed it as \\"hippie crap.\\" I enjoyed the flow of the tune and downloaded the album.I listened to the album closely and instantly dug it. A couple of the later tracks made me realize how one of my favorite artists, Beck, must really like this album. I am not saying Beck Hanson ripped them off but some of the songs sound awfully similar to a few of Beck's numbers (see his album \\"Mutations\\"). If you like this album I would highly suggest you picking up Beck's \\"Mutations\\" -- a great album.I would suggest this album to any fan of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's Best Album, But...","review":"Even though the version of Echoes on here is breathtaking (and the main reason I say it's the best Floyd album), my favorite version is the live one from the Pompeii concert. The guitars are heavier and the harmonies are punchier. So, while I absolutely recommend buying this album, be sure to buy \\"Live At Pompeii\\" too.By the way, the rest of the album is great too, especially Fearless and One Of These Days I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Contained inside 'Meddle' is an exciting blend of blues, jazz, and that trademark Pink Floyd slow-rockish music, for lack of a better term. The main purpose of 'Pillow of Winds,' the album's second track, at least for me, is to calm down the listener from listening to 'One of these Days,' the track before it. After I listened to 'One of these Days,' I felt extraordinarily excited and pleasantly angry, almost the same way one feels after playing football. But then the soft fade into the next song calmed me down and nearly put me to sleep, just as I believe Pink Floyd intended it to be. The other songs had similar effects, PF clearly portrays their emotions throughout the album.All in all, a fantastic album, second to only Wish You Were Here in the list of Floyd albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, This is Pink Floyd's Best!","review":"Meddle is really a album of transformation. Echoes is simply classic art rock! They really solidified on this recording. Everyone raves about Dark Side as the classic Pink Floyd work. Actually, to capture all of what Pink Floyd was about from 1967 to 1980, Meddle is the best of the best. Also, the most influencial on musicians of the time. People began to realize a little weirdness can be real art and also sell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Floyd album","review":"after listening to Animals, I thought I'd give meddle a try.Well this is one one my favorites by far. and echoes what tune.well I would say buy any and every floyd cd you can they are all great, you'll never be dissapointed. I just wish they would get back together again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very ambient, aural album","review":"This is a very evocative, moody art rock CD from Pink Floyd. That doesn't mean the album doesn't rock a little. \\"Fearless\\" and the pulsing opener \\"One of these Days\\" had me moving my feet to the beat. But the centerpiece of the CD is the 25 minute long \\"Echoes,\\" a triumph in aurully stimulating psychedelic mind music. This is not quite as precise and streamlined as \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" but it is one of Pink Floyd's most underrated and best recordings. Buy Dark Side and The Wall first, then buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"thumbs up","review":"Meddle is considered by Gilmour to be his start to the real riffs you here in later Floyd albums. Echoes is the Floyd's best song ever. A 23 minute masetrpiece. One of these days is really an early heavy metal anthem. Although they were not heavy at times, One of these days just has to be one of the craziest songs in Metal or Rock! A version of echoes is heard in the movie Crystal Voyager. Never again will there be a band quite like the Floyd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the best Floyd albums...","review":"The band finally found their own direction and voice after Syd's ousting with this album...the best part is the lush acoustics and the multi-layered Gilmore vocals that eventually became staples of the band's sound, such as on the elegant 'Fearless'. Also worth it for the epic 'Echoes', the first song in this vein by the band that, in my opinion, justified its length."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Pink Floyd's early albums","review":"This is the best pre-\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" Pink Floyd album and the only one that does not sound horribly dated. The musical ideas that would fuel the master work \\"Dark Side\\" were already being toyed with here. Especially on the side-long \\"Echoes,\\" which is draggy at times but concludes on a high point of sound and energy. The rest isn't too bad either. Floyd was a fully functioning four piece band at this stage (rather than a Roger Watters dominated group) and the singing and songwriting reflect that. Overall, a very good album that only hints at what was to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's prog pinnacle","review":"For Floyd fans who are also prog heads it doesn't get better than Meddle. \\"Echoes\\" is worth the price of admission alone and is often overlooked in the \\"prog epic masterpiece\\" stakes next to pieces like \\"Supper's Ready\\" or \\"Close to the Edge\\" (It pre-dates both). The band's more pastoral side shines brilliantly in \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" and \\"Fearless\\" while \\"One of These Days\\" must be one of rock's greatest album openers -- a scorching tour de force instrumental that shows off David Gilmour's slide guitar mastery. The sort of blending of pop, prog and space rock that was hinted at on Atom Heart Mother is far better demonstrated here and Gilmour and co. have been playing out this formula ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echoes, where it all began.....","review":"Typical Floyd fans know this. This album is where it began, their true sound indeed. You can here bits and pieces of all their later albums on this one. Starting with One Of These Days, to Fearless, all the way to Echoes the longest and my favorite on this album, just sound good all the way through, very moving to me. A MUST album for Floyd fans who like their later stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"This album is where the style that the Floyd had sort of slowly meandered towards finally starts to gel much more. \\"Echoes,\\" the 20+ minute opus here, is much more interesting to listen to than, say, the title cut from \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" because there's a lot more focus towards the construction of such a long piece than there had been before. The shorter songs are a mixed bag, but \\"Fearless\\" and \\"One Of These Days\\" are two of the Floyd's best. There's a lot here to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compared to ... the 2011 remaster","review":"I just got done listening to three versions of Echoes and most of the rest of Meddle...from the 1992 Shine On box set, my 1974 Japanese vinyl copy (rendered in digital format through Audacity and the Apple Format AAC exporter)and the 2011 remaster.My 1974 Japanese pressing still beats the pants off all the CD versions, including the 2011 remaster, but not everyone is going to find a copy...So, there is a little improvement over the 1992 mastering(in my pedestrian opinion...I'm no Audio Jedi Master...) but not enough, in my opinion to justify replacing your Pink Floyd catalog.On the other hand, the 2011 packaging is very nice, restoring something of the old LP approach and including a lot of pictures and text that were left off of other packages.I'm a bit of a Pink Floyd fanatic, so I'm happy to have three copies of Meddle (and four or more of Wish You Were Here and Dark Side of the Moon), but I can't recommend that kind of obsession to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 2 in the \\"All time greatest stoner albums\\"","review":"Wow...what a trip....pardon the pun.

The problem here is that the mastering is so godawful poor! It seems to be mastered from a record-and judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks (6-10), the record used was pressed off-center!!! Artwork bears no resemblance to original, and mine came with a booklet but no tray card! Add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release, and this makes the disc useless. Most Dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl, and that is a superior copy to own at this point.

If Jeopardy gets any more game releases, keep it the way it originally is. In my opinion, the only thing that should be updtaed with Jeopardy are the Answers, and categorys. Also, Jeopardy would make a great Nintendo DS game.

I thought hard about getting a Britax, but the money spent on a Britax vs. the money spent on this one, well it was a no-brainier! This car seat is just as safe if not safer than the Britax (packed with hard Styrofoam), it is about the same size, so much softer and much more padding than a Britax. And here's the kicker, its more than $100 less!! Like I said, a no-brainier! I've heard about the shorter strap issue, but my 1 yr old DS is an average size, (50th to 60th %tile for both ht and wt) and we have no problems and plenty of room to grow. I very highly recommend this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate This Car Seat","review":"I purchased this seat a few months ago online because of the fantastic reviews I had read and it also looked very comfortable. However, when I strapped my 1 year old daughter into it, the straps seemed to be quite tight and with a coat on, forget it, she just was not going to fit. I thought the seat must be defective so I called Evenflo and after about a month of phone calls, a new seat finally arrived. Same problem. The straps are maybe one inch longer. My daughter at one year was 20 lbs and slightly taller than average. I have no idea how a 40lb child would fit in this seat. Now that she's 15 months it's like she's strapped into a stragiht jacket. I have to warm up the car before she enters it because there's no way she can fit with any kind of jacket on.Would love to sell this seat because we will NEED to purchase another one. We have an inexpensive Graco in my husband's truck that we just love! Sorry Evenflo, will never purchase another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Frustrated To Continue Using This Carseat","review":"At first I loved this carseat and thought I had made the right decision, but soon discovered I had not. The straps were too much work for me...I don't want to be in rain/snow/freezing temps trying to fight the straps. They wouldn't losen or tighten correctly, and they kept falling off my son's shoulders. I read ALL the reviews to try and solve these problems, but found they did not work. I ended up going with the Britax Marathon, and found that it is much easier to install and put my child into. After all the frustration with the Evenflo, I couldn't wait to take my son places. Yes, the Britax is more money, but I would rather pay more money and have my sanity when putting my child in his carseat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good features...but not for long.","review":"It's a crying shame to pay this much for a car seat that will not allow you to put a 27 lb. toddler with his coat on in the seat and still be able to fasten the straps.

Now that our baby is a toddler, not so great. Also, it rattles when no one is riding in it...very annoying. If you have a \\"tall\\" car (we have a suburban) you may not like it. The base does not come off. I almost hit my son's head on the roof everytime I lift him to put him in the car. (The Alpha Omega, without the base, puts everything at a better angle.) What I really don't understand is with all this technology...why can't they make a car seat that is comfortable and works like they say it will! They all seem to have their \\"issues.\\" Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"car seat is great","review":"My daughter loves this car seat. She sat in it for the first time at 4 months. It is easy to install, however, I needed to put a towel under the front of the base to have it recline more. If I did not do this her head fell forward when she fell asleep.

If you need to clean this seat forget it you will never get the lower cushion off without unscrewing the back of the car seat. Also the knob to tighten the strapes is to hard to reach because it gets stuck into the seat.

Yesterday I finally got a cortisone shot, as it got so bad I can't move my thumb, lift my baby without pain, or open a jar.And I'm a fitness instructor, so its not like I'm some weak whiner with fragile joints or anything!This seat was otherwise a great buy, and I put it in my husband's car, since he rarely uses it, but if you start to get achy wrists---exchange it! The only cure for De Quervain's is to stop the motion altogher.

After buying a Graco ComfortSport convertible car seat and returning it the first day we used it, we bought this one. It took no time for my husband to secure the car seat using the LATCH system. We have a Chevy Malibu and a Chevy Silverado (4-door) and it fits both great. The knob to tighten and loosen the harness strap is fairly easy to get to. The harness straps look like they have plenty of growing room even with the extra padding in place so I don't think the length will be a problem once she gets bigger. Just by feeling this car seat compared to others it seemed to have a lot more cushioning, much more comfortable for the little ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought 2 and Will Buy 2 More!","review":"After a lot of research on convertible car seats, I was deciding between the Britax and this car seat. I have twins and will be eventually getting 4 car seats, so price was a major factor. I decided on the Evenflo Triumph DLX and I have to say I love it! I've read a lot of reviews on these that say that they are hard to install, difficult to move the straps to a different position and difficult to release. I found that the installation took 10 minutes to get it tight in both my Acura and my husbands Tahoe. The straps are easily moved without removing the car seat by detaching the cover and lifting a panel. The harness release takes some getting used to after using Graco Snugride seats, but after a few times it's apiece if cake! My son that is using this seat also loves it! He falls asleep rapidly and can see out the window more easily.

This seat worked wonders. She loved it. It is very comfy and roomy. However, the straps are impossible to adjust rear facing. I had to remove the seat from the car just to loosen them. What a Pain!!!!!!!!!! Now that my daughter is 15 months, I am not that impressed with the straps as they have one height adjustment for forward facing and it seems too high and rubs against her neck. I bought this seat because it is highly rated. However, I would buy the Britax seat over this one again as we bought the Marathon for my two year. It is extremely easy to use and not that much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the straps","review":"I also did a ton of research and saw that this and the Britax Marathon were equally rated, the only difference being price. So I purchased the Evenflo and loved the look and how cushy it was. However, after a few days of working the straps I'm just overly frustrated and am returning it for the Britax which has the strap adjustments same as my old Graco infant seat. With this seat rear facing I have a heck of a time turning the strap loosener because it's buried into my seat. And the whole double strap harness is just too much trouble. It seemed everytime I raised the strap to get my baby out, the straps tightened down even more to where I could barely get it buckled again, even though it is touted as a memory adjuster. Just too much trouble to deal with when I'm running 3-4 errands at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"safety concerns","review":"I bought this car seat for my son who is now 13 months old when he was 7 months old. It is difficult to get the baby into and I also had a safety concern with this seat. My son would lift the cover and pick at the styrofoam. I had to call Evenflo and they sent me a replacement which is the newer model that has clips on the cover so baby cannot get to the styrofoam. If you are planning on buying this seat I would suggest buying the Envenflo Triumph and make sure there are clips to secure the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many screws","review":"I decided against this car seat for 2 main reasons: to adjust the straps or clean the cover, you would have to remove the back cover which includes about 8 screws and I could not loosen the straps easily. Another reason (although not a main one) is the seat is heavy. It's cumbersome if you are frequently taking the seat out to move from one car to another or drop off with the day care. I bought the Graco ComfortSport instead (saved me about $20 and weighs less than 12 pounds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your child is over 2 this carseat is not for u","review":"I just got this carseat yesterday I was very exited about it but when it was time to sit my son who just turned 2 last month in it the straps where pulled as much as they could go and my son would not fit. eventhough the seat says toddlers up to 40 lb and 40 in but my son is only 30 pounds and not close to 40 inches in height it is probably great for infants but not for young toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Tricky But Worth It","review":"This car seat is great but tricky to get to work right. The instructions are not very good. If you are installing the seat with a seat belt you should have no problem with the straps adjusting. For the Latch system you MUST lift up the cover and look at how the Latch goes thru. If you don't, the Latch belt can easily go over one or both of the child restraints and make the belts seem to stick or too short. You need to look again and refeed the Latch strap when you switch from rear facing to forward facing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Safe","review":"Our daughter loves this carseat, and so do we! It came highly recommended to us for its safety rating, and we appreciate the added comforts such as the padding (removable and washable) and the recline features (while the infant is facing the rear). When she gets a bit older, we look forward to using the cup holder for her snack cup on long trips. It took a bit of getting used to when we learned how the straps clipped together, but now it's a snap. I do wish that it was a bit easier to tighten and loosen the straps. I can see that they want to make it tight to avoid accidently loosening them, but I've used other seats that make it much more convenient for parents. It's a bit of work when I want to accomodate a bulky coat under the straps instead of her usual light shirt. However, it's worth it to see that she is comfortable and safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I purchased the Titan Dlx for my daughter. The straps were difficult to adjust and I had a hard time installing it into my car. I returned it for the Triumph DLX, I am very please. It seems to be very comfy.

She does not fit in this seat. The Shoulder straps are too tight. I tried to release them (and this was not an easy thing to do, the latch seems to be stuck) Sure I hadn't released the straps all the way, I pulled harder, but the straps were released and still were not long enough. I took all the padding off, which is why I purchased the DELUX in the first place and sat the car seat all the way up and she did not fit it the seat any better. Seeing that most people are buying this seat for a LONG-TERM USE I would not purchase this unless your child is very small!!

It was, except for how wide it was, but even that is acceptable.What is completely unacceptable -- while trying to put son in the seat, pull up the crotch strap -- it came completely out of the seat!! We had to work to get it back in and secure to get him home. Now it moves back and forth and twists. How horrible that the strap came completely out and this is supposed to save my child in an accident!!The warranty is only for 90 days. I went and bought the Britax yesterday and it is much easier to use (lighter, easier to adjust straps). Plus they have a 1 yr warranty.I just can't believe it came out and it scares me to think what could have happened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great carseat!","review":"I have both this carseat and the Britax Roundabout. The Evenflo is so easy to install - even I could do it! I bought an extra one to have at my sister's house so we don't have to take 2 cars everywhere...and we are so thankful that it is easy to install since we do it fairly often. The knobs on the sides to tighten the straps are great. My 9 month old is very comfortable in the seat and it looks like he has a lot of room to grow.I definitely recommend this carseat, esp if you plan to move it alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS SEAT...","review":"I BOUGHT THIS SEAT AFTER TRYING SEVERAL IN MY VEHICLE AT BABIES R US.

She hated everything which included her carseat and riding in the car. We had the graco snugride infant carrier carseat, she hated it. So we finally decided to splurge and get this seat. She loved it from the first moment we put her in it. Its so plush and it cradles her so well. In the other seat her head would just flop around, not in this one. She can fall asleep so easily in this seat and even though we have to take her our everytime instead of just getting the seat out of the car, its so worth it and every penny too. Shes older now but she still loves her seat, we have 2 now one for grandmas car and one for mine. I would highly recommend this seat to all new moms especially if you are having trouble getting your little one to like those car rides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconvenient to use - strap problems","review":"I just returned this seat because I found it too inconvenient to use. The straps were constantly getting twisted and the mechanism for tightening and loosening the straps was awful to use... it would seem to freeze in place so that no amount of human strenghth could release it. On the plus side, it did seem comfortable for the baby, although she did get overheated in it rather easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this before buying.......","review":"In two months this is my second Triumph seat. The first one was missing parts although it was fresh out of the sealed box. Today i had to unscrew the back of the seat to get the seat cover off to wash it, the special impact resistant foam was completly split in half. There is no way that my 8th month old did that one. Also the straps are very difficult, and have fun actually getting the seat into your car rear facing without having the \\"latch\\" system. I will tell you however that as far as comfort goes, it seems great, but with all of the other quirks it has, it's really not worth it. Sorry Triuph, 2 strikes and your out. I am going to just break down and buy the Britax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Pain!","review":"I heard good things about this carseat but was very disappointed when I bought two for our twin boys. The straps get twisted (within the first three days) and it is very difficult to get around the shoulders. My husband was extremely frustrated and was at wits end with the chairs. Also, the turn dial on the side which tightens the straps was broken so I had to reach around a squirmy child and use both dials - not easy! I am taking them both back and buying the Britax. It is not worth the money to be irritated for the next two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"the seat is poorly made!","review":"MY DAUGHTER IS 23MTHS. OLD I BOUGHT THIS SEAT ABOUT A YR. AGO.

After having it for 2 months I hate it. The straps ARE a pain in the butt to adjust, with the two straps combined, it is hard to get them to fit right. The way the carseat sits in my Grand Prix, and our Sierra Truck is not as I thought it would, I actually turned our baby front facing before she was one year, because it does not sit right in our two vehicles. The padding that is additinal always slumps down in the seat making it hard to adjust the straps correctly. The knobs on the side to adjust are a true pain, they are hard to adjust at first because they are stiff, even after they are broke in, they are still not convient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use over 25lbs in winter!!","review":"We read Consumer Reports and decided on this carseat due to their rating...however....the car seat no longer fits our child and she is 26lbs!

After re-reading the directions, it states not to put a child in \\"bulky clothing\\". After calling the company, they re-confirmed this. I replied, \\"You expect us to put her in a coat, take her to the car, take off the coat, drive, then put in the coat again in 20 degree weather??\\" Their reply, \\"yes ma'am\\".

Not to mention how much room this seat took up in my car. I read all the reviews for months before i bought this, i should have never wasted my money, now i can't return it and no one will buy it off me, i probably couldn't give it away! i would give this product 0 stars if it had the option!

My daughter is 5 months and she has grown out of her infant carseat and so we baught this seat. Everytime Jaylyn is in this seat she falls right to sleep, in her infant seat I had to put my arm in the back and hold her hand for her to go to sleep. She is so comfortable and smiles when I put her in the seat. I recommend this to everyone, it is a little big, but the installation was very simple and I really enjoy this seat. Not one complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this seat!","review":"I also did a lot of research before buying this seat. We took our baby to the Babies-R-Us store and placed her inside the display seat to see how she fit and how easy it was to adjust the straps. Well the seat works fine when the baby is little, less than a year. After that the seat is a pain. The back of the carseat must be disassembled with tools to re-tread the straps through a higher shoulder slot. My baby threw-up in the seat and I had to take the whole thing apart to remove the cover and straps to wash them. Also, no matter how I work the knobs, the straps have always been too tight on my daughters shoulders after I put them through the higher slots. The seat is wide and doesn't fit in every position in our minivan. I had hoped to use this carseat for a few years, but now I can't wait to replace it! Our next seat will be a Britax that adjusts up to 65 lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just recieved the carseat.","review":"I just received the carseat, I put my son in it and he seemed to like it, it is very comfortable and soft. For some reason though I cant seem to get it to recline, can someone help? I dont think it should be hard but I did what it says and it wont recline. Other than that, it looks to be a great seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"This is the worst designed piece of junk I have ever used. I have been extremely disappointed. The whole seat has to be unscrewed and taken apart in order to take the cover off and wash it. Who has a kid that doesn't poop and throw up!?!...not me. In the process of taking the cover off pieces fell into the car seat. It seems very unsafe that the owner is trusted to put the whole carseat back together the correct way. Although the seat has padding and looks comfortable, my daughter who is slightly petite has always had the over the shoulder strap going into her neck (we tried multiple adjustments) which looks terribly uncomfortable. The straps are hard to loosen, which can be very frustrating. I am not usually this picky, but I felt the need to let those of you out there know...this is not a good seat. I tried to contact Evenflo and they would do nothing for me...very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect seat","review":"This seat was a perfect choice for us. Our son is bigger than average. He's 5 mos. and 21lbs. and over 27 inches. It was hard finding a safe seat for his age and weight. Even though he weighs as much as some one year olds, we still didn't feel comfortable facing him forward. We needed a seat that he could fit comfortably in facing rear and would secure his head and neck during naps. At first we tried the graco comfort sport but the one recline position was not enough to keep his little head from dangling during naps. He was noticably uncomfortable. The Triumph DLX has everything we were looking for. Comfort, several recline positions, and the perfect height. We could not have found a more perfect chair. Everything is so easy to adjust which is another reason to buy this chair. It accomodates all sizes. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"native wolf trio","review":"I love the native american cross stitch, I only wish there I could find more of them.

Personally, I dont like the song Hyperactive very much. I dont think that it's mechanical robotic nerd-wave sound fits the luscious glamour of the rest of the album. The White City is similar but its song structure still fits the album. It serves as an upbeat contrast that still fits. If Hyperactive were replaced with Airwaves from The Golden Age of Wireless (which fits this album much more than that one), then this would be a 5 star masterpiece every bit as good as XTC's Skylarking.I would love to see The Flat Earth on SACD or even 96/48 DVD. It definitely deserves it since the recording quality is fantastic. I kick myself for having not bought it on vinyl when I could have. Now its only available as an import."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every number a gem","review":"While a number of reviewers may dismiss Hyperactive, my experience with the song and the album is quite different. My first copy of The Flat Earth was a cassette pirated in Thailand. Because of the two-side logistics, Hyperactive was the first tune on side one, and Screen Kiss was the last. Dissidents opened side two and the album closed with I Scare Myself. When presented in this order, the whole album makes much more sense. Hyperactive is a killer opener. Every tune is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"TD Flat Earth","review":"Loved this CD and listen to it frequently still.

A summer night, all windows in the room open, ALL of the lights out and headphones on. Now you have the PERFECT setting for this album! Ambient, moody and tranquil are words that come to mind when describing Dolby's 2nd effort.

Marlette's characters are richly developed, and in a true southern tradition, lovable and 'dislikeable' at the same time. I was a teenager in a small southern town in 1964 (when Magic Time is in its heyday), and I clearly remember the racial turmoil that summer throughout the south and the feelings of rage and shame it all brought to the forefront. Marlette captured this beautifully through his characters--the joy, the angst, the fear, and the knowledge that something bigger than all of us was happening, and we weren't quite sure where it all would lead, but we wanted to be there. I think this is a wonderful novel for all ages, and I highly recommend it. Doug Marlette just keeps getting better and better, and it's a joy to read his work. Keep writing, Mr. Marlette!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful marriage of past and present","review":"This one-song EP, also known as \\"BeforeTheInmostLight,\\" is the first part of the \\"All the Pretty Little Horses/The Inmost Light\\" trilogy. The carefully layered song is built on an endless loop taken from an old wax recording made by one of the last surviving Castrato singers. (The Castrati were former boy sopranos who were castrated so that - hopefully - their beautiful voices would remain intact, while at the same time being bolstered by the powerful lungs of an adult man.) \\"Where the Long Shadows Fall\\" is about 20 minutes long, and is beautiful and mesmerizing. The scratchy quality of the recording used for the loop lends a great deal to the hypnotic power of this laid-back but compelling song. A lot of material recorded by Current 93 doesn't strike a chord with many first-time listeners, but this EP is quite accessible, and could very well be enjoyed by fans of Portishead, Massive Attack, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doggie Treats","review":"I purchased a case and the dogs loved them.

The vividly descriptive prose brings the story to life and evokes images that only someone totally familiar with the landscape and the people could manage. Readers are transported to that distant time when the memories of a brutal war were still fresh on the minds of many Southerners. A time when all the roads were filled with chokeing dust in dry weather, and life sucking mud in wet weather. The intense conflict between whites and blacks is eloquently portrayed by Kilgo, and the reader is forced to feel the anguish of a man torn between his duty to kith an kin, and the feelings of his heart. Bravo to Kilgo for tackling this difficult subject, but even more accolades are deserved for the eloquent way that it was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to sharpen with it","review":"I brought this sharpener and I recently sharpened my Cold Steel Trail Boss with it and it takes like 20 minutes to sharpen it, it wears my arm down after a couple of minutes, and the sharpener is already wearing down!

Now I don't have to worry about carving with a butter knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP","review":"JUNK. Good concept, poor performance. Barely sharpens hunting knife and takes forever to just notice a difference in the blade. Don't even try to do an ax blade (like it claims you can)...you will look like a fool fumbling with this little inferior piece of crap for hours. Perhaps it would work great on a little pocket knife...but a good rock would probably do just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"For the life of me, I could not figure out how to use this thing. I do a better job sharpening my knives and axes with a bastard file followed by a whetstone. I just dragged the blade of my axe through this thing over and over, and nothing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip purchasing this tool","review":"I purchased this sharpener along with a Fiskars Brush Axe. The Brush Axe arrived without a sharp edge and this sharpener wiped out its two sharpening stones in about 10 seconds of attempted use. Needless to say, I was left with the dull sensation that I'd been taken and I would not buy this sharpener again. FWIW, a ten-dollar, old-style, safety sharpener worked like a charm to sharpen up my new Fiskars Brush Axe."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure junk","review":"I have purchased a few sharpeners over the years. This is by far the worse one. The plastic case it is made of gets cut up real fast the first time used. The rolling sharpening wheel does not sharpen. If anything, it dulls your blade as the blade rolls on it. Junk, junk, junk, junk and junk. Very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I bought this thinking I could save some time and sharpen my knives and axes \\"the easy way\\". Lesson learned that there are no shortcuts. The sharpener put a slight edge on my pocket knife, but did very little for my estwing camping axe. It is a fairly cheap plastic case with ceramic wheel inside. It was not expensive however neither is a wet stone. There is no substitute for learning to sharpen your knives/tools with an old fashion wet stone. I generally do not rate items, but feel compelled to say that I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Price","review":"If you are looking for a good sharpener in this price range then this is it. It does a good job on my Fiskars Chopping Axe. I am not sure how good it would do on knives. I have only used it on my axe. But for the price this is a good sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all purpose sharpener","review":"This sharpener uses little ceramic wheels set at the proper edging angle for blade sharpening. Its small size is deceiving for it is well designed and works as described. Takes just a few strokes to sharpen even the most neglected blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sharpener","review":"It's a little too big to take camping with you but it's great to keep in a survival kit. It has a stone wheel that sharpens both sides of the blade at once. The wheel is removable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke too fast","review":"The plastic handle, the elongated piece you hold onto, broke with very little use. I was not impressed with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"I bought this sharpener to accomodate my husband's Christmas gift, a Fiskar's axe. It works excellent for keeping his axe super-sharp, and I have even used it for a few of my kitchen knives (works great, by the way). For the price, it is definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great if the Edge is Shaped Correctly","review":"I have one axe which is fairly new, and hasn't felt the bite of a grindstone. That edge was sharpened to a beautiful point. I have an axe and a hatchet, decades old, which have been struck into the dirt many times and which have spent many minutes on a grinding wheel. This sharpener didn't even touch the point, and only demonstrated how poor an edge I ground out. So, worked beautifully for my Gerber and Fiskers axes.The grinding wheel inside is just a stone cylinder with a V groove in it, held at an angle to the edge. Run the edge lightly back and forth through the V slot, and it's the rotation of the stone that sharpens little arcs into the edge. This doesn't need any down force. You can distinctly feel the drag when the edge has the same profile as the stone and it's time to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Axe will not fit in the Axe/knife sharpner","review":"Bought an axe from Amazon at the same time I bought the sharpner. Went to sharpen my axe with the brand new handy, dandy axe sharpner, but my axe won't fit in it.

One of two partners in an investigation agency dies but his ghost remains to carry on the business. Save for one episode, only the remaining partner can see or hear him, the ghost, on the other hand, has little power to do anything but be where he cannot be seen.

I love all the work by Louise Hay and I think this is a great resource to start thinking positive and seeing the results come through in your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heal Your Body A - Z by Louise Hay","review":"This book is a list of physical ailments with some very simplistic statements about probable causes followed by affirmations. The book is subtitled \\"The mental causes for physical illness and the way to overcome them\\", but there's very little on ways to overcome the illnesses. For example, for \\"Leprosy\\" she lists as the first probable cause, \\"Inability to handle life at all\\", and then follows with a generic \\"I rise above all limitations\\" as a thought to overcome the illness. Not only are most readers not likely to encounter Leprosy in their lives, the statements are childishly ridiculous.This book is not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Review","review":"I bought the Kindle edition to complement my hardcopy Louise Hay collection.The Kindle edition is nearly unreadable.

I also experimented with changing the font. No improvement!Save your money and buy the hardcopy version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"This book totally disappointed me. Let me give you an example of what you'll find inside; if you have hemorroids, you are \\"holding onto things\\" and then there's a suggestion on how to let go of things. If you have acne, you have anger inside, etc. There is no science behind any of this. I agree that your feelings can contribute to health issues but it's not the entire cause. Maybe I just have big pores in my skin that clog easy. There's maybe 5% truth to this book but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"A person recommended this book but it was not what I thought it was going to be but I have to say I have laughed more than I have in a very long time so I guess I got something out of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Silly Little Book","review":"This is a cute, but silly little book and is not worth the paper it is printed on.

I regularly buy copies to give to family and friends and am glad to see the updated edition with a great new cover.Like Louise, I had a diagnosis of cancer, and like her I did not use \\"modern medical methods\\" to alleviate the condition.

Her very simplistic and down to earth writing really workd for me. Since 1988, I have read Louise's books and listened to her tapes and CD's. Her affirmations in her CD series really do work, IF they are listened to often. This book is excellent to use as a referall book. After reading the book, I really understood which emotions or negative things in my life were causing illness. This is a great tool in getting well.

This book has the name of the dis-ease, the core possibility of belief and then a positive affirmation to re-direct that belief. That is great! It is simple, easy to understand and use as a reference book. Sometimes, I write the positive thought or affirmation many times over and over, only to discover that the ailment is gone.

Hacavitz incorporates the best of black and death metal successfully to create a deadly form of extreme metal. Vicious blast-beats lay down the foundation of the record for most of its entirety, yet it doesn't sound rehashed or tired. However, the band's speed isn't necessarily its primary weapon. Hacavitz also attack the senses with a lethal dose of malevolent riffs that would make Trey Azatgoth raise an eyebrow. The primitive values of the production enhance the ferocity of the performance. It doesn't sound neither under or overtly recorded. While a lot of death/black metal bands of today sound pretty ordinary, this band offers a fresh approach by impeccable sounding genuinely perverse and providing a productive output. If bands like Revenge or Sadistik Execution bore you to tears (and they should), you may find an alternate option with the effective and destructive approach Hacavitz offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works and price was right","review":"Attached it to my new hard drive and it works and the price was right.

Which, of course, affected the performances. Ice Cube is downright dull and Micheal Epps totally lacks comedic timing and screen presence. Unlike Cube and Tucker in the original, Cube and Epps have no chemistry in this film. The jokes are stupid, senseless and are not funny. This movie is a downright disgrace and a complete disaster from beginning to end.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your money on this one. You'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Friday series","review":"Next Friday wasn't as funny compared to the original cause there was no Smokey and the thugs in this movie weren't all that funny, the returning characters are Craig, Craig's Dad, Deebo and the next door neighbor Stanley (cameo).The story is about Craig's father taking Craig to Rancho Cucomonga to protect him from Deebo (who escaped from prison to get revenge). Deebo wasn't as good in this one compared to the original.Then Craig meets Uncle Elroy, who just won the lottery and his cousin Day Day (he's no sidekick compared to Smokey) and they meet the next door neighbor thugs.I only recommend this movie to the hardcore fans of Friday and I've seen Friday After Next and it's alot better than this one cause Day Day was actually funny in that one and the whole movie was funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"After seeing Friday, I eagerly awaited the sequel. This movie is one of the biggest disappointments ever. Where Friday found humor in ordinary life in the hood, this movie takes Ice Cube (who is now an avid weed smoker) out to the burbs to live with his rich uncle and attempts to use the formula as in Friday. It doens't work. Most of the humor seems forced. I mean come on. A gang of Mexican thugs living next door? Please. His cousin, who plays the same sort of role Chris Tucker played in the first one, also doesn't help matters any. Where Chris Tucker was in your face in Friday, this guy's a whiny loser who can't control his life. I could go on, but there are too many things wrong with this movie.

Yes, Chris Tucker is not in it but they covered it up well in the movie.The whole plot of the movie is that Craig has to get away from his neighbor---hood because of Deebo. He went to jail but rumors circulated that he was planning an escape.Craig's Father decides he's going to move in with Uncle Elroy and his cousin Day-Day. His uncle had won the lotto so he moved into what they called a \\"White neighborhood\\".Trouble occurs naturally. Ya'll just gotta buy it.

Some hilarious scenes, but when it's all said and done, this movie leaves more to be desired. What happens to Karla and Craig? Why didn't Ice Cube use Debo more often?

Rent it first and go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a different Friday, Ya'll...","review":"I love this movie! The first Friday was more about a message and life growing up in the ghetto.

Day-Day is Craig's loveable idiot cousin and has some of the best lines in the move - and EVERYBODY beats on this guy. If you were looking for more reality like the first Friday, you may be disappointed - this is more like the lighter side of Barbershop (If you have seen Barbershop go shoot yourself in the foot, fool!).

That's all this movie is. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, and it certainly has no redeeming quality to it if you're older than six.Buy 'Problem Child 2'. It's the same exact thing, but at least the children can actually get away with reading those lines. They're better actors too.Don't buy this movie.The DVD offers a director and Ice Cube commentary that's actually funnier than anything in the film.

But on Thanksgiving Day, just two weeks ago, I finally picked up a copy and gave it a listen, hmmm...relaxing, nice arrangements, excellent playing and great vocal harmonies throughout, not bad! \\"Us & Them\\" is my current fave and I now understand why so many millions have fallen under the spell of \\"Darkside....\\". The sounds and textures truly envelope and soothe you, creating a warm, calming effect that lingers long after the album ends.

The entire song Money (a great one by the way) reminds me of the enron scandle. Alot of the song Us and Them can be appiled to whats going on in the middle east.

Never before or after have I heard an album quite like it. Intense yet at the same time soft.

It is so great to see teens and twenties loving these two bands and I put them together because I was told by a 15 year old yesterday I needed to. It was great when working in a comic book, retro stuff store that I was told over and over by the youth of today that my Dark Side of the Moon Baseball Jersey from seeing Roger Waters in concert in October was really great. Mom and Dad don't worry. The concerts are either old or young people and us old suffered the consequences of a wayward youth in many cases and we are making sure new Floyd Fans do Floyd in a nice way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sidereal masterpiece!","review":"\\"The dark side of the moon\\" is at least to my m ind the most original proposal formulated by any other band until that moment. And the main reason is the bulletproof commitment and audacious statements in what lyrics concern as well as the kaleidoscopic flight that breeds it.Pink Floyd not only elevated but enriched notably the conception of irreverent expression, totally distant of the commercial mainstreams, they knew to add a new language, vision and sidereal scope to the music.On the other hand just a few records have been able to achieve the elitesque distinction of mythical albums and this is one of them.An absolute masterpiece that not only established a landmark in what concerns to have kept along fifteen years at the top of the best sellers, besides signified a before and an after in the music.Sometimes the words are useless because are unable to express the majestic grandness of the artistic expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd - 'Dark Side Of The Moon,30th Anniversary Edition' (Capitol)","review":"Review no.306.Pink Floyd's 1973 landmark album release.Where(if you ask me)early British psychedelia evolves into progressive.This newly remastered 30th Anniversary Edition is nice to have,with the two-layered job manufactured into the disc.What will they think of next?Tracks that I simply love hearing just about any day,afternoon,late night,etc. are \\"Time\\",\\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\",\\"Us And Them\\",the awesome \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\".Take it FROM me,get the 'real' thing here.Avoid any of those cheesy tribute titles where they have one or several unknown artists play a tune or two off this stellar classic.'Dark Side Of The Moon' is an absolute must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supurb","review":"I've still got the original record.

Some people may say these guys didn't have the musical talent that some groups did of their time, but with the combination of Gilmour and the mastermind Roger Waters these guys released one of the best albums of all time in Dark Side of The Moon. Classical rock fans who actually respect true music will fall in love with this album, and don't let anyone convince you anything but. If you are a new Floyd fan, I strongly suggest this as a starter for your collection. This album is definately up there with Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall.Pink Floyd offered material in Dark Side of The Moon that had never even been attempted in the music world, brilliant songwriting that was really out there and had a never ending presence that has kept me playing this album over and over...face it this album ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You know the content rocks, so does the sound quality","review":"This edition has fantastic sound quality.

However I never cared for Clare Torry's \\"Vocals\\" on \\"The Great Gig In the Sky\\" and \\"Us and Them\\" is little too slow.One of the reasons I love this album is because unlike many other Pink Floyd albums there are no songs over ten minutes. Another is the use of sound effects such as chiming clocks, cash registers, maniacal laughter, and heartbeats. Added to this is their brilliant use of synthesizers. The Dark Side of the Moon also features great lyrics all written by Roger Waters.This is truly the first (and arguably the last) of Pink Floyd's great albums. After Dark Side they had other good albums such as Wish You Were Here,the Wall, and the Divison Bell, but I think they don't come close to Dark Side of the Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY WHOLE ALBUM","review":"This is the type of album where you have to listen to it as a whole to take in the full effect. ALso, ditch the crappy apple headphones and get a nice pair of headphones such as Audiotechnica or senheiser then listen to this album.

It is worth your every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"One fine album.","review":"Dark Side of the Moon is considered one of the best albums of all time; I beg to differ. Although I admit it is an excellent album, there are songs on it that suck. For example, the album starts out with a good first song, and then the next three really aren't that good. One whole song is some lady singing the background to a later song (what she is singing in terms of words I do not know). Anyway, the album does pick up quite nicely at number 5 (Money) I may add, and the next 4 songs (to the end) are also very good. The idea of connecting the last five song is very well done which I should give the band credit for. However, in terms of \\"best ever,\\" I would rank Dark Side of the Moon like this:1. Sgt. Pepper (because it was original and progressive)1. (tied) Abbey Road (superior to any other album musically but not quite as original as the other)3. Led Zeppelin IV (excellent musical talent at it's peak)4. Dark Side of the Moon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must for any music collection!!","review":"If you're just starting to get into Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon may not sink in at first -- but give it time! It'll grow on you! With songs like \\"On the Run\\" and \\"Time,\\" the musical styles and sound effects capture the listener. And I can't think of a more relaxing time, then listening to \\"Us and Them.\\" One the downside, radio stations have a thing with playing \\"Money\\" all of the time, which has got to be one of my least favorite of all of their songs.

This album captures the true genius of the band, from the profound lyrics of Roger Waters to the melodic instrumentals. The band was at it's peak here. It is so much better than \\"The Wall\\" because it's not \\"by Roger Waters\\". It has the band working together and doing their own songs instead of the power trip of Roger Waters. Each member took part in a song's creation here. From the opening \\"Speak to Me\\" to the searing saxophone of \\"Money\\" to the soothing \\"Us and Them\\" to the trippy \\"Brain Damage\\" to the closing and haunting \\"Eclipse\\", this album is a classic! Every single one of the songs where someone sings has been played on my radio station, and rightfully so. It captures the band at their best, and it is their last 5-star album until \\"The Wall\\", in my book (though it is still better).One warning: Don't fall asleep listening to this album, it'll give you the weirdest dreams of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums of all time; brilliant!","review":"When I first heard Dark Side of the Moon, I didn't think it special.

It is THE smoothest album of all time. The transitions are SO seemless it is like one long, brilliant song. It's as close to a picture that music can make. Simply put, it's brilliant.

They just don't make 'em like they used to. The album uses sound affects to enhance its music, unlike some current music which uses bass guitars and electronics as a crutch for lack of talent (though not all electronic bands are bad). I highly recommend this album to anyone wanting a break from the shallow smiley-happy boy bands and teen pop idols that seem to pervuade current musical trends.

Kenneth Stuart said it well in his review about the quality of the CD layer of this \\"Dark Side\\" ... not very good. Better versions have been done. I agree with him that the UK Harvest CD of \\"Dark Side\\" is very good and not available now. The version in Sony's 'Shine On' Pink Floyd box set. is good also but expensive. However, the SACD layer of this 30th Anniversary remaster is outstanding (5 stars). Very natural, open, and dynamic sound.

Stupid! Has anyone else have this same problem with Amazon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I'll keep this short....This is an awesome box set. I haven't heard the quadraphonic version in 30 years, and that alone was worth the money. I'm not an expert on what other versions there are of this album, but the only one I had was some cheap 10 dollar version I bought when CD's first came out, so this one was a treat for me. So glad I bought it, can't wait for the others ones coming up next."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection, 5 out of 5","review":"I love pieces of the Wall tremoundously but in its entirety I would select Dark Side of the Moon as the better album with very little thought. I see the 1 and 2 star reviews and it boggles my mind. These have to be people who love to argue just for the sake of argueing. I can understand that the album would not be a 4 or 5 for everyone but the number of 1 and 2 star reviews makes no sense. What are these people listening to? What do they consider a 4 or 5 star album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here it goes....I'll be ridiculed to death..................","review":"Sorry folks. This album is not that good. I know its been on the music charts for years... I know its constantly being played on the radio... I just fail to get it.\\"Money\\" and \\"Time\\" seem to be the only tunes to my liking - the others just seem to be drug-induced, slow, and depressing. After owning this album back in the late 70s, I never once thought about getting it on CD.Just to let you all know, my favorite Pink Floyd album is 'ANIMALS'. That one you can't miss with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and overrated","review":"I used to listen to Pink Floyd in High School and college. It is music that is meant to be listened to in an altered state, if you know what I mean :-) But, the fact is, now at the age of 33, I would never pop in a pink floyd album. The music is dull, pessimistic, and it drones on folks.Bottom line: If you are under 22, still in college--buy it.Adults with any Self-worth and sense of hope = don't buy it!BTW=I gave it two stars b/c some of the songs, while in college, were pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The worlds best Album","review":"My favorite album of all time and even better in gold. I got it used but the sound quality is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great packaging at least...","review":"The packaging is great, all I had hoped. Unfortunately the manufacturing of the vinyl, or part of the packaging (looks like it was dragged across something) process, was done poorly. The album came scuffed on both sides, one side substantially. Pops and clicks are present throughout. I gave it a thorough cleaning with a Nitty Gritty 1.5 cleaning unit which helped a little but the pops and clicks are still everywhere. Easily the worst sounding new LP I have purchased, very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant Over 30 Years Later","review":"Incredibly, Dark Side Of The Moon, by Pink Floyd, was released almost 35 years ago. The amazing thing is that this excellent CD is still important and relevant today. I can listen to Us and Them over and over again. The hypnotic perfection of this CD is amazing. Most bands would love to have a collection of greatest hits that would rival this one album by this incredible band. If you have not heard this, you are in for a treat. A Five star masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better and better","review":"This release has been remasterd from the original tapes iusing Sony's latest digital stream technology, which is supersior enough for SACD discs so the regular CD player can benefit too, and it does.The over quality of the sound from this disck is better that I have ever heard before, so much so it's like a new album. You can hear the band as a whole, the keyboards, drums, brass and are more prominent and with a clarity that enhances the entire CD. Even if you have a copy of DSOTM and enjoy it, all the more reason to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is why I bought a SACD player.. really","review":"I wanted this to come out on DVD-A. I bought my SACD player just for this multichannel mix. I am so happy I have it. And the SACD stereo mix is also top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.......\\"Great line........","review":"This is by far one of the greatest albums of all time!Don't hate dark side finatics,but this is only my fourth favorite Pink Floyd album,beaten by The Wall(the greatest album ever)Meddle(musically the best album of all time)and Animals(musically the 2nd greatest album of all time).Sue me.Despite that,I reccomend this album to any fan of the oldies or just,ANYONE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"remastered version poor quality","review":"This is specifically for the remastered version. Others wrote about getting poor pressings, and I am one of those. It was good until the end of the second side. It sounded like there was a scuff on the record, but a visual inspection shows no scratches, so it must be in the way it was made. Secondly, there are some sonic differences from the original recording. There was something disturbing about the cut: \\"on the run\\". I think the problem is that there is a slight time offset between the percussion (cymbals) and the rest of the instruments. It is really annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even a million stars are not sufficient","review":"The dark side of the moon is my favourite album.I could spend 24 hours of the day desribing the greatness of Pink Floyd and this masterpiece which they created.No collection is complete without this album.Please buy this to earn respect in society."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band ever? Ahead of their time in more ways than one.","review":"This album is in one word \\"beautiful\\", \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" makes the hairs on my back stand up when i listen to it.I truely apprieciate this album as a music lover. Ahead of their time in more ways than one, experimentation of electrical equipment before sampling was even born. I'm not that old i'm 18, and i can see how amazing this album is. Close your eyes when you play it and let the music take you for an amazing journey, cheesey yes, but it really does it, u have to buy it to see. A must for anyone who loves - and apprieciates amazing music of the highest quality.11/10 for me, and i dont even give most album's ten, it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark side of the moon aka best album ever","review":"If anyone dares say that this record is bad. They wouldnt know good music if it wacked them over the head. However I can vagely see where there coming from though. If Im honest the first time I heard it I found it a bit long and boring. But listen to it more and you'll find it amazing. Every single track on this album is great. From the nice slow paced breath to the fast instrumentl On the run to the hard rocker time. My faviroute track on this album is either money or us and them. DONT listen to people like jacdale 8 or whatever hes called hes into crap like Fall out boy. Pink Floyd put all of them to shame and if you havent seen them at live 8 yet WATCH THEM! theyve still got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROGER WATERS AND DAVE GILMOUR ARE GENIUSES","review":"Need I say more!!! THE WALL runs a close second to the best Pink Floyd album. The Great Gig in the Sky is the only bad thing about the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still beyond incredible","review":"One has to wonder who would rate Sarah M and Sheryl C above Floyd. Dark Side is the epitome of what an expressionist album should be like. Sarah and Sheryl need to have an album on the charts for 20 years... Then, and only then, can anyone try to put them in a league with anything near the greatness of Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, a masterpiece and a suggestion","review":"This album is clearly a classic (I bought it on vinyl, 8-track, cassette, then CD). Also love Wish You Were Here. Roger Waters' tour this summer was awesome, as he played many of these tracks!A suggestion... finally after 25 years there's another album that can compare with this - \\"UP\\" from R.E.M. released in 1998. Much resemblance - exceptional harmony, sonic effects, melodically rich and timeless work that gets better with repeated listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"My first Floyd I purchased. Still way better than The Wall. This one is truly a classic. Even the music is still trippy here. This album sort of sounds like Obscured by Clouds in a way. This should be your first Floyd Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever!!!","review":"ALL I CAN SAY IS... GET THE CD!!! ITS A TIMELESS MASTERPIECE!!! WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW IMPORTANT THIS ABULM IS IN HISTORY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great","review":"It doesn't matter whether or not one buys this version, the original version, or still has the LP. This is just one awesome album, and a milestone in rock history."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st timer is amazed......","review":"DSOTM was the first PF experience I had. It is well edited and has earned the title of :Best CD ever!I would recommend this cd to any one who appreciated good music like this(beetles, led zepp., lynard skn., deep purple, etc.).

While SACD is a step in the right direction, even well-kept, original vinyl is superior. The vinyl, half-speed, two-channel master recording by Stereophile(long out of print)is the best way to experience DSM. Listen to music as it was recorded, not by electronically enhanced bits and bytes. Analog to digital reviews are a waste when the original format is obtainable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HARD WAY","review":"If listen to Pink Floyd, there is no excuse to not own this.

La calidad del remasterizado es bastante buena y supera a la del 2003. Las imagenes incluidas te dejan con gusto a poco al igual que el documental incluido.

My Yamaha V2600 sounded better in the 7 speaker stereo mode which is not typical. Normally the 5.1 SACD is so much crisper and cleaner. This 5.1 on many tracks is muddy, the best way to describe. Also the bass and sub bass not really good. I don't understand the good reviews it got, I would agree more with the bad ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply don't get how there are folks rating this 2 & 3 stars??","review":"My fellow Amazon'ers...disregard the overanalytical, pessimistic audiophile nerds who gave this two stars. The live disc is awesome and the remastering on the original studio album is good too. But don't miss out on the live disc, if you love live music cd's as much as me and love pf like i do, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot by not getting this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the recent re-issue. This package is from a few years ago.","review":"This pressing is horrible. It is very noisy. Do not confuse this with the 2011 version, which by all accounts sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"True artistic Masterpiece","review":"Pink FLoyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is one of the albums that proves over and over again that the boundaries of music are limitless. The album holds a special unique place in the universe of art. Every sound, rhythm, and lyric furthers the albums story of life, loss, and death. The whole album melts together to a heartbeat rhythm, with musical highs and lows. From the swirling electronic soundscape of \\"on the run\\", to the biting sarcasm and anger of \\"money\\", to the final climax of sound where the message of the album comes full circle, \\"dark side of the moon\\" takes us on a aural and mental journey that is rarely found in Pop Music. Pink Floyd were truly innovative and creative, pushing back boundaries and redefining the idea of music.For best results, listen with a good pair of headphones in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever.","review":"Pink Floyd is the best band ever. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the best album ever. David Gilmour is the best singer ever. David Gilmour is the best guitarist ever. Roger Waters is the best bassist ever. Roger Waters is the best writer ever. Nick Mason is the best drummer ever. Richard Wright is the best keyboardist ever. Claire Tory is the best guest-starring singer ever. The \\"I was really drunk at the time\\" guy is the best ever at whatever it is he does. The guy at the store who sold this to me is the best salesguy ever. The cabdriver who drove me to the store is the best cabdriver ever.Yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest gig","review":"What really remains to be said? The only truly adequate review of such a phenomenon as this would be itself a work of art. After not giving this album a fair listen in the early 80s, I thank the two young men who played it as we rode aboard a train rolling through the south of England back in 86."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two 3-letter words: art to pop","review":"This album was the end of Pink Floyd's once mighty tenure as the psychadelic kings. After this album there was no turning back. Darkside of the Moon is just a bad version of Obscured by Clouds and isn't there best work. People can go ahead and concider this their best album but lyrically only Brain Damge is the only appealing selection and musically Eclipse is the only song that displays any effort form the band itself. All and all compared to non-Pink Floyd albums it is a masterpiece but this album introduced Pink Floyd to their doom and that was fame and fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surround mix of SACD is horrible compared to the quad mix!","review":"This is one of the best albums i ever heard. But, like Hey Mo!! already indicated: The surround mix of the SACD is absolutely horrible compared to the original Alan Parsons quadrophonic mix. Tha SACD mix has only added 'ambient effects', while the AP quad mix is really discrete and adds 3 extra dimensions to the album.It's too bad that the AP mix is not available for the general public, so you can verify my opinion. Let's hope this changes soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Everyone keeps rambling how great this CD sounds, and how way ahead of it's time it is. Yeah, back in 1973. Now it sounds as silly and dated as most of the music from that era. So it has been a consistent seller and one of the top albums of all time. So has Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" and the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" soundtrack, but I don't see anyone rambling about how great those CD's are. There is nothing ground-breaking about this CD; it's just plain pseudo-intellectual fodder, designed to make the listener think he/she is really into something deep. DSM has been certified 15x platinum here in the U.S over the last 25 years. The Backstreet Boys debut album has been certified 11x platinum already. Does that mean these are great albums? No, it just means the American public has bad taste when it comes to buying albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Butcher A Classic","review":"I'd like to know who made the decision on how the tracks were separated and if he was drinking at the time. I understand that one song merges into another and the CD should be listened to as a whole and not individual tracks, but at least whoever put together the version I bought back in the 80's understood that you DO NOT separate tracks in mid-lyric or in the midst of a musical phrase when there is clearly a spot that makes more sense. If I thought I could return this and get my money back, I would; remastered and improved sound or not. As it is, I'm going to try to do my best Alan Parsons and correct the problems with my Roxio software. Failing a suitable fix, I'm sticking with my 20+ year-old copy on my computer/Mp3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a totall waste of Money...?

Even the name- Pink Floyd - is so perfect that it suggests nothing less than perfection within... and Roger Water's mind is apparently indeed quite brilliant... what kind of person could have possibly thought up such intelligently soothing lyrics and music? No kind of person, only a God.Anyone who doesn't like Pink Floyd is probably pessimistic, insanely anti-consumerist, and a very unpleasant person to be around. *cough cough* eric hamilton *cough cough*Anyone who could be so blatantly ignorant, so outright MORONIC!And for those who DON'T LIKE THE FLOYD, the lunatic is in your heads. You'd better believe that I'll raise the blade, make the change, re-arrange you till you're sane!HARRUMPH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd music cd and dvd set","review":"Great music from an historic band. I highly recommend it if you love Pink Floyd. A must have for all Pink Floyd lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Albums of All Time","review":"As most of you know, this is one of the greatest albums of all time. This is the first remastered version I have every listen to. The quality is truly amazing compared to the original CD version. Try playing this album and watching the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" at the same time, it will add a whole new experience to both the music and the movie. I've heard they didn't plan it, but the music works with the movie's scenes perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl is getting better","review":"Side two sounds pretty good but side 1 is bad. They must have pressed this from one really old mother. Great Gig in the Sky sounds terrible. Probably spent their money on the reissued posters and inserts and not on the vinyl. I will have to resort to my CD when I wan't to listen to this great album.2/13/12 Update. The vinyl is getting better over time. The level of static electricity is starting to diminish which makes it easier to get all of the dust out of the grooves. Great Gig still sounds the worst of all the tracks however.Musically and lyrically this is the band's best album overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can i get an amen?","review":"Are you a fan of this album?

In fact, it's all dark.\\"","review":"If you come to this album, as I did, having heard nothing from Pink Floyd but -The Wall-, you may be disappointed. If parts of this recording sound like the Alan Parsons Project, or even -Abbey Road-, it's probably because Alan Parsons was an engineer on both albums. In any case, any of those is superior to this (yawn) pretentious and overrated album.

Very unprofound. Musically? Simplistic, and not even catchy. This is the most overrated album of all time! I've tried. And I've tried! And I've tried! Just like \\"On The Road\\" by Kerouac, it is one of the most overrated, misnamed \\"classics\\" of our time. The lyrics are trite, the hooks are cliche. This isn't even in Pink Floyd's top 5! Those who like it have been sold a bill of goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated album in music history","review":"I have no idea why this is one of the best-selling albums ever. It's bad even by Pink Floyd standards; they did so much better on *real* classics such as \\"Meddle\\", \\"Ummagumma\\" or \\"Animals\\". I guess the electronics were kinda progressive in 1973, but whereas other music from that time (and before) still sounds as timeless as ever, this has become remarkably stale. Not to mention the pretentious lyrics. Lame lame lame. I guess this sells only because everybody recognizes the cover. In my humble opinion this is the worst, not the best, Pink Floyd album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd are much better than this.","review":"I truly couldn't find one song worth keeping on this album, and I love Pink Floyd. They have some really good songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"High Hopes\\", or \\"Hey You\\". I didn't like the \\"Echoes\\" Collection either because the songs were un-naturally spliced together where one song from an album ends and where one song from another album begins on the following track. They had to have altered at least 7 songs from their original endings and beginnings. It's like a complete album there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"I loved DSOTM when I was 17. Which was 18 years ago.

I was the perfect target market at the time and I already liked pyschedelic music by Hendrix and others but somehow I could never get into this album and still don't care to listen to it even though it has been impossible to escape from at times. Maybe it was all the clanging clocks, the \\"listen to what my new synth can do\\" tracks or the chick in the shower vocal exercise that really turned me off, though there are some good pieces of music contained here; all this stuff just seemed like sound effects junk to me, and I can't really recommend this album as whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark side stinks","review":"I really tried to like this album. seen it on all the top album lists + how it was in the charts for a million years. i cant stand it. even tried listening to it every day for a couple of weeks to see if it needed to grow on me. well it did not. whats with all the sound effects????? clocks, running,cash registers, ect. oh, and that chick screaming for what seems to be hours. grew up + still love, beatles, stones , led, zep, hendrix ect but sorry to say , dont dig this album at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great release for Floyd fans!","review":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

You don't hear any words until mid way into the 3rd song. yah really boring, instrumental, sleepy sounds. The song 'Money' is kinda random mabey it should be on another album because this song actually rocks! 'Great Gig in the Sky' is all piano and a woman singing (not words) just screaming (kinda opera like) This album sucks except for 'Money' which is one of my favorite songs. The firs two are extreamly long and all instrumental. and I really don't like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated albums of all time.","review":"There are a couple good songs on here but if your looking for good songwriting look elsewhere. Most of the album is filler. Self indulgent wanking solos that most people would have to be stoned out of their gourd to enjoy. If you want better examples of the american electric heavy metal guitar style I recommend: Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Judas Priest or the Scorpions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for people with a poor taste","review":"I really detest Pink Floyd. This is one of the lousiest albums ever made in the history of rock music. I never liked Pink Floyd and I almost fell asleep one day when I heard this, this is just noise! Anyone who likes them needs to see a doctor. This is just boring sleep music. Even Neil Young's Greatest Hits has much better music than this. This has two of the lousiest songs ever like Us And Them and Time.

It goes T-W-A-N-G throughout. Find another version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody awful","review":"I've been trying to replace music that has been misplaced over the years and I picked up this version as an MP3 download. This remaster has ruined the flow of this album. At the end of every song the smooth transition that existed in the original vinyl and cd versions are gone. After attempting to listen to it once, I can't even bring myself to listen to it in the remastered form again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sturdy as THE WALL","review":"If anyone ever told you Dark Side of the Moon was Floyd's best album they indeed were left in the Dark. DSOTM is not nearly as durable as The Wall. The Wall both tells a story and presents a theme. DSOTM is merely a collection of songs, which receives too much recognition. With the exception of Breathe, Time, and Us and Them, DSOTM is anything BUT a concept album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This low quality MP3 makes my ears bleed","review":"I have this great 4-5 star album on vinyl pressed by Mobile Fidelity and the sound quality is simply fantastic!The sound mix on this MP3 makes my ears bleed.I paid $1.99 for this today \\"on sale\\" but the MP3 wasn't worth two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Don't believe all the hype about this album. Sure ,it's got some good songs on it, but a lot of it is just something you'd want to put on for background music-it's not something you can actually \\"listen\\" to attentively.I'm sure it sounds great when you're stoned but for a square person like me who doesn't take drugs much of the album is simply boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This is an awesome set, a must-have for Pink Floyd fans!

It sounds like it was recorded yesterday. If you are frustrated with today's \\"rock and Roll\\", then pick up this refreshing album. It's one where you can listen to it front and back all through. There is not one crappy song. Plus, now that it is on cd, you can listen to it in its entirety without having to flip it over to listen to side two. It's music people who do and don't use drugs can both appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Masterpiece","review":"I recently wandered about the internet in search of something to buy. As soon as I saw \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" I figured that I should take a dip into a different side of music. Although I have a very wide musical taste, ranging anywhere from Dave Matthews Band to Frank Sinatra, I was never too familar with Pink Floyd. This CD is filled with psychedelic music from beginning to end, with each song blending into another to form a harmonious band of tunes sure to please anyone. So if you are looking to be pleased and get your money's worth, this CD is a sure bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on so may levels","review":"Okay, I'm not sure how it was done, but if any band could do it, it had to be Pink Floyd. For the six or seven of you who don't know, Pink Floys not only made an album with great songs + hypnotic tunes, but a soundtrack, as well. Try starting this CD on the third roar of the MGM logo in THE WIZARD OF OZ. You'll be surprized, and I guarantee that you'll have a whole new appreciation for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Concept Rock Album of All-Time","review":"For those unfamilar with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", the album has been on the charts longer than any album in history. If you wonder why, then you have not listened to the album. There are very few artists, who bring rock music to such a high-level, as Pink Floyd. \\"Dark Side..\\" can be described as a very thought-provoking and beautiful album, which touches the soul. At the surface level, the album is dreamy and strange to the casual listener. With an open-mind one can travel into the psyche of the individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best SACD I've ever heard","review":"If you are a fan, and have a good 5.1 system - buy this.

I am 14 right now and i didnt grow up listening to this, but I just recently bought it and it has grown on me instantly.

I have a decent sound system with 5 full range speakers (Interlude 40, 25c, 10), JBL PB10 subwoofer, Yamaha receiver, Sony SACD player, and I use really good cables and speaker wire. I previously had the MFSL gold version of this cd and the SACD version just kills it in every possible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...Dark Side in surround sound!!!","review":"This is the first pop/rock multi-channel SACD that delivers on the promises made when the format was introduced. Where other SACDs use the extra channels to provide goofy instrument placement and distracting pans, reminiscent of the \\"good ol' days\\" of quad, in this case everything works perfectly. The surround channels wrap you in the atmospheric vocals, synth, and sound effects, while the front soundstage remains rock solid. The two channel SACD version is excellent as well, but after listening in 5.1, you'll probably never go back. This is Dark Side of the Moon like it was meant to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"...the lunatic is in my head...","review":"....\\"run rabbit, run - dig that hole, forget the sun - and when at last the work is done - don't sit down, it's time to dig another one\\" ....\\"and then one day you find ten years have got behind you - no one told you where to run, you missed the starting gun\\" ....\\"the tolling of the iron bell - calls the faithful to their knees - to hear the softly spoken magic spells\\" ....\\"money it's a crime - share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my part\\"....forward he cried from the rear - and the front rank died\\" ....\\"you lock the door - and throw away the key - there's someone in my head but it's not me\\" ....\\"and if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear - you shout but no one seems to hear - and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes- I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows me away","review":"I get goosbumps just listening to the beauty of Gilmore's guitar playing.

It's no surprise to see how much of an impact this has had over the years because this music even today is a breakthrough in terms of musicianship and the flow of the album.

This CD is a must for the Rock Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Pink Floyd","review":"After making the excellent but muddy \\"Meddle\\", Pink Floyd finally acquired the professional engineering and musicla discipline to produce this defining album.One of the great albums of later 20th century music, and certainly one of the most popular, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" produced music that just resists being imitated by other artists.Part of what makes \\"Dark Side\\" different beyond the spacey experimental style of the music is its themes on life. And the experimental style is really a bit of a cover, inside these songs are some fairly straightforward folk strains of english music.\\"Dark Side\\" has a sound and style that is a knotch beyond most popular music. This is an album that will last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic...just don't over-play it.","review":"THE greatest album ever? No. One of the greatest? Definitely.

They created their own box when they released this album/CD. The album's theme deals with the hassles of everyday life. Enough said.

I once borrowed a mate's cd copy but decided not to buy as it seemed flat. origninally just getting this for the novelty of the cover and not really expecting a sound improvement i was impressed. it did seem like quite a bit has changed, with sound effects in the foreground. the quality is just like the rest of the CD catalogue, but the new mix has lifted areas, like the intro of money and such. Other areas have been toned down like the intro pulse (sounds like a drum rather than a pulse now) and the piano on us and them. i;m not too sure about some of this meddling, but for the whole it makes for a fresher sounding, more powerful version of the album (and still far better than the Pulse one). I just hope those SACD things go down in price, but for now i am happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even bother putting it on my turntable...","review":"When one plunks down 30+ dollars for an audiophile 180g pressing of an album, one expects to get a really good product. I opened mine, took it out of the sleeve and came to a screeching halt. The disc looked like it had been used as a door stop. There were scratches, imperfections and generally unbuffable blemishes on the surface of the disc. I wish I could find someone to complain to about this. I notice that some people haven't had any problems with their copies, but I couldn't even bring myself to attempt playing it on my turntable, because that would have just angered me even more. EMI (or whoever pressed this garbage), you are the suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"Some people have complained bitterly about the MP3 download. They say the track changes are horrible. Maybe the issuer has updated it since those reviews because I didn't think the track change edits were bad. Originally, on the album, all the tunes ran together and, well, you have to make cuts somewhere to separate songs. You can hear where they cut but it doesn't sound to me like any notes were lost. I've edited music for MP3 before and you gotta cut somewhere just so you can index the songs. If you want your MP3 to flow perfectly, buy the CD and rip it to one long MP3. This will make it flow perfectly but you'll loose the song indexing. All this being said, I used to listen to this on 8-track; talk about crappy track changes :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 in your program...#1 in my mind!","review":"Quite simply the best rock album of all time. I just do not care that it was a quasi concept album. Waters and Gilmour took us to places where we had never been. Nothing they did before or after quite measured up to this album, although some of their other offerings (Wish You Were Here, and the Wall) are in my top 25 of all-time. My suggestion is to put this CD into your player, turn the lights off or way down, put on the headphones (the best you can afford), get horizontal and press play. Wow is too small a word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd's masterpiece much to last reviewers chagaga, dismay","review":"How can anyone not like Dark Side of the Moon.

It is good to listen to alone or also to share with friends. The dreamy music and the profound lyrics make this album required listening.Many segments of beautiful instrumentals and song, this is just wonderful sound. Pleasure for the ear. This album can really put you over the edge of reality, and for this reason, it is good for meditative purposes, and to de-stress and ponder the big questions of life.The lyrics do address these big questions of life, like how to find your way in the world, and what false beliefs we often fall for.

Besides the fact that this is Pink Floyd's masterpiece. Like Sgt Pepper is to the Beatles, Physical Graffiti and ZOSO to Led Zeppelin and Exile on Main Street to the Rolling Stones. Every song on this CD goes beyond mind blowing, and a clear fact that they don't make music like this these days. Now everything is electronic and voice computer-generated by know-it-all young brainless producers who have no idea that they wouldn't be here if it wasn't for giants like Pink Floyd. You can listen to DSOTM straight through without leaving the comfort of being disturbed....well I can. I can't deal with pop music today even though I grew up between the 70s and 80s.

All the songs connect to a central idea which in this case is insanity, exploring diferent concepts such as:war, alienation, evolution and life.Now the music is simply incredible. The blending of sound textures in most of songs (breathe, the great gig in the sky, brain damage...), generating an erotic, relaxing and non-gravity ambient is the reason why I consider this album a keystone of modern music.It is a master piece in lyrics, music and basically you can understarnd why they were able to come up with \\"the wall\\".Buy it and frame it, it's a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark side of the moon","review":"This is not a rock album.

When I fist heard of the Japan version I was mainly interested in it because of its mini-lp style case, but when I listed to it for the fist time I was blown away. The why I like it more then the original CD is because it sounds more like the Vinyl version, there is more bass and it uses the Left and Right channels more which gives it more depth due to the fact it sounds more like the music is around you rather then just in front. I would recommend this version to anyone who has a high end system, listens it on head phones, or someone who just wants to collect it because EMI is stopping production."},{"rating":"2","title":"More thoughts","review":"I will never understand people who call this a concept album. When I hear Dark Side of the Moon I hear just a bunch of songs that don't really go together at all mixed together with some strange instrumentals and weird sound effects. But when I hear The Wall I hear a concept album in every true sense of the word. Each and every song flows to the next to tell a story of someone being born, going through childhood, rising to fame, and ultimately going insane. You can tell from The Wall that it is telling a story and is definitely qualified to be called a concept album. But ultimately Dark Side of the Moon has no story to tell so is therefore not a concept album. It's just a bunch of songs that were put on an album that don't tell any kind of story at all.

Why do people still talk about it like it was made yesterday? Why is it one of the great classic albums? Why does it still inspire people today? No one has ever come up with a substantial explanation. I can't either. All I know is that I adore this album. Every note, word, guitar lick, drum part, keyboard, vocal, etc., etc..It's a sad, depressing album at times, dark and brooding. It's not exactly #1 album material. But it has had the most staying power of any album EVER. It's undeniably beautiful, powerful, and a grand work of art. Enough said...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !","review":"The reproduced and digitized sound quality from the original CD is by far the best!!! Almost as if you can reach out and embrace the notes!! Better than in the 70's and I'm clean & sober!!!JohnB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Feels Like The First Time!","review":"Classic is something that transcends generations...each song is priceless; the album flows with an unselfconsciousness missing in later albums, and it is obvious that the band is having fun with this and not trying as darned hard as they did in subsequent works (like the theatrical, and sometimes tedious The Wall). I had the pleasure recently of introducing a friend (who is 10 years my junior and into the most recent Techno/Industrial/Gothic stuff) to Dark Side...what a rush to see that thrill of discovery in someone all over again! The fact that he ended up taking the album home with him speaks highly of the timeless nature of this really great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd is awesome","review":"I like pink floyd a lot. The way the music flows is aewsome. Money is a geat song and Time and Us and Them, so good. However, there are occasions when they go to far and it gets too crazy. All in all, it is a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best , at the end everybody is at the darkside","review":"Not much to write, just listen the music and enjoy.

OMG! How can you not like it! Every freakin' song is teh sick! With classics like Time, Breathe, Us and Them, Brain Damage, The Greath Gig in the Sky, and Eclipse you CANT go wrong. I love this album. It's so dark, desperate, and sad. Especially Brain Damagage, an obvious tribute to their former member in a Sanitarium. And Eclipse so much in so few words...all of ones life is in that song. Great Wonderful Diveine music from angels of Heaven! Seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"behind belief, Pink's best and the greatest album ever made","review":"This was what made Pink Floyd, it couldn't get any better. Even though this masterpiece is 30 years old I still think it is the most saticfying and \\"beyond it's time\\" album of all time. I,ve listened to the whole thing from start to finish over 100 times in 4 years. It has to me all of Floyd's best: Time, the solo is just aswome. Great Gig In The Sky, the best use of another singers voice that is not in the band ever. Money, what can I say? A pure Floyd Classic. And to me the greatest closeing song of any great album, Eclipse. Simpley the Greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's best","review":"This ambient, mysterious album sounds just as fresh as it did in 1973. Waters' lyrics are deep and meaningful, and Gilmour's solos are jaw-dropping. But whats amazing about this album is how coherent it is. Each track seems to flow right into the next, and I couldn't imagine the order of the songs being different. The sound effects (like the clinking of coins in Money and the chiming of clocks in Time) really add to atmosphere of the music. Really incredible work, here.This is when Floyd acheived perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immersion Crap Set * DO NOT BUY*","review":"All I really cared about was the music. And what do I get? Three of four discs loose in the box with many scratches. And two other discs in cardboard sleeves. I wish the powers that be would have left all the crap out of the box and sprung for some real cases. Who really needs all that cheap crap anyway, it is nothing but garbage. They could have done so much better. A huge disappointment! I will be sending this pile of garbage back for a refund.

I wanted to replace my scratched up Mobile Fidelity version and was greeted with a nightmare. Now fellow Floydians don't take this the wrong way. I like Pink Floyd as much or more than the next guy, but this disk was such a pain. First as some have stated the sound is very different from the Mobile Fidelity disc. The 5.1 almost detracts from the music, as everything is far less concentrated.It's hard hearing Nick's drums from the left, David's guitar from the right, and Roger singing in back. Also I couldn't get the thing to play in a normal CD player, even though it suposedly can. After hearing Speak to me through Time I promplty exchanged it for the '92 remaster which sounds a heck of a lot better and more like the my old Mobile Fidelity.I hope this clears up some of the mystery about this disc.- Wolfgang Frost"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"Horrible stereo re-master.

Honestly, it is a poor SACD, very muddy in the drums and background. I thought I was imagining things until I talked to other owners of this SACD version of DSoTM, and they said the same thing. Looking forward to buying a hi quality vinyl disk in the future. I hear it is excellent. My recommendation would be to avoid this SACD version of DSoTM."},{"rating":"1","title":"More gimmicks than substance","review":"\\"Why Pink Floyd\\", is what came to my mind as I pondered how great this set could have been. Why include marbles and a scarf instead of the undoubtedly countless additional hours of material that must exist? Why require the Pink Floyd fan to pay over $100 to get the disc 6, the only unheard material for hardcore fans that are not interested in the surround sound, blue ray, etc..? Why hit us with yet another reworking of the iconic cover we all love, when we would prefer to hear what remains in the vaults.Then I come to an understanding... Why? Because Mason needs another new vintage Italian sports car. Not surprising that he needs a second drummer to ghost for him on the rare occasion he bothers to play the kit.Question answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Only a Critic Would Love","review":"Wow - what a disappointment. I grew up in the 60's and 70's, but I had forgotton how much of this pseudo-intellectual, banal artsy [stuff] there was out there. This is an album that the critics then and now believe was some type of a wonderful breakthrough album that was supposed to have lifted the level of rock music (or whatever) - actually it stinks. If you are still lost in the 60's you'll love this - if you have matured somewhat in the meantime - it will seem like it goes on forever and ever with mindless nothing. It has a couple average cuts on it - in reality - even in the early 70's - if this album had been cut by a less well known and less politically correct band it would never have seen the light of day. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is very un-cool","review":"See? I only gave it one star - now I can hang with the cool kids! I admit, I've only heard \\"Money\\" on my dad's car radio - but that's enough to know dis hole Floyd-think is mid-20th century. You dino's need to listen to some Future Bible Heroes - they will be remembered many months from now. This Dark Side is just a retro-fad. Ever see that flik with the rich guy who's in love with his little sled? Like, the same number of people who remember that will remember DS 6 months from now! Ps: Schaumburg is sooo boring - get me out of here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this become popular?","review":"I don't know what was happening with music fans in 1973, but there must've been a low point in music history going on or something. Pink Floyd are without question the most overatted band EVER. I have listened to this album several times and tried to like it. But I can't, it stinks to be frank. Even the supposedly classic song \\"Money\\". Is very annoying to listen to more than once, maybe its that unbearable sax solo or the off-key rhythm section and cash register sounds. But to me this album is very poor and vastly overatted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Led Zepellin","review":"Pink Floyd is by all means original. But if you're new to them, hear them first. You either love them or you hate them. Personally, I don't see why they're so highly esteemed. They've got a good beat, but I am always disappointed after I listen to a song and never catch the riff. Great songwriters ( Beatles, Rolling Stones, LED ZEPELLIN ) get a beat and work off of it. Pink Floyd just sort of dicks around and never gets interesting. Their singer isn't my type either- he doesn't have the energy of a real rock and roll band.I realize that millions of people love this band, but I'm more into music than most people anywhere- I listen to Rock, R&B;, Metallica, Techno, and Classical... and I don't recommend Pink Floyd- but I wouldn't dissuade you from listening to him, as expanding musical taste can never do harm.

You people can't be serious. They didn't even get any MTV or BET airplay. Therefore, they automatically are horrible.

It has lush guitars, great lyrical content, and excellent throaty vocals. I recommend this album to anyone that enjoys great rock with a splash of progressive. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it can leave you feeling gray and flat after a few listens. Definitely something you don't want to put into your regular rotation or play at a party when you're trying to pump things up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why bother getting this unless you have an SACD player?","review":"Another reviewer gave this a low rating admitting he was only rating the cd NOT the sacd. The whole point of getting this is for the sacd capability. Otherwise you just have a cd. Next time perhaps the reviewer should hold judgement until he hears exactly what he is missing. Dark Side of the Moon in 5.1 is what he is missing. Listen to that then make your judgement on this disc. Im sure you will be enlightened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Just disregard the tone-deaf reviewers.","review":"This is a classic album that every music fan must have! It stands up to the test of time in terms of it's precision, depth, and mastery of musical emotion. As for the critics (one in particular): How can someone even mention any album by the bands Metallica, Green Day, REM, etc. in the same conversation with DSOTM?!?! Get real - Mettalica is (at best) a 3-chord repetition; Green Day, a juvenile shouting match; and REM a lame rehash of new-wave music. If you like Rock in most any form - Dark Side of the Moon is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dull","review":"This album is very dull and depressing! All those sound affects are designed not so much for sonic innovation, but to distract from the rather dull and ordinary songs. To me an all time great album has to have good song writting as well as good lyrics, and quality performance. My top 10 albums in no particular order are:1)Let it Bleed (Rolling Stones) 2)Revolver (Beatles) 3)Innervisions (Stevie Wonder) 4)Rubber Soul (The Beatles) 5)Arthur (The Kinks) 6)My Aim is True (Elvis Costello) 7)The Velvet Undergroud (The Velvet Underground) 8)Free Wheelin Bob Dylan (Bob Dylan) 9)Who's Next (The Who) 10)Hunky Dory (David Bowie)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing CD","review":"The sleeve and booklet arrived sealed, but the CD was missing.

I'm assuming it's all the same person who has so obviously had such a visceral reaction to this album. Kudos to Pink Floyd for creating \\"art\\" that has motivated people to react in such a way. Personally, I think the Pink lost it after Syd. One star for \\"Money\\" (great record) and one more because it isn't The Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold up over time","review":"This disk simply does not stand the test of time. For example, the echo used on the Us and Them vocals is over produced. Also the song Great Gig in the Sky amounts to nothing more than a bunch of screaming and lacks any direction what so ever. The songs Brain Damage and Eclipse especially have lost its appeal. \\"All that you touch.....\\" seems dry and just lacking in anything thay can be taken seriously. During the \\"High School\\" days this was very stoney. But now it amounts to little more than overplayed FM dribble. This music simply tries to hard to \\"freak out\\" the listener. Real music that holds up after 30 years or so is usually not so overproduced, but instead has strong, straight forward song writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd or Parsons? You Tell Me!","review":"Were it not for this Dark Side of the Moon's (DSOM) commercial success, I'd probably having given it five stars...after all, IT IS Pink Floyd.But, DSOM is as much a reflection of Alan Parson's production effort as it is Gilmour's and others' ability. And, what's up with that? I learned to love Floyd because it broke with studio production conventions.As for ELECTRONICA production, Parsons is very good, but he is not Floyd.What I like most about this album is that it continues to introduce new generations to a great band.Nonetheless, this album is terrific. My recommendation is: BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a sure-fire classic","review":"While this album is not on my list of desert-island discs, and not even close, it is easy for me to see the appeal of it. It appeals to classic rock fans from all generations by expanding that genre incredibly without getting too weird. The Wizard of Oz thing also increases its mystery and analog depth. The phrasing is not the best, but it doesn't matter here. I do think, though, that the fans of this album should go buy \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" to see where this music was coming from in a purified form which I think makes it superior to \\"Dark Side\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's greatest album","review":"This album creeps it's way into the listner's mind and never escapes. From great hits such as \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" to other greats such as \\"The great gig in the sky\\"and \\"Us and them\\" this album is Roger Water's brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than life itself.","review":"If only life consisted of infinite time to lay around and listen to Dark Side of the Moon. It has spoken to generations, and will continue to remain an accurate reflection of the human condition for as long as Mankind walks this Earth. Pink Floyd rivals Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Hemingway (all of whom I have read) as the most inspirational artist(s) in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This is Pink Floyds first big post- Barret album. And it rocks!The music showed Pink Floyd at a time when they all wrote songs together and weren't led by soully by Roger Waters (Make someone who knows nothing about pink floyd listen to this and then The Final Cut and see if they can tell it is the same band). The music is excellent (I can't believe anyone was shallow enough to give it 1 star) and there is no filler (unlike the wall). The concept (insanity to be very basic) and music are good enough to make you want to go insane yourself.To top it off it ends perfectly with Eclipse.(note: if you have never synchronised this with wizard of oz and you are curious start playing at the third roar of the MGM lion. There are some neat coincidences. Or are they coincidences?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs of all time.","review":"Pink Floyd is so... original. There just isn't anything that sounds like this wonderful CD. Breathe sounds surreal, Time and Money are absolute masterpieces, Us and Them... just wow. Pick this up. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Album","review":"As a devoted Pink Floyd fan, this album truly resonates with me. Not only is it some of the best music that Floyd ever wrote, but it's very diverse. Rather than being all \\"super-slow rock ballads\\" as some have suggested, it shows a great variety of styles, from the slow, chilled-out melodies of \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" to the up-tempo, rhythmic sounds and bass of \\"Money\\". It is an all-around great album, for longtime fans looking for a bit of variety to new listners who are searching for something easier to diegest than \\"The Wall\\" -- which is, by the way, an excellent album if you have intellect to understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"isnt the same as the original but still good","review":"Great album......why did i buy this when i already had the original?.....i dont know....still worth the money though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Look, before you get mad at me, I'm 42 years old.

Very disappointed, Alan Parsons did not want this recorded like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the ages","review":"Simply put, a century from now this album and this band will be held in the same respect that people of our time hold the classical masterpieces of Mozart, Beethoven and Chopin. When the 22nd century comes, who will remember the likes of The Cranberries, Hole, and The Beastie Boys?? This album will still be selling strongly when Marilyn Manson is selling used cars for a living, and Madonna is getting her 17th tummy tuck. P.S. For any of you that feel this album is over rated and Floyd is un-inspired, I suggest you read \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\", and learn why this is not just a rock band, it is a group of Master Artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcends unreachable boundaries","review":"I must have listened to Dark Side of the Moon over a million times in the past 10 years ago. I know their music inside out.I have tried out various musical categories and songs. I would rate Dark side of the Moon as the best album of them all. There is something about that music, so rich, so alluring, so beautiful, so sad, so mysterious, so perfect, that one could keep listening to it over and over and over and remain enthralled forever. The music of Pink Floyd rises above the group itself, as well as any of the other existing groups or albums. It makes no sense comparing this album to any other. Its uniquenes makes it the best selling album of all time and that speaks volumes for the music of Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I kinda liked it.","review":"\\"The sun is the same, in a relative way;\\" This album is really cool. It seems to me to create a forty-odd minute sound collage, like Revolution 9 actually making sense.

I just call Dark Side of the Moon cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Side of the Moon: Best ablum from the best band","review":"I could ramble on about how good this album is, but I won't. I can't. I'd go crazy trying to explain how good it is. Every song is as good as the next, and it is only fitting that the last song is entitled Eclipse. This CD is less of a collection of songs and more like an experience. Whenever I listen to it, I end up with a different favorite song. Sometimes The great Gig in the Sky, or Brain Damage, Any Colour You Like, Money, Time, but usually Eclipse. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Roger Waters is a genius, high or not high."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is unbeleivable!","review":"It goes along with the Swan Princess too!

This import from Spain is the only one I have found that has the English version.I don't think it has ever been released on CD in the US. After getting over the awe of having this song on a CD rather than the old 45 RPM record, I listened to the rest of the tracks and every one is great. The volume and treble are a little off on some tracks (too loud) compared to most CD'S but an equalizer helps this small problem and after all it was recorded in the early 70's and is an import from Spain. It was very hard to find. Amazon tried for months ,then finally a marketplace member listed one for sale.

My Myolite started to falter after its second season of use, and then would not turn on properly. I returned it last month to be repaired. The customer service said the wire inside the unit was not connected correctly and Petzl could not fix it. They said they could dispose the unit or send it back unrepaired. Petzl did not stand by this headlamp which cost more than $50. I have many headlamps and many that are less expensive that continue to work after years of use.

Windham Hill has produced a number of these videos. Usually they involve collections of music by different artists, whereas this entire soundtrack is by Mark Isham. The music is, simply, breathtaking beautiful and hypnotic. However, it's a curious video. It is not a documentary where one learns about Tibet. Rather, the best way to watch it is to let the images wash over you. However, at times it seems a little sterile, with images of the wind whipping across beautiful scenery but no noise of the wind - it's like looking at scenery through a thick glass. The hard-core fan of Mark Isham's music will want this video but I'm not sure it appeals to a broader segment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Isham Music, but horrible DVD transfer and filming","review":"This has to be one of the worst DVD transfers I have ever seen, period. It actually looks worse than a VHS copy. The music by Mark Isham is wondrous so buy the CD, but this DVD is not only unclear but shows what only can be described as very \\"blah\\" pictures of Tibet. The editing is poor with too many shots held far too long in slow motion of mundane objects like a dirt road. And, no, it is not some philosophical Buddhist filming of \\"nothingness,\\" it's just poor film-making that happens to accompany a great soundtrack. What a shame, as this DVD could and should have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Documentary!","review":"If your desire is to learn more about Tibetan Culture, then this is not the most aproppiated product for you. I recommend you to buy a guide about Tibet, e.g. the Lonely Planet one. The Tibetan landscape is only a complement to the music, not the opposite. Tibet is a beautiful place, and you will find beatiful sceneries in this DVD, but you must be aware that this is not a Documentary, this is a way of traveling through music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this, bought mine - just watched for 10minutes before switching it off","review":"I wish I had read reviews on this before purchasing this DVD. I was hoping to watch a documentary about Tibet and not some person telling me how he got came to produce soundtracks with some visual that happened to be Tibet. Never in my imagination that some people would place this DVD for sale. It's likened to someone had just been to Tibet, captured some shots with his camcorder and decided to write some accompanying soundtrack to facilitate the whole viewing. There is nothing wrong with it - just that the viewer expects to know more about Tibet - it's places, how the natives live and not how he came to write his soundtrack. The DVD should be sold as soundtrack of xx with viewings of Tibet to accompany the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"love my Amazon Bali lacy skamp brief because i am 73 yrs old","review":"it is just right for my design needs---white, washes easily in the shower, dries like a dream, cheap enough. perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bali lacy scamp panty","review":"This is a \\"no longer made\\" item, but I have seen it for sale at $9 each.

I wore them twice and threw them away. I was hoping to find a style to replace the discontinued Olga French-cut briefs (style #23913), which were full-cut briefs but with an attractive lace band at the waist and slightly raised leg holes in front. I wanted undies that wouldn't ride up but would still look attractive on my middle-aged body. I'm nearly 60, and \\"hipster\\" styles now seem to accentuate any paunch. I'm not overweight, but I'm not some svelte little chickie anymore either; still, I don't want to look dorky. These undies were so unattractive, though, I didn't want my husband to see me in them; I looked like sausage in casing. The legs are cut really low, which I assumed would mean that they wouldn't ride up. Unfortunately, the right side rode up a bit anyway.

Of course, sensuous chaos ensues. I especially liked the hero, Marcus. Miss Greene also has a good sense of the regency period and blends her plot seamlessly.

Dancing across a field of flowers or standing with perfect posture. Yes, I do feel taller after each session. I am already tall enough but being taller makes you look thinner. Why do we women wear high heels? Case Closed! The plan is to do these exercises so precisely that you don't need to spend all day at a gym. I find these videos to be up there in the top 10 of my collection. Yes, working out does take motivation and an hour may seem long until you look at yourself in the mirror and see the new you and it is worth the effort.

The video video is 40 minutes, with 15 minutes of upper body sculpting and 15 minutes of lower or \\"total\\" sculpting for the legs, buttocks, and thighs. Some of the moves are hard, especially towards the end. There are some variations on push-ups that if you have little or no strength in your arms I would either skip or do less of them until you gain the strength.

The reproduction of color is AMAZINGLY ACCURATE (having seen the original pieces I can truly testify to that, and VERY important point when studying this master's art). The only problem with the color is their inability to use the actual metals in the prints (such as in pieces like Monte Carlo where real silver was used), but what are you going to do? This IS the go-to reference on the man who was indeed \\"the spirit of Art Nouveau\\", and will reveal his struggles, heartaches and magnificent triumphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"This book was well worth the money.

I go to the swimming pool with my son and he's almost 3. He wants to have fun and is not interested in doing any of the exercises for more than 1 minute. And it's a kiddie pool, because in that Summer club the kids have to be over 3 to go to the deep pool. I will be joining the YMCA for his swimming classes and of course, I will put in practice her advice to listen to your child so he trusts you and not force him, but that is just common sense/maternal instinct: I wouldn't force my son to get underwater if he doesn't want it.... What I really like was the foreword: I hadn't heard of Glenn Doman and now I got all of his books about child development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This is a book about happy babies and happy parents. It gives the basics on how to teach your baby or young child to swim and lots of real life interesting stories about babies and parents doing just that.

Great B-Movie fun with a great cast and then it got to the ending, and it was ruined by a cliffhanger ending. I listened to the commentary at the end of the film and the director talks about the ending he was going to do and should have done, then goes on to say he hates how directors end films hoping for a sequel and that's what he does, but worst of all, ends with a cliffhanger. This film would have been so much better if it had a real ending!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE WILL BE BUGS","review":"Surprisingly effective giant bug movie with good effects and a wry sense of humor. Christopher Marquette makes good work of his role as the geeky antihero while Ray Wise is perfect as his military fanatic father.

Come to that, the secondary characters, who Altman has the irritating habit of never giving a first name to, are just as lifeless and flat.

I get home, pop it into my DVD player, and then I hear this woman talking. It's not a DVD. It's boring as shit, throughout the whole thing, this woman just talks about the band. It's hard to follow along with, and I got bored of it after listening to it for about 20 minutes. I completely lost interest.

Finally, I decided to get this one. Well, I have to say that this is a very good album, equally fine as their debut \\"Air conditioning\\". \\"Airborne\\" continues with the jazz-rock of \\"Midnight wire\\", but on a more melodic and less pretentious note. The playing of the band (once again featuring drummer Stewart Copeland who also co-wrote some songs) is tighter and more engaged. Without getting trite, the music flows like a well-oiled machine. The delicate pop song \\"Desiree\\" leaves you wallking on air for the rest of the day. Other standout tracks are \\"Kids to blame\\", \\"Hot and bothered\\", and \\"Baby please..\\", but everything here is good, even the 11-minute megawork \\"Moonshine\\".

It also stated that this book would make you not be so crazy in love again. All that Dorothy Tennov did in this book was put what other authors have written. She put others people's stories in there, and repeated herself over and over again until she hit over page 200. I am very disappinted in this book, and wish I had never read such a useless piece of material. It gave no help to anybody, only confusion, and a boring reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"less good than i had remembered","review":"I had first read \\"Love and Limerance\\" 25 years ago, and remembered it as being a fascinating book because it described \\"limerance\\" (a word which the author made up herself) as that heart-pounding excitement when one first encounters a love object. Accordingly, I ordered 3 copies (one for myself and two to offer to therapy clients.) However, I was able to get through only 1/2 of the book before laying it aside (and determining to donate the other 2 copies to the library) because after it makes its [very worthwhile] point in the first 25-50 pages, it repeats and repeats it to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've ever been \\"love-sick\\"...","review":"I came across \\"Love and Limerence\\" shortly after it was first published, and it's stayed with me.

It gave me a new word to use to descripe the mania you feel when you first become so attracted to someone that you can think of nothing else. It really isn't love, although you think it must be. It's painful and obsessive. It makes no sense. It's out of your control. Well, the word Limerence is meant to describe the whole feeling. I mistakenly loaned the book to someone who never returned it. Today, just to see if it could still be found, I searched on Amazon, and here is a new printing!

It's not tough enough for framing though (wouldn't survive a fall off the roof too well) and might bog down when cutting 4x, but if you do finish work it's a hell of a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION","review":"This album was the high water mark of Seger's career, though many of us didn't realize it. \\"Against The Wind\\" was the third of a four album run that permanently established Seger as major force in rock music.For a while, Seger towered over everyone in rock music, including Bruce Springsteen, but less product, albums and tours, allowed Seger's star to fade leading to an almost has-been perception by the early 1990s.This album is a brilliant showcase of Seger's talent and a sad reminder of what could have been, if not for missed opporunities.It is one of the strongest records ever made. There are no \\"bad\\" songs and several classic hits. In many ways, it is Seger's third Greatest Hits album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Against The Wind","review":"The song 'Against The Wind' is my second favorite song of all time, sometimes my very favorite, in my more reflective moments. Almost all of Bob's stuff is great, but this one speaks for me much more than anything else he's done. 'Fire Lake' is also incredible, as is 'You'll Accomp'ny Me'. My mother got me into Seger when I was very young, she'd be playing it as we'd make out trips into the mountains, etc. Her favorite song of all is on her too: 'No Man's Land'. So it's an album shared by me, my brother and mother, and one I've listened to and loved for literally as long as I can remember. And while subconsiously I think stuff like Stranger In Town has better rockers than this album, things like that, with Against The Wind, it's an emotional favorite as opposed to a logical best, which would be somthing like Night Moves, Stranger In Town, or The Distance. But this one remains close to me. Great memories. Thanks, mom, thanks Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Against The Wind is a welcome sound for the Eighties","review":"Having been a Bob Seger fan since the early seventies this album is in true form.Acompany Me has been my favorite,even more so then Old time Rock and Roll.Maybe I can still see Tom Cruise dancing on the couch in his underwear or maybe I just got tired of it.Anyway with songs like Against the Wind and Fire Lake are great.The one song that in my opinion is weak is Horizontal Bop. The first time I played this album I thought oh no the whole album is going to be like this......Nah.Whats nice now a days i can skip this track ......26 years later i'm still skipping.OVERALL: This is a great album its just Horizontal Bop is out of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seger's album is OK but not the best and a favorite here!","review":"Only a couple of songs that's included on my Bob Seger's Greatest Hits CD from \\"Against The Wind\\" to \\"You'll Accomp'ny Me\\" I like by him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One From Bob Seger","review":"AGAINST THE WIND isn't quite as consistent as NIGHT MOVES, STRANGER IN TOWN, or LIVE BULLET, but it's still a wonderful album. It contains several fine rockers and ballads, the best of which are \\"Long Twin Silver Line\\", \\"No Man's Land\\", \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\", \\"Shinin' Brightly\\", \\"Fire Lake\\", and the title track. The other tracks are also very good. Seger's support for sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist only adds to the appeal of AGAINST THE WIND. Buy this one and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"wore out the tape","review":"I like this album so much I wore out my tape years ago. It gives me hope comfort and energy.

The ultimate display of idiocy posing as scholarship. In Paglia's universe every object on the screen has a hidden meaning: pencils become phallic objects, statues in the streets become carriers of major themes, and fur coats symbolize male economic dominance.It is a joke. If someone wanted to make a parody of bad scholarship, this is what he would end up with. Alas, it is not even funny. This book is a test of patience. I would give it zero stars if it was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paglia for people who usually don't like Paglia","review":"I often think Camille Paglia is really dippy, but I just adored this book nonetheless. Her characteristic hyperbole works terrifically when talking about a movie she adores (who doesn't like to go off the deep end when discussing a favorite film?), and she keeps her pet rants about feminism and academia to a minimum. Her analysis of \\"The Birds\\" is often first-rate and engaging, and though she does go on in places about her insane Nietzschean paradigms even there she's very funny. Best of all, this book includes an insightful and intelligent interview with that most gifted and most neglected of Hitchcock's icy blondes, Tippi Hedren, which does much towards illuminating her famous performance in this film and also dispelling some of the myths promulgated by Donald Spoto. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinical","review":"If you like music with your work out this is not the DVD for you.

It has glimpses of humour and good writing but most of the time it's quite uninteresting and I never goot a good mental picture of the action.Those who are interested in Hubbard may want to read this short novel, but it's not a very good one.

You can get the new sets for under ninety dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond.... the best!","review":"This third boxset contains not the best Bond films, but (we all know) the Bond films are the best! One thing that amazes me after watching various LDs and DVDs in my collection, is that one consistently returns to watching Bond, even after years of absence. They are supremely well made (how many movies have their own dedicated studio and special effects/stunt etc. teams? Are there any such competitors? ), and basically are the best, however much one compares between the films and highlights relatively small differentials. The long duration of the films alone - usually with several genres per film - makes them good value for money.

A View To A Kill, along with The Man With The Golden Gun, are the worst of all. Moore is too old. The Living Daylights is good, but not as good as Licence to Kill. Another reason why #2 was bad was Mooraker. Moonraker is about the third worst Bond movie. The other three in the #2 set (DN, OHMSS, and, TSWLM) are all in the better half of the series. Octopussy is the second best Roger Moore movie behind TSWLM despite his age. FYEO is close behind Octopussy though. This set is good. I would get it if I didn't already have all of them.

Some good stunts and acting, but Moore is getting really old. (He was 56 when he did \\"Octopussy\\" and 58 when he did \\"A View to a Kill\\") \\"The Living Daylights\\" is OK. Timothy Dalton is good, as is the car he has. \\"From Russia With Love\\" is undoubtedly the best in the set.

I have gloves purchased in a 10 pack, and cheap, that last longer then these. I had no issues with them when I was painting though so I guess that might be the extent of their use.

Adrianne's lyrics and integrity of delivery make this one to just buy and listen to. Aspects could never have been written by a male singer song writer, I'm absolutely sure of that. Other elements could never have been written by one who hadn't had some sort of Catholic background. But this is intensely personal. Comparisons could be made with some Brandi Carlile or Wailin Jennies. But to try and get this all in one package, which is also stunningly unique, is beyond my capacity to describe.

If you like Scriabin you won't have any problem with these pieces. You've occassionally had a rougher time with Beethoven. The Piano Variations weren't difficult for me to listen to in 1966 when I was 17 and some of it's relentless spareness gives way to some gorgeous harmonies now and then.

While there's some good historical action photos, and neat collectible skateboards, this book is so full of misinformation and jumbled facts that I don't know what to take for the truth. For example it says that Danny Way was an early pioneer of the air in the 70's. Danny was instrumental to taking vert skating to the next level, but not until the late 80's. The book is also merely a tool for the author to promote his own obscure line of skateboards, and for a small group of collectors to inflate the values of their private collections. As proof that the author has not done his homework, mixed in with the \\"glossary of skateboarding terms\\" are rollerblading terms! The book best covers the 60's, but after that it just falls apart.

It gets back to the basics of humorous dialogue and great action sequences. While retaining a good portion of the original cast, the introduction of new characters was smooth. Although it is more or less independent of the trilogy, Stranger Tides still fits well within the created universe. Its ending leave enough room to bring about a follow up without it seeming forced. Overall a good movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite by far","review":"What didn't I like about this movie? Where do I begin? Yes, there was plenty of action. But it seemed shallow and lacked the depth of the previous POTC. It wasn't fun and it also seemed absent of the light-heartedness of the the earlier ones. Maybe I missed Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. After it was over...I just thought \\"Meh\\" and \\"Glad that was a Rebox movie and I didn't actually purchase it\\" -- I was thoroughly disappointed. But on the other hand, my husband enjoyed it. I didn't particularly like Penelope Cruz in it, either. Anyway, I could ramble on, but the bottom line was, I've always enjoyed the previous three.

The first being a classic, the second being highly entertaining, but not quite as special as the first. The 3rd was a bloated mess. The 4th was worse yet with a pointless plot and phoned in performances by most of the acting core. I fear for the 5th, and based on my infallible observations, it will be less than garbage.Do not buy this unless you are a DEVOTED fan of the Pirates franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - disappointing","review":"All - I absolutely enjoyed the first movie in the serious - almost groundbreaking in it's storytelling and character development. This is the 4th (and hopefully final) movie in the serious and I found it to be very dull. I love the history of Blackbeard, but the way he is portrayed here in this movie is almost comical, which is completely not what he was in real life. Penelope Cruz does as good or better job in the leader female character role and shines, but the rest of the movie is very lackluster. Save your money and re-rent the first - you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I was so disappointed in Pirates of the Carribean on Stranger Tides. None of the amazing special effect as the first two. The story line was totally lame and the casting terrible. Penelope Cruz may be cute but she was miscast in this movie. I felt no credible connection between her and Johnnie Depp's character plus it was extremely difficult to understand what she was saying. Johnnie Depp acted throughout the movie as though he was bored. Ho hum another one. Just didn't get it for me. My husband felt the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really the best","review":"I enjoyed the first 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but this one didn't really grab me. What I really didn't understand was the love between the preacher pirate and the mermaid. It didn't tie into the plot at all. At least Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann got to know each other through the first 3 and you got an idea of the grounds for their love. Penelope Cruz was an interesting pick for the female lead. She has worked with Johnny Depp before and both are very talented, but in this movie, talent seemed not to be there. Penelope seemed like a cardboard character and Johnny Depp seemed like he was bored with the whole thing. It's no wonder they're re writing the script for the next one. The whole movie seemed to be rushed, the plot was all over the place and not solid and the script was not well written. They need to work a lot harder for the next Pirates of the Caribbean, or they're going to lose the audience. It was not the Johnny Depp you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant Cruz","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this movie very much, and I enjoyed Penelope Cruz even less.

The plot of this film is very disjointed and poorly written, , Jack, Angelica and other characters are always bickering, the mermaids have vampire fangs (WTF? O_O) and there are too many plot twists and turns that hinder the movie from top to bottom which makes the plot hard to care about. The plot twists and turns worked well in the first movie but they don't do well in the sequels considering how the plots of them don't turn out well. Anywho this movie would've been better if it's issues were fixed. It's not an awful film, but it certainly isn't the worst; its medicore yet enjoyable. 6.5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie, will own it after DVD release","review":"If you're a fan of Johnny Depp's zany character and enjoy the more adventurous family movies, you won't be bored with this one. We saw it in the movie theater when it came out and my 10-year-old was enthralled the entire time. I'd give this movie 3 out of 5 stars if I were rating the movie on its own merits.However, I'm deducting a star for this release itself on principle. I own a Blu-Ray player and a DVD player, but the studio's attempt to force people to purchase Blu-Ray or wait another month for the DVD is brazenly obnoxious.

We paid less than $14 for it to be shipped to our house and it would have cost us more than that to go to the movies for two adults!And seriously, it's a good one - worthy of paying the extra for the difference between DVD and Blue Ray, though this comes with DVD just in case.

As far as I'm concerened it's been downhill ever since. And this last installment didn't reverse the trend. Characters in search of a story is my view. Thought the first 20 minutes or so were very entertaining and thought they might actually been on to something. but alas after the exciting and funny coach escape, it was all downhill from there. And does this group ever do anything in the daylight? One dark and dingy scene after another. Why bother with exotic locations when you never get to see any of them.

This film however focuses more on Captain Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) and has two new main characters - Blackbeard and his daughter.This film seemed to move much faster than the previous three and was much funnier.

The 4th movie however is just a mess of running around, rampage, things falling, out of place \\"humor\\", etc etc etc. There were a ton of characters and \\"sides\\" that participated in this so called \\"adventure\\" yet essentially resulted in nothing.

Waited long enough didn't I?!?!?If you are a fan of the Pirates series of movies, let's just say, this one doesn't disappoint at all.Johnny Depp is again at the helm as Captain Jack Sparrow. No one could EVER do this part better than Johnny Depp. Believe me when I say, after 4 movies, he doesn't miss a step as Captain Jack and it's all just as fresh as movie one.The addition of Blackbeard and his daughter are very well written and casted. I didn't even miss Keira Knightly as Elizabeth and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner... in fact, I found it rather refreshing that they were NOT in this movie at all.Like I said, if you are a fan of the first 3, On Stranger Tides delivers and holds true to the spirit of Pirates of the Caribbean. It's a must see... Savvy?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie. Not best in series by long shot.","review":"While the video is Disney's typical excellent output on BD, technically speaking, the movie itself is worth a buy for series completionists and shows that Jack doesn't need the 2 lovebirds.

No hats, no makeup and there was no \\"there\\" there.There was no \\"there\\" there in the actress who played the captured mermaid, no there there with the wishy-washy actor who replaced Orlando. Zimmer's magnificent score from POTC-1 just degraded all the way down to this sequel. He seems tired too.

While it has Johny Dep in it, who I love as Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie was so so.I have loved all the Pirate movies, but this one was a cash grab using the Pirate name. It was nothing like the other movies, and it lacked the gusto the others had.Sadly speaking it just did not live up to my expectations. Stranger Tides yes I would say strange, but Pirate's it was not. Lack of a good plot and just thrown together action scenes just made this movie boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"First off, I am a HUGE Pirates fan. I've seen part 3 at least 15 times (6 in the theater), so I was chomping at the bit for this one to come out! Unfortunately, this movie was barely entertaining. For one thing, why Disney chose to put Penelope Cruz in anything even remotely kid-friendly is beyond me. She has been in several soft-core porn movies and is only a half-baked actress to boot. Practically the entire movie was filmed on either an island or in England, and desperately lacked good \\"piratey\\" action. There were only a few original cast members in this movie, and Elizabeth and Will were sorely missed.This is by far the worst of the series and (I can't believe I'm saying this)I doubt I will even purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warrior forgetting to bring his spear","review":"And that spear is wma format music.

I bought it the first day.\\"Solo Star\\" boasts a lot of good track. Solange is doing her thing. She's only 15 or 16 and she wrote a lot on the album and produced a lot of the tracks.

Neither are the Austin Powers movies. Or Axe Murderer. 54 is junk. He should not be a star. Or a Megastar (which some people think he is). For example...in this film he and Liz Hurley are underground in the Nevada desert. She is wearing this silver two-piece costume. 2 minutes later she is back at the Riviera hotel in a leather costume and another 2 minutes later she's back underground in the Nevada desert.

Rather than waste 90 minutes watching the film, why not buy a poster of Elizabeth Hurley, a chest wig and a dental prosthesis, and say to yourself such phases as 'groovy baby' and 'wow' - you'll have a lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Funniest movie ever","review":"i love this movie so much. i saw it in theatres first day it came out n i was dieing laughing. it was the 2nd funniest because the spy who shagged me was definetly the funniest. but the first one was so funny i went out, bought it, and watched it at least 50 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzled","review":"How is it all the reviews on this site give this film either 1 or 5 stars (mostly 5's).

Entertaining, witty and VERY funny!","review":"If you want to see a movie that is hilariously entertaining, this is the one to see!

The movie is a great parody of many great spy movies. This will be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hillarious! Mike Myers at his best!","review":"Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is an absolutely hillarious spoof of 60's spy movies. Mike Myers is brilliant as he plays duel parts as the notorious Dr. Evil and the ever charming, swinging Austin Powers. From the opening scene set in the 60's depicting how Powers and \\"Evil\\" have been eternally linked is fantastic. The constant inside spoofing of James Bond movies and just how riduculous some of the Bond movies really were, adds to the comedy. A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it baby","review":"The more you watch this movie the more you will laugh. It is ridiculous and hilarious and I recommend it to anyone in who wants to laugh non stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent movie plus some great extras.","review":"Of course the movie itself is hilarious, but this DVD is also one of the best I own in terms of bonus materials. The deleted scenes are really funny, and this is probably the only place you'll ever get to see them. I also like the commentary track. Definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupit is the word to describe it.","review":"Austin Powers is one of those rediculous farces out there that don't make any sense. The plot is just too stupit and only 12 year old would find this funny. This movie is stupit all it is it's a wierd looking Mike Myers and some other wierd guys and some hot chicks in some really rediculous plot. That is really what this movie adds up to. If you want a good Mike Myers film check out Waynes World at least that was funny. This was a mess and stupit and once again everybody loved it Why? Because everyone else liked it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Shagedelic movie ever!","review":"I saw the first movie not to long ago then just saw the second. THERE GREAT!

Mike Myers combines pretty much all of his skits from Saturday Night Live into this delightful movie. Dr. Evil's speech about his childhood at the group session. Sometimes things are just so random in this movie that you can't help but laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"I thought this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!! When I first saw it, I laughed so much I hurt!! The toilet scene with Tom Arnold was especially funny, and I broke into tears I cried so hard.

His character is used more in the second movie, but unfortunately it isn't nearly as good as the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An original movie but lacking in many areas","review":"I am a fan of Mike Myers and I thought Wayne's World and So I Married an Axe Murderer were both great movies.

Every time you watch it, it gets better and better. Myers is great as both Powers and Dr. Evil, and does an even better job in The Spy Who Shagged Me, where he also plays a character that is described as \\"a disgruntlied Scotsman that weighs a metric ton\\". Just like the first one the sequel gets funnier each time you see it. It's about time a great movie has a great sequel.

Austin Powers contains both full and wide screen versions, some great audio commentary from Myers and director Jay Roach, deleted scenes, a music video, theatrical trailers, biographies, filmographies, a 60's spy film retrospective, and even \\"Star Highlights\\" which highlight brief video clips from some of the actors' other Time Warner movies (My favorite was a titilating scene in Dangerous Ground with Elizabeth Hurley.Although not everyone will find Mike Myers' sense of humor as funny as I, it's hard to knock a DVD with so many outstanding features.Recommended END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Where shoul I begin, I saw this movie when it came out on Cable and I was disappointed in fact I was channel surfing throughout the movie. I then thought to myself that maybe I did not give it the chance it deserved, besides it is suppose to be one of the funniest movies. I burrowed the video from a freind and watched it from beginning to end. It was torturous! towards the end I just wanted the film to end and the credits to scroll up. The only thing that was good about the movie was Myer's portrayl of dr. evil and even that cannot bring it up to 2 stars. Highly overrated and I am not going to bother with the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"groovy?","review":"The story is hell when you have to write a paper linking Austin to Bernard Marx from brave new world."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"i saw this movie when it came to video and didn't laugh once.i had to go rent it again when the 2nd one came out to see if i missed something..i didn't.this one of the most overated comides in a long time.the movie did nothing in theatres and made all it's money on video.the 2nd austin powers only lasted 4 weeks in the theatre here(i live in md)and is out of theatres alot of places(it did most of it's money in the opening week and fell)mike myers has not made a good movie yet and always has to drees up to play a charcter to get attention(look that so i married a axe murder movie-it failed cause he was just himself and waynes world-it was big)i laughed at the police acadmey movies more than i laughed at this load of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't think the film was funny.","review":"I don't know what I expected from the movie, but, I watched the entire tape only because I wanted to see exactly what caused the raves I'd heard about it.

MIKE MYERS does not deserve to be an actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you stupid, Baby?","review":"Anybody who seriously likes this movie is insane, unethical, and has no morals. The movie was only funny because of how stupid it was and the plot was absolutely horrible.

This movie's rediculous-- Don't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a offensive movie!","review":"As a girl, (duh a female) I found this movie hugely offensive. For the mental producer to portray women as sex objects, \\"shagadelic babies\\" is just downright immoral.

R1 dvd is heavily cut!!!","review":"first things first. this dvd is cut heavily! The Christian Slater \\"orange sherbert\\" scene is completely gone, and 2 scenes which were in the original, complete cut (the 'henchmans wife' and the 'bucks party' scenes) are cut and placed in the deleted scenes section!This cut of the movie is shocking, if you want to buy Austin powers on dvd, please steer clear of the R1, and buy the full version which has not been butchered. I wish someone had told me before i wasted my money on this very substandard dvd.You have been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh behave!","review":"Heh heh. How could you hate this movie? It's a classic.The story goes like this, in 1967, secret agent Austin Powers [a ladies man] sees his nemesis, Dr. Evil freeze himself and escape in a Big Boy, Austin decides to freeze himself in case Dr. Evil ever returns. Thirty years later, the Big Boy returns to Earth and Dr. Evil is revived. So the agents revive Powers, but both have one helluva time getting to adjust. That's the plot without spoilers.This movie is HALARIOUS! Filled with over-the-top sixtie's sexual humor [I want to \\"shag\\" ya baby!

You are gonna shag over this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boneheaded, but at least it has Elizabeth Hurley!","review":"I can hardly believe it, but I flushed 90 minutes of my life down the toilet watching this piece of utter trash.

Mike Myers does a groovy job as Austin Powers, and Elizabeth Hurley is awesome... as ever! The jokes may not be absolutely hilarious, but they sure are funny enough.

Tremendously funny. I've watched it again and again, and it's still as funny as ever. I have yet to see the second one, but I'm sure that it will be as good, if not, better than the first.

I laughed my butt off, as I didn't know what to expect having never seen the 1st one. When I heard that the 1st one was better than the 2nd one, I went right over to my video store to rent it and perhaps later buy it. Thank god I rented it first. I am sorry, but this movie was a major dissapointment. Had I seen this beforehand I doubt I'd have seen the 2nd one. Both do have many of the same supporting characters, but this was kinda lacking something I'm afraid. There were some decent laughs in it, but save the money it would take to rent it and go to your cinema instead and see The Spy Who Shagged Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it, love it or Hate it?","review":"What can I say... I used to watch the Three Stoges. I like Steve Martin. Umm, the first time I watched this... I was not too impressed. But, then a few days later, I was going around saying \\"Grooovy Baby\\", \\"Let's Shag on my Shag\\" and \\"Shagadelic\\". Anytime a movie leaves you with something that sticks with you like, \\"I'll be Back\\" or \\"Make my Day\\"... then there must be something that connects. I am not a young person either. Well to make this short. I will definitely watch the new \\"Spy who Shagged Me\\". Austin (Myers)is taking comedy to new, albeit shagadelic heights. Watch this one and be prepared to Shaga,Shaga, ding dong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of quotable quotes (believe me, you'll quote)","review":"If you're a highly conservative, or old fashioned, modest type, you should skip over this movie. But if you aren't, I guarentee you'll like it. I love Mike Myers, He does an awesome job in this movie and I'm really looking forward to the sequel, which, as you might know, has made more money in it's opening run then this movie made throughout the entire history of it! It goes to show that people liked this one enough to see the sequel! I guarentee laughs, even if it's just one.

(SO DOES MR.BIGGLESWORTH). BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"International man of shagging","review":"Mike Myers is rapidly becoming, if he isn't already, the heir apparent to Mel Brooks in the sense that he is a master of jokes based on bodily functions. AUSTIN POWERS--INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY has all the elements of scatalogical humor: urination, fornication, masturbation, penis enlargement (almost anything to do with the penis really), allotta fagina, femmebots with gun barrel breasts... jeez, he even has a long scene in a toilet booth (with a fun cameo by Tom Arnold). And like Brooks, Myers is a master of movie genre satire. If Brooks had taken on a 007 spoof, it would pretty close to this. And Brooks would play multiple roles as well.Still, Myers is to be congratuated for his undoubted originality. His interpretation and reinterpretation of 60s and 70s pop culture, which he also demonstrated a mastery of in WAYNE'S WORLD, is his own. Part Bond movie, part Laugh-In, part sci-fi, all hilarious, AUSTIN POWERS is one of the best comedies to have emerged in the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Transfer","review":"I LOVE this movie, but I am reviewing the DVD, not the movie. The DVD transfer for this movie is atrocious. The aspect ratio is wrong. There are grainy scenes and scenes where the film was obviously dirty. Need a new transfer from the master laser disks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor's New Clothes","review":"Unfortunately, I did not see this until after two years of hype had gone on. Predictably, it did not live up to that hype. I like Mike Myers, and Austin is a great character for him, but the movie simply did not exploit either his talent or the Austin character.It had funny moments, but too few to hold the movie together. Hope they get better writers for future episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's groovy,baby!","review":"It's the best movie I've seen my whole life! It's very,very funny! Great costumes and music! Great for the whole family! Super makeup! Slap-stick comedy! What else could you for in a movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough material for a 15 minute SNL","review":"A parody on James Bond films. Probably the best moments were Mimi Rodgers in tight outfits, and the pre-frozen Austin in the '60s; complete with cool period music, cars etc.There were some genuinely funny bits, but the comedic timing was too looong, and there was just lots of \\"dumb\\" stuff in between those funny moments. Could be I just don't get it...but I think I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think we got Shagged.... Bay-bee.","review":"Egads. No more Austin for me. Take a trip down trival lane with this movie.. Its supposed to be a spy spoof, I know, but man, its just not very funny. Its tasteless. It doesn't remotely connect to any senses, it has no humor, acting, spoofing, action, etc. .... nada, zilch, zero... Can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Tasteless and Juvenile","review":"I can understand this movie appealing to a 14 year old - that's about the level of immature \\"humor\\" that Austin Powers delivers. What I cannot understand is how seemingly intelligent and mature adults have become so enthusiastic about this tasteless exercise in sophomoric self-indulgence. It's a pity that the remake of The Avengers was such a failure; the original series succeeded at spoofing the James Bond genre with intelligence and wit. Austin Powers has neither.More the pity, the DVD edition is well packaged with lots of extras. What's not surprising is that the two alternative endings are no funnier or well written than the final version.With a sequel on its way to the theaters, keep the following in mind: Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother seeing this one","review":"A can't believe so many people actually liked this movie. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I really like Mike Myers, from his Saturday Night Live days and his other movies, but this one is the worst. They are actually making a sequel to this movie but that is one I won't bother seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Austin Powers Trilogy","review":"\\"Austin Powers\\" is a marvelous send-up of the James Bond films of the 1960s and also pays tribute to all the trends of the era; for example, my favorite throw-away joke is seeing Andy Warhol, at the film's opening, contemplating a can of tomato soup.The humor centers around a time-lost swinger, attempting to adapt to a modern world in which the Russians are allies, nobody gives in to free love, and a higher degree of self-control and responsiblity is emphasized in society.The Dr. Evil segments are some of the funniest parts of the movie; I think the funniest scene is where Scott and Dr. Evil argue over the merits of allowing evil bass to eat Austin Powers, as oppossed to simply shooting him.I took off a star for scene where Austin Powers drowns a henchman in a toilet; I personnaly felt that the scene was thrown in for cheap laughs.The other two Austin Powers films are funny, but just can't compare to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Horrible DVD","review":"Ok, we all know that this a fantastic movie, I won't deny that. But I have to say that this is one of the lowest quality DVDs I've seen yet. Terrible transfer, and the compression rate is so high that the entire image is crawling with digital distortion. If I went over your head, trust me one this one, I work with digital video all the time.If your picky about the quality of your DVDs, pass on this one. Wait for a newer version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude, disgusting, gross, ugly main character...","review":"I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was DISGUSTING.

Try 5th grader","review":"The only enjoyable seen was the opening seen a kind of large Bollywood dance scene. Th rest was utter garbage. I guess if you liked this movie maybe you should check out the Porkie's series, but then again you might have to ask your mom and dad for their video card, since I doubt any adult would want to view it again. Really, this was a baaaaad movie. The jokes weren't funny and the few gags that were not utterly stupid were repeated ad nauseum. It's not that I didn't 'get' the humor. I just don't think that juvenile bad sitcom type of humor is funny. Has America really sunk so low that this tripe is actually popular? Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Hold Your BREATH!","review":"This movie is truly sad. If anyone is stupid enough to like it, then they deserve to watch this film. Austin Powers (Myers) is a horribly portrayed man of the 60s era. I believe that he throws girls arounds like ping pong balls. If you ask me, if you think Austin Powers is funny; Go buy a 747 and paint polka dots on it. Then, say oh behave, just so you can calm down. Then go off and marry Austin Powers because you are perfect for eachother."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"What a sad comment on our culture if we find garbage like this worthwhile. This is the equivalent of body-noise humor, set at a childish level. Anyone who likes this tripe should be emabarassed at their immaturity. Garbage packaged any way is still garbage. The directors and financiers of movies like this are counting on the utter stupidity of the public to spend money on junk like this. They laugh all the way to the bank, while fools line up to throw away their hard earned money on glaring stupidity like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"This is easily the worst film of the millennium. Mike myers is even more tedious than usual as the crass british agent. This is a predictable James Bond parody and Myers seems to think that repeating the same crap jokes over and over again is funny. This film does'nt even deserve one star. And they made a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoulutely hilarious!","review":"\\"Austin Powers\\" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! My favorite scene will always be the one where Tom Arnold looks in the bathroom stall and asks Austin Powers, \\"What did you eat?!\\". Mike Myers is a comic genius! I like \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" a little more, but this was still great. Unfortunately for laserdisc, DVD, and VHS owners of \\"Austin Powers\\", you are not quite getting all of the picture. It was shot in 2.35:1, but was presented on tape in the aspect ratio of 1.90. Why this is, I do not know. The same thing happened to me when I bought a used copy of \\"The Lost Boys\\" on laserdisc. It was shot in 2.35:1, but coincidently, was also matted at 1.90. Oh, well. It doesn't take away from the hilarity factor. But when they say it's in widescreen, they should give us ALL of the widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I just NOT get it??","review":"I like Mike Myers just as much as the next person, but I personally did not think this film to be all that funny. I was probably the last person to see it, after I heard it hyped by all my friends. Some of the lines and catch-phrases were very funny, but the movie went absolutely nowhere. Myers has done better work (ie: Wayne's World!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing","review":"I thought that this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It ranks right down there with Natural Born Killers and From Dusk Till Dawn. The writing was terrible, Austin's teeth make me want to vomit and the 'hip' lingo pissed me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame camp humor","review":"If you don't really want a witty and insightful comedy -- then maybe you want the inverse, and \\"Austin Powers\\" is that! It's just lame, predictable, campy shtick. Both \\"Wayne's World\\" movies were better and that's not even saying much. Some of the gags in this film are just over-the-top and they are supposed to be, but it gets so old to the point of just annoying and entirely boring. Elizabeth Hurley is little more than a sex toy and proves that she can't act and she's not even funny. I liked Myers on Saturday Night Live, but this material leaves a lot fo be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 'The Avengers' dares compete for worst film ever","review":"Rarely have I seen talent so completely wasted. Not even Myers could pull this one off. The entire premise of the film is a single, unfunny joke. The direction was good, the acting was good, but neither could save a complete failure of an excuse for a script. I found the first 5 mins. funny, the rest was basically the first 5 mins. repeated over and over and over and over again. If you don't want to waste over an hour of your life, don't bother watching this. Its purile, pointless, brainless and uninteresting. Its not even awful enough to have any cringe entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great satire of the 60's","review":"I think you had to live in the 60's with the Avengers, Wild Wild West, The Man from UNCLE, etc. to really appreciate how gullible and innocent we were growing up.

Does that make any sense?). And the cinematography is very bad: I never seen it in Widescreen but the pan and scan version looks like a direct-to-video flick.

Yes it has it's lowpoints. \\"No Bone Movies\\" sucks merciless in comperison with songs like \\"Revelation\\", \\"Mr. Crowley\\" or \\"Goodbye to Romance\\". Also, if you want Rhandy Roads to leave it's mark on the album with an instrumental song, has it to be this short and meaningless (Dee)? On the other Hand, it has \\"Mr. Crowley\\", \\"I don't know\\" and \\"Crazy Train\\". It is rather a mixed bag than a full-time quality effort.

At least thats how I felt when I heard the first track. But then, on Crazy Train and especially Goodbye To Romance and the rest I was peaved. The horrible sound of the new bass and especially flat drumming made me sure I was ripped off royaly. Its true the two front men made an excellent debut album but the fact remains there was still that annoying disappointment in the background. I first heard side 1 on the radio and was totally awed, thats why Im buying the 1995 remaster off this site, and you should too. 1995 remaster -- worth the effort to get.

The album is brilliant. Songs such as, I Don't Know and Crazy Train are hard rocking, yet also hold very thought provoking lyrics, and Ozzy sounds incredible throughout this album. Also check out Randy Rhoads guitar playing, and especially listen to Revelation, (Mother Earth), and you'll even hear elements of classical music. This is a must have for any headbanger, as evident by the fact that four or five songs from this album are still staples in Ozzy's live show nearly twenty years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Ahhhhh, the Album that put Ozzy back in the limelight...Randy Rhodes(RIP) does some amazing riffs on this CD also..and to think he had not come into his prime as a player really boggles the mind.

So what if you owe Kerslake and Daisley royalties, that doesn't mean that it's required to re-release one of your best albums(much less ruin it along with Randy's phenominal guitar work)! Just make some more copies of the 1995 remaster, and leave it alone. It's hard to find the previous Ozzy remasters from seven years ago anyway, now I'll have an even harder time trying to find a copy with this on the shelves. This is an utterly disgusting way to try to make more cash, especially when you already have enough money to wipe yourself with. And in my opinion Ozzy really doesn't deserve all that money. He never was much of a singer, and I can bet he didn't write half of his material. The majority of the talent was in the rest of the band no matter what lineup, and this was the best lineup Ozzy had, and now, thanks to Ozzy and Sharon, this masterpiece will never be the same. Thanks a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwwwwwwwww!","review":"Spare me from this nightmare. How could Ozzy orSharon or the record company or whoever think this could possibly be a good idea? It's like finding Metallica's \\"Kill 'Em All\\" drumtracks on the \\"Reload\\" album, that wouldn't work, well, neither does this. This has to be the worst scam in the history of record making. These Ozzy albums were remastered just a few years ago, I bought them a second time then, now I gotta go out and spend my wad a third time to find this crap on 'em! What is the point here?

Ozzy let his wife f*ck over two very talented musicians out of spite and greed. Bob wrote almost all the lyrics and split the music writing with Randy and Lee. Ozzy just sang the songs. They deserve their money. Ozzy is only as good as the musicians that surround him. With the exception of Zakk, his band blows. The current rhythm section's performance is pitiful on this album. The mixing is horrible. The bass is too loud and sometimes out of tune with the backing tracks. The drums? Forget it. Lee Kerslake was da man. His performance can't be topped. I can't believe Ozzy would desecrate the precious few tracks Randy played on with this rubbish. Says alot about what he has become. A businessman."},{"rating":"1","title":"That (C-word!)","review":"I just found out about this atrocity and am pretty freakin annoyed. In his haze of an existence, the wife took over Ozzy's career and does everything she can to disgrace his good name.

No wonder her kids are messed-up spoiled jerks who'll be dead via suicide or o.d. Ozzy will probably outlast those two pathetic reject clowns.I've been listening to the 2 Randy Rhoads albums since the 80's and they are 2 of my favorite records. Rhoads was the most dynamic guitarist ever in my opinion. But the drums and bass on both albums, espcecially \\"Diary\\" are just as important and the wife of Ozzy replaced them w/ half-assed musicians trying to mimic the originals.Please do not buy this album and support this abortion!! Find the originals which are far superior and don't give this c-word any more money!! Hopefully, she will die soon. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for ruining a masterpiece Ozzy!","review":"I bought it and at first I really liked it. Then I bought an original and it blew this away. Ozzy and Sharon ruined two masterpieces. Just because you don't want to pay someone or because you don't like them doesn't mean you ruin masterpieces. While your at it, take Bill Ward and Geezer Butler off the first three Black Sabbath albums. This is like the first three Metallica albums without Cliff Burton and Lars Ulrich. This is like the first two Pantera albums without Vinnie Paul or Rex Brown. I have no respect for Ozzy anymore. Money got to his head. If he has any respect for his fans he will put out the originals again. How could you replace the original rhythm section with the loser from Faith No More and Robert Trujillo.

I'm so sick of people giving this cd two, or even one star because the bass and drums where rerecoded. This cd has the unforgetable riffs of Crazy Train, , and I Don't Know. These riffs are done by the late, the great, Randy Rhoads (who is my favorite guitarist). It has the infamous tracks, Sucide Soultion, and Mr. Crowly. Even the less known tracks, Such as Steal Away (The Night) and the very much underated song, Revelation Mother Earth. The extra track You Looking at me, Looking at you, is a great track, and worth listing to.

To re-record any part of an album is just simply not done. How can you expect to be able to put new bass and drum tracks on a cd 23 years after its release, and have it fit the way the original tracks did. I'm sure that Robert Trujillo (bass) and Mike Bordin (drums) tried to use vintage equipment to come as close as possible to the original, but that's not the point, just get the 1995 re-master that has the shrunken picture of the cover art and says Ozzy in big letters on the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"daysley, kerslake_ please come back again","review":"what tha hell is ozzy thinking?

Look for the 95' remaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"First of all, I do not have anything against Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin, but it still makes me angry that they would play a part in butchering a classic recording such as this one. No matter how well they would have played it still would have been sub par because it is not the original recording. Why do artists do this? No one liked it when Frank Zappa did this in the mid 80's, but at least the real versions were eventually rereleased. I mean as a huge Ozzy fan I can tolerate the reality show and even the Pepsi commercial, but this travesty really, even more so than the tv show and commercial, makes we wonder where Ozzy's true priorities are. It really makes me sad that a treasured album from my childhood is tainted by petty squabbles over royalties( which is apparently the reason Daisley's and Kerslakes tracks were replaced)and released in a clearly inferior form. Shame on Ozzy and all other involved in this project."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the original! I have been ripped off!","review":"Boy, I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought this. I have always wanted to hear \\"You Lookin' at Me Lookin' at You\\", so I picked this up as soon as I saw it -- only to find that, without any notice on the outside of the package, Ozzy has replaced the original bass and drum tracks with re-recordings! What a gyp! Granted, the new drumming is probably better than the original (though I haven't listened to the whole new album) -- but the vibra-slap at the beginning of the new \\"Crazy Train\\" is weak! And, you shouldn't mess with history like this! It made me mad when Frank Zappa did it (on We're Only in It For the Money), and ZZ Top (on the Six-Pack), and Tangerine Dream (on the Tangents box set and other collections), but this makes me madder than any of those. You just don't mess with \\"Crazy Train\\" -- come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS \\"REMASTERED\\" CD! BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"Remastered nothing, its been almost completely remade and is musically inferior to the original version. Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake have been screwed out of royalties, and now they've been removed from the album altogether! Sharon Osbourne is one mean-spirited, greedy, over-materialistic person and the fact that Ozzy went along with it shows how little integrity he really has. I hate to say it, but I've simply lost respect for Ozzy Osbourne. I love his music and legacy, but there are certain things that are just inexcusably wrong, this CD is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is Ozzy thinking?","review":"Blizzard of Ozz, a clasic Metal album, just got butchered. Ozzy hired a new bass player and drummer to play over top the classic tracks. The result: Randy's guitar is phenomenal, Ozzy's vocals alot clearer, but the bass and drums......What the heck is Ozzy thinking! I bought this album thinking oh cool its remastered with full size art work now, but its not. Buy the 22 bit digital remasters edition, or if your lucky, pick it up used on the old Jet records label, thats the way it should sound. This classic album has just been killed by technology.

It sounds like this ill-advised re-recording project was rushed through and no proper attention to detail was given. The bass and drums sound \\"modern\\" and the guitars and vocals sound \\"classic\\" - so the whole album is way off balance. Because the overall effect of the music have been so radically altered, even the great Randy Rhoads doesn't really sound so great anymore. The \\"magic\\" of the album is gone now. What blasphemy! Randy Rhoads must be rolling over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be illegal","review":"Do not buy this CD! It is not the original! It has been re-recorded!

If you have already read the earlier reviews then it should be clear to you Ozzy and company for some unknown reason has re-recorded over the bass and drum parts. For those of you who are new to Ozzy must be warned. I'm sure people who own the original notice right off when they pop this version of the album into their CD players that this cannot be same as the vinyl or the 1995 remaster. Don't be tricked into buying this because of the falsely stated \\"ORIGINAL Recording Remastered\\" sticker on the front...Also note that Diary of a Madman has also been recorded over. Avoid both of these albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good despite blatant profiteering","review":"Come now, fellow reviewers! Yes, this latest release smacks of corporate greed but surely we are here to review the MUSIC and not the business (non)sense of Mrs Osbourne and her accountants?

I would much rather hear Bob Daisley on Bass and Lee Kerslake on Drums,who both sounded incredible on the original.The re-master from 1995 had the original lineup and sounds awesome;So why did they do this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't express my anger","review":"One star is one two many.

This album has not only just been remastered..it's been changed. Some of the sound effects (such as the satanic little laugh on Mr. Crowley), have been completely changed, and they're absolutely terrible. Also the bass and drums were rerecorded by diff. people, making it sound completely off. The only two good things about this album are: The artwork on the cover looks better and the bonus track contained. The rest of this album is not worth your time. I don't even think people who haven't heard his older versions of these songs would like the remastered ones. I have no idea why anyone would remaster such a great, brilliant album, so poorly.

I guess Oz and co. didn't have enough respect for this album to consider it a classic (as I always have)...This is the ultimate disrespect to the original band which included bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake. This is a frigin' rock band... not some bubble-gum band where the members are interchangable like Legos. The original tracks felt great. THE ONLY, ONLY, ONLY reason they were replaced is because some \\"rocket scientist\\" thought up, \\"Well, if we're going to do a re-release with an extra track, wouldn't it be cool if we also replaced the bass and drums! Yeah! No one's done that before! It will be ground breaking!\\" And this is the result. This is how the morons in the music biz think a lot of the time.Return it, and get your money back.

Same with \\"Diary of a Madman.\\" Why? Because Daisley and Kerslake co-wrote the albums and would get royalties if they didn't.The original versions of these albums are must haves for any good rock and roll collection, classics that helped set the tone for a whole decade.

This album is the single WORST remaster ever.... Ozzy and Sharon have taken out and rerecorded the original bass and drums in the album. These new performers lack any power the orininla performers did and have shockingly inferior performances of the songs and seem to have no sense of the real song... \\"I Don't Know\\" is weak and lacks power.. \\"Crazy Train\\" is rushed... all are ruined!!!

I was a HUGE Rhoads fan, and I always dug Ozzy's voice. I was flat out disgusted when I heard this version of Crazy Train on the radio yesterday. These new guys didn't even bother to take the time to get the tone right, or try to mimic the original. Keep in mind, mimicing the original isn't always a good thing, especially when the new musicians are better, but these new guys suck. Why didn't that dishrag Ozzy didn't get Tommy Alridge or Rudy Sarzo to re-do the album?

The re-recording of the rhythm tracks and remix of this record ruins what was perfectly fine in the first place. Besides the duff modern sounding drums, which do not gell with the tracks from the original session, the guitar tones have somewhat different effects taking away from Randy Rhoads classic and unique tone. It wouldn't have been such a bad thing, if they would have had the remix/masters along with the original mix, like I have seen on some Deep Purple and Grand Funk Railroad reissues. As it is now, this is a piece of junk. Skip this one and look for the earlier masters."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!","review":"I'm sure you've heard it already.

The re-recorded bass and drums sound awful, thick, ridiculous. Blizzard and Diary of a Madman have been ruined, and all that is left of their memory is the 1995 remaster. Hope somebody gets the clue and brings it back. This is no longer music. Removing Daisley and Kerslake from the CD is an offence to the fans, the art, and the ears.

This \\"remastered album\\" not only removes the original drums and bass from the source recording, but it removes all traces of 2/3 of the creative talent that WROTE THE SONGS. Bob Daisly wrote ALL the lyrics on Blizzard of OZ and Diary of a Madman. He collaborated on all the music with the great Randy Rhodes (Lee Kerslake contributed on Diary of a Madman). Ozzy, as in his career with Black Sabbath, contributed personality and vocals AND THAT'S IT.I can just imagine Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward rolling their eyes over this travesty. If Sharon Osbourne owned the rights to the original Black Sabbath master recordings, there would be no trace of their work either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Mess With A Classic","review":"I just heard somebody else's copy of this bastardization of Ozzy's first solo album. I really thought I was going to vomit.No collection of heavy metal or hard rock is complete without Blizzard Of Ozz, and the album itself is easily worthy of five stars. This \\"remaster,\\" however, is a joke. I, for one, am not laughing (unless you call dry heaves \\"laughter\\").Listen to all the other reviewers and get a used copy of the 1995 remaster with the small album cover and the big yellow \\"OZZY\\" written down the right side.

Bass is toned differently, as it can be heard from Crazy Train. It sounds as though someone is in constipation.Ozzy sounds better here than in the 1995 remasters though.

It's a must have and this is the one you want not the newer remastered ones as they are misleading as the original bass and drum parts have been removed and replaced with inferior parts.I love all of Ozzy's stuff, but his vocal style can get on your nerves though.

It was then I realized, after looking through the liner notes that I was listening to [an imitation].

The \\"new\\" album muddles the rhythm section to the point of making such incredible tracks like Crazy Train. Mr. Crowley and Goodbye to Romance sound like a medicre cover band at the corner bar on a slow Wednesday night.New fans may never hear the real music, since the original masters have been removed from the marketplace and replaced for all the wrong reasons.

I think most of the other reviewers agree that re-recording the bass & drum parts was one big mistake! Like the original Star Wars trilogy, the original album is a classic. Why screw with it? And the packaging is very misleading because you don't know you're getting a re-recorded CD until you buy it and open it, and then it's too late. Not that the new bass & drums sound bad, but they are totally unnecessary. The bonus track however, \\"You Lookin' At Me Lookin' At you\\" is actually pretty good, but it still doesn't excuse what was done to this once-excellent album. I give the original recording about FOUR stars, but, sorry, Ozzy, this one only gets ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANK YOU GUYS....","review":"I had just bought the 2002 version.

THe two albums that touched my soul with the power of music when i was growing up , were Diary of a Madman and Blizzard. Ozzy had done it all right back then. His questionable imagery and lyrics were great. More importantly, Randy could write heart felt , well crafterd music. This \\"redone\\" album is awful. Rerecording most of the parts makes it a joke. Ozzy should have quit rocking after Ultimate Sin , in my opinion. His image, music and life as a whole make me laugh at what i once thought was something special. Listen to the originals, accept no substitutes. Sharon O is the Donald Trump of Rock N Roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"blasphemy!","review":"How can you go back and re-record the bass and drums with different musicians and butcher a classic album! The new bass and drums don't go with Rhoad's guitar work, which is an insult to his memory. Ozzy is crazy now; he won't even release \\"the ultimate Sin\\" or \\"Speak of the Devil\\" anymore, and he ruined his two best albums with the re-recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT get fooled by this!","review":"As I wrote in the Diary of a Madman review, I love Ozzy. DOAM is my favorite, but this one ( the original ) is a very close second. However, I think Ozzy literally DESTROYED two masterpieces by re-recording them. If you are familiar with Bob Daisley bass playing you know it's NOT TRUE that the bass sound was improved. Even if it was, that is not the most decent thing to do to a musician who put his heart and soul into a project. That superfine bass playing is gone forever. Watching \\"The Osbournes\\" I am almost sure that this abomination has a \\"Sharon finger\\" on it. 5 star to the original, minus 100000 to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"Straight to the point: Ozzy and Sharon are spineless cowards. Even if you assume the worst and it were true that Daisley and Kerslake were just trying to smooch unfair royalties (which I sincerely doubt), you don't defile two of metal's alltime masterpieces by re-recording them with other musicians. I can only assume that the Black Prince of Obedience and his Overlord Wench were worried about the outcome in court, and hence the \\"re-master\\" of the recordings. Buy the original recordings second hand, so they get no further royalties. Then go buy the Living Loud CD with Daisley and Kerslake playing their own Ozzy \\"covers\\" with Steve Morse on guitar so they can get some roylalties. Steve Morse is a nice guy, and I don't think he would associate himslef with a pair of smoochers, if you know what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"I'm so upset that this classic album has been monkeyed with,that I'm done with Ozzy.

He has no integrity as an artist anymore, and Randy would be very angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"History revisited at the expense of art","review":"Its an abomination to have replaced original musicians Lee Kerslake and Bob Dailey with members of Ozzy's current band. Why not rerecord Randy Rhodes guitar parts and use Ingwie Malmsteen to do the job? Or worse yet, lets get Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy's parts, hey it worked in Black Sabbath, Oz should be used to it by now. Either scenario would be as inappropriate as this Sharron Osbourne led hatchet job. To ruin an album because musicians actually wanted to get paid for their work is inexcusable. What should we expect though from the daughter of a gangster? The greed is just sickening. I will look for the '95 reissue to replace my worn out cassette copy instead of buying this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album should be called Blizzard Revisited","review":"This is not a remastered version of Blizzard of Ozz as one would think.

Just make some more copies of the 1995 remaster, and leave it alone. It's hard to find the previous Ozzy remasters from seven years ago anyway, now I'll have an even harder time trying to find a copy with this on the shelves. This is an utterly disgusting way to try to make more cash, especially when you already have enough money to wipe yourself with. And in my opinion Ozzy really doesn't deserve all that money. He never was much of a singer, and I can bet he didn't write half of his material. The majority of the talent was in the rest of the band no matter what lineup, and this was the best lineup Ozzy had, and now, thanks to Ozzy and Sharon, this masterpiece will never be the same.

This was done out of spite and is so sick as to be almost beyond belief. If these records ever meant anything to you - and if they still do - DO NOT BUY THESE REMASTERS!!!!!Look for the 1995 remasters (the little album cover with the quilt-like border).

You only need 2 of his albums. This one and Diary of A Madman. After that, it goes downhill until No More Tears. Randy Rhoads's solos are amazing. It really is very sad how he died at a young age. And there's also the great drumming and basswork. It proves that they're not there to make the guitarist show off. Ozzy's singing is not as nasal as other albums, but it is Ozzy, alright.

Even the bonus track is re-mixed with different bass and drum parts. That is so sad, that they went as far to remix the bonus track (that's like adding new sound to a demo and calling it a demo). What's the point? Why not just re-record the entire album over, but just don't mess with the original and tweak the sound a little bit to make it sound better like if were recorded a couple of years ago, insted of it sounding like 1981.I can't wait to hear how they messed up \\"TRIBUTE\\", I wonder how they will pull that off, since it's a live recording?

It's done occasionally, like a number of John Lennon albums which were originally horribly produced and muddy sounding (for example Imagine) - perhaps they needed it. This Blizzard (and Diary) reissue goes even beyond remixing to re-recording main instrument tracks. Who in their right mind thought that was acceptable to do to a perfectly fine master? Why would the record company even allow this to begin with - replace a masterpiece recording with a at least partly re-recorded album? I mean albums are historic material in themselves, to mess with them is just not right. They need to come to their senses and pull this crap off the shelves and release the proper remaster. I still have the 1995 release so I'm doing good, but this is really a shame.

From what I have seen here, some in this group (whole aristocratic families, in fact) were evil to the point of murdering those who disagreed with them. Why was this film not seen widely, and why are there are (at least on the jacket) no reviews whatsoever? Perhaps it is a shameful chapter in British history - \\"dirty laundry\\" some want buried?

Her family - who are all part of the conspiracy - try to teach her a lesson by kidnapping her nephew while she is supposed to be baby sitting and instead falls asleep.

The film, with an excellent cast of British actors (including one of the stars of the excellent TV series Downton Abbey) is about a partly true conspiracy to keep Britain out of WW2. People who know about the conspiracy are turning up dead, and only a young British actress seems to have any insight into the events. The problem for me, and I imagine for many viewers, is the murder mystery aspect of the film gives way about half into the film to a psychological / horror-type film. Not quite horror (and quite watchable), but for anyone wanting to know more about the conspiracy, the work of behind-the-scenes British fascists like Oswald Mosley, or just hoping for an old-style murder mystery will be very disappointed. This film could have been much better; the writers just seemed to run out of dialog and ideas.

Like LL Cool J before him, this guy lays down phat, irony-free lyrics, loaded with a poppish sound and a power to move mountains!! In fact, when I first heard the huge summer hit, \\"Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)\\", not only was I noddin' my head, but I also couldn't wait to see the hit summer blockbuster, \\"Men In Black II\\"!Alls I can say is, check this album out. It's full of positive energy, summer fun, and it gives you an inside glimpse of MIB II, possibly one of the best movies ever released!!The earlier reviewer who suggested this might be the \\"Best Rap Album of 2002\\" wasn't going far enough.

Will tries to totally change his style, which is not necessary because he was really good before. There are none of the funky beats will's known for, and the lyrics arent any good either. the cd's really boring too, because it has the same sound all the way through.

All praise to Smith as a talented actor (an Oscar-nominated one, at that), but his rapping is cheesy even by preteen standards. Granted, he had a couple of singles that are wickedly catchy as they are guilty pleasures (\\"Gettin' Jiggy With It\\" and \\"Miami\\"), but on his latest album, we find Smith struggling to stay relevant in a climate that favors the flashiness of P. Diddy, the thuggishness of DMX, and the unchecked vulgarity of Eminem. \\"Born to Reign\\" has tracks that suffer from tired samples, dated production, and Smith's goofy delivery. With a bankable movie career, a strikingly pretty wife, and good reviews for his acting, Smith does have plenty going for him. But he needs to stay away from the studio. \\"Born to Reign\\" isn't a compete fiasco, but it comes dangerously close."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 pens in 1","review":"This is a great addition or stand alone pen.

That is not what happens in the Princeton Review US History book.The Princeton book goes into lengthy reviews of each time period of US History, helping those of us who learn through understanding not only a specific event, but the whole time period around that event.

DVD's look amazing, especially in 16:9 widescreen mode. It is highly adjustable and an excellent space saver. Compare it to smaller 15\\" LCDs by some of the BIGS and you will notice that they are all in the $700-$1200 range.

I rented it and cannot see myself watching it over and over, but would recommend it to anyone who needs a pick-me-up or something to watch with the kids.

After reading these novels I feel like I know the man a little more. His movie death at the end of the novel, during the Generations film brings to a close pretty well my following of the Star Trek franchise. The new cast just does not have the interesting personalities like Shatner and Nimoy. I will miss this cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid, funny and very honest book about life on Star Trek.","review":"Having recently watched all seven of the Star Trek movies which still feature the original cast (all over again), I was very grateful for this very candid and thoroughly entertaining book about their making. It is full of great anecdotes and one or two stories which made me laugh so hard, I had a hard time trying to breathe. A great sequel to Star Trek Memories and an absolute must for all fans of the original series and the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional and true. One mans exciting journey through life.","review":"Where do I begin? Before reading this book I merely thought of Shatner as an arrogant, ungrateful upstart who did not appreciate the full impact of his wonderful role on Star Trek. After reading this book I have come to realise that Shatner is Kirk, just as all the other characters on the Enterprise are exaggerated reflections of the actors which played them.One thing that always baffled me was how Shatner could so easily give up the greatest, most popular and televised role in history, spanning over thirty years. This book explains his struggle to control the character and at the same time his sense of loss at finally killing him off.Perhaps it was Shatner himself that made Star Trek what it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"very insightful and enjoyable.","review":"simple and salient review. just saying.a great book with lots of first hand knowledge about the making of the movies and the studio politics that is involved. a lot of this stuff you may have heard a bit hear or a story there on commentaries or in interviews, but in this book you get a full view of them from several POVs. very entertaining and insightful and highly recommend to both the hard core fan and novice alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda stood in th' can","review":"Well, I LOVE this band, have since I caught the \\"Last Train to Hicksville\\" in '73, BUT............ this is the music to a movie which never got made and although I doubt it was the soundtrack that killed the project it couldn't have helped. I was eagerly anticipating something as compelling as the other fine work with which I was familiar, BUT..... this aint it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"One can be a passionate fan of Dan and still not embrace this particular work. On this one, the upbeat, carefree style which is so effectively conveyed in songs like Cowboy's Dream No. 19 and You Got To Believe sounds forced. The songs about Boogaloo Jones and Vinnie might fit the corresponding characters in Bakshi's cartoon, but that's not good. True to the Bakshi method, the portrayals are just blah stereotypes of street-wise hipsters. That is a major disappointment given how Hicks is otherwise so consistent in bringing his uniquely skewed sensibility to everything he touches. And last of all, the customary ensemble precision ain't there. The music sounds under-rehearsed. Mary Ann is flat on practically everything she sings. If you are a completest who must have every recording from this edition of the band, you'll of course want IHON. All others should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"wolf as woman","review":"This was a very enjoyable read.

This one on the other hand...was disappointing. I usually enjoy long books but this one was stretched too thin. The plot was never ending. I found myself skipping to parts about Firekeeper, (the book is about her right), but she wasn't the main focus very often. Also she doesn't seem to be getting anywhere with language or knowledge. In all the book was never ending and I only finished in case something important happened in the end, which it didn't. I thought the next one in the series would be better but there doesn't seem much hope for that.

The performances were recorded under Phil Spector's supervision but, apparently, were not intended for commercial release.Then, in 1986, Yoko Ono prepares this now historically important gigs for official release. Somehow she finds out maybe it would be a fancy idea to give this recordings a contemporary 80's look, so she adds \\"modern\\" production touches, mainly in the sound of the snare drum, making it sound like coming from Brothers in Arms!!!!!!!! Besides, the sound is very flat, like many albums RECORDED in the 80's.This is an atrocity! We can hear some of this recordings in their original form on Lennon's Anthology Box Set, and they sound pretty fine. What the hell were this people thinking? Hey, it is John Lennon!!!!!!! Let's show some respect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard","review":"It's hard to put John down, but this cd has some serious... issues. Where to start...Firstly, Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band is comprised of a group of guys who,... They aren't well rehearsed, they aren't good playing together. The sax is all over the place! Every time he plays its just a mess! No subtlety...John is busy screaming. He hardly sings. Its a shame, because he had such a haunting voice. Instead he's just...uck.But on the plus side, Well Well Well is pretty good, and Yoko doesnt do much. Instant Karma is such a tight song, but the drums are all over the place. Those drum breaks are just emberrasing ...John tries to be funny, but it doesnt work.John just wasn't a live artist. In the Beatles and on his own, he didnt seem to like playing live. He was a studio man. He was fantastic in the studio, he wasn't on stage.And Come Together just didnt sound right. None of the songs really sound right. He just can't seem to get into it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Lennon around","review":"I read somewhere that at some point, John had thought of asking Paul to appear on stage with him, since John was so nervous about this performance. Unfortunately, it shows. It reminds of Chuck Berry, how he hires any local band that knows a 12 bar progression and shows up on stage and starts playing. The band here sounds under rehearsed, and the CD sound quality is murky to say the least. The only thing that saves the show occasionally is John voice, but for the most part he is just not into it. 'Hound dog' and 'give peace a chance' are just exercises of self-indulgence that do not desearve a second listen. Also, after listening to some tracks of the other show Lennon performed at the Madison Square Garden, looks like Yoko chose the wrong show to release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I thought Lennon was supposed to be a genius. If he was, it really doesn't show in this performance. First, the CD is way too short -- is 11 songs the best they could do? Second, he doesn't sing any of the songs, the entire time John screams the lyrics. Atleast Elvis was kind enough to sing 'Hound Dog.' It almost gives me a headache to listen to him screaming out all these songs. As a matter of fact, the only song he doesn't scream on is 'Imagine.' The third problem is the last song, 'Give Peace A Chance,' is SHORTENED! The full song is 5 minutes, but on this album it fades out after 41 seconds. For shame. Thankfully, however, the complete song is available on the Imagine soundtrack. Otherwise I wouldn't know what to do. All in all, save your money and get the John Lennon Anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take this book to the South of France!","review":"Even with a 2003 publication date, this book was our primary resource while traveling with the kids in Provence in July 2005.

I used this book in a history class of Russia and thought this book very interesting. I have just reread it, and it is still a classic book about the last hundred years history of Russia. Treadgold follows standard thought about most interpretations of Russian history.Even though I thought this book was great, the single chapters about Breshnev, Gorbachev, and Yeltsin do not do justice to these large spans of time for the country. I thought he could have put a few more chapters on these immensely important time periods. Lenin, Stalin, and Nicholas II are dealt in depth in the writing.The print is small and there are no pictures, just maps and writing. At over 400 pages, this is not for those who want a summary history of this nation.

I remember when if you liked Ozzy people would look at you disgusted and weird, but ever since MTV got hold of him, all of the sudden it's cool to be an Ozzy fan.

To start off with the positive things first, the performance is really good. Ozzy can still put on a great performance...but that's where it ends. Ozzy has a habit of playing the same songs from Blizzard of Ozz and the same few songs from No More Tears with Paranoid, Bark at the Moon, and usually 1 song from Diary of a Madman. For a man who has as many great albums and songs as Ozzy, I don't see why he doesn't want to play any of them. Diary of a Madman, Bark at the Moon, and The Ultimate Sin(to which isn't represented at all here) are some of his best work.

Got the clean version for 5 bucks at Wal Mart the other night. The language is edited in a less annoying fashion than many edited cds. The setlist relies heavily on the Blizzard of Ozz, No More Tears, and Down to Earth albums, with a few about three songs that aren't from those three albums. Believer from Diary of a Madman, Bark at the Moon from the album of the same name, and Paranoid from Ozzy's Black Sabbath days round out the set. Many people think this set came out to cash in on the success of the Osbournes tv series. Maybe it did, but Live at Budokan is a fine live album, with Ozzy's vocals being pretty good. Only real gripe is too many songs from Blizzard, No More Tears, & Down to Earth dominating the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Ozzy Osbourne? What's going on??","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of MTV's hit show \\"The Osbournes,\\" which I believe will go down in television lore as one of the greatest reality shows ever to grace the tube. Well, imagine my shock when I listened to this hard-rockin' disc, expecting some gentle acoustic ballads, and instead found lovable old Ozzy to be anything but lovable. In fact, there's nothing even remotely acoustic or gentle on this album. And sure Ozzy cuzzes a lot, BUT I DIDN'T THINK HE'D CUZZ IN FRONT OF A LARGE ARENA AUDIENCE IN JAPAN!!!! I don't know, I was just a little disappointed in these songs. Maybe it's time for pudgy little Jack Osbourne to carry the Osbourne family torch. I BET HE WOULD BE A LITTLE ROCKER!!

The addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have. I studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow. While I agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first, I after a month I can claim some serious progress! My only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key. All in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"I have been writing Japanese for years, and I started with the author's \\"Let's Learn Hiragana\\" and \\"Let's Learn Katakana.\\" I loved both books, especially the Hiragana. I learned Kanji from various sources, spent hundreds of dollars on books (literally), yet none of them were as beautifully written as this one. If you want to learn the characters in depth, and want to really enjoy writing them (yes, it is artistic and even fun to do) and not just be flabbergasted and frustrated, this is the book to start with (or even switch over to). I might get this book just to improve my handwriting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its very good, but something is wrong.","review":"I truly love this authors work, but my biggest problem is that they use romanji.

'Like a Rock' is easily the best song on the album, with its great lyrics, and Segers great vocal delivery, and that guitar solo oh, that guitar solo is one of the top five slide solos ever recorded! Other stand out tracks are 'Miami', and 'American Storms' both of which are Seger classics. The silver bullet band sounds great here, and Bobs vocal delivers once again sounds great on everytrack here.

But there are serious issues with the FNX-9 for which it is also marketed.The FNX-9 frame extends beyond the bottom of the holster and with it the last two \\"teeth\\" of the accessory rail. If you apply any torque on the draw, a rail tooth will catch on the bottom of the holster. As a result either 1) the gun does not draw or 2) the gun is drawn with the holster still attached.If the \\"sheath\\" into which the frame fit was a bit longer, this holster would be a much better fit for the FNX-9. As is, the product is difficult to recommend for FNX owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit for FNH FNX-9","review":"The FOBUS web wite recommends this model for the FNX pistols. All I had to do was back out the tension screw on the holster a couple of turns, and the FNX fit in there perfectly. You can adjust the tension screw to suit your desired draw weight. Just pull upwards on the pistol's grip and the FNX comes right out. Since your thumb is right there too, you can also push down on the top of the holster to help drawing it. Excellent holster that is comfortable to wear daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Paddle Holster For PX4","review":"The Holster took a month to be delivered from Israel but was worth the wait.

At minimum, even these would have been enhanced if there had been a thumbnail of the map beside each caption which showed where these shots were taken.

If I had to rank those 5,The intro really wouldnt count so that would be the 5th but it would go in this order: Heat It Up, I Do, Fly With Me, If She Only Knew, and the Intro. The other song I really liked on there was Do You Wanna Dance. Of course there are also the 2 singles which have been overplayed on the airwaves: Because of You and The Hardest Thing. I personally like Because of You more than The Hardest Thing. Heat It Up, Fly With Me, and Do You Wanna Dance have great beats to them and are \\"dance\\" songs. They just make you wanna dance.

Maybe your next album will be better than this, I hope!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talentless","review":"Granted, they can sing, but 98 degrees just isn't original. I am not keen on the whole boy band thing, but at least the B Boys are pioneers, and the \\"Everybody\\" song is catchy. 98 doesn't write their own music or lyrics, and in my opinion, the only reason that they are doing this is for money. REAL talents take several years to be discovered, and they work HARD for their fame. Groups like BB, 98 Degrees, and N'Sync just aren't worthy of the praise they are recieving."},{"rating":"2","title":"They have the best, clear voices in the world!","review":"98 degrees is the best cd I eva received.

Whenever I'm feeling down, I listen to it and feel much better because I can relate to each of the songs in some way. It was also interesting for me to learn that these guys actually wrote most of their own songs - I admire that. Another plus is that I was lucky enough to see them in the Macy's parade and they actually noticed their fans and made the effort to wave (unlike a certain other group of singers I was fond of) which shows that they are genuine people.

Uh, can't exactly say they're in the same league as genuine R&B acts. But, definitely more talented than cutie boybanz. As 'true 2 ur heart' shows, these dudes r capable of more than radio-friendly ballads. 98 reminds me of .. Colour Me Badd ?? Hmmm, as pointed out by someone, their style tends 2b formulaic. Guess they're playing it safe. I wldn't suggest they diversify too much either, this may turn off a mainstream audience. Perhaps 98 cld consider tackling a jazz or soul standard or incorporate elements of such in their next album. Meanwhile, folks enjoy this one. Yeah, it's worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!

It's like they live on a different planet where everything is trite and inane!! But one particular \\"review\\" is worthy of a special mention -- the one from a Connecticut girl on February 6. I mean, is that not one of the funniest (unintentionally, I'm sure) things ever? Somebody should save it and show it her, say, ten years from now. If she is matured by that time, I'm sure she'd be stunned how much air she had in her brains. I mean freaking out over Boy Bands is silly enough, but to author a gem like this?! Truly priceless!!

The \\"Intro\\" is a little corny, but \\"Heat It Up\\" changes the pace from that. You can totally feel the emotionaly distress in \\"I Do (Cherish You) and it intensifies w/ Nick Lachey's vocals. He and Jeff Timmons do an excellent job on the album showcasing their skills. Even \\"Fly with Me\\" isn't bad after the first seconds with its airy sound. The CD ends w/ acapplea \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" which is perfectly done. This album shows why they got a record deal in the first place and why millons of people go crazy for them (including myself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too hot for words","review":"Where do I start?

The fourth track, \\"I Do\\" is an excellent love song and ideal for a wedding. \\"Because of You\\" and \\"The Hardest Thing\\" are songs that you can never get tired of, and always turn up the radio for, and \\"True to Your Heart\\" is a good advice song for anyone!

This is basically due to the fact that this is not music, it is record executive product designed to prey upon the mindless public's addiction to unabridged cheezy music.

It ain't - nothing covered is particularly advanced - perhaps 'intermediate C/UNIX' would be an appropriate title (but that has less appeal, right?). It does cover a wideish range of topics, but in very little depth (we're talking small puddle - hot day) 100 pages. I doubt Alan's Ph.D. is in computer science, gardening more likely.

The keyboard and sax solos after Drew Abbott's incredible solo have been lost alongside the 'shake, baby shake' audience chanting as well.This annoying thing aside, the cd rocks all the way through, despite the fact it has not been remastered and this is something we'd all have acknowledged, no matter the vinyl sounded awesome.4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola Slim Battery is useless!","review":"Motorola Slim Battery is useless!

A bunch of really good songs with not much in the way of \\"filler\\".Tracks 1,2,3,4,8,9 & 11 are the popular classics you'll know from the radio. (Tracks 6,12 & 13 aren't that popular, but they grow on you). So you get $7 worth of essential tracks for the current Amazon price of $8. Not bad. (You can get each of these songs individually from iTunes and save yourself $1). Two other good songs from Steve Miller, that fall outside the 1974-1978 range, are \\"Abracadabra\\" and \\"Living in the USA\\". Don't go and pay $14 for the \\"Young Hearts\\" greatest hits CD just to get these two additional songs.

It's true that there are seven U.S. top 30 hits here, but the remaining cuts never even charted. While these non-charting tracks may be well-known to the Miller devotee, they are curiosities to the casual fan (including myself), who would probably want a definitve, single-disc collection that encompasses all of Miller's big hits from the pop and album rock charts. And most diehard fans already have the albums from which the cuts on this CD are taken. Also, if you want full album versions of your favorite Miller songs, you may not find them all here, as some have been edited.

Yeah, we all know the Four Seasons but Vivaldi was MUCH MUCH more than four concerti out of a set of twelve. If you are curious about other Vivaldi works, love opera or vocal music or just want to give it a try...you won't be disappointed. The playing is on period instruments (which I love), the vocalists have a lovely clarity, there are some arias that if they don't bring tears to your eyes, you will certainly come close. They are such that let you know that Vivaldi really was close to God and She gave him a gift to share with the world more than 200 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!!","review":"A Vivaldi opera may lack the psychological depth of a Handel work in similar vein, but does it matter, not one bit when the singing is this gloriuos with pulse quickening coloratura and the sheer inventivness the of each aria.

Let's hope the Vivaldi Edition continues to unveil such wonders!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice watch","review":"Seiko makes good watches, and this one is no exception. It's design is classic, non-fussy and handsome. The two-tone watch will work well with any other jewelry and keeps great time. I found the fact that the date window shows both day and date to be a nice touch, as opposed to simply displaying the date alone. The watch is easy to read and to operate. Two things that a prospective purchaser might want to know are that the face of the watch is not white, but rather a pale steel gray, and that the band is a standard length for a man's watch (as mentoned in the description), so those with larger wrists might have to purchase a replacement band. Still, this is a good watch at a good price and well worth investing in a replacement band, if that should be the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch, but strap has reddish tint","review":"I bought this watch when I was in the market for something with a brown leather strap. When the watch arrived, I was surprised to see that the strap had more of a reddish tint to it.

If and Fat Old Sun are good too. They're kind of soft and wimpy sounding but It's a different side of Floyd. Yeah...and the breakfast that psychadelic and belongs to Alan is okay.

Except it's far more orchestrated as opposed to more keyboard. The song overall is excellent. Then there is songs that the band members wrote for the middle. If, which is Waters second song discussing insanity, which became his thing to write about later on. Fat Old Sun an excellent song by Gilmour with what I would consider his first real guitar solo at the end. Then the implant of human sounds in Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast. The final bridge to cross into their work that marked Floyd as Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for Collectors Only","review":"There are those on this thread who find this album musically compelling, but this long-time Floydian isn't one of them. No disrespect intended. That being said, the 2011 remaster provides a richer and fuller sound that is well worth the purchase price... IF you liked this album in the first place. However, if you are unfamiliar with the material on this album, I highly recommend you spend a little time on the web, listen to each track all the way thru and know what you're buying before you plunk down your hard-earned cash. IMHO, this is the single weakest entry in the Floyd catalog. Two stars because Fat Old Sun is a cool tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm.","review":"whilst not a great album when compared to what came after, Atom Heart Mother is a humouress album evoking a somewhat folky feel, where even the brass band feels welcome. It doesn't stand up to repeated listens, as it is perhaps a novely album, though Rick Wright's Summer '68 is the highlight here, and feels more like the Floyd we know. Fat Old Sun is another number which is pleasant, though hardly earth moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Rubbish\\"","review":"Even Roger Waters himself suggested this to the worst Floyd album by calling it \\"rubbish\\". The only redeeming factors are the Atom Heart Mother Suit was some solid points and the song \\"If\\" which gives hints of Waters' future song writing potential. Who idea has it to put a microphone to somebody's face while chewing and dub it on the last track? It is terrible! Please don't base your judgements of Floyd on this rubbish! This was an experiment that failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save this one for last","review":"I've been a Pink Floyd fan for many years - and for a while I was pretty much a fanatic. But there is one album I was never able to get into. And believe me I tried. I wanted to like it -I played it many times, hoping it would somehow click, but it just didn't.Yes - it is an important album in the history of Pink Floyd. Without Atom Heart Mother, there would probably be no Dark Side of the Moon. It kindof marks the signpost where the early Floyd turned into the fully realized Floyd. If you need to complete your Pink Floyd collection, by all means, get it.However, if you are new to Pink Floyd, or looking to expand beyond Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, don't look here. You will be disappointed.With that said, it does have one of my all-time favorite album covers (for whatever that's worth)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's Finest","review":"Back in the good old Napster days, there were always a couple of live versions of the Atom Heart Mother Suite available which are also excellent.

It was the best album they did since \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and remains in my humble opinion, one of their best albums period Why I think this album is so great is that it has a bit of everything. From the epic instrumental \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"( featuring French horns, chilling choir voices, keyboards and sound effects) to the acoustic-folk \\"If\\" to the piano-driven \\"Summer 68'\\"(still one of my favorite Floyd songs) and the subtly spectacular \\"Fat Old Sun.\\" \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" remains one of my favorite Pink Floyd instrumental songs. I feel \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" aside from being so great, was an important album because it hinted the things that were to come of Floyd and distinguished them as a very serious band in music and that they could make it without Syd Barret."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply mind blowing","review":"this is possibly one of Pink Floyd's greatest efforts. Great lyrics, great music, what else do you need?

But the 25 minute set of atom heart mother is worth the cash alone. but there are some really buetifull songs on this record to. besides the title track fat old sun and summer of 68 are my favs on the record. If is ok, but doesnt reaslly stand out.

I thought it would be some insane album like Ummagumma's studio album. I put the CD in the car and me and my mom listened to the first tune, Atom Heart Mother. I thought it was pretty cool they were blending in with an orchestra. My mom thought it was really weird and we changed it to the next song. The other songs are great. I went back and listened to the first song all through and I thought it represented Gilmour and Wright at their creative best. If you are just starting to get into Pink Floyd, wait until you get deeper into their music until you purchase this one. I got it after i had purchased stuff besides Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. This is an album that takes some getting used to, but i thought it rocked! Ummagumma is one of those Pink Floyd albums that sounds messed if you thats the first floyd Cd you get, but if you appreciate the fact that they were experimenting, you would like it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it straight","review":"floyd fans get really freaky about the group, rather like the beatles thing. personally i go for the early stuff. \\"atom heart mother\\" is simply killer diller. yes the suite is symphonic, but what is not much mentioned is gilmours tasty, tasty guitar in the middle of it. the whole album is journeyman work. after \\"atom heart mother\\" and \\"umma gumma\\" floyd turned into just another pop band."},{"rating":"2","title":"atom heart mother","review":"Atom Heart Mother brings a lot to the table. First of all it displays the awesome talent of all 4 bandmembers (something lacking in previous albums save Meddle). Second it shows how they can preform instrumental music as well as varying styles of lyrical music. It takes you from the mellow, smooth-sounding Fat Old Sun to the rough edged Summer 68. And the instrumental music sounds as if you were on an acid trip with the mood varying varieties of the atom heart mother suite.

This album usually falls through the cracks when Pink Floyd's massive canon of work is reviewed. Too bad, because this album is truly groundbreaking.Listen to such magic as Summer of 68, which uses some nice horn work. The title track is a sprawling opus mixing classical, rock and funk with great effect. My all-time favorite is Fat Old Sun, which just might be the best PF song ever. The guitar track in this song is quite simply mindblowing. Even better then Comfortably Numb, in my opinion. The album is rounded out by the acoustic beauty of If and the fun Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, which has great percussion work by Nick Mason.Any serious Floyd aficianado already has this album, but budding fans need to pick it up.

Meddle is at least interesting. AHM is just awful, disorganized and aimless. The songs are totally forgettable. The side-long title track was orchestrated and constructed by Ron Geesin, so think again before you go pronouncing Atom Heart Mother the ultimate Pink Floyd album. It's a good thing an LP side only holds 20-30 minutes of music; who knows how much longer \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" (the suite) would have been if made in the digital/CD era.

It paved the way for all their later works. If you are a new Floyd fan, get Wish You Were Here. If you are now getting more Floyd stuff, get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"No doubt, Pink Floyd is/was one of the greatest rock bands, but the stuff they made before 'Dark Side..' is either extremely strange of just plain boring. 'Atom Heart Mother' is just plain boring. The title track grows on you after repeated listenings; it contains something new each time that you hadn't heard before, but the rest of the album is bad. The songs have no light or heart. I like the cover. Its kind of funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"If....","review":"The title track is strange and wonderful--like a dream where reality seems slightly out of joint. \\"Fat Old Sun\\" and \\"Summer of '68\\" are both strong songs which hint at Floyd's later work. \\"Fat Old Sun\\" follows the same formula as \\"Comfortably Numb\\": a nice chord sequence, a refrain which is longer than the verse, and a powerful guitar solo at the end. \\"Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast\\" is odd and rambling, but fun to listen to.

It is badly cut (i.e. sections of the original movie are missing), very low quality video, and the picture only takes up about 50% of the screen window (which is probably good, blown up to full screen it would probably be un-watchable). The \\"product details\\" on the website are misleading in that it infers that you are getting a DVD disk.

In fact, I believe most of the people who own this album played \\"L'anno che verra\\" to mark the millenium. This album starts with the powerful \\"L'ultima luna\\", an irreverent, yet personal allegory on biblical creation. This album is a very nocturnal piece with the recurring themes of the moon and nightfall in most of the selections. As in many of Dalla's early albums, there is a song dedicated to one of Italy's premier cities, this time Milano. Dalla is certainly at his lyrical best in this album. The lyrics of \\"Anna e Marco\\" provide a simple antidote to the themes of youth dienfranchisement with the last line which states \\"Anna vorrebbe voluto moriri, Marco vorrebbe andarsene lontano, qualcuno gli la visto tornare, tenendosi per mano.\\" This album made me a Dalla fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"Why did a European metal label sign an American emo band?

It's sickening and pathetic and I hate it. The singer sucks too, he has no sense of melody and does all these long sustained notes that just sound like poop.

As Myron learns about right and wrong, rarely is the delineation between the good guys and bad guys without a little fuzziness. They're all people doing the best they can given their particular circumstances. In the end, even Myron himself wonders if he's no longer one of the 'good guys.'So why only 4.5 stars? The ending was a let-down. Also, there are references to past events that don't make much sense. Certainly, I don't expect the whole story. But often, just one more sentence would've satisfied me.

Mr. Coben jumps from one character's point of view to another, then to omniscient point of view, then to authorial p.o.v. The thing that decided me not to finish the book, however, was when he switched point of view within a sentence.I was sad not to finish the book because I think Mr. Coben has a fine feel for keeping tension alive, but I was just to distracted by the p.o.v. issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"My new favorite author.

But Britney did such a terrible job singing in this that I almost can't bear to listen to it. It has a lot of good harmonies, but Britney's voice is so inconsistent throughout the entire song. There are times where her voice is very thin, then there are times where she makes her voice too full. This song is a nice change from Britney's fast-paced songs, but the lyrics are still a little on the bubblegum side. This ballad just can't compare to that of other artists such as Jessica Simpson (\\"I Wanna Love You Forever\\") and Christina Aguilera (\\"I Turn To You\\").

Her first single was ...Baby One More Time. From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart is a beautiful ballad and I really think you should buy the CD. If you're an American fan then another good reason to buy this CD is because it's enhanced and has a clip of the Born To Make You Happy video which is Britney's 4th single in Europe and if you live in Europe you get to see a clip of From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart, so it works out both ways. This CD also includes a remix of (You Drive Me) Crazy.

Let me warn you: DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID! The lead track is absolutely TERRIBLE - Britney's voice is AWFUL and the song itself is almost as bad. The remix of \\"Crazy\\" IS NOT the one that was released to radio - it is an EXTREMELY BAD version of this already mediocre song. As for the Enhanced CD part, it couldn't possibly be any more boring. The video for the lead track shows Britney looking horrible and she just sits around and sings. VERY BORING. The CD doesn't even include the WHOLE video for \\"Born To Make You Happy\\", which is a really stupid boring video anyway. Whether you want to buy this for yourself, or you're a parent and your kid is nagging you to buys this, once word of advide: DO NOT BUY THIS! It's not even worth 1 cent, let alone 3 bucks!

It's fantastic.And if you would like to read \\"a book by the Dalai Lama\\" to see what Buddhism can offer, or just to be inspired, I recomend \\"Healing Anger - The Power of Patience from a Buddhist Perspective\\" which is a transcript of oral teachings delivered by HH in Arisona for the Buddhists & non-Buddhists.Well, you can come back to \\"A Simple Path\\" when you are ready!This is truly beautiful a book.

The pans are sturdy. They get a lot of use in my kitchen, and are holding up just fine.

I'm a huge Suzanne Brockmann fan and eagerly await each new installment. I feel that I really did not get my money's worth this time. I won't reiterate what others have said except to say that I agree that the story was too long and too easy to put down. However, I would like to add one point. I was seriously aggravated by all the almost teen-talking verbal vomit. Many times when the characters were considering a point, every digressing thought in their head was written in the paragraph. Eventually, I just began skipping ahead many sentences to avoid this inner verbal vomit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max and Gina at last","review":"This long awaited book about Max Bhagat and Gina V. is a little different from SB's Navy Seal books. Well, to begin with none of them are in it, but it still is a great story with alot of her usual touches. Max is a great character and the Molly/ Jones story is cool. Gina is a little too good to be true but then again it is a romance thriller. This is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a \\"Thriller\\"?","review":"My first experience with a Brockmann book.

I won't bother with another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turncoat author !!!","review":"Brockmann has made a fortune depicting heroic navy seals and generally setting her stories amongst the selfless acts of our military. In this book she reveals her true colors by weaving baseless, politically-motivated misrepresentations of the US military---no doubt based on \\"facts\\" from left-wing news sources that are disproved by only a little research. I personally am glad she showed her true colors so Americans can vote with their wallets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Breaking Point To Madness","review":"This book is actually the 9th book in Brockmann's Trouble Shooters series. When I started reading the book I had no idea that it was #9. Needless to say it was pretty easy to follow along. However, it was drawn out and I think it could have been done better.The story starts out like the movie \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" It jumps from the present to the past to form one unique storyline. That was pretty cool but here are the flaws. The only part of this book that was decent was the characterization and the romance between Max and Gina, and even that leaves a lot to be desired, but it was the only redeeming quality of the book.For the rest of this review please follow this link:[..]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Suzanne Brockmann has weitten an interesting book. This is my first encounter with her work and I enjoyed it.

I was so disappointed. It started out very good, very well written but got more and more outlandish by the minute. I kept waiting for the other characters to come in and help save the day as usual but there was no sign of them. The complete reversal in Max's character was a little contrived and I think the worst character portrayal was that of Jules. He went from an applaudable FBI agent who just happened to be gay to a stereotypical gay man fumbling around trying to be a FBI agent; I always liked Jules and this portrayal was most disappointing. I recommend buying it used because I know Suzanne Brockmann fans will not be able to resist it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is certainly a low point for Brockmann","review":"I started reading Brockmann's books for the dialogue between the characters. However, this is one I'm glad I borrowed & didn't buy. Max & Gina have no reason to be drawn to each other and his angst over being the older man got boring a book or so ago. Jules is too sweet-sweet and \\"sensitive\\" to be human; I almost got a cavity.

I hope the next book is better because when she writes well, it's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"Great series,have been reading them in order,they are well written,and keep your interest throughout,,for me it was a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Normally I can't wait for an SB novel, and I approached this one with high hopes...but what a waste of money. The action is predictable, the \\"romance\\" is predictable, and all in all, the novel is a big disappointment.

But I can't get past the first couple minutes of listening to Patrick Lawlor---his voice is too high and over-dramatic for these alpha male stories, sort of like a teenager over-emphasizing everything.So I went back to reading instead. Another wonderful Brockmann story worth 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey love story masked as an FBI thriller","review":"Wow, this book was nothing like the back cover predicted. It certainly sounded like an FBI thriller, but it turned out to be a dopey love story instead. I'm not a big reader of the romance novel and now I know why.The main characters in this story spend more time thinking about and reflecting on their romanitic intrests than anything else. There's barely time to get the FBI action in.I would strongly recomend not to read this book unless you are looking for a sweet romantic love story between a completely pyschotic woman and a stuburn old FBI agent who really does not want to get involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Read","review":"I wish I didn't have this issue with not stopping something I have started, because I certainly would have stopped at the beginning. But, I hoped it got better. The constant joking/sarcasm was very distracting to the story. I kept waiting for the \\"ba da bum\\" drum roll after each sentence. Instead of trying to be so cute, the story should have been worked on a little more. I actually had to start skimming the ending, just to get through it. It took me over a month to read this( I usually read a book in a few short days), I had to force myself to pick it up. The ending I thought was a little rediculous. A couple about to die, playing house. The man who couldn't say two words about his feelings through the whole book, all of a sudden couldn't shut up. It was just a poor book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's fantasy, and then there's [bad].","review":"I am a big fan of erotic artwork, and I love it when the artist allows his or her imagination to go wild. Erotic comics don't have to be fully realistic, so artists can, e.g., bend the rules of gravity. But come on! Like most other guys, I like largely proportioned women, but why does Taylor feel the need to draw his women so that they look like they have had very poorly done breast implant surgery?

This is a very unfortunate packaging of spoken word, soundtrack and video of appaling shallowness that never come together like the ingredients of a badly mixed cocktail. This material should have been released only as a spoken word recording, without any soundtrack whatsoever - let alone video.

Every choice he made, every squat he stayed and not near as much about the man i recognize from nirvana. It took a few play backs because for the longest time i didnt even recognize his voice. To me it just didnt sound like him. The pictures shown in the film are random. Over an hour into it and not one picture of Kurt. After over an hour one picture of the top of Courtneys head supposebly as he says she reminded him of nancy spungen (who didnt she remind of nancy spungen).

The best part about this movie, is while Kurt tells his story, you see his hometown. I've read a review saying it could be any town. I've been there, it is where he grew up. As you see these images and hear the soundtrack of the music he listened to you get a better picture of what his life was like. It's the whole package, so to speak. I thank Michael Azerrad for making these great interviews available to his fans. It is touching and informative. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I am ever so happy that Michael Azzerad created such a masterpiece. Having been a Nirvana fan since 1990 at the fresh age of 13, and really never hearing what Kurt had to say throughout the years, unless I wished to indulge in youtube nonsense or articles. It's nice to own this visual masterpiece that really and truly, without question, brings you into his world. At least a portion of it, and in his words, his voice. It was nice to lie back and just listen. Like rock -n- roll therapy. Looking up every so often to see sweeping views of pines and cartoon imagery, all flowing with Kurt's narrative. Beautiful, a MUST for any die hard Kurt lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Let Down!","review":"I am a hardcore Nirvana and Cobain fan. This movie was such a major let down. It seems like the company that produced this just grabbed some audio clips from Cobain interviews and shot some random footage of what I guess is supposed to be his hometown, but it could be any town they are just random clips. Nothing in this film fits together. It all just seems to be thrown in there. I am still a Nirvana fan. I gave this movie 2 stars just because it was about Cobain and nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.","review":"The spoken words of Kurt Cobain would be GREAT to experience. Fortunately, this doc has them. Unfortunately, they are presented in such a farcical way as to make this film unwatchable.About A Son would have been fantastic if not for this film's absurd stylizing fantasies. Putting so much farce into the images, it forces a viewer into the mind-boggling conflict of wanting to stay, for the Cobain audio, yet repulsed by the distracting imagery competing with - no, mocking - the powerful heartfelt voice.Hopefully these interviews are available elsewhere, without the director trying to out-shine the real star. The words of Kurt Cobain are very powerful. Trying to give them even more power is just an insult, Schnack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a must read book for diabetics. I have always felt that a low carb diet works best for diabetics. Dr. Bernstein also recommends exercise. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't feed my family this","review":"I agree with Dr. Bernstein's philosophy - I bought this book after reading Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution. It's just the recipes are very rich and bland, the kind my grandparents would have been happy with, but not what I want my kids to grow up eating. To me, these recipes typify the standard American diet, loaded with cream, butter and cheese. I'm not opposed to fat, but I'd rather have a recipe with coconut milk, or avocados-food with more nutritional benefit than a cup of cream. I bought this book to help me plan healthy meals, but I didn't find any inspiration here. I don't mean to denigrate the recipes, which are very elegant and are the kind of food I grew up with, it's just that I have plenty of recipes for roast chicken already. Had I seen the book beforehand I would have put it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks hard to live with","review":"I am sure that if a person could actually live with this diet plan, not only would he/she lose weight, but blood sugars would be in complete control. There are too few choices in acceptable foods and too many no-nos. It is similar to Phase One of South Beach Diet, which is doable for two weeks but too strict for the long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much preaching","review":"The author spends too much time berating the bad eating habits of Americans and not enough time providing practical, usable advice. Get to the point - we already know we have a problem, that's why we PAID for your book. We want good advice, not preaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible diet to follow","review":"I commend the author for faithfully following the diet he prescribes in this book- but for the vast majority of people this diet is impossible to follow. He suggests an extremely low-carbohydrate diet, even more so than the south beach diet or the atkins diet. He says to follow a 12-6-6 diet, 12 grams of carbs for breakfast, and 6 grams for both lunch and dinner. I was hopeful that this book would give me a diet to follow, but his diet was just too strict, he doesn't even allow for milk- instead he has you use a little cream mixed into water! ick! I'm sure his diet of protein and vegetables would make anyone lose weight and be very healthy, but for the average person it is just not realistic to think that you can go through the rest of your life cutting out all carbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bacon is strictly prohibited by my cardiologist","review":"I just received this book and was shocked to see so many recipes using bacon!! Not only is it full of fat but is also high in sodium. Had I known this, I would not have purchased it. I will be returning the book, in hopes someone can use it. South Beach is much more sensible to me. Of course I am type 2, no meds and have been able to maintain a A1c of 6. Years ago I did Atkins, but I didn't have diabetes then and it was fun to indulge in all the fats. But now that I have learned a few things, I have a better perspective of what is good for me. I really didn't want to give this 'one star'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow-on to Diabetes Solution","review":"Great follow-on to Dr. Bernstein's \\"Diabetes Solution\\".

There are a lot of stealth sugars in \\"the Diabetic Diet\\" most often recommended by physicians that shoot up your sugar instead of controlling it.

I think this book is a must-read for diabetics or anyone who is interested in getting their blood sugars stabilized.I only rated the book 4 stars because I there are some issues that really need to be improved upon. The organization of the book is a little cumbersome and the writing style needs to be tightened up a bit. I think Dr. Bernstein's book could have benefitted greatly from the services of a good professional editor who is a better wordsmith than he is. Having said that, what do you expect? The man's an engineer and a doctor...not Shakespeare. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad format translation ruins recipes","review":"This book is essentially two parts. The first part is about carbohydrates and diabetes, and I found it valuable. The second part is recipes, which I found largely useless, because of ingredients lists that contain measurements and amounts like \\"H cups\\" or \\"H teaspoon.\\" I'm guessing that these \\"H\\"s and similar puzzlements are actual amounts in the book's printed version, like perhaps 1/2 or 1/3, but who knows? In any case, the original text did not make it into the ebook. The publisher obviously didn't bother to proof the ebook, but charges a hefty price for it anyway. I wish the recipes were as useful as the money I spent to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"this book was useless. I am not interested in what foods contain very little carbs. i already know that, and most likely you do too.i was hoping this book would tell you how to better dose the amount of insulin you take while on a low carb diet. it doesn't even mention anything close to that.the main problem with most low carb diets for diabetics is dosing your insulin so you don't go too low, because if you do go low, then have to have a lot of carbs to bring up your blood sugar level. as most diabetics who have tried a low carb diet know, eating low carb is not the problem, it's not going too low on your blood sugars.and he doesn't mention any effective ways to bring up your blood sugars if you go low.in addition to that, the first 70 pages of the book are spent trying to convince you of his beliefs in low carb diets. only about 10 pages are devoted to telling you what he believes is a low carb diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and disappointing","review":"I bought this book before I learned how off-base Dr. Berstein is in the area of disbetes treatment.

Try a publication from Joslin Diabetes Center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been more info on book","review":"I was upset with the book.

Most other tricycles we've tried have had pedals much too far away for her to reach. She has enjoyed being able to pedal it instead of just pushing it along with her feet like she has had to do with other trikes. My only 2 criticisms of the product are: 1) the folding feature is kind of a joke... it folds alright, but even folded, it is almost as big as when it is unfolded and 2) it is a little top-heavy and tips over pretty quickly. Overall, though, it has been a good toy for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"This trike is designed for children not old enough to ride on it.Initially, I thought this looked like a quality toy, but upon further examination, it became obvious that the pedals are set too close together. There is not enough leverage for my 4-year old girl to turn them over.My 2-year old loves to get on it and can scoot himself by pushing on the floor. Most of the time the older pusher the younger and then the pedals become a hazard.This toy is cute, but it shouldn't be considered as an entry level tricycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presented incorrectly","review":"First of all it was mailed in a soft carton envelope which was broken through when I got it.

That's why it's allways a pleasure to review such calssics as this. \\"PSBWB\\" is, without doubt a very enegic album. Dave Mustaine and co. are at their best.

This is a great album but not gqite as good as puppets.peace sells has better solos, more creative riffs than puppets, and can be faster than puppets, but even though puppets's solos are not as good, it has more power, riffs are more crushing and powerful, vocals are not somewhat corny like mustaine's, sometimes faster than peace sells. But it all evens out.Peace sells is a hell of an album but just like puppets. Just both albums are just so f*cking awsome! But I would say metallica is overall better than megadeth.

This in my opinion is the best of all the Megadeth records with Rust In Peace and So Far So Good So What just behind. I don't know why but the songs on this album just soud evil. The whole album has this dark tone to it and it makes it just that much better. The only trak I don't really love is I Ain't Superstitious. The rest of the songs are incredible. I personally think that Good Mourning/Black Friday is the best song Megadeth has made. This is the best album of Metal it blows any other thrash record away. BUY THIS ALBUM OR YOU DO NOT LIKE THRASH METAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Megadeth fans beware","review":"Mustaine went and pulled a George Lucas on us! These songs sound like they've been re-recorded! Let alone 're-mastered'. This album doesn't sound the same at all anymore - in a really 'less heavy' kinda way...it's completely bizarre and quite an unwelcome surprise. Jeez Mustaine, why you fixin' stuff that ain't broken? I'm tempted to pawn this off man. He ruined his own material."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Best Metal Album of '86","review":"Megadeth are a good band, but in the 80's they've always been considered second best. Let's get one thing out of the way, Metallica's Ride the Lighting was NOT dominantly written by Mustaine, as only the title track and parts of Ktulu were written by Mustaine. Anyway, this album has some good riffs , but the lyrics are completely out of context in most places, and the songs barely reach 5 minutes. This is second best to Master of Puppets (the best thrash album of all time) for best metal album of '86. It's good and all, but just doesn't have the epic compositions of Metallica's classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Dark, Really Fast, Really Heavy","review":"Coming of the heels of Killing is my Business(which is a good album in its own right, Megadeth released this speed metal masterpiece in 1986. Every song from Wake Up Dead to Peace Sells to Black Friday and everywhere in between boasts some blistering guitar riffs and an extremely crunchy low end. On the other hand, the lyrics obviously show Mustaine's drug addiction and can get rather freaky at times.

I had never heard nothing from Mustaine's boys before RUST IN PEACE. What a delightful surprise was this PEACE SELLS... From the first track WAKE UP DEAD I was caught with no defences. It's a fresh work, clearly full of desire to do it right (and clearly obscured by bad production...). The songs are killers, the riffs are sheer metal from the eighties. To say the truth, I found it to be better than RUST IN PEACE..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Tight Thrash- Megadeth's Finest Hour","review":"I used to own the LP back in 1986 and lost it soon after in a fire. I never replaced it until yesterday.Turn back the clock time, I actually forgot how much I enjoyed this. The first 6 tracks are killer, I like all of them. In fact the only track on this disk that does not meet my approval is the ultra poppy cover of \\"I Aint Superstitous.\\" While I am sure the original is very good, this one just doesn't fit on an otherwise dark disk.This CD contains my favorite Megadeth song of all time, Good Mourning/Black Friday. It starts out slow with the melancholy Good Mourning and builds up speed to the feverish intensity of Black Friday. IMO this has to go down as one of the best thrash songs of its genre. Its raw, it kicks, the only knock is that the lyrics are a little pedestrian, but I didn't buy this for the lyrics.For the milennium youth, if you like good hard thrash, this is a must add to your collection. I don't think they make metal like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Buying !","review":"The first thing you notice is that Daves songstyle has been changed a lot since the first album. It's better on this one but Mustaine cold have sounded a little rawer on some parts like he did on the first album. The production and soundquallity is twice as good as the first edition of Killing..Each song is cooler and it dosn't sound that screamy. Great album, but not their best and Metallicas 86' release were still better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfathomable.","review":"This is one of the greatest albums ever made. You've heard it before (probably about some really bad albums, honestly), but I defy you to put on \\"My Last Words,\\" \\"The Conjuring,\\" or \\"Devil's Island\\" and NOT soil yourself. Dave Mustaine is a true metal deity, and this album made him one. Admittedly, the lyrics are usually awful, but when read as campy b-grade-horror-movie-type stuff they're actually pretty funny.And honestly? When the band is chugging this hard, this fast, and the smoke is pouring from Dave's flaming fretboard, you won't care.I'd recommend that everyone in the world listen to this album, but honestly, there are some people who don't DESERVE to hear _Peace Sells_."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best anything in the world ever.","review":"This album, well, it was the one thing that got me into metal, and I have loved it since.

The first three albums were their best, especially this one. At the time, Megadeth were known as \\"State of the Art Speed Metal.\\" This was about as fast and heavy as you could go and still be melodic. I miss all days when music had balls to it. This is speed metal at its best. The entire alternative scene s****. They're all a bunch of spoiled little rich kids who hate the world because Daddy bought them a Honda instead of a Porsche for their 16th birthday. The entire second side rules, especially the gory \\"Black Friday\\" and a speed metal song about Russian Roulette called \\"My Last Words.\\" Megadeth started slowing down with each album after their third but at least they didn't never became flat out butt rock like their sister band whose name I'll refrain from mentioning.

However, I prefer that 2nd-generation Beatles material to the BOORRRINNGGG, over-rated 70's Floyd stuff.

It's not quite a classic but it's still very good and covers a lot of ground. It also has some progressive influences even though the genre wasn't official in 1968, it was still an influence to the progressive genre. The album's less accessible than Piper and it's harder to get into but after several listens it gets better. It's more complex than their debut but it holds up with age very well and the lyrics are better also. It's also their last with Syd Barrett, right before David Gilmour does lead vocals. Jugaband Blues, Corporal Clegg and Let There Be More Light are some of their finest songs to date. Overall, it's not as much of a classic as Piper at The Gates Of Dawn and it's a bit short in amount of songs but it's still up to standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"LET US HAVE A NEW DIGITAL REMASTER WITH MISSING SYD TRACKS!!!","review":"If \\"PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN\\" rates a digital remaster, then it's about time for a \\" A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS\\", to get the same attention.

Bravo, Mr. Waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"you need to know the story....","review":"Before you yell \\"sophmore jinx\\" at this album. Sure, there are only two really good songs here ( the Rick Wright penned \\"Remember a Day\\" and the group-written title track, a true showcase for each individual member's strengths ) that hold up to repeated listening. But what must be remembered is that the Floyd's main singer and songwriter Syd Barret ( who was largely responsible for the genius first album ) was in the middle of a complete and utter mental breakdown due to copious ingestion of psychedelic drugs when this album was recorded, and was all but absent from the recording, having been effectively replaced by vocalist/guitarist David Gilmour.

Corporal Clegg is a good song but is ruined by what I think is a kazoo. It sounds like circus music! Set the Controls...is a good song but I think it's too slow and Jugband Blues just doesn't fit with the rest of the songs but I can stand it. Every other song on the CD is great and is one of their better albums. I rank it just below Meddle, DSOTM, and Wish You Were Here.

Since I always had a taste for the bizarre, the song titles and spacey melodies suited me just fine. My favorites are Let There Be More Light, Set the Controls, and the title track. They achieved what other artists did not do until years later, and all without synthesizers. Truly a milestone in space rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"psychedelic good","review":"This is very good early pink Floyd. This album should not be broken up into individual songs.

Still, it is a very entertaining album and this brilliant remaster does improve the experience. Two of the best songs on this album are the title track and \`Set the controls for the heart of the sun\\", but I prefer the live versions of these two songs as found in the \\"Ummagumma\\" double CD. Although Syd Barrett had left the band, he does contribute to this album with his \`Jugband Blues'.

The songs are just sounds thrown together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Piper","review":"Unjustly underrated, ASOS is really the darker, sader side of Piper. It also has the best mix of all the Floyd's players and songwriters. Waters, Wright, and Mason keep up the great playing from Piper, and even the Floydian bandit Gilmour sounds alright(kinda like a mild verison of the superior Syd). As for Barrett, he comes through like the great madcap we all love. The slide playing on Remember a Day, \\"Manic\\" guitar on Corp. Clegg, oh...... And Jugband Blues is the great Floydian swing, you cry with a smile on your face. Unless, of course, your inhuman(like many Floyd \\"fans\\" seem to be) and are only happy when Dave Gilmour says: \\"Well, that was not professional at all.\\" Oh, poor, beautiful Syd....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Saucerful of...?","review":"This album is, without a doubt, as drab as they get. Coming off of the expiremental \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" the band decided to record their next album (or their first with Gilmour), which is what you are looking at now. The band rid themselves of Syd during the sessions (he plays on \\"Corporal Clegg\\" and his own \\"Jugband Blues\\") and Syd's absence shows horribly on the other tracks. Those two are OK tracks (Clegg is rather stupid, but hey, we all make mistakes!) and Jugband Blues is pretty much all this album can go on. It bombed drastically upon release in 1968. Instead of blowing your money on this you'd be better off getting a compilation (\\"Echoes\\" - for example) to give you an overview. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great","review":"Now I know this was a transitional album from Syd to Dave. But I must say this is the weakest Floyd album I've heard (Neck to neck with THE FINAL CUT). I kinda like \\"Corp. Clegg\\" and the title track still sounds great, but the whole thing just doesn't gel. \\"Jugband Blues\\" is the weirdest commercial track I've heard by an English-speaking artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"An incredible psychodelic journey from the end of Syd Barrett's time in the Floyd, to the time of his replacement and friend David Gilmore, who stepped in to help out for a while (so he thought). David ends up replacing him permanently after Syd's meltdown. It ain't Dark Side, or The Wall, or Wish You Were Here, but it's the roots of the original Pink Floyd. It's the rest of the band trying to write and take over for a Syd who has lost it from taking too much LSD. Jug band blues obviously says it all. It's classic and a must have for any Floyd fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's 'stepchild' album","review":"Why oh why do Dark Side era Floyd fans feel the need to bash Syd and the early albums? We're talking about two different bands that happen to share the same name. The problem with Saucerful is that it has too much Syd for these fans, and not enough Syd for Syd fans. Syd may have only 1 writing credit on this album, but it is clear that Rick and Roger were trying to keep in the Piper spirit with their compositions. I particularly like both of Rick's contributions, but find \\"Corporal Clegg\\" to be a well-intentioned misfire. And the lyrics to \\"Let There Be More Light\\" are as bad as anything from the notoriously sloppy psychedelic years. \\"Jugband Blues\\" is sloppy musically, but I find the lyrics compelling, particularly during the plaintive guitar-strumming ending. Syd fans, this one is worth it - our guy's presence is strong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spoonful of Floyd","review":"Released June 1968, this album continues the psychedelic music from Pink Floyd's first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but Barrett's nutty fairytales are replaced by more space-rock, such as \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", and Roger Water's first Floyd song about war, \\"Corporal Clegg\\". It was a transitional album as they were in the process of booting out their leader, Syd Barrett, due to his bizarre behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Best Floyd Album","review":"This album is the Floyd's second greatest creation(their greatest being \\"Piper\\"). More heavily influenced by Syd than most people think, this album is The Pink Floyd when they were truly experimental and pcycadelic. It is a work by a band not afraid to venture a little beyond the realms of normal human experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important early Pink Floyd","review":"The ufo space travel theme of Astonomy domine is continued on Let there be more light Saucerful of secrets and Set the controls.

Wright contributes as well with the pleasant \\"Remember A Day\\" and \\"Seesaw\\", but it was clear from the outset that Waters was going to mold the band in his image.

Indeed this story is quite over-written with a story that goes no where but in endless circles. Several supporting DD cast members get trashed in this story and you might be repulsed by how out of character Daredevil is in this book. In one scene, he throws a child off the roof.

Othe than that the book is perfect. Kevin Smith really does this book justice. Anyone who wants to read a comic that is as good as the great Frank miller's run should absolutely pick this up. Kevin finally makes a character truly interesting and exciting for the first time in years. and Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti's art make a very striking visual statement. It is very exciting and fun to look at.

Also check out Daredevil: Visionaries for the full eight issue storyline"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for those who love Stevens, but not too much.","review":"It's probably the most complete book of Stevens that is not out-of-print. It's very complete, and very well done. He's easy to read. But, you don't get all of the score, as in Moonshadow (i.e) you don't have the intro of the song. Also, some little things that you hear while listening the albums are not in it.i.e in Wild World, in the chorus, there a little picking and pulloff on the guitar: on the book, it's not the same. The chords sound very good ( same as the albums.) and the piano scores are terrific. For those who really know Stevens, I don't recommend it beacause you don't have the songs from Numbers to Back to Earth albums. You miss really good ones especially, *Novim's Nightmare* a very complex and beautifull song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Transcription","review":"This book will fit the bill for most musicians who want to play the music of Cat Stevens. A few of the introductions are somewhat inaccurate and it would be nice if the second and third verses to If I Laugh and Tuesdays Dead could be on the same page as the music.

It comes in an Olympus-branded package and seems absolutely precision-crafted, just what you need. From that standpoint I'd give it a 5-star rating, or better!

I was never really sold on this artist before receiving this CD, but I decided to lay aside my prejudice. After hearing the CD my opinion did not change of Bisbal. His music is not as innovative as an Alejandro Sanz, Alex Ubago, Chayenne or Luis Miguel. His style is a little overplayed and I got a little tired of the CD after a while. I would not really recommend this CD, his act is a like a poor man's Ricky Martin.

Absolutely the best read I have had in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This was a book that I was required to read for my college history class. I'm usually not big on books that are required, so I decided to get a headstart on this one so I could keep up in class. The book starts a little slow, but by the time she gets to about middle school, and especially high school, I found myself unable to put the book down. The imagery is amazing. As Anne gets a little depressed and unmotivated, I could feel myself become unmotivated and read the book less. I felt ackward reading about the situation with her mother when she and her sister were living together, you can just feel the tension in the dialogue. This is a really good book to read, whether it's a requirement or not because it is full of a lot of personal insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring throughout","review":"One's life is, though it may seem cliche, a long and winding journey. At this moment in time, I am still at the beginning of my journey. Though I have never met her, I feel the journey fo Anne Moodey has affected my life in a way I cannot describe. Her autobiography, Coming of Age in Mississippi is an amazing tale of her courage. I am fifteen years old. At 15, Anne Moodey was earning a living as a waitress and basically supporting herself. Anne's dedication to civil rights shows the vast impact that one ordinary person can make in the life of millions. I hope her dedication to her cause will inspire others , no matter where the journey takes them , to make a difference"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Testimony about Life in the South","review":"I had to read this book for my history class and after all the other books I read, I felt that this was going to be just as boring as the rest. I have never been so wrong. I couldn't put this book down. Although this was not an adventure novel or a mystery I was still getting anxious at certain moments. Such included when she was threatened by the KKK and when she found out about Emytt Tyll. We can all learn a lot from her experiences. It made me realize that we cannot have true freedom unless we are willing to fight for it no matter the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"My name is Traci McElroy","review":"I think that the book was very outstanding.

A MUST read.","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. \\"Of Coming Age In Mississippi\\" shows segregation and Civil Rights hardships like it has never been shown before.

It is real, heartbreaking, and impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Moody","review":"Thinking that this was going to end up being an annoying book report book, I was pleasantly surprised.

It tells a lot about black history and I suggest reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing, heart wrenching book","review":"This book was absoluteley amazing.

I can't say I'd ever recommend this to anyone, unless they were researching boring, straightforwward books lacking any eloquence or flavor. Moody tells her story without any emotion, which I guess is good because it isn't sappy, but it still manages to be asinine. If this book is being read to see the black viewpoint in the South, try something like Stuck Rubber Baby...Anything else really. Maybe I'm biased because I just didn't like how her Mom complained about being poor but squeezed out the kids at a rate of 1.5 per chapter. Sorry if this offends anyone, I know it isn't Moody's fault that her life was really boring, but I just wish stupid and poor people wouldn't have 10 kids when they can't afford to feed 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"The book came fast, good quality, nice read! it was perfect!

Sure, many APPEARANCES have changed, but have you ever searched the internet to see how many Klan sites there are? The topic of racism and hatred that comes with it is still scary and real; not only for black people, but everyone who is considered \\"different\\" than others around them. Anne's story is painful, real, honest, timely, and -most of all- it is a reminder to people to always be aware of attitudes and influences that we convey. I found myself thinking about the writing style afterwards. The language changes as Anne Moody's character matures and becomes more educated. This was a subtle effect that very effectively to drew the reader in closer.

The stitching stays put, the wear patches take a long time to wear out and the rest of the glove fits like a well made glove. The only problem I have with them is the length of the ring and little fingers.

I wanted to try these because the pinky and ring fingers are full length and I only need the other 3 exposed to handle my scanning pad and paperwork.Disappointed because they are supposedly designed for carpenter's? Waste of money unless you are only going to model them.The YOUNGSTOWN KEVLAR gloves are much better but don't come in this open finger format.Also they make your hands sweat more that other materials I've used and make your hands stinky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work Gloves","review":"Excellent work gloves. I've worked building small metal building working with cut sheet metal with jagged edges and these gloves still held up. You can get poked easily through the thin back portion, but if you know what you're doing it shouldn't be a problem. The thick palm protection is placed exactly where it needs to be. Since it's a framing glove, the cut off tips work great for handling screws or other small items. Felt pad is probably the greatest invention ever, its right where i usually wipe of the sweat from my brow and it usually stays clean because of the placement. Excellent glove, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, I highly recommended.","review":"I bought this glove to work and handle wood, tools, and do carpentry.

I didn't--I simply went on the word of a print reviewer who compared this to the ambient music of Brian Eno, one of my favorite artists. However, unlike Eno's soundscapes, most songs here have heavy beats with fast tempos and Cockney-accented lyrics. Not something I expected when I went to buy \\"ambient\\" music. Despite feeling misled, I gave this dub record a chance with a few listens and still find the music unoriginally repetitive and the lyrics trite, even silly.

However, some of the tracks appear to have been composed as space filler.

During illness, it is necessary for the mind to transcend the agony of the physical affliction. Doing so, the mind can concentrate its powers on God's perfection, and devine healing. In so doing, oftentimes fear subsides, and the positive affirmations create a healing force that can produce miracles. When I look upon the author's face, I see perfection of mind and body.

It is interesting to compare it with, say, the Hollywood Quartet's version from the 50s which approaches the piece as modern music -the Artemis play it with drama and poetry. I particularly liked the fin-de-siécle portamento in the \\"am griffbrett\\" passages after letter N in the score. The recording itself is immaculate without being recorded too close -contrary to another review here there is no heavy breathing. In fact we seem to be hearing entirely different recordings. I listen with Stax electrostatic earphones and they pick up everything but there is nothing extraneous on this recording. I like the pairing of Verklärte Nacht with the sumptuous Strauss Capriccio sextet and the curious but interesting transcription of Berg's piano sonata."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious recording","review":"with loud breathing noises by at least 2 players all the way through, mars what would otherwise be an acceptable disc.One player in particular seems to hold their breath while playing and between measures take a big inhale through their nose, sounding like a loud sniff.Also the last measure of the title piece is a lamely interpreted ending for such a luminous and powerful composition, (as well as sounding dissociated with what was played before it: poor editing?).This turkey should have been scrapped if they didn't have time to re-record it.It's a pity amazon does not allow negative stars as this disc is torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for decorating!","review":"I Love this little sifters!

The good thing about this book is that it covers the major topics required for the understanding of financial markets, i.e. stocks, bonds, interest rates, risk, dynamic programming, options, etc. One thing that I did not like is that in the middle of the section they switch for discrete-time to continuous-time and then back and forth again. It would have been better, in my opinion, to do discrete-time as a whole and then a separate section in continuous-time. In addition, the solutions manual that accompany does not seem like it's worth the $20+ you pay for it.

The mood and ambience are really perfect, though the music is sometimes too hardcore for what's happening on screen. John Glass is a nice protagonist with a very humane, anti-hero aspect to his personality.This is a slow-paced sci-fi movie, inspired by italian post-apocalyptic B-movies from the 80's.However, Hellacious Acres : the Case of John Glass proves that the genre isn't limited to half-assed storyline and crappy one-liners.

HA! \\"As the World Falls Down\\" has always been one of my favorites, but \\"Home at Last\\", though instrumental, has to be my alltime favorite song. I love absolutely everything about this soundtrack, every song, every melody. Just get it ok! =0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie! Great Soundtrack!","review":"Being 18 and a fan of the movie since it came out, it is great to finally own the CD. Listening to the Soundtrack is just like watching the movie. This is one of the best film soundtracks out there. If you like the movie, buy the CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD will carry you away","review":"You can relax, dream, and dance to this CD over and over agian. Trevor Jones and David Bowie are magnificent. They combine to make a wonderful CD. The songs very from light and happy(Magic Dance) to dark and nervous(Into the Labyrinth) and then calm and sad(Home at Last). The rich music and variety of instruments, mainly synthesizers and guitars, makes this CD truly unique. This is one of the few soundtracks that can stand alone,without the movie. However, I caution you : If you by this CD you wil have to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAB soundtrack for a FAB movie!","review":"Since i've been four i've been in love withh this film-its like no other movie. I finally bought the soundtrack, its brilliant! Magic Dance is great but I love \\"as the world falls down\\" its the ultimate love song... I would reccomend any Labyrinth fan to buy this wonderful CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He didn't sell out here!!!","review":"David Bowie complains that he sold out in the eighties. This soundtrack would seem to prove him wrong. His music is so unique and enjoyable, and Trevor Jones' score complements Bowie's musical and acting performance perfectly. \\"Magic Dance\\" is one of the best tracks on the album. the movie was incredible, and this soundtrack is right up there with Legend, Dune, & Blade Runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Labyrinth","review":"Great movie and great soundtrack! We have the movie in VHS and have updated it to DVD so we can continue to enjoy. The music is a delight to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie's tracks stand out the most!","review":"There's no doubt in anyone's mind, once they hear the soundtrack that Bowie hold it together. The songs are very clever. Especially for Bowie, whom prior to the Labyrinth soundtrack, had little to no experience writing songs about a children's' movie. \\"Magic Dance\\" is a funny song, but nonetheless good in it's strange and simple way. \\"Underground\\" is a weird song, but much better than any non-Bowie track included on the soundtrack. My absolute favorite song on the soundtrack, hands down, has to be \\"As The World Falls Down.\\" This is a love song at its best! Bowie's voice is stronger than ever, along with his song writing! I can't get enough of this song, and hope you won't be able to too! Many critics ponder on why Bowie chose to do this movie. It's quite simple really. Bowie has always searched high and low for something that would make people talk. Labyrinth was the perfect solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done masterpiece by Bowie!!!","review":"I have been a fan of this movie since I was 10 years old. I'm now 22 and love it still. This movie, of a girl's journey from adolescence to adulthood, is beautifully scored by the songs of David Bowie and is probably on the top 3 list of all time greatest soundtracks. Songs like Magic Dance, Underground, and When The World Falls Down are beautiful examples of Bowie's exeptional talent as a singer/songwriter. I can do nothing but reccomend this album to anybody who...eehh...to anybody that...eehhh, well to anybody!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"music","review":"this was not for me but a gift , never heard from the granddaughter so I don't know how she liked , but guess she did since she had asked specifically for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Labyrinth soundtrack","review":"Love the movie, love the soundtrack...it lags a bit during the instrumental pieces, but the Bowie tracks more than make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie soundtrack","review":"I have been a fan of this movie since I was twelve, and 15 years later still completely enamored with both the movie and the music behind this. My personal favorite on this CD has to be \\"As the World Falls Down\\"; a hauntingly sweet song that gets in your head and stays forever. I have actually had a friend have this song in their wedding reception and plan to carry on that tradition myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Bowie, loved the movie","review":"But the stand alone soundtrack wasn't worth buying. If you're used to loving every song on the CD that Bowie puts out, you'll be in for a big let down. Lets face it, David Bowie and opera just doesn't mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Take a good look at the box they show you as what you think you're buying -- because you won't see a box when it gets to you. Instead, you'll get a 5yd strip of Dual Lock in such a tight rolled that permanent crimps have formed. Forget having those sections lay flat on anything.Add to that the backing coming off in several places, so that the sticky part has been exposed to dust and air.Add to THAT the whole thing being crammed into the smallest possible shipping envelope.I've been buying Dual Lock for years. I've always bought it in the box, and have never had a problem until now.Major disappointment. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing information","review":"There are two publications with the same name, same publisher, same publication year. One is referred to as a paperback, and costs $12, while the other is referred to as hardcover, and costs $45. It is not clear from the description of these two documents how different they are - the paperback is actually a pamphlet, about 12 pages, a summary of the other, a several hundred page book. Choose which you want based on this information."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read","review":"When I was a child, I found this book in the library of my town. It was a very old edition, but I became to love it so much. Now I'm older, but I will enjoy buying it again for my children. I know they will enjoy the book so much, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is cool!","review":"This book helps you see where your running potential lies. You can find out, based on your PR in a given event, how fast your intervals should be run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alessandro Safina - INSIEME A TE and LUNA","review":"A very beautiful CD for a wonderful voice. We had great singers and wonderful voices in Italy in the past, we are continuing to have wonderful voices, Alessandro Safina's voice is actually one of the best, not so much popular as he really deserves in my Country, he has a lot of enthusiasts all over Europe, hope this will happen for USA, also. HIGLY recomended music for both classic and pop-music lovers. Paola from Rome / Italy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"After using this I would have to agree with other reviews, look at something else. The problem with this strap is that the quick release buckles slip apart when you try to get it on tight, which I want when I'm traveling with my car. Other than that the straps are ok, but that for it's intended purpose makes them sub par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not hold","review":"I returned this because it wouldn't hold. No matter how I routed the strap it slipped very easily. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of cheap","review":"Purchased the straps to keep the tire from flopping around. I guess it will do that but I am afraid to use the strap because it is so ruff that it will scratch the paint on the frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very disappointing add on","review":"I had great expectations after playing German Railroads 1 (see my review there) in this add on and I am deeply disappointed. Here is some of the main flaws: A lot of the sound is not authentic but copied from the North East Corridor - including the flawed audio when the train is stopped and you still hear driving sounds. AI trains come the opposite directions with no headlights on. The CAB display (aka MCD or LZB) has not been implemented. The manual says to use the track monitor - what a joke. If you like high speed trains - save your money on this one and drive the TGV for free instead (look for LGV Med 2 on various TS related sites).I played for about 1 hour and I don't think I will spend more time with this add on."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],R={key:0},N={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",R,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-d43cdefc"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/47.md","filePath":"library/47.md"}'),x={name:"library/47.md"},P=Object.assign(x,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
