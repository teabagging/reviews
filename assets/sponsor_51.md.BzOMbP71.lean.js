When the top closes, it has special sections in the top that keep the separated compartments separate. In other words, you don't have to worry about everything jumping compartments and needing to reorganize the items every time you open it up. I also bought the larger storage organizer for larger items. I highly recommend both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable small item storage bin","review":"This is a great item - lots of individual bins for nails, screws, and other items for the handyman. Tough as nails - I beat mine around and it stands up to the abuse. Stays shut with a great latching system - and the lid closes flush on the top of the individual storage bins so things don't get mixed up. Mine is now many years old - bought the new one for my son-in-law when I couldn't find a 2 inch screw at his new home. The compartments will hold items as big as a 4 inch screw or 16 penny nail and as small as a glazing point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Love it, but:- I bought last month for 15, now it's 20.

I bought multiple of these and am likely to buy many more. They are significantly cheaper than buying a large cabinet of welded steel.Instead of buying expensive parts cabinets, I suggest for small parts that are not frequently used, use a wire shelving system and a whole lot of these. If you do the comparison, you could buy 25 of these or the larger version and a some Inter-Metro type wire rack and have twice the storage of a parts cabinet of storage shelving system and have money left over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage box","review":"I bought a couple of these for my work van.

This just fits up against the wall in the nook where I have my desk, and any time I need anything I just lift it onto my lap and instantly find what I need. I love it!

I select for every repairjob the required tools and stuff in this box. It's a great help."},{"rating":"1","title":"They discontinued their better model; this one is inferior","review":"This product is not very useful, because the compartments are of fixed size and the sizes cannot be adjusted. Have a tool or part that's too big for their largest bin? You can't leave bins out to deal with this, because the others will shift around. So, you're out of luck.We really liked Stanley's model 014006R, which was rated #1 by just about everyone (including the \\"DIY Guy\\") and had 26 compartments with movable partitions. But they discontinued it, and all their so-called \\"customer care\\" department did, when we asked how to get a few more, was send us boilerplate e-mails in poor English, probably from a sweatshop overseas. For a short while we were able to find a few more of them at Target, and we stocked up, but they're now gone for good.So, Stanley has lost our business. In the future, we will be using the red boxes with movable partitions from Plano Molding, which also have more secure latches on the lid and more reasonable pricing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Sticker Glue Goo - Unfriendly Packaging","review":"The greatness of this product is greatly diminished by the HUGE sticker on the clear front cover that leaves behind nasty patches of glue goo that ruins the appearance even after removing the sticker with extreme carefulness.Then, the glue goo attracts dirt which leads to black patches all over the front clear panel.What would you do if a store put a sticker on your new car or a sticker on your pizza that ruined the paint or the pepperoni?A product should come without a horrible sticker which makes the customer have to work for 30 minutes to try to clean it off.Thank you and Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for LEGO!","review":"I'm \\"helping\\" my daughter collect the Lego Mini-figure series, needed something to store all the little pieces, and this was perfect. Note that the cover only opens to about 100 degrees, so it practically sticks up. This makes it easy for the cover to be accidentally knocked or jostled and having it slam close. The item is also very large and you really need to stand over it (especially if you're a kid) to view down all the deep containers. Propping one end up so the item is at an angle will help, but of course the cover will slam down from gravity. Solution is to whittle or cut away the clear tabs near the hinge so the cover opens to about 170 degrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best storage available","review":"I love these units - They are so good , I now have some 12 units and built a cabinet for them. Each container has an individual box which you can remove and rearrange. Most of all you do not have those stupid dividers that always fail. I use these for my work shop for hardware and for kits that do specific jobs.OK so they are expensive compared to the cheap ones - but they are heavy duty and will outlast the cheaper ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous adhesive","review":"I bought this to supplement another organizer I purchased at The Container Store. There is a large sticker that comes on this container which covers all of the middle compartments making it impossible to see what is inside these compartments. As soon as I got it I took the sticker off and there was a lot of the usual sticker residue underneath. I spent 30 minutes with goof-off, rubbing alcohol and an all purpose cleaner but the residue still won't come off. Now there is just a bunch of leftover residue clouding the top plastic of the container and it attracts all kinds of dirt.Not the fault of the seller of course, but there is absolutely no reason why they needed to use a sticker on top of the container. Now it's not usable and I'm going to send it back and pick up the generic version that I originally bought at The Container Store even though it's more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for parts, now how do I organize the bins?","review":"I have been accumulating a bigger and bigger pile of these lately. They're extremely useful for small parts. I have everything from screws, washers, and nuts to spark plugs in these bins. I really like that I can remove a bin full of the screws I'm using, take it to the work I'm doing, then return it later. I also like that I can rearrange the bins to put them in a configuration that makes sense for the parts in the box.The only problem I now have is that I have to organize my organizers! I'd love to have some sort of rack or cart to store them in, but stanley doesn't seem to sell one. I'm going to probably end up building my own, but it will be totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product ! ! !","review":"Amazon and eBay are the only places you can still get these good storage containers.

But these are the worst arrangements I've ever heard. They follow a formula: start with soaring strings, add in the acoustic guitar solo which would be acceptable if they left it at that. But every song then goes into a Kenny G type solo and some of these are really akward transitions! I was listening and thinking....\\"man, the only thing missing from this mish mash is music box piano\\"....and then there it was.The other annoying contrivance used: if it was originally an upbeat song from Lion King, they slowed it waaay down. The romantic ballad was suddenly jazzy? I am a big Disney music fan, so am really annoyed they ruined it like this.

No he has blossomed into a liberal commie pacifist band-wagon jumping moronic retard.He needs to move out of the country with Robert Redford, Alec Baldwin, Barbara Streisand, and Sean Penn. They can all get a house together in France and wallow in their own self-inducting pacifism.Maynard... a thought to you from me... Stop the new thoughts that the whole world is composed of what you see in your own back yard. Open your mind and realize that the world cannot be one big ball of love and understanding when 90% of the world wants you dead. That is the cold hard facts as they are.

I am a huge Tool and A Perfect Circle fan, but this album doesn't contain the complex guitar parts that I've grown to expect or ambiguously decipherable lyrics. No, the album contains a lot of drumming and bass with some other various instruments. True, Tool and A Perfect Circle have made songs that contained little guitar over the years, but this album really takes the cake. Now, as to the lyrics, Keenan's lyrics on this album are written in a much more simple meter and they contain something that I've never seen before in any song written by Tool or A Perfect Circle: transparently political messages. I respected Keenan's lyrics for their ambiguity and numerous possible interpretations, but this album has such a blatant message that it is impossible to escape it. This band has great potential, but this album falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Sucks. It's fine that most songs are covers, but they sucked.

I still love tool and maynard but I'll never purchase another Perfect Circle album. Save your money and buy 4 gallons of gasoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Maynard, what happened???","review":"This cd is a disgrace. It is hard to believe the same guy was performing this garbage as the guy who did Undertow, Anemia, and all of Tools stuff. Hell, even the first two APC albums, which I call \\"Tool on Prozac\\" were way better than this. This album is very, very bad, and I can almost guarantee if you loved Tool, and liked APC's first two albums, you will be greatly disappointed with this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just download 'Passive'","review":"All these bands trying to use a political agenda are making a mistake. We don't give a crap. Just make good music. I LOVE APC but this record is disappointing. Please don't be fooled by the positive reviews.If you loved Mer De Noms and Thirteenth Step as I do, this one will disappoint you. Other reviewers can embrace the dark, slow, creepy, un-rocking songs on the album as art and that's their right. There are brooding songs on the first two APC albums that are amazing but this does not deliver. These are just poor covers. There's no other way to say it. That being said, the song 'Passive', the only original on the album, is very cool. It is uptempo, rocking, and delivers the sound and vocals that move you like the best APC songs do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"For the price it was great.

Stick to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH ALREADY!!!","review":"Is it just me, or is it time for Maynard to stop focusing on this band and get to making another Tool album? I mean seriously, I hate this band more than anyting. Tool has been around for over twenty years, and they've only done 4 albums. This band has been around since 2000 or so, and they have just as many. The only thing good about this band is the fact that they sort of sound like tool, and yet they still suck much worse. Seriously, enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, APC HAS LOYAL FANS!","review":"I think its kinda cool, that they made this protest album, but what is REALLY cool is that so many people have responded with such intellegent remarks! Most of them completely true but ALL of them completely opinionated. So, as a review, I would like to Add that this is one record you really just need to hear, and decide for yourself, it's different than the usual APC, but then again All three albums sound completly different. bignOg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another APC Winner","review":"Even though it is mainly covers, most of the songs sound nothing like the originals. In fact, they pretty much sound like new APC songs. Being a big APC fan, I didn't know what to expect, outside of the brilliance I'm used to from them and Tool. This is no exception, Emotive is a great album and gets better with each listen. Forget about the politics, this about music, and amazing arrangements. Maynard scores another one in the winner category."},{"rating":"2","title":"War, Peace, Love, and Greed","review":"This is a very good album. The songs are all excellent. And they did a great job reworking and rearranging the songs.And the cover art and the war posters are very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugghh!! Propaganda in music at its worse","review":"I feel so refreshed that so many people share my views on this. I am troubled by the fact that I have to leave APC a bad review but I gota be honest with myself. For one, I'm about as tired of political propaganda as many are with the war. This CD was just that... 'Nuff said. Politics aside, the whole musical feeling I got from it was really bad. I did not find the endless covers entertaining or creative. I'm really disappointed especially at the creativity I always expect and get from a MJK project. Every song was bogged down as much as the next. The fact that there were only 2 originals made it worse. The problem with covers is that they come from someone elses heart, not yours and it shows. I hope the next APC album makes up for this.Other than that, every Tool and APC album(except emotive) RULES!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now being anti war is fashionable","review":"Maybe when this came out on election day in 2004, it got negative reviews because Iraq was going well at the time.Well the tide has changed 2007 and this antiwar disc fits my mood well.Realize these are mostly covers and only 1 or 2 new songs.But Maynard James Keenan's unique delivery makes them brand new.It is a depressing subject and CD though.Since its hated by many, its easy to get cheap used copies.I might have felt ripped off at $18 but for $5 its easy to be legal.It has a nice holo cover too, evocative and Emotive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I LOVED 13th Step and became a Perfect Circle fan because of it. I heard this one wasnt as good, but bought a used copy for a good price and listened with an open mind. What a drag this CD is, it sounds lifeless. The opposite of their last GREAT CD to say the least. Hard to imagine Perfect Circle sounding boring but they do, this isnt just bad it's terrible! And what a shame, because I thought the potential was tremendous after their last disc. I hope this was just an experiment (the protest/cover album) or whatever? I will be patiently waiting for the real followup to Thirteenth Step!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment.","review":"I didn't like it at all, for a few reasons. It doesn't sound anything like their previous work and they totally changed the songs that It sounds NOTHING like the original. Second, Maynard only sings lead vocals in half the songs, Billy sings the others, and I think thats kind of unfair. I HATE it when there is an album where the lead singer doesnt sing in a lot of the songs. This album is like the equivilant of Linkin park's reanimation, which is VERY experimental, and cannot enjoy listening to it. I only like One song on it. Personally, I hate it when a band covers songs on an entire album. And I thought this was a poor attempt for APC. This album will collect dust in my CD rack. The other two releases never leave my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"okish","review":"This is an OKish album. I love APC, but the cd isnt worth the bucks.

Even though, there were some disappointing songs that i felt that APC could have re-covered better. One, When the Levee Breaks. This cover song sounded nothing like the original, even though i like the way he was trying not to sound just like the originals, I felt this sound could have sounded a little bit better. Gimme, Gimme, Gimme was great. So was Fear's Lets have a War. Very nice remake of John Lennon's Image, almost made me cry. But all in all, this is a must have to all Tool, NIN, Tapeworm, and APC fans. Very Nice Message. MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is APC taking advantage of??? Is this even a cd?","review":"APC stuff is great but this cd is kinda ridiculous and havning people pay the price of a full cd is rip off. I have every tool and apc cd so i know that this is not even close to what they can really produce. This cd is jsut full of covers and such and 1 remix. Is this a real cd at all. They need to rethink and wait to put something out that is worth the attention of the real fans..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacophonous Cover Tunes","review":"I think it might be useful to preface my review by stating that I normally provide quite charitable, if not subjective, reviews of albums by A Perfect Circle and Tool. This instance, at least in the former sense, is no exception; this album is barely worthy of 2 stars.I'm not going to give a song and dance about the quality of individual songs since the criteria used by reviewers is purely subjective. However, I might as well state that, for me, not even one of the songs succeeded in capturing my attention.In light of their predecessors, these songs take the form of bad cover music. Keenan's rendition of the song \\"Imagine\\" is embarrassing and probably the most sadistic treatment of Lennon - sans Brinkley's shooting the man himself back in 1980. Songs like \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and \\"What's Going On\\" are equally irreverent.In short, \\"EMotive\\" falls way short of previous APC accomplishments. Even after multiple listens, this album failed to compel me.Dispensable."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be an EP","review":"Huge fan of APC but this was rushed on emotion instead of created with emotion. It was nice to hear Passive finally made it to disk but after hearing it live it was a let down. The covers had great potential but after several listens this CD likely won't ever see the light of day again. Can I have my $14 back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme gimme gimme a cd that doesn't suck!","review":"This is worse than a crappy NIN tribute album. This is worse than a bunch of celebrities singing about how bad war/hunger/aids/pagans/oil/ is. This album sucks. Not only does Maynard not sing as much as he should, the cover of \\"Gimme gimme gimme\\" is one of the worst covers EVER RECORDED! It's worse than Manson's cover of \\"The KKK took my baby away.\\" Not to mention \\"Imagine,\\" which is an absolute horror of once was a great song. This album is just once credible musicians thinking that their fame is enough of a reason for them to steal other peoples' music just to complain. This album lacks imagination. All the songs sound the same, like they've been put through an APC filter. There is no emotion, everything is predictable, and it sounds like it was recorded in a couple of days. Also, the song, \\"Passive,\\" was originally written by live NIN member Danny Lohner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD was flatout amazing. Maynard does it again. Without a doubt the best song on the CD is John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", but \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rythme of the War Drums\\" is a great song. I could listen to this CD over and over again. He sings all of the songs with such, i cant describe it. The music is wow. The drums in the songs is amazing also. Overall great CD. Go buy it, and tell all your friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EEEKKK","review":"Firstly, let me say that I am huge APC (and tool) fan, but Emotive just didn't fit the bill. Maybe APC just wasn't ready for a cover album (though I must admit, that was a big attention catcher for me), or maybe it was just too much of a change into the negative. Either way... there's alot left to be desired, esp. from a band like APC. Props to Maynard for beautiful vocals and also to Billy for those splendid little re-done riffs, because that's pretty much why I gave the CD a second star at all. All in all, if you're looking for something to leave in your stereo and put on repeat, steer clear. My apologies to all the other fans and all the members of APC. I'll be waiting around for the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've always liked A Perfect Circle, from the time before \\"Mer de Noms\\" came out when they toured with Nine Inch Nails on their Fragility tour, and even now I still believe that they are one of the most original and hardest working bands in the genre today. \\"Emotive\\", a cover album attempting to express Maynard and co.'s political views, starts off strong with \\"Annihilation\\", but from that point forward the disc is anything other than what it's title would imply. The following covers, most notably John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" and Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" lack any charge or emotional legitimacy, which is a surprising fact considering the band covering them. \\"Emotive\\" is still worth a listen though for hardcore APC fans, but it is a great disappointment from an otherwise excellent band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing back the new Tool album another year...","review":"Seriously, don't buy this cd. If you really need it, just get on your favorite file-sharing network or whatever and download it. Only about half the tracks are any good, and that sappy John Lennon song doesn't get better with a fresh coat of gloomy goth paint. There's too much talent in the current incarnation of A Perfect Circle to waste it on a covers album... it frustrates me that Maynard spent time on this when he could have been playing with his tool. I mean with Tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"I love Tool. I love APC. I love Maynard. However, this CD is terrible. Maynard and so many other music and film talents need to realize that we don't give a crap what they really think about politics and war (and most social issues). Most of them have so much money their opinions aren't based in reality anyway. We don't buy the music to find out what the meaning of life is. I buy it because I love the way APC takes two guitars and plays them with such awesome power. I sing along but don't really pay attention to the words. Most of the songs are just lousy covers of tired 60s anti-war tunes. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"this album is dissapointing overall. Imagine is by far the best song on the cd and is amazing. I think its even better than the original by John Lennon. Other than that song and one or two others, the album is weak overall. Its just too politically driven and the lyrics are all just repitition of things we've all heard before. If you are a strong anti-war liberal, get this album! If you are a huge APC fan, think twice before getting this. The songs manage to retain some semblence of the APC style but overall are quite different and will (most likely) leave you dissapointed (atleast at first)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, this album blows","review":"I bought this cd because I love Tool and A Perfect Circle and usually they don't dissapoint. This album does dissapoint. Horrible renditions of songs that don't need to be remade. Wast of 15 dollars. Thoughtless versions of great songs. The only song I can actually listen to is When the Levee Breaks. Stick to their regular studio albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for Nosepicking Bedwetters","review":"Mostly I just want to get my star rating into the mix because it's way too high. Just listen to the samples. This is pure crap, and if you like it I got some old Air Supply tapes to sell you. I'm done with these idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfect Circle; Slightly Askew","review":"Let me first say I love A Perfect Circle. I've loved the other two outings and am not totally bashing this one. I think this record is extremely over-produced, so many samples and artificial instruments are used and it ruins their vibe. I think the cover of Lennons \\"Imagine\\" is ambitious, but falls short. I just think that this is such a timeless and sacred song that it shouldn't be tampered with. I think \\"Passive\\" and \\"Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie\\" are good songs. Maynard just tried to hard to write political and the lyrics came out kind of cheesy. All in all this is not a bad album. I give them an A for effort. It's a very amibitious attempt and I always respect bands for trying new things....but I want the old APC back. I wouldn't suggest buying this album, but certainly burn it from a friend and see if you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time for some peace, love and understanding","review":"Someone wrote in a review that the words to these songs were not in keeping with some of Maynard's past (tool) songs and thus his past thinking. I say that most thinking people can evolve and change their point of view. The mind set that says once you come to a decision you must stick with it forever is the reason we are in the mess we are in. I wish our leaders would be as open minded. I personally think this is a great album and it's time for music like this to come back into our culture. Job well done APC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you're kidding right?","review":"words can't even begin to describe how much this album [...]. i understand that there are covers on this album, but you mean to tell me that maynard can't do any better than this? maynard has one of the most unique voices in music and its a shame to see all that talent go to waste. i can't think of one song on this album where maynard uses his full vocal range. the cd is full of whispering and computer inhanced singing ( if that's what you want to call it ). there is also a lack of actual guitar. the entire cd is basically a bunch of computer generated noise! in short if you like the first two cds from APC this one might not be for you because it is nothing like mer de nomes or the 13th step. i hope that they can come back with something better than this next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"maynard, how you've let me down!","review":"when i heard a perfect circle was coming out with a politically motivated cover album, i about messed myself. i think cover albums are awesome, but this has let me down so much. i first heard \\"imagine\\" a couple months ago and they turned it into one of the most depressing songs ever, same with \\"whats going on\\" (granted it was a million times better than that crappy all-star cover a few years ago). zeppelin's when the levee breaks is unrecognizable and boring. maynard chose some great old school punk songs (fear's \\"let's have a war\\" and black flag's \\"gimmie gimmie gimmie\\") but they're not good either (well, \\"lets have a war\\" was pretty cool). devo's freedom of choice was decent, but you know what it's all good...i still love you maynard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Take well Executed","review":"I didn't know what to expect buying into this album. I didn't even realize that it was an anti-war album with cover songs, still as A Perfect Circle fan I purchased this album.Maynard will always have my respect and this album has that fully. Many things that Maynard writes/sings about I don't always agree with, but I just have to respect him for doing what he loves, and standing for his beliefs.I admit I haven't heard many of the originals before, but still these songs with the APC touch are catchy and a great listen. The only reason I don't give this album a 5 star is nothing truly stands out on this album like his previous work, and I feel that the remake of PET was not what it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment","review":"I LOVE Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step, and think APC is an enormously talented and incredible band, and are even better in concert. I ran out and bought this CD and can't believe how bad it sucks. It is slow, depressing, monotonous, and doesn't do justice at all to the songs, whose original artists must be rolling over in their graves. If APC wanted to share their political thoughts with us, at least they could have been original and kept their edge, a la Rage Against the Machine. War sucks, but this music is even more depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it's worth...","review":"I've read few of reviews from disappointed fans acting like this album was created to be a brand new APC album. In my opinion it's not. A new album would be full of new tracks written by the band. This is their dedication to anti-warsentiment, taking existing songs and giving them an APC spin. They do this flawlessly. Imagine is one of the most haunting tracks I've heard. I didn't even recognize it the first time I listened. And this isn't metal. This is APC, and they don't fit into any categories of music out there. You have to go beyond conventional expectations and take this album for what it is, a fresh look at a new war through older songs. With of course, a new track and a remixed track that are incredible. Give this a shot, and don't expect any one style. This album is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY","review":"APC HAS PUT UP A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THIS WORLD MORE PEACEFUL. OR AT LEAST MAKE US LISTEN TO AND ASSESS THE SITUATION ABOUT VIOLENCE AMONG PEOPLE... MUSIC IS BAD AND THE LYRICS ARE DOWN RIGHT ANNOYING. TOTAL WASTE... THE BEST TWO (AND ONLY GOOD) SONGS ARE THE FIRST AND THE SECOND ONES. KEEP IN MIND THAT \\"IMAGINE\\" IS NOT EVEN THEIR SONG... MAYNARD, COME BACK TO TOOL AND DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO!!! I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM... 13TH STEP WAS APC'S BEST CREATION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Gas, it seems...","review":"Just download \\"Passive\\" and feel free to say you own the whole thing. I was quite cautious this time around, since I did not like their second album that much after that huge first rendition, and my fears became a reality. You may keep on \\"pusshin it\\" if you will, that's the sign of the true fan, but I am a music lover and there are only two kinds o f music: good and bad. This is bad, period. It confirms once again that singers do not make a band, they usually tear it appart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"As shocking as the realization that MJK has now jumped into bed with the Hollywood elite on political issues, it is even more shocking that, despite the politically charged lyrics, the music sucks. And sucks bad. The sound is a mish-mash of covers and sub-par b-sides. MJK's voice tries to exude emotion, but comes off sounding forced, and in some cases, totally flat. Let's just all agree to sweep this one under the rug and forget that it ever happened. Here's to hoping that this was just an aberration from a band and vocalist that consistently puts out some of the best material in rock. Considering the outcome of the election, it seems APC gambled...and lost. The album seems totally irrelevant because of that. And the rumors that APC will tour with Streisand in support of the album...those are still just rumors."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is half ass at best","review":"With the talent in this band you would expect great things. This is not great by any stretch. this is basically a covers and remix album that should be sold as a single for 5 bucks cause really thats what it is. I suggest previewing before listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Start with the good- I am a huge MJK fan, and have every Tool and APC release. This disc has a FEW musically interesting moments. Now, on to reality... Sadly this disc is nothing more than a hastily cobbled frothy liberal release, dripping with anti-war propaganda and moonbat fantasies. A collection of songs that, when released originally, ranged from poor to okay (with the exception of Led Zep's \\"Levee\\"), made only slightly better by the band's MUSICAL brilliance (previously I would have said \\"brilliance\\" without any clarification; now I must clarify that the brilliance does not include much intellectually). This release may end up a best-seller on the UC Berkeley campus, (largely to kids entrenched in liberal propagana du jour masquerading as a \\"college education\\" spewing from the wordholes of self-righteous soapbox professors), but deserves no merit most anywhere else. A regretable purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you're an idiot","review":"Before this CD came out, APC was one of my favorite bands, and I bought all of their singles and CDs and whatever else there was to buy, and then this CD came out. I'm not a fan of propaganda and cover albums, so this was already looking like a flop in my eyes. Still, I bought it and listened to it... and I was utterly disappointed. Maynard tends to force his ideas rather than suggest them, and in this case I just found it unecessary. The only time I was more disappointed with a CD was when I listened to APC's remix CD, aMOTION. That pretty much made me vomit on everything in sight. Good thing Tool is where the next Maynard project is coming from, because any more of this crap and I'd have to disown his bald head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"This album is not at all like the past ones, as it is much more tranquil. However, hopes are high that it will scare off all of the Tool fans who are just following Maynard like a lost puppy. Musically, this album offers much, as it is a cover album and allows the listener to hear spins on older songs. I think its great and makes a great driving album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Tool is one of my three favorite bands, they are producing art. Perfect Circle, well, i generally like the stuff, some is stronger than others. But this? The only reason I gave it two stars because I actually like 'what's going on' and the fact that i finally get to hear 'passive' which was meant to be recorded by tapeworm, a project Maynard was doing with Trent Reznor.This blows, though, and i hate to say that, I really do."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Decent","review":"As a long-time fan, I must admit that when I first listened to it, eMOTIVe was quite a disappointment. It wasn't at ALL what I was expecting from Maynard James Keenan, and a few of the tracks were flat-out BAD.After having a week or two with it, I must say I've come to love this album. Despite horribly-traumatic tracks like \\"People Are People\\" and \\"Let's Have A War,\\" excuisite ear-candy like \\"When The Levee Breaks,\\" \\"Imagine,\\" \\"Freedom Of Choice,\\" and \\"Fiddle And The Drum\\" [a surprisingly-beautiful a cappella cut] more than make up for those less-than-thrilling selections. Also, the heavily-industrial remix of \\"Pet\\" and the long-awaited release of \\"Vacant\\" [renamed \\"Passive\\" on this album] are very much worth the money spent.All in all, it may take some getting used to, and a few of the tracks may never grow on you, but once the shock of its stark departure from APC's other fare has worn off, you won't be able to live without this one in your colection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why be so critical ??","review":"First off , let me state that normally I don't give many reviews. I felt that I needed to voice my opinion on this particular album , so here it is. The album \\"Emotive\\" gave me a different listening experience compared to what I usually listen to, i.e.(hip-hop, rap). Although I have heard earlier Tool albums and thought the videos were outstanding , I never gave it much thought. So a buddy of mine lent me his copy to check out, and I was blown away with the variety on this album. Forget the political b.s. and the \\"Let's make a point\\" factor , and enjoy the music. Strictly, the music!!! Just Listen. If you don't listen, and try to pinpoint faults with anything , you will never hear the sound. PERIOD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointment and an insult","review":"i give two ratings for this cd:1 star when compared to their previous works and the potential of this band.3 stars when compared to all the garbage that is put out these days.i found the lyrics to be insulting of my intelligence. i love a perfect circle because their songs are bottled emotion that seep into me and provoke different unexepcted feelings and thoughts. the songs on this track however seem more like a lecture (along the lines of the \\"drugs are bad\\" speaches) when i think war protest songs.. i think of black sabbath with war pigs. that song SHOWS you war is bad as oppossed to telling you its bad. it would have been some more work, but maynard clearly could have done the same. i highly reccomend you buy this cd. it will give you a new found appreciation for mer de noms and thirteenth step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame vanity project.","review":"This is usually the type of cd a band releases early in their career, when they still have only a cult following. As their proficiency in their craft grows, then so does their following. APC takes a huge step backward with this release, which would indicate that it is nothing more than a lame vanity project. If your a fan of APC, and are quite impressed with the quality of music they have put forth so far, you better demo this cd first rather than just run out and buy it. I'm certain a lot of consumers are going to feel completely cheated with this purchase. The only good reviews are coming from die hard fans, and they would probably write great reviews if Keenan were to cover the Muppets Movie soundtrack. Most of the bad reviews are accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"I love Maynard and everything he does. But this doesn't even sound like anything he would make. I listened to it before I bought it and the only reason I bought it was to support the band. It's a shame they put this album out. Almost as big of a disappointment as Kerry losing. I hope the DVD coming out soon will be better. I give all tool and apc albums 5 stars but this doesn't even deserve 1. Sorry.Only good thing was I heard a old song on the tapeworm album that never came out. Good song...to bad on this cd they changed it a little. Was much better before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring to be different","review":"It seems that most of the reviews for this album are terribly scathing, and also, point missing.This is not your typical perfect circle offering, and that seems to offend the hardcore APC fans. However they have missed the boat! This album has a message, and if you can't see that then you're probably too stupid for me to explain it.Let me just say that every one of these songs touches a nerve. From the awesomely dark and disturbing take on Lennon's 'imagine' to the accapella brilliance of \\"fiddle and drum\\" These songs take known classics and twist them, wrench them and tear them to shreds, while still retaining the original message of each song.MJK's vocals are edgy and nerve wracking. The ultimate dark and brooding anti-war sentiment for my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked Tool","review":"And thirteenth step, and mar de nomsSometimes it seemed like depressing music just to be depressing, but hey, maynard has a great voiceBut this CD.....First of all, not every song has to sound like a funeral march. Ok...its creative once, but Turning heavy/punk songs into dirges isnt really that creative. Also it seems like Maynard missed the point of some of these songs. Like Imagine, its subtle, its hopeful, its not upbeat....but come on...its like the sound of depression, in the worst way you could possible imagine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans Will Be Surprised","review":"The problem with this album that fans will have is that Maynard never -really- stuck his blunt views in a record. In all of his other songs he kept it open to interpretation and after listening to all the TOOL and APC albums you'd think that his bands were apathetic; not trying to play off an image, just doing it for the music (Which is a good thing). In Emotive you find that image of the band ruined. After I realized that all the songs were covers and they all tried to force certain views & propaganda on its listener, I couldn't listen to it anymore. Some of the covers sound alright, most of them sound bad.The bottom line for me is that this kind of propagandistic music can work in Hip-Hop or subtly in rock...But when it's added into dark, emotional music such as TOOL or APC it gets sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland musicianship.","review":"I gave this album two stars; one for the cover (holograms will always be cool) and one for the song \\"Passive\\". Other than that there are very few highlights to this album. Annihilation, and Let's Have A War aren't bad, but that's only when comparing them to the other songs on this album. If you're an insomniac this may be your cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, Bad","review":"A perfect circle is a great band. But I may never buy one again after this stupid album. The first two albums released were wonderful. This one stunk worse then a fresh turd. They are surposed to be hard core, destroy the world type of a band. Not whining little anti war cry babies. Don't buy it, buy the other two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember, its art, not product","review":"The root of all music, lies within. Maynard is an amazing musician/person for even letting anyone know how he really feels about the world. I believe he knows that some people forget that we are ONE race.

Its ashame in the midst of a worldwide pending war, Maynard is the light at the end of the tunnel.Maynard KeenanJFK [murdered]Martin Luther King [murdered]John Lennon [murdered]Jesus [murdered]I don't want to know what a nuclear war is like :("},{"rating":"1","title":"What Are You Doing?!","review":"Don't listen to this.. really.

I read other reviews that shared the same sentiment but I still felt the need to purchase it to see for myself as I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 previous albums.If you have not yet purchased this album and are considering it based on their other albums take heed of this review and the others. This album is almost entirely covers, poorly done ones at that, ones that were much better in their original rendition. This album is slow and boring and never really gets off the ground.

The APC version of People Are People is just horrible. Why it wasn't cut is a mystery.Other than that butcher job on a great song, I have to admit that I really like the way the other covers are arranged.

Emotive is friggen waste of plastic. Half of the CD sounds like it is fillers. A couple of the tunes sound like unimagiontive use of a drum machine and whatever noise they could slop on top of it. Passive is more like what I was expecting. The cover on Imagine was ALMOST an inspired cover. Maynard couldn't quite get the lyrics to fit. Would love to hear it redone with new lyrics. People are People sounds like something my 5 yr old would come up with. Fiddle and the Drum might have been cool cept the lyrics and music were monotonous. Freedom of Choice showed alot of potential but didn't quite get there. Sounded forced and rushed. When the Levee breaks was ok. There are a couple I can't even sit through at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a cheap political commentary","review":"There is little here that is musically interesting.

Instead of buying this album, you can come find me and I will pull my largely unused copy out of the CD case in which it has remained for the last 5 years.I think the band might possibly have made this entire CD in one weekend, when they sat around on a Friday, and said, \\"you know, let's make a political statement with a new album.\\" They then spent the next 72 hours remixing some old stuff, putting some boring experimental tracks together, and sent it to the presses for release by Monday.If you don't own one of APC's previous two albums, buy either or both of those instead, and save your money on this boring piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"this album shouldn't have been released, or at most should have been an ep of six songs (tracks 1-5 + 11). imagine's a really neat take on a john lennon song, and passive's also really good. then, the only other good songs are 'when the levee breaks', 'annihilation', 'peace love and understanding', and 'what's going on'. some of these aren't too great for the most part, but all in all are definitely listenable and can be enjoyable.my suggestion is: if you are just getting into a perfect circle, do not buy this album unless you really like industrial music or remixes. rather buy mer de noms (thirteenth step is better, but it takes a while longer to get into than mer do noms and hence is not as good of an introduction to the band)"},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously sub-par for APC","review":"Like many here, I love the first two APC releases and was disappointed by this one. I actually rather enjoy covers when they're done well. These are only okay... and the selection of these covers seems to have been driven by their political message/content instead of their musical properties. If APC's intent here is solely political, then okay. However, this CD won't do much for someone who purchases CDs looking for *music* instead of a worldview. I like provocative lyrics, but message alone cannot make a CD in my book.Oh well... get 13th Step and Mer De Noms."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted money","review":"No disrespect to anyone but I don't care how many people say what Maynard's message was or that it was the \\"way\\" APC formed the music to their own style....you don't take classic songs and ruin them! Imagine...why? WHy would you do that to John Lennon, I wouldn't be surprised if he did backflips in his grave. Furthermore to offend him and then offend the like's of the late great Marvin Gaye it just takes a new low and level of dissapointment. I am a huge fan of Maynard and tool and the original APC album but they have gotten \\"progressively\\" worse and this doesn't help. Not only that don't buy this album expecting to hear the sweet sound of Mr. Keenan's voice because BIlly sings lead on the majority of the tracks and he can't sing very well. It wasn't a great album, it wasn't even a good album do yourselves a favor and waste your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"APC has been on a downward spirol","review":"This is like listening to elevator music but worse u cant ignore it because it sucks so much.

If anything download it first and see for ur self the agony of disappointment that this album brings. Ahh i hate having to give it even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Common Story","review":"We've seen it before. Music artists get political. Well Maynard picked the low hanging fruit on this one. Lyrically ready for a third grade audience. Trite melodies. A patronizingly simple theme informing listeners that they are all sheep and that they have the freedom of choice to stop the war. Gee...I wonder where they got this idea from.Despite my disappointment with the album as a whole, a high point is track 10 \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\". This track happens to be a remix of 'Pet' from Thirteenth Step. So the most worthwhile track is only a new and improved version of something I have already paid for.If you are a PC fan, like I have been, you may want to avoid this disk. It is better to remember Perfect Circle the way they used to be...with a spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm soooo glad I didn't buy this!","review":"Just listening to the snippets from above, I'm extremely pleased that I didn't pull my usual \\"rush out and buy it cause its a band that I like\\", which has proved successful in other situations.This DOES sound slapped together, and like just a third album to finish their contract.Maynard, just slip back into Tool and pump out another one. I don't care if its a couple years out so you can get back into form, JUST DO IT!APC hasn't disappointed until now. No, listening to just the samples probably isn't fair,....but neither is slapping the APC name on something so sub-par. This is FAR from the musical genius that I've come to accept and expect from Maynard and company."},{"rating":"1","title":"No respect for the dead","review":"I must admit that I have only heard one song from this cd. It is the cover of John Lennon's classic Imagine. The cover is dark, gloomy, and deppressing. This is the exact opposite of Lennon's version, which is more of a song of hope for the future. I have no respect for this band and do not intend on lisstening to anything else of thiers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting effort, reasonably well produced., hypocritical","review":"My only gripe is that this is a total screed against war and yet seems to penetrate through the responsibility of government to the \\"wallets\\". Sure, war profiteering is certainly one aspect of war, but the last time I checked, war is something that a State has to declare. IT is the main recipient of any benefits to be culled from war. Ultimately IT holds the power in its hands, and at best it trades its power to other Big Interests, whatever they may be.It is hilarious that the left decries war, but adores Statism. Perhaps that is due to the endless force it has at its disposal to wield in other forms other than war. That, apparently, is all well and fine. And in so doing prop up the beast.Welfare breeds warfare, warfare breeds welfare...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Needed or Wanted","review":"Maynard James Keenan releases music so rarely that when he does, we the fans deserve more than an album of cover songs. This honestly really pisses me off because if the creative talent of A Perfect Circle which has more talent than any other band out there right now cannot manage to write and record 12 new songs for their 3rd CD then what is the world coming to? Seriously, how many years now since a Tool album? And we get this? Maynard singing John Lennon?!?! I'm outraged and disgusted and you should be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This CD sucks so much...all you have to do is listen to the samples Amazon has on this page...seriously, it sounds as if these guys got trashed one night and recorded an album...the songs are so boring, slow, and cliche...I can't even stand the remake of Imagine, the Beatles had a much better version and I'm no hippy"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ambient Folk band kidnapped Perfect Circle and recorded this album","review":"If your a APC fan save yourself the money and just get the song passive off of itunes. The rest of the album is like a folk/ambient experiment. If you like tool/apc this is not the album you were hoping for. The song passive is awesome though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit underrated...","review":"True, this record may pale in comparison to the ridiculously good \\"Thirteenth Step\\", but MJK and company deliver on \\"Emotive\\", an album of anti-war sentiment, re-recorded classics by such artists as Marvin Gaye, John Lennon and Black Flag. The difference between \\"Emotive\\" and most other records is the fact that 4-5 songs really carry the album, which prevents it from being \\"great\\", but far from the realm of \\"bad\\". Tracks such as Annihilation, Passive, Imagine, Let's Start A War, Freedom of Choice and Counting Bodies are killer, and make this record a good choice for the \\"industrial hippie\\" (as one other reviewer excellently stated) in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing....","review":"I understand the fact that everyone is entitled to their own political view, that being the very foundation of our country. But this is not APC. This is not Maynard. It is not for the fact that most of the album is cover songs. I love APC for the mystic, indepth, poetic lyrics and their dynamic range of music which makes their albums into tapestries; art. The fact that they make thier message so blatently obvious so simple just because of their views over politics (on election day no less), I find disgraceful to their name. Maynard is a brillant lyricist. I am disappointed that he felt that he needed to pull a stunt like this to try to influence an election that, had it gone the other way, really would have provided little change. For those like myself who look to Tool and APC for their poetic, inspirational, and thought-provoking music, don't buy this album, stay with MDN and 13th step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounding music","review":"I don't understand the bad reviews - i think this album is really good. I don't know too much about its scheduled release or political message it was supposed to have made, but anyone looking for haunting, emotional music, here it is. The covers are well selected and I must say I think this is an awesome version of John Lennon's 'imagine'. Admittedly not as good as their first album, but cover albums never are. A perfect circle are a great band and i don't think this album has hurt them at all, good sounding music and I think Maynard's voice sounds good over anything, even fingernails scraping on a chalkboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest disappointment of 2005","review":"i probably shouldnt be too harsh on this cd because i only heard 30 second previews at borders. i own mer de noms and the thirteenth 2 of my favorite albums, and i heard the single Passive on the radio and it was an amazing song so i thought that if all the songs were as good as that that it would be an essential cd so i was at borders a few weeks after and saw it on the cd shelf and previewed all the tracks. i preveiwed all the songs and was disappointed except for passive. i just fell sorry for all the people that bought this cd as first time APC listeners and now think badly of the band. i mean the cd deserves some credit but for a keenan cd it is pretty much awful. i suggest buying instead of buying this buying APC's first two albums Mer De Noms, and The Thirteenth Step which are both amazing. i also suggest buying the Tool cd's Lateralus and Aenima. hopefully the next APC album will not disappoint and the upcoming Tool album will be worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm","review":"This album is really not what I expected from Maynard. Its definitely progressive. It is a little too political or \\"world view\\" for me. The peace preaching is good. He raped butchered one of the greatest songs ever written. I wish I could \\"imagine\\" him not perverting it but it does fit the theme of this album so I forgive him. I originally thought it was someone like staind or that maynard sound alike band that covered \\"imagine\\" which infuriated me to no end but learning it was Maynard and the context he used it eased the tension somewhat. Its not a \\"rock\\" type of cover. His version of \\"What's goin on\\" is interesting. Either this album is way ahead of its time and totally misunderstood or its the first garbage I have heard out of Maynard. At first sound I'm not too impressed but maybe it will grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I'm a huge Tool fan, so when APC came out I just naturally kinda got into them. Their first album was good, and Thirteenth Step was just awesome...Yes, I can say \\"This Sucks\\" about this album if I want to. Not all of their work sucks, just this album. I went in hoping for another TS style album, and I just wanted to throw the cd out the window. Even the remake of \\"Imagine\\", which I guess some people liked, didn't impress me at all. It isn't horrible, it's just not something I care to hear more than once.Still a huge fan of Maynard's work, but I don't recommend this album to anyone really... Sorry APC, you win some, you lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too political...not musical enough","review":"First off I have to say that I'm a fan of APC and that the song Passive on this album is such a great song; it's probably one of my favorite APC songs ever. With that being said, I wish the other songs on eMotive were as good as this one. Maynard James Keenan definitely had more of a political rather than musical objective when making this album. His political opinions and viewpoints don't really matter to me just as long as his music is good like it was in Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step. This album lacked that whole APC vibe his previous album had. I give the two star rating because Passive is just such an awesome song especially when I was able to see it on the movie Constantine. Buy Mer de Noms and Thirteenth before getting this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"When I heard A Perfect Circle had come out with an anti-war CD, I was excited. I read all the bad reviews and I still gave it the benefit of the doubt. But the critics were right. This album stinks.The tracks that aren't unbearably uninspired (\\"Freedom of Choice\\") or physically unbearable (\\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\") are just plain boring. The covers are the originals with everything good stripped away and nothing added back. There is no musical life here, nothing interesting.\\"Passive\\" is an exception. Not APC's best, but stirring enough that I'll probably listen to it again.But really, don't waste your money. Even if you're a die-hard APC fan AND a die-hard pacifist, it's just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inevitably Outstanding","review":"If you are a die-hard Tool and APC fan, you will learn to appreciate this album. The quality of the entire album may not of been at its greatest, as they usually put out but Maynard is sending a political message here. I don't care what you might of heard that they are becoming soft and they are not putting out good music. This album encouraged me to become more of a Fan of Maynard's then ever. And please, as I read in that other review, DON'T EVER COMPARE APC TO METALLICA! So you phony posers and Limp Bizkit fans stop the complaining about the \\"mediocre\\" (as you say) album that this great band has put out to send a great message, as the old dusted originals did in its own time. Imagine is excellent! It sends out a better message and makes more since than Lennon's original. Please Buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important enough to write a review","review":"What a waste... I love Tool and APC, but this album is a total travesty to the reputation they once had. Can't Maynard write music anymore without a complete agenda? This is supposed to be art, not propaganda. With the exception of \\"Passive\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" the entire album is so immature I can't even listen to it. The music is terrible. Their new sound is soft & slow, on par with elevator jingles. And the lyrics are ridiculously childish & annoying. I feel stupid for even buying this. \\"Emotive\\" is a fallacy of what the band used to be. Save yourself, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Message... Poor Delivery","review":"Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of \\"Imagine\\" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth 1 song","review":"Just go to iTune's music store and download the song \\"Passive,\\" because in all honesty, that's probably the only song on the entire album that is worth $1, and the only one you will listen to repeatedly. Billy Howerdel's lead singing ... simply ... horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album of the Year","review":"Been a Huge Tool and APC fan for years but this is the worst album they've ever done. There are only 2 good songs and the rest are horrible attempts at covering. It sounds as if they made the album in 1 day in a garage. They should stick to writing awesome music instead of getting into politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Maynard?","review":"2 or 3 songs here are worth hearing, and one of those is a remix. Otherwise this album is just boring/prententious political messages given in the form of butcheries of good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want someone to shove a political message down your throat","review":"...then this CD is for you. I forgot about that before I picked it up, and then remembered this was one of *those* love it or hate it CD's.There is however, one song I like and that's Passive. All of the others are either horible covers, or he's whispering or talking like he's just been kicked in the nuts. That's NOT good music, hell it's not even music.I've always liked Tool/APC when I've heard their songs, reguardless of their message, but this album sounds terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap.","review":"Maynard used to be my absolute idol. Now he's just pissing me off. This album was so obviously thrown together as a last minute attempt to shove their political adgenda down everyone's throats in time for elections. I'm sorry if that's harsh, but the cd is just awful. But what can you expect? They put out 13th step, go on tour (which i went to see, frigging rocked) and somewhere in there had time to crap this out. Sorry to everyone who liked it, you are entitled to your opinions, but you all know mine. and what the hell is up with \\"counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of a war drum\\"? can you say recycled crap? Pet was a great song, but there's no need to turn a Da Vinci into a finger painting. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped it would be","review":"I hesitated to buy this album, mostly because when I looked at it in the store, it looked almost \\"preachy\\" in nature, not like A Perfect Circle's other albums...I have to admit I am having a little bit of buyer's remorse now. Some of the tracks on the album are good, track ten is good (it is the reason I bought the album, track 11 is good too, but some of the other tracks (track 6...Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie...) are REALLY bad (I understand that they are making a statement, but it just doesn't work). The biggest problem I have with this album is that it sounds SO different from their other albums...a little difference is good, but this is just a little too much \\"preaching to the choir\\" for my taste. My advice...if you don't have any other Perfect Circle CDs, buy Mer de Noms, or Thirteenth Step.If you want to buy this CD, buy it used, don't pay full price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to their usual quality of music.","review":"Most of the songs are on the CD are covers, and don't sound like stuff Maynard normally does. There are a couple songs that bear Maynard's unique style, but most of the CD is not the high-quality of music that I've come to expect from this band. I can appreciate the music even if I don't agree with the lyrics, but it's the music itself which disappoints me this time. The whole thing sounds rushed, as if they just slapped it together to make a point. If you're a fan of his normal work, you might not like this. This is a disappointing album from a band whom I normally expect a very high-quality of music from, and the first time I'm less than satisfied with something Maynard's produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"No wonder this CD isn't more popular. It is nowhere as good as their other releases or anything from Tool. Except for two songs, it's a waste IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Just awful....I Miss TOOL!","review":"I am a huge Tool fan but had recently (in the last year or so) come to appreciate APC. While nowhere on the level of TOOL they do have Maynard and a melodic and textural sound. I bought this CD the minute I saw it (even though my initial reaction was F---! I thought another Tool cd was due out first) I popped it in my CD player and all I can say is what a piece of garbage. The lyrics are stupid, the melody is lame, the only song that sounds kinda of like APC is the song PASSIVE and that might have been left off of a good album. Don't waste your money on this CD. You would be better served going out in the woods with your hippie friends, bringing a guitar and recording your work. THIS CD IS LAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"Maynard and his band have made spectacular music and this album is no doubt one of their greatest. They do the songs in their own way, the apc way and its awesome. It's worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST COVER ALBUM!!!!","review":"A Perfect Circle should never be allowed to cover songs again. Every band makes a bad album and this is it for them. If Marvin Gaye and John Lennon were alive today, they would be pissed off at A Perfect Circle. The worst cover on the album is Imagine, Maynard butchers the song with his singing and the instruments aren't anywhere near the original -- plus there's no piano. Also when the cd got the What's Going On I almost threw it out the window.This is just cover after cover of crap. I don't suggest this album to any APC fan. This gets chulcked up there with Six Feet Under's Graveyard Classics and A Punk Tribuite To Metallica. If you want some good covers pick up Metallica's Garage inc. or Slayer's Undisputed Attitude not this piece of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing perfect about this...","review":"I am disgusted when mindless trendy bands take a song from a distinguished group of musicians and botch the F out of it, and if this was the only album that APC put out that is the way it would appear.

Let me make this clear, \\"THIS IS NOT THE FOLLOW UP TO THIRTEENTH STEP OR THE NEW TOOL ALBUM\\"!!! If this is what you're looking for, you're looking in the wrong place. You're gonna have to wait a little longer! If you're a true A Perfect Circle and TOOL fan, then you'd know that Maynard made this album as a way of expressing himself and letting his voice be heard!

The band had just put out 13th Step a year prior to the release of this CD and had been on tour promoting that album before working on Emotive. Why did they need to rush into producing a cover CD full of songs that were written by a bunch of hippies? And after all, what's more ridiculous than Maynard, the same guy who said he wanted to see Armageddon come about, (in Aenema) singing about peace? How freakin hypocritical is that?The musicianship is still of superb quality, and there is a little bit of positive experimentation on this album, but overall it's incredibly dissapointing.

There are a lot of photos and maps that help to understand the course of the events. If I should find a fault it could be this one: naval aspect are covered only as regard the main events and battles, but the most of everyday battles are not dealt with.

Just by holding it in your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"After I ordered this book, it was at my house in about four days. I haven't been able to finish it entirely yet because of other school books but I'm about half way through so far and it's amazing! I would recomend this book to just about anyone. This hardcover in particular looks beautiful! Since I got it, ive had at least ten random people at school comment on how beautiful it looks. Bottom line, It's an awesome book and you should get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and weep","review":"I just finished reading \\"Krndija\\" - it is awesome. Anyone who has an interest in the history of the Donauschwaben (Danube Swabians) who came to colonize the Danube Basin in the former Yugoslavia, will find this true to the letter. The author did much research and I found the facts true to form. I can say that because, I too am a Danube Swabian. If you want to know how the early settlers lived and died and later lost everything to Tito's regime, this is a book for you. I recommend it highly. By the way, \\"Krndija\\" is a small town in Croatia which was inhabited by ethnic Germans until 1944.Katherine Flotz, AuthorA Pebble in my Shoe - a memoir"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product","review":"The Rion Mini Lean-To greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts. It difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled. (Making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing.) The 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams - but no photos - with parts labelled to help with assembly. One classic exerpt on page 7, \\"The 'OUT' on the 2D connector should face the inside of the Mini Lean-To\\". This kind of product gives the term \\"some assembly required\\" a bad name.Also, it's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed. Save yourself the trouble get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth spending more on something else","review":"I loved the way that the stroller looked- it matched our carseat perfectly. It steers well, has great shade coverage and very nice cup holders. The BIG problem is that is sometimes gets stuck open and the \\"one-hand\\" folding mechanism DOES NOT WORK. This has happened to me and my husband. I cannot wait to replace this stroller with a more expensive, safer product."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's only 10 months and we need a new stroller","review":"I have to say that I was happy with this stroller at first. We have been using it for about 6 months now. For the most part it is pretty sturdy, lightweight, and easy to manuever. But the problem that I am having now is that the button located on the handle that you use to fold it up, doesn't always work. So, I am often stranded in parking lots, with my daughter sitting in the car, waiting for us to go, and I am outside of the car, struggling with the stroller, trying to get it to close!!! The other day I almost just left it in the mall parking lot (I was attemting to close it for atleast 20 minutes), when I finally just cleared out the trunk of my car and stuck it in there unfolded.I wouldn't recommend this product.

That's good. HOWEVER, the edition I had was absolutely riddled with typos, misspellings, and incorrect punctuation. It's hard to take this book about newswriting fundamentals seriously, when one of the fundamentals - accuracy - is so obviously not a priority. Also, I'm not sure that a book is the best way to teach writing, at least this kind of writing. I fell way behind in the reading, but I still got an A in the class. I learned much more from On Writing Well by Zinsser than I did from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheapest and fastest way to lose weight","review":"I came across this DVD a couple years ago at Target.

Some of the characters are inconsistent. Why would Ragnhild start fawning over the main character, after he helped 'magick' her horse into almost drowning her? I got the book for free, got my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hero so stupid, you wish he'd die","review":"Sigurd is neither smart nor clever nor mighty nor noble. He betrays his friends and is easily duped. The main appeal of this story lies in its antagonists: a treacherous wizard, a sly warlord, cunning infant-demon Mori, comical Hross-Bjorn.Elegant descriptive prose and a fast pace fight to redeem a weak storyline (\\"What's in the box?\\") and repetitious dialogue. Deliciously macabre vignettes of opposing the undead monsters of Scandinavian folklore are strung together loosely to create a narrative where character motives are irrelevant to action scenes. Predictable plot twists wouldn't fool a child. Genocide or conquest seem the only solutions to racial unrest between Light Elves and Dark Elves. The denouement, mercifully short, tries to hint at deeper meaning, but misses.This disaster of a novel is fortunately a quick (but not painless) read. Two stars are given for the gory and entertaining monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard and the war machine","review":"I really liked this book, and it's predecessor, the Cyborg and the Sorceror.

His criticisms are so off-the-mark that he must make repeated claims that his expose style drivel is directed toward the \\"layman\\" reader. I find it hard to believe that Ormerod is an economist due to the continuous oversight/misrepresentation in his book.

I've built around 10 networks using Linksys switches and routers and have been very pleased. I have never had a failure with a Linksys hub, switch, or router. I have had 1 or 2 bad network cards, but out of 50+ that's not too bad.I've set up 2 networks using this 16 port switch. One of them is still going strong after 5+ years, the other has only been in service for a few months - no problems with either switch.

Imagine all the chapters from Les Miserables that describe the Battle of Waterloo, the sewer system, and the convent.

This sets the stage for Blake Edwards' comedy that pokes fun at Hollywood.Thrown together is a brilliant cast, a rediculous story, a bunch of crazy characters, and the centerpiece: Julie Andrews' boobs bared. The result is a very funny and entertaining movie that is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first mockumentary?","review":"I know SOB is not meant as a documentary style movie, but when you look at it's spot on take of Hollywood it reminds me of movies like This Is Spinal Tap. SOB is clearly done as a narrative, but you can see some of the elements that later were used in the 'mockumentary' movies of the 90's. The writing is top-notch and the actors seem to be reveling in their parts. The scene where Robert Preston explains his occupation to the young lady at the party has to rank as one of the top 10 funniest scenes in the movies. The story doesn't wander. Blake Edwards mixes slapstick with dark humor to create a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It's a shame this doesn't get airplay anywhere that I've been able to see, even with 500 channels to surf through. But, I guess that isn't too surprising considering who and what bears the brunt of most of the jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hoot!!","review":"You have to give Blake Edwards and his courageous cast credit for having the nerve to make this film. It is irreverent, often over the top, and is pretty merciless in commenting on the Hollywood system. This film is not his masterpiece, but certainly one of his most personal statements. The picture quality of the DVD is excellent--good color, good definition, etc. The sound is so-so but, since it isn't a musical, that doesn't really matter too much. Supposedly, Edwards worked on this screenplay for years, as a reaction to the treatment he and his wife received from Paramount--especially during and after the filming of their mega-flop, \\"Darling Lili.\\" Most folks now agree that \\"Lili\\" is a darned-good film and exhibits some of Edwards' and Andrews' best traits. When can we see this film on DVD?? And why not package it with with S.O.B. as a double set!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat and hilarious!","review":"I first saw this film when it was released in 1981. I was so shocked at seeing Julie Andrews bare her breasts and use all sorts of profanity that I did not fully appreciate the film at the time. I recently rented the video and I found myself laughing out loud all the way through. Blake Edwards' poison-pen letter to Hollywood is dead-on and everyone in the film has a great time chewing up the scenery. My favorite scene: when Julie has been doped-up to do her \\"big\\" scene; she is hilariously high and shows a comic turn that is remarkable. The funeral home \\"set piece\\" is also a riot. Not for all tastes, but for those who enjoy black humor and pointed satire, this is for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S.O.B. Goes Over, Or Under the Top and Bares All","review":"Sometimes a movie appears only to exist for a gimmick. At first appearance this film seems only to exist so that Mary Poppins herself bares her chesties. Not to say it wasn't impressive. This I grant you. But this film is so much more. A horrible bomb when it was released, it is about a bomb that the studio wants to remake into a lavish softcore porno musical. A great cast, sharp writing, and crisp direction give this film bite, edge, and heart. Of all the films that target the big Hollywood system, this is by far the best. It may have been too good for Blake Edwards, because it upset a great deal of important people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good rock-chick album from Jon Bon Jovi's cousin","review":"Aside from the lousy cover of the legendary Jefferson Airplane hit \\"Somebody To Love,\\" the rest of this album is an assured and confident if not commercially successful album full of upbeat energy and well-written, hummable songs. Particularly good are \\"Emergency\\" and \\"A Flower Can't Grow In A Shadow.\\" If this hadn't been released in 1989, it might have done better, but Jon Bon Jovi was so huge at that time that few people probably even knew that he had a singing cousin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinnamon oil","review":"I want the small bottle not the larger one.

I read the book aloud for my boys (age 8-1/2 and 12), and all three of us were bored with it for the first half of the book.The gold nugget wasn't mentioned until chapter 4 and didn't disappear until chapter 7. Therefore only chapters 8 to 11 (the final chapter) actually involved solving the mystery. The rest was just filler about dude ranch activities and hanging out with friends. We're used to Scooby and other children's mystery books where the mystery is established much earlier in the book.On the positive side, the book has an illustration in almost every chapter and a manageable amount of text per page/chapter, which is definitely a plus for kids who are just starting to read chapter books on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuart's Review","review":"Ron Roy paints a coulourful picture of mystery & suspense about 3 friends who go to a dude ranch and discover that someone steals the gold nugget they found. They spend the week panning for gold, chasing down clues and narrowing down the suspects, all guests at the dude ranch.The story is interesting, but the plot was not all that believable, as it is unlikely that three 8-year-olds could catch a world-renown thief. Although this book is written for a slightly younger reader, mystery stories are always fun and enjoyable. I give this book 4 stars out of 5, because it was a bit slow to start off, but as the story developed, I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting to find out what would happen next"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phrenology for the '90s","review":"If you wish learn to identify people's personalities or how they may be feeling or may be thinking at a given moment then his book is a waste of your time and money. The ideas in this book are nothing but pseudoscientific nonsense. The text is full of glittering generalities and vague statements which nearly anyone would agree were true about them, regardless of face shape.

As other reviewers have mentioned, read the works by Paul Ekman and boycott this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"I cannot confirm nor deny the validity of the studies reported in this book. In some ways it appears to be mostly opinion or belief much like in a religion or pshychology. The things reported are generalized but not always true for each individual. However, it is fascinating and has very good illustrations. My favorite section is on body language. I do agree that body language can be an important cue on some feelings.

Are we really so stupid as to believe that people with broad foreheads are erudite and learned?!?I bought this book thinking it would be somewhat scientific but it is not. In fact the author makes no attempt to justify his assertions - he tells you that people with joined eyebrows are likely to be dishonest and you are supposed to believe him. If one made comments based on the colour of one's skin then one would be rightly lambasted.If readers believe that their facial interpretations based on this book are true then they need to read some books on self-deception.I agree with a previous reviewer that this sort of nonsense is vaguely dangerous in that it promotes visual prejudice.

Filled with wondrous color illustrations on almost every single page, it treats the indigenous and exotic wildlife of alien worlds as a scholastic journal, making note of unusual animal features for the discerning Star Wars connoisseur. A grand and elaborate coffee table book, The Wildlife Of Star Wars is very highly recommended for Star Wars fans and science fiction enthusiasts who enjoy a good extraterrestrial bestiary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, about freaking time","review":"I was lucky and just picked this up because the artwork on the box looked pretty good. This was a very good anime, enough said. This is how anime should be. Dark, disturbed, and at the end a good message. Artwork was amazing, music was dead on. Story might have been a little simplistic and the villian was kind of corny, but other than very good. It goes on my best list. And I am sick and tired of the dragonballz, pokemon, types; this is the exact opposite. It is like: Akira, Escaflowne, Neon Genesis. Not like (thank god), Pokemon, Dragonballz, other corny anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, not great bonus features","review":"This is my favorite series ever (relatively).But in this product, the extra bonus DVD with the bonus features is kinda useless. The \\"making of\\" is of the dubbing process, which I didn't really care about. The series were great and the dvd's weren't scratched AT ALL, which is what I cared about the most, but the 4th disc is useless. I wanted to see the actual making of the anime, not the dubbing.

Perhaps that is the moral of the show, but I think it's just bad writing. The violence is painfully tame and the stupidity of Shu borderlines that of comedy. You almost wish that the world he's in should just be obliterated to save us from total boredom. Save your money and purchase a better collectible set. Trigun, Reign, even Berserk has more action and storyline than this waste of dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing exceptional","review":"I watched episodes 1 to 3 and half of 4. The first episode looked good enough to persue the series, but I even neglected to finish watching the fourth one. It is a story in an alternate world which is lacking the essential ressource of water. Everything is very dark: bloody war, insane leaders wanting to \\"bring peace\\" to the world, children in difficult war situations. Maybe it gets better later on, but I did not think there was much of a plot or a point this far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Epic...","review":"If really amazing, Metropolis style CGI animation is what you require for viewing Anime, then, yeah...maybe you shouldn't see this. But I thought the animation was pretty nice, and the story was so engaging and heartfelt that even if the animation was Saturday morning cartoon quality, I would have still enjoyed this. During episodes 11-13, there were many moments that I could not fight off tears...this is some intense stuff. If you like Anime that makes you laugh, think and cry, don't sleep on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draining","review":"This was very draining. At first I found ti very mockable (elements seem to constantly repeat) but as I went on, it really did seem like a journey. The preview for the last episode was just a scene of everybody posing comradely together giving you some hope... which is not to be. Its kinda like Grave of the Fireflies, where you slowly slide into despair, with it punctauted (in Grave, it was the junk food) by something. Seeing it once is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please disregard the other guy","review":"I'm surprised at the canadian that gave this a 2 star. The least he could have done was finish the set before giving his opinion- that is if he did indeed buy this boxed set.I first saw this show on AXN in my country and no matter how unpleasant things got for the characters, I just had to watch it until the finale. After the last episode aired, I just knew I had to get the DVDs.The 3 DVDs are also available seperately, they each have high reviews here at Amazon. Don't take his word for it, or mine.

I have, however, assembled many products using instruction manuals. I found this manual difficult to follow. It lists the assembly instructions in two different areas of the manual and each set of instructions were slightly different from each other. I had the same problem with the alignment instructions. The remote control is impossible to read while it scrolls. I couldn't tell you if the telescope is aligned properly, but we could not see anything with it.

This book follows Daredevil through 9 issues from the mid 70's. During these issues, he fights everyone from the hulk to Doctor octopus as well as his villians like Bullseye and Gladiator. His relationship with the black widow crumbles, and Ben Urich starts to realize his identity. This would be perfect if it weren't for the last issue which Miller just did art on. But the other 8 certaintly make up for it. It is defiently worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian","review":"This is pretty standard B grade comic book fare. Minimal story arcs, mostly relationship stuff with the Black Widow. No Elektra in this volume. The other plotlines neatly resolve in each issue. There's a pretty lame Bullseye story arc in this volume, and then stories with B-grade supervillains like Gladiator and the Mauler. There's a brief Hulk story that doesn't do much and a short Doctor Octopus interlude that is also nothing special. Miller is only doing the artwork in this volume, not the story or scripting. Unless you're a real big fan, this is not a must have volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to temper the accolades","review":"Frank Miller was the creative sage behind Dark Knight and the rebirth of comics. That's fact. Although I was not impressed with the drawing style, the totality of his drawing and writing output in that project was perfect.This is not the case here. The drawing style looks awkward. Many other reviewers have praised the layouts cinematic etc but these were achieved by other terrific illustrators with better drawing techniques. Looks like Miller didn't even write most of these stories. I really didn't enjoy the comic, Elektra was OK, Bullseye was way over the top, Kingpin was drawn too large (at times the size of the Hulk) to be believable.Hate to go against the tide but I don't see anything here that deserved a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"hold more than other paper clips in this price range","review":"Anyone who is even slightly familiar with the industry will tell you these are the best clips you can buy in this price range.

I wanted this version for the hip-hop section. Cardio workout? No, just Carmen Electra trying too hard to look sexy but bopping around like a fool. She has no talent and appears uncoordinated (she has a dance background). The instructional part on the hip-hop is not to bad-a bit simple (could have added a few more moves to learn)-the actual workout is a joke(not long enough to gain any real benefit). The lap-dance section-how do you get fit from that? The background music-boring and a tad old fashioned. Carmen Electra is so into herself instead of drawing in and including her audience. Don't waste your money on making this woman and her producers rich. The only thing about this dvd that deserves one star is the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"I get the point","review":"I get the point that she is pretty and has a stunning body - but the move is tedious and I doubt that this can be a part of exercise.

I am normal and not into that wierd move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not good.....","review":"I just bought this today and was really excited to used it. I work out daily on the treadmill, stationary bike or use my pilates dvd...that was getting pretty boring. I'm an experienced dancer so I skipped the first 3 dvds and went straight to this one. The lap dance dvd was VERY short and the moves were just repeated twice. Not too much to it! Now the hip hop one wasn't bad. I've used some of the moves before in dance team routines and such, but running in place? Sorry, I've never seen that done and it made Carmen Electra look like she was lost and running in circles. I don't think it was worth what I paid for it and I now regret *not* reading the reviews before I purchased this dvd. I'm hoping the 2nd one might be a little more of a cardio workout for me! By the way, does anyone know how to change the music on the dvd?? it says you can change the music for the workout but everytime I tried it went right back to the music it was playing the first time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion... I'm not really impressed.","review":"I wasn't really taken away with this video myself. I had purchased this one along with the \\"Fit to Strip\\" and I much rather liked the Fit to Strip. The FtoS was very intense. The hip hop dance/workout was very easy and not an intense dance. I haven't watched the full lap dance, but I saw enough to know I'm not really interested and wouldn't benefit from it. I know myself just cause I used to be a stripper at one point in my life. It's weight more intense doing the real thing cause you're trying so hard to control yourself from falling on your face or looking stupid for customers. And I'm 23, so I don't think much has changed since then. But no offense to anyone who likes it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weak workout","review":"There is no real workout involved in this low budget dvd.

I thought it still had that but when i put the dvd in i noticed the music had changed, it really didnt go with the work out at all.

She does the lap dance on an empty chair. No lap. The idea is that our audience will watch us dirty dance on an empty chair. I think that's a little odd.Anyway, she breaks the routine into shorter segments and at the end she does the entire routine. It's extremely easy to follow. There is a backbend that might be difficult for some though.You can modify the moves so that they make sense if you dance for a person.I think it's okay, if you need a few pointers in lap dances. I wouldn't buy this DVD. You should only rent it or get the bootleg from your friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURCHASED & NEVER RECEIVED","review":"I placed my order Marched 2, 2009 and a month later I still have not received it.

Usually after discovering that a study guide is full of errors and vague explanations I toss the book aside along with anything else ever written by the author. But I have examined other study guide material written by Bill Ferguson and I am convinced he is a competent instructor.

The fashion show is amazing. There is no person who shouldn't see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Women","review":"This is one of the all-time great showcases for the top actresses of the 1930s. It's written by Claire Booth Luce, and the crackling dialogue & energetic plot are maximized by the direction of George Cukor. Such a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie goldie","review":"The Women is full of great actresses, some funny scenery chewing, and a lot of conniving. Not recommended for any woman who's husband has recently cheated on her--it's too close to the bone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated, hated, HATED it!","review":"First of all, I'm a \\"chick.\\" Second, I love classic old films. Third, I like George Cukor. Fourth, the cast of this film was fabulous. But the plot and characters were INSUFFERABLE! I agree with the reviewer that said this film is incredibly misogynistic! The women are all catty, shallow, heartless bitches -- except Norma Shearer's character, who is a total sap. Much of the dialogue is so rapid-fire and rat-a-tat-tat that you can barely understand what they're saying. The fashion-show scene was way too long, as was the film as a whole, and I especially hated the ultra-schmaltzy scenes between Shearer and her totally implausible, girl-scouty daughter. My husband is generally OK with chick flicks, but I thought he was a saint for sitting through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully the world isn't filled with just women!","review":"I got this at the library and watched it, and it was sort of strange,to see just women and narry a man in sight! And none of these women were real women in my opinion, they were catty, gossipy, busybodies that were annoying...I wouldn't want any of these women for my friend, and what man would want one of these women? Except for Norma, of course. She was the only character who made the film worth watching. This film was worth a one-time watch, but I doubt I will ever watch it again. You just need a man in a movie, in my opinion. The credits were clever in that the women were each likened to an animal that represented their personality and character. I found it a plus to this movie. If you want to see an example of a very strange movie, or if you want to see how horrible this world would be without men, give this movie a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar cast and crew, superbly biting script","review":"My mother first shared this classic with me when I was about thirteen. We have continued to revisit it over the years, with each viewing resonating more and more. Norma Shearer is perfect as the film's straight woman, Joan Crawford is at her catty best, and Rosalind Russell indisputably steals the show. Paulette Goddard's helpless Miriam is a delight. Marjorie Main is a gem as the unabashedly upfront Lucy, and Mary Boland stretches her melodramatic muscles as the over-the-top Countess DeLave. Virginia Weidler and Ruth Hussey, both familiar from The Philadelphia Story, also put in great performances. And Adrian outdoes himself for the film's fashion show, designing some of the most hilarious and beautiful clothing I've ever seen. Amazing direction, production, and performances, as well as the genius of Clare Boothe Luce's stage play as a basis for the script, ensure that you will keep coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem!","review":"The first time I saw this movie I fell in love with it! I highly recommend it to all you gals out there! Joan Crawford definitely puts on a very good performance herself- and in the end.. well I won't spoil it for you- just get your girlfriends together-pop some popcorn and other snacks and laugh, cry, and sigh-\\"they don't make movies like this anymore!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining and Engaging","review":"Holds your attention the entire way through at its 2 hr and 13 min running time. Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford steal the show and Rosalind Russell of Auntie Mame fame gives one of her best performances. I appreciated Cukor's brilliant use of color for the fashion show sequence and some of the cinmatography throughout the film is truly thrilling. The ending is the best part of the film with a comical and fast paced cat fight and Crawford getting her come uppance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous ! Fabulous ! Fabulous !","review":"This is a movie about the lives of a group of New York socialites who's loves revolve around gossip, fashion and the art of being just a woman. Very entertaining, funny and it's so amazing that gossip was entertaining then as it is today in the age of cell phones, internet and tv, we still seek that most entertaining of all guilty pleasures !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth as silk","review":"One of the most flawless of oldies, this movie keeps a pace that is breathtaking. It doesn't baby you - you have to listen as fast as they talk. Even though Rosalind Russell (who I normally adore) can be shrill at times, the performances of Shearer and Crawford alone make this movie worth watching, again and again. It is also visually beautiful given the costume and set design You find yourself mentally coloring in the luscious evening gowns! It's smart, funny and fascinating, a little time capsule as well. Only Cukor could have pulled off dealing with these divas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless!","review":"This film is absolutely timeless! All the reviews have perfectly described what this film is. Its a must for the home movie library! I HIGHLY recommend it. It is SO much better than the 2009-2010 or the latest version of today. I almost purchased it after seeing it and came across the original and so glad I purchased the original instead. You will laugh, cry from laughing and totally enjoy it and the special features included in the DVD are extra special too! Buy it you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original masterpiece!","review":"Excellent movie, great sets, wonderful characters.

This is a classic film with an all-star cast that included many innovations for its time. The review by Jeffsdate shows that this person knows nothing of this history and should do some research. Yes the characters were horrible to each other! They were meant to be! Have you read the play? All the characters are stereotypes. Hence no males in the cast - including animals. And the fashion show was so long because this was one of the first technicolor scenes. I hope that other Amazon customers will give this movie the chance it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Women","review":"The original \\"The Women\\" is funny and the acting by all the women is great. Well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!!!","review":"If you haven't seen \\"The Women,\\" do yourself a favor and see it any way you can - I checked out the video from my local library. I've never been a Norma Shearer fan, but she's good here...however, the movie belongs, in my humble opinion, to Paulette Goddard, Mary Boland, and, of course, Rosalind Russell. The catfight between Goddard and Russell is, by itself, worth the price of the video or DVD. So is Marjorie Main's brief part. Boland is hilarious. Goddard is delicious. Crawford is great in her part. Shearer, in keeping with the times, is a bit stilted in her role, but she plays it well, anyway. The dialogue is fast and kicky and great fun. The clothes are beautiful. They just don't make movies like this anymore!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a vision of love that is wonderful","review":"i have watched this movie over and over again just to capture and enjoy the rhythm and cadence of the verbiage tossed back and forth.....it's musical ......lycrical...comical......and thoughtful.....these women are catty, political....fight against their feelings and ultimately can't help but show what they're feeling by trying to hold back or in trying to manipultate others.....i see my mom in these gals...their love for family....wanting to be the showgirl of the times for their love...and yearning for what it means to just be while being the ultimate \\"woman\\"........cukor is a genious......and the woman in this film deserve a standing ovation......roses.....and many hugs from anyone who can appreciate their strength and honesty in the feelings they offered us in this film........."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Men Allowed","review":"Overall a good enjoyable movie. I was slightly disappointed thinking that Joan Crawford was the star of the movie. She is given second billing, however she is really one of the co-stars, this is Norma Shearer's movie. Joan has a lot less screen time than the star, however her character's impact is felt throughout the whole movie. What is really interesting about The Women is the fact that there is not one man seen on screen. The whole movie centers around relationships with men, but no man is seen, what a novel concept!"},{"rating":"2","title":"black and white doesnt matter","review":"even though it is in black and white doesnt take away from the outstanding casting and feeling of the movie. if you have the recent remake of this movie and liked it you will love the orginal more. highly recommend it. now i know why my mom hunted down for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"dish the dirt with flair","review":"Being a huge fan of the stage play by the same name,the movie version is equal in it's fun and wit! If for nothing else, the fashion show (in color in a black and white film)is worth the price of this DVD! Ms. Russell and Ms Crawford are at their best as well as the rest of the cast. At times the script seems hokey and dated, but that adds to the charm and period in which this film was made.This is a must have for anyone who has close friends that they love and hate at the same time!!! This is camp at it's best without being campy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I love old movies but I found this one to be particularly annoying. It was extremely long and slow-paced and I found most of the dialog to be rather agitating. I've seen other old movies like this so I know that it was just the style of movies made back then but I can't stand to watch them. I sat through the entire movie and thought, \\"this is definitely one for the donation box\\". Like I said, I am a big fan of old movies, just not this one; I actually prefer the remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Reno divorce movie","review":"A fun Reno divorce movie.

There were some very good questions, some so good that they were slightly rewritten and repeated. I found the charades part to be impossible. I have seen every show at least four times, so it wasn't that I didn't know what they were talking about. The charades were just too complicated to perform without saying anything. In addition to the many mistakes in grammar and spelling, one question in particluar proved to be a huge disappointment. The questions is simple: \\"Name the six member cast of Friends.\\" I think we all know the answer to that, but sadly the answer on the card is incorrect. They failed to include David Schwimmer! Hardly the trivia challenge I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game for a true Friends fan!","review":"This trivia game is great, if you have seen every episode 50 times like me then its easy. I give it 5 stars on fun and only 1 star for educational because its not educational unless you are trying to learn Friends stuff. I think it is so fun to play this game. So I recommend this game to everyone. But dont buy this game if you have only seen a few episodes or one of each episode, you need to be an expert like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated","review":"This game was not what I expected. It is too complicated. We didn't even play the game because it's so hard to understand how to play the rules. It is not worth it.

I suggest making your own game up with the cards, like a drinking game or something similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh, they suck","review":"I really feel sorry for anyone who bought this album. This music is very boring and predictable, more of the same metalcore. Metalcore is the worst! Manntis are only popular because they were on that Battle for Ozzfest show. All that show was was a 'metal' version of American Idol. This band was made on TV with pretty much no effort made on the bands part at all. They made it because their guitarist can show how cool he is, and I guess he succeeded. CenturyMedia and MTV must have some secret conspiracy going in relation to this band, which is a shame, because CenturyMedia usually puts out quality albums on its label."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DEBUT FROM A GREAT BAND","review":"All i have to say is Manntis was cheated on battle for ozzfest, but it doesn't really matter, since there on a better label then the winners ADF!!! this album rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not my lucky day","review":"When I read the back cover I thought that the premise of the story would lend itself to an amusing read. I was prepared for the plot to be a bit on the lighterside with clever and witty dialogue. Unfortunately, light does not begin to describe the silly and at times mind numbing stupidity of both the characters and the plot. Witty was nowhere to be found. The book did have some scenes that were intended to be sensual, but even they were rendered ridiculous by the authors unceasing use of cutesy euphemisms. Before long I found myself skimming and skipping through the sillier passages, and then skimming and skipping through entire pages. The author's halfhearted attempt at intrigue was a classic case of way too little, way too late. All things considered, Luck may have been a Lady, but she was also a complete waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is totaly unpredicable!","review":"This book has you almost falling off of your seat. Just when you think that everything is over you find out that it has just begun. One thing that I like about this book is that there is logic behind everything that happens.

You will be hard-pressed to find an SF fan who will tell you that 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous With Rama, and The City & The Stars are not three of the best science fiction books ever written. And the reason, is simply because they ARE three of the best! Each one is a masterpiece in it's own right, the kind of future story that could only have come from Arthur C. Clarke. No one else could've written these books. That's not to discount the other two stories in this collection: The Deep Range (which is a good book about the sea (not space!) which a very poetic ending), and A Fall of Moondust, another ACC classic. If Amazon ever gets this book back, be sure to order it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer ... the book is a good size in pages only ... what is on the pages is a waste.

For those of you who don't know, Anglicans are Episcopalians in the U. S. It was recommended to me by someone in my Old Testament class. The reason I bought the book is because there is a liturgy in the back which can be used when removing life support from someone who will pass away not immediately, but soon. There is a service for the Burial of the Dead in the Book of Common Prayer and also for Ministration at the Time of Death. The liturgy in this book would cover the situation when removing life support will lead to death, but not instantly. I bought it because there is such a situation in my family and felt having some prayers and readings at the time would give comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry reading on a necessary topic","review":"This book, put together by a panel is mighty dry reading - kinda like unbuttered popcorn. Alas, that's a common problem with a report or study put together by a committee, no evidence that any of the panelists has a flair for writing. As with the other reviewers to date, I feel the book provides much needed help on the issue of one's faith on facing and addressing death; especially death under trying circumstances--life support, hospice care. I'd have found it helpful if there'd been some discussion on coping with the death of youth or young children (grief issues are especially critical) and the matter of a child dying before elderly parents, again an especially hard grief issue and test of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"Each event is glossed over so quickly that if you blink you'll miss it. The best parts of the opening and closing ceremonies (such as the T-Rex's) are omitted. I wanted to throw it in the trash seconds after I started watching it. (The commentator's narration is particularly grating.)If you'd like a DVD with good coverage of figure skating, get the \\"Salt Lake 2002 Figure Skating the Competition/the Exhibition\\" two DVD set (oddly enough, also produced by NBC). This set, while not perfect, includes the entire routines--complete with original music, commentary, and audience reaction. It truly recaptures the magic of the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best (but only) Video Scrapbook Available","review":"A moving tribute to the games; however, I would have liked to see more event footage rather than just event highlights and those sappy human interest stories. Costas's voice is fine as narrarator (he's got my vote for the sequel too, if he wants the job). If NBC heeds the call for a follow up (\\"More Olympic Highlights\\" or \\"v2002.2\\") it would be great to see:-more behind the scenes footage (perhaps never before aired).-what it was like to be there: to obtain tickets and to attend an event (including traffic, bus rides, and security).-scenes from the olympic village (athletes quarters), and olympic square/medals ceremonies (downtown).-clips from Jay Leno's hysterical late night coverage (including \\"Ross the Intern's\\" live reports).-medal award ceremony pagentry, awards, and concerts.-and full coverage of sporting events including opening and closing ceremonies (even if it requires a boxed set)."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 Days in 90 Minutes","review":"This could have been a pleasant enough souvenir of the 2002 Winter Olympics. It is not surprising that each sport is given a miniscule amount of time, with only a few seconds each devoted to the opening and closing ceremonies. It is not surprising that, whenever possible, the producers acted as if only Americans were competing in each sport. What IS surprising is that the producers chose to underscore almost every second of the documentary (even the figure skating!) with cheesy synthesizer music. Go ahead and get it, but be forewarned. And the bonus footage IS well-done."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad compilation","review":"I expected this DVD to feature some complete events and it didbut it was not the original, had its own music over it and just plainly... For example, the pairs skating of both the Russian and Canadian teams, yes they were complete, but it wasn't the one seen on TV with the music that they skated to with the commnetary. It has music over it and was extremely dissapointing. If you want to remember the events for the way they happened, this DVD isn't the way to go"},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"It tries to cover as many events as possible but does neither justice. I also feel that it was done in such a manner as trying to be as 'politically correct' as possible as they seem to go out of their way to minimize the Americans presence in the games. They also barely mentioned any controversies.I bought it hoping that it would cover the games from a historic perspective and give the viewer a feeling of being there. It did not mention the venues in any great detail, the city or state, or the hard work of the locals. It did not mention the commradery of the competitors that comes along every few years. It did not capalize on the thousands of feet of footage available and barely even touched on the limits of the DVD format. They told the story - but only at an arms length. Even interviews with were in the 'bonus' section of the DVD.What a waste! I'll try the figure skating tape (which is what I'm interested in). But on VHS?

Janet Malcolm is an excellent writer and there are some nice pithy aphorisms in the book. Unfortunately, this short book does not go into enough depth to resolve Ms. McGough's guilt or innocence. In essence, the reader is asked to trust Ms. Malcolm's instincts as to who the con artists were in the story she describes. I would pass on this book as it resolves and illuminates nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frustrating Book","review":"There was a good book in here somewhere, but I found the author's point of view toward the main charachter frustrating. Either offer more analysis of her poor decisions or tell us some more facts to make the reader more sympathetic to the lawyer. But the way the author left it, I felt the lawyer seemed unsympathetic and some of her actions without enough explanaton/justification/analysis to give teh reader some perspective.The story is somewhat interesting, which manages to carry the book, but the writing left me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing; drab reading","review":"Honestly, I did not even waste time finishing this book (short as it is).

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her typical work","review":"The idea of the book was intriguing (truth rests not on objective standards but on competing narratives and our evaluation of the plausibility of those narratives), but unfortunately, Malcolm chose a dreadful way to demonstrate it. As she noted repeatedly, none of McGough's legal contacts had much interest in her story, and Malcolm did not succeed in making me care, either about McGough or the issues at hand--an ironic case of hoist on your own petard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Biased Writing By a Fine Author","review":"Having been interviewed by Ms Malcomb for this book, given that I was personally responsible for the plight of her protagonist, I can say with certainty that she has really missed the truth of this matter. I have read and like a number of her other works, but this book simply ignores by omission the fact that Sheila McGough went to jail for very good reasons. There were many others who were defrauded by her, and it is no fluke or prejudice of our system--as Ms Malcomb avers--that she was found guilty.For a fine author to have been hoodwinked by Ms McGough shows how good she really was at getting other people's money for her criminal boyfriend. This would only be qualified as bad journalism were it an article, although it may be well written. On this case, however, Ms Malcomb just got it wrong--and in a book which is suppposedly relating a true story this is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvation Blvd.","review":"What a stupid movie!

You are far better off spending the extra money for an 802.11g WAP (54 Mbps versus 11 Mbps).Unlike other WAPs, this device can connect to another WAP and act as a bridge. If you have two Ethernet networks and want to connect them, it is relatively painless with this device. That was my original rationalization for buying this product. Turns out I never really needed the extra functionality.I was never impressed with the 10 Mbps speed. The first time around setup was painless. However, reinstalling the software under XP became problematic. The USB driver/software from Linksys caused my Windows XP machine to blue-screen and crash. It caused my Windows ME system to hang periodically.I would recommend you pass on this product and get an 802.11g WAP. They are faster (54/100+Mbps) AND backwards compatible with your existing 802.11b network cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"About what I've come to expect from Linksys..","review":"..good quality at a good price. I've never had a problem with any equipment I've bought from Linksys, and the WAP11 is no different. Setup is as simple as a wireless LAN can get. Initial setup is done through a USB connection. Once the access point has an IP address, you can ditch the USB cable and do all configuration through the included SNMP utility. Performance is also excellent. I have a D-Link DWL-650 Wireless NIC in my laptop that I use with this access point, and I am able to access my network from almost anywhere in a 2-story, 3000 sq. ft house, even when the signal has walls/floors to travel through.

But I came home from vacation and its not sending out a signal anymore. The WAP11 connects to the LAN fine, but none of the laptops are getting any signalfrom it. Tech support was laughably inept. Now I've figured out the reset button doesn't actually do anything. They want me to upgrade firmware a third time. DSL Reports.com says there's a problem with the latest firmware.

I asked my brother if he could see the wireless network and connect to it and he was able to. I didnt have to change any of the setting, worked right out of the box!Ofcourse I wanted my network to be secure, so after around 5 minutes of playing around I was able to totally secure my wireless network so that only my brother would be able to log on.

This is far below their rating of 11 mbit/sec and much worse than the 4 mbit/sec I get in a similar setup with my Orinoco gear.After an unfruitful 1 hour session with Linksys tech support ended with them blaming the wretched performance on \\"microwave oven or air traffic control tower interference\\" I returned the units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for version 2 of WAP11 and WPC11","review":"I'm finding the rating from other reviews of this product a little inflated. Wireless products from other companies must be really bad if someone would rate these products with 5 stars.

If you need a serious wireless product then wait for version 2 or buy Cisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAP11 Limited","review":"I am disappointed with this product. I bought an early release, in March 2001. I found the manual to be poor and the technical assistance poorer -- often I had to keep calling until I got lucky and I found someone who knew something. My access point is about 40 feet from my computer (although it is down one flight) and my connection is always weak. Recently, my connection has often been too weak to work and Linksys has not been able to give me any help diagnosing the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"overated range","review":"I give this product a two star because it is easy enough to set up.

Sometimes returned on its own after a few minutes, sometimes requires reboot/restart, and once it never came back. Dealer replaced unit, which exhibited similar behavior. Apparently, just my guess, noise (RF, line, Ethernet) got interpreted as bad data and it gets lost trying to process it. New firmware (v 1.07) made it worse. Tech support is clueless, and one of them suggested using a competitors product: NetGear MR814. I have no doubt the WAP11 works well in a quiet environment. Version 2.8 is supposed to be better, they say...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy set up, poor performance","review":"The configuration was simple. Just left it as it was coming out of the box. I used the Linksys card in my portable W2K computer. The operational distance I get is the only problem I have with this product. If you are with 30 feet of the unit it works great, but if you move beyond the it becomes useless. Linksys does not officially support any other antennas that will provide better gain. Other companies do. So if you are thinking about sitting out at the pool, with this box in your office, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, Just OK, not if you want customer support","review":"For the price, I guess its good. but connectivity was very bad. I could not even a good signal strength in the next room. I had to reload the access point every day. Support (waiting on line for over 1 hour with them) told me I should upgrade the fimware, which I did. Then everything went crazy, Linksys would not retain my configuration or IP address. So I called support and they suggested another file. still same thing. so finally fed up and returned it and got a netgear mr314 (which was the same price as only a access point, on sale), which so far has no problems and gives better range. I go outside my house i stilll have signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid wireless network solution","review":"I use this wireless hub at work with 9 Wireless laptop cards and have no complaints. Setup is pretty straight forward (really simple in Win 2000 as you can swap out wireless with standard PC network cards). Also since this product utilizes the 802.1 standard can easily be integrated with other wireless solutions (we use ours with another wireless hub from Adtron as well).For a home application however you would be better going with the switch version of this as you would get better multiuser performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"First one Died after 13 months, Second one has problems","review":"I could kick myself for buying another one. The first one just quit after 13 months. The second one has been nothing but trouble. The node locks up every 2 days. I use to always get 11mb/sec. With the new one I get either 1 or 2 Mb/sec. I downloaded new firmware to the device. No improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"I've had this product for a few days, and it's going right back into the box it came in and being sent back.For one, the device needs to be rebooted once a day, or the clients will lose the signal. I've tested this on both Windows2000 and Linux clients running two different Orinoco Gold Cards.Second, the signal strength isn't even close to the advertized specs. I start losing signal about 30 feet away from the device, with a clear line of sight!Third, support is non-existant. I've waited on hold for over a half hour to be disconnected.I think the only reason they set the retail price so high is so it'll compare with Lucent/Agere and Cisco solutions price-wise. Some people believe that a high retail price constitutes a good product, and this access point will prove otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable installation makes this product useless","review":"Threre are two ways to configure this device - one via the USB port and the other via the network port. Both methods failed.The USB drivers under Windows 2000 SP2 caused repeated blue screen of death. Even when Win2K booted up it reported that the driver had failed. The latest drivers from the website didn't help.The ethernet port (SNMP access) reported the WAP wasn't installed.Linksys' website doesn't help. So I am returning the unit today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless really does deliver!","review":"We were about to get cable internet access and had more than one computer we wished to share that internet with. How did we solve that problem? We bought a Linksys wireless Access Point router and wireless USB receivers for all our computers.Setting up the Access Point was not easy. (If you have Windows XP, it will be very, very easy. We didn't.) After a call to their tech line we were in business. I also had trouble installing one of the USB connectors to one of my Windows ME computers. After installing XP on that computer, it connected right away.Connection is near always 100%, sometimes dipping into 97%. The router is in the middle of the house, and it reaches all computers in the basement and the second floor with perfect connection. Cable speeds are as fast as when the computer was hard wired to the modem.I really do recommend this product to anyone setting up a home network. We're all sharing the internet, printers, and files on our new Linksys wireless network."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research before you buy","review":"Be sure you know exactly what you need before you buy when it comes to Linksys products. Just because it is \\"wireless\\" and conforms to the 801.11b standard, doesn't mean it's going to be compatible to other Linksys wireless products.

When I upgraded to Windows ME, the only problem I had was with the Linksys card. Neither phone support or email support has been able to fix the problem. Email support rarely returns any messages, and if they do, all they say is they are working on the problem. I have four computers and a laptop and all were working decently on the network before upgrading to ME - not good, just decently - but what is so discouraging is the lack of support.

Software installed ok & got it to work. The problem is that the WAP11 has no useful range. As long as you are located in the same room and have \\"line of sight\\" with the WAP11, it's ok. If you go out of the room, or any way get out of the line of sight, even the next room, the signal quality goes to poor and the link drops. I have regular, normal wood and sheet rock walls. Packing mine back up for returning...doesn't work as advertised. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Performance","review":"Well, the performance decrease of 50% when using this product almost made me send it back. The customer support sent me over the top....it's non-existent, little help and hard to get hold of....Several others that I know have also since complained of the speed performance. Even if you disable the wireless acess the performance is very much impared when in use, as compared to being just attached to the cable modem directly.It was easy to install and get going. Not sure yet if it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super product for Average users like myself","review":"It was running before I knew it.

However, the computers wouldn't connect. When I tested with a script that pinged the computers across the wireless connection I had 90% packet loss at 3 feet! When I moved the computer from the office to the living room I had 100% packet loss and 26 percent (\\"poor\\") signal strength - only two rooms away!Email to technical support went totally unanswered.So I can only assume that this product is a joke and that linksys will put out a real product soon and apologize for ever shipping this thing.

My biggest complaint is that the maximum signal range that I got from the Linksys Wireless \\"solution\\" was about 30 feet through a single gypsum wallboard wall; nowhere close to the advertised distance of 164 feet at 11 Mbps indoors. I spent far too many hours moving the WAP around the house and switching channels attempting to achieve a more acceptable range.

Please do yourself a favor and check with your ISP, odds are they don't support Linksys (and with good reason)..

I repositioned the WAP11 in 3 locations...no luck. I have heard that the Linksys WPC11 PCMCIA (in my laptop) card is horrible when it come to walls...maybe that's the problem, except I also read on someone's website that they had opened the WAP11 and found a WPC11 card inside of it!!I hope they increase the power of this unit...until then, I'm returning this one.Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally buggy - a popular choice for no good reason","review":"I can't stress how much stress this device has caused. It seems that it's going to do the job properly and then insidious problems creep in that get worse and worse until everything goes horribly wrong.Terrible support and worse companion products mean that this access point will cost you more in sweat and tears than any other piece of electronics you may own - and it's unlikely to get better due to this area of gadgetry 'moving on' to new faster standards.Advice is - if you want to stick to cheap and cheerfull 802.11b hardware - avoid linksys kit like the plague and keep doing your research to find a good alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 1 1/2 year","review":"Linksys WAP11 worked flawlessly for about 6 month, then it started to drop communication about every couple of days, then it just gradually gotten worse. Before it went completely dead on me, it was dropping communication with my PC about 1 minute after I reset the Access Point. All I could say is that I am not pleased with Linksys products since it is my second Linksys product that went out of commission shortly after the 1 year warranty. I am not sure if I'll buy another Linksys product, but I really like the fact that WRT54G has lots of third party support to add features to the factory build firmware. Naah...I won't give Linksys another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wireless access point","review":"This WAP11 was very easy to install (took 15 minutes total) and the speeds are excellent. I use this item with Linksys' pc card for my notebook pc. Together, they were easy to install and work like a dream.

Granted, it is downstairs, diagonally opposite my office: however, I thought that \\"indoors 150ft\\" implied through walls. Not sure if changing the PCMCIA card will help, but I am willing to try.Installation was also difficult, particularly for a novice like me.

(PC Magazine actually praised their setup routine, so take my comments as you will.)In terms of range, I was VERY disappointed. I got good performance, until I moved my computer more than five or six feet from the box. I tried changing channels, repositioning the antennas, etc., but didn't have much better luck.

Well, it didn't work, I walked from his house to mine with my laptop in my hands. The time I had reached the street on my friend's house drive way, I lost the signal.

His use of parentheses is so extensive it makes me wonder why he didn't just put everything in parentheses and be done with it.

I don't think so...","review":"Initially, these were the most comfortable slippers I've owned. However, after five days of use, the so-called 'memory foam' insoles are now flat and hard. If these slippers were made with real memory foam I suspect the insoles would have remained soft and cushy for at least a couple of months. But five days? Not good. The main positive is that the upper part of the slipper that covers the foot remains comfortable. For buyers purchasing these slippers online, I agree with other reviewers that they run a bit small. I wear a 10.5 shoe but needed the 11-12 size for a comfortable fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable but questionable quality","review":"I have had Totes slippers in the past and have found them to be the most comfortable.

I kept waiting for it to arrive, and then finally, after 15 days of waiting for this package, was told that it had been on backorder, with no notification of this fact. It finally arrived, 4 days before Christmas. It was a gift for my son, and when he tried them on (2 pairs of slippers), they did not fit, even though he was currently wearing the same style numbered slippers, same size, and they fit perfectly.

It does not have the bended metal. The holes in the mounting plate do no match the holes on the ends of my UU610. More over, because the wheels overlie the mounting holes, they would get in the way of the support beams and accessories. I compared the part number and it is indeed the same, but this item looks like it was made for some other stand completely--maybe the UU610CZ (similar looking but smaller). It did say \\"warranty part\\" on the box and did not have any instructions. Also, it only came with two mounting bolts despite the pictured kit having 4. Too bad, the pictured kit looks like it would fit my stand exactly. The mounting holes on this one are just too narrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE, IT DOES NOT FIT!!!","review":"Unless Amazon can assure you that they have replaced their part 726215 they are shipping, with the wheel kit shown, you are wasting your time.

Because of his comments, I blitzed Amazon about it before ordering, and got a polite but lame third-world reply saying they could not check to make sure it was the one pictured.

The only drawback to this dvd is that Judith Krantz's intro is boring and doesn't add anything. It's more like her personal reminiscing about several of her books and telling you what you are about to see. I had hoped it would be more like anecdotes about the taping, special features with interviews of several of the actors, something amusing. She was just enamoured of herself. OH, and there is a lengthy review of what you just saw at the beginning of each section and a preview at the end of each section. It's like they left in the TV commercials.

Of course not but it would be better if I could watch it through like an actual film rather than feeling like I'm watching TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ARTIST'S PASSION","review":"To me, someone who doesn't normally watch miniseries based on Romance novels, the chief value of \\"Mistral's Daughter\\" lies in its music score, penned by Vladimir Cosma. While I don't think much of Mistral as an artist (he's 10 times better than most 20th-century artists--which is not saying much) or of his morals, the music that underlies his creative moments is truly exceptional. I know of no other theme that so fully captures the GLORY and PASSION of artistic creation--it is lush, it is thrilling, it is unforgettable. Rachmaninoff would have been proud of it.(Unfortunately, the most extended passage of this theme has been cut from recent TV showings.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Not a great novel at all, and not satisfying to someone looking for fiction concerning poker in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"If you are expecting to buy this camera.........BE VERY CAREFUL.....when a chip burned out on my S7000, after only 3 yrs, Fuji wanted $170.00 ro replace it and would only stand behind it for 3 months!!!!

You would think while researching various names of expensive teas to include in the book, she would have also read the proper descriptions for Cream Tea and Afternoon Tea and no, High Tea is not the kind where you eat finger sandwiches and scones. Anyone who knows anything about English afternoon tea knows 'high' doesn't mean 'fancy.' I wouldn't ordinarily be so persnickety about it but if you're going to call a book 'A Tea Shop Mystery' for heaven sake, know something about it!As for the murder mystery?

Forget about a coherent plot! The book just ends, the killer is unmasked by accident, and Theodosia as usual flounders from suspect to suspect without ever coming to any conclusion.

I had to force my way to finish it since the plot was so uninteresting. I didn't care about finding the murderer because there was no sympathy developed for the victim. The major characters in the series, normally fun, were annoying. Drayton moped throughout the book, Haley whined and complained, and Theodosia was too busy running around going to fashion events and hosting teas that solving the murder took a back seat. Even she was apathetic! As for Theo and her boyfriend, this is not exactly the romance of the century. They are more like brother and sister. I doubt that most women would consider being called \\"kiddo\\" by their boyfriends a term of endearment. By the time the murder was solved, it was anticlimactic, and I was just glad that the book came to an end. This book did not have the cozy charm that the others in the series did. Those who like this series can skip this entry and hope that the next book gets back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful escape","review":"This series of Tea Shop mysteries is refreshing.

It was very hard to get into the book and want to continue to the end because the story just wasn't interesting. The reader doesn't get a sense of who the victim was, so it's hard to feel sympathy for the person. The murder part of the story really took a backseat to all the distracting social functions that Theodosia, the heroine, had to attend. The supporting characters, normally fun and three dimensional, were boring, whining, and morose throughout the book. Theo's relationship with her boyfriend, Jory, still doesn't progress. They are more like brother and sister. The magic of the earlier books simply isn't here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"A little too deep reading for me so gave the book to a friend.

I am more into bands like Taking Back Sunday, and Incubus, just a little screamo music. But, this CD is amazing. They lyrics are so crazy that you have to listen to the song five times in a row just to be sure what you thought you heard him sing, scream, or growl was what it really said. The music is amazing, great guitar and they actually let the bass player stand out in some songs, unlike most bands nowadays. Overall, This CD is one of my favorite of all time. I cannot take it out of my cd player except for maybe once a week, then it goes into my portable cd player so I can listen to it as I go to bed. Buy This CD.

As I was saying this album rips, there is no need to exhaust myself by explaining what it is, let's just say... post-hardcore/hardcore (emohardcore?) or is it hardcore emo?

I bought this CD off of hearing the E-card, and it seemed promising.....they had the energy, and the sound. but ooooops i bought the cd and was completely thrown away from what the rest of the album actrually panned out to be. First off the opening song is good, it starts the album with their energy, and i do like the song, but then it all goes down from their. The rest the album seems to draw away from the energy from the first song. Every song just seems to bore me. I know that Rock/Hardcore is cool, it keeps a good pase, and i am a big fan to listen to it....but this band just dies down without anything different. the point is, I've heard this all before.....i've tried to give this album many chances, but its just bad clash of Every Time I Die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vapor Transmission part 2 !!","review":"I am shocked to see so many bad reviews of Punk Static Paranoia. \\"A stale Linkin Park clone?\\" (see other reviews) Please, are you kidding me? This album is the rightful successor to Vapor Transmission. Yes it is only 9 songs, but there is very little filler here. Candyass is awesome, and when Vapor Transmission was released, it left me wanting more. This latest release answers that call. If you are on the fence about getting PSP, I would not hesitate! Anyone who thinks that Orgy has lost it needs to get their head checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Terrible!!!","review":"I really enjoyed Candyass. I thought it was kind of a throughback to the 80's as far as the beats and synth is concerned. Then there was Vapor Transmission which was not as good, but still a decent effort from the band. But WTF?! It's like, lets see how much we can sound like Korn or something. This album is like nu-metal garbage. I am not a fan of nu-metal, but this album doesn't even sound good for nu-metal. I respected Orgy until I heard this album, they were doing something different up until now. This album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two letters: N-O!","review":"I used to love Orgy, it was definitely one of my favorite bands. All of that changed now, and for a good reason. There is no way I would concider purchasing this album. For one, they kept us waiting YEARS for some new material, and when they finally come out with something, they make it a 9 effortless track CD. The songs aren't that good, and Jay's voice wasn't meant for screaming. Even the cover art of Punk Static Paranoia looks cheap (and, aren't those the fonts that Korn used in their \\"Issues\\" album?)... and quite frankly, I'm tired of looking at guys wear make-up. Too bad though, they used to have great talent.Don't buy it, we have enough wannabe metal bands out there, this is just another one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost their own sound","review":"I'm glad i listened to samples before buying this pathetic album. Is not as if we have enough want-to-be so called metal-rap bands who all sound the exact same. Orgy was an awesome band when they had the Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson like sound and i could name that tune in two notes. This album was just a disappointment and a 90 degree turn in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third time is not a charm","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Orgy's first two albums Candy Ass and Vapor Transmission but what the hell is this. Did they even think that they would possibly get noticed by the mainstream? Nu Metal already died for the most part. What better way to drive your fans away than to give up and lose your originality. Good job guys for giving us a prime example of sucking up and selling out. Lets hope your fourth attempt, if there is one, will possibly bring back some credit you once had."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad to say...","review":"I must say I tried to be optimistic at first glance of the cover. Yet by track 3 I had to face facts... Orgy fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into a horrible place. I am extremely disappointed, having been a complete fan of the first album and even somewhat pleased with the second. It's weird that they haven't learned their lesson after \\"Vapor Transmission\\" I mean obviously they had a larger response with \\"Candyass\\". So why start rapping and screaming when gorgeous melodies and a well-structured chorus got them where they are. I find this album on its way to e-bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is orgy?","review":"I mean really, this is NOT Orgy. They used to be the best out of this world electronic futuristic rock band alive. Now they are... just another metal band. Screaming? EXTREMELY disappointed. Every song reeks of change and a change that was definately for the worst. If you liked the old Orgy (first two cds) don't even consider buying this album. If you want just another metal band then this *might* suffice as a lower quality one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected release","review":"PSP is sort of disappointing. It's nothing like their early stuff. there are 9 tracks altogether. the instrument sounds are dope but the songs are terrible. on \\"vague\\" you hear the better side of orgy. this song is not that great but is a much more realistic song for this album. on the letdown \\"leave me out\\" there's this intro that sounds like a beat from some whiny boy band which was unbelievable. what were they thinking?\\"inside my head\\" might pass for a good song you hear on the speakers while shopping at express. this one isn't too bad.the rest is dumb, especially when jay raps in part of the first song."},{"rating":"1","title":"This always happens","review":"Every band moves on from its original sound and that is expected if the band was creative in the first place. But Orgy moved some where far, far away from their old sound that the older fans enjoyed. Just by looking at the CD cover I knew something was wrong and your not saposed to judge a book by its cover but dear god this [STINKS] Move on if you liked them before. But your pre-teen baby bat, punk, or emo wanabe siblings will love it. Buy it for their birthday. Honest. Your parents might love it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Bunny","review":"Prior to buying the CD I read some very mixed reviews of the new material which did fill me with a little doubt.. but I have to say I was glad that I picked it up. P/S/P is a more accessible direction for ORGY and a warmer sound than on the previous CD, yeah it's a bit short (considering they've been away for so long) but you know what... it leaves you wanting more, and that means it never outstays it's welcome! Full marks guys... a very promising revival! Now get to the UK with DOPE and POWERMAN 5000 and I'll be a happy bunny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Well. I had hopes for this album. I wasnt entirely let down, however only a few songs on this album even approach what Orgy have accomplished in the past. I would like to write a drawn out review analysing each song, but I dont feel that its worthy of the effort.I feel that a band may evolve, but that true evolution is an outgrowth of prior efforts, and that naturally outbranching will occur. Screaming and forsaking of past electronica influences almost entirely are NOT a natural progression from their prior efforts, but simply an effort to tailor to a larger audience. Lyrics are more straightforward, and some will argue that this makes them not worse, just more accessible. And yet it was Jays jaded, sometimes metaphorical offerings that made his lyrics stand out and endowed them with a certain odd joy when listening.Candyass remains their masterpiece, with Vapor Transmission close behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"What happened to Orgy sounding original? I really like their style, and am a fan of Candyass, and to a lesser extent, Vapor Transmission. But this stuff is so far from compelling it's ridiculous. A lot like Korn's new album, Take a Look in the Mirror; it sounds like they've run out of steam and are reaching for the sound they think \\"nu-metal\\" fans want to hear. Look, if you don't have any new ideas or the courage to travel in new musical directions, just break up. Stop embarassing yourselves, and more importantly, fans like me.No style. No substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Digital\\" Disaster","review":"Orgy has had two good albums before this disaster was created. I personally was waiting for a new Orgy album since 2001. It took them this long to create something so horrible. From the first track up to the ninth track it's really really bad. Orgy went from the so called \\"Death Wave Pop\\" sound to a horrid nu-metal sound. Honestly, the only thing I liked about this album is 1 sentence in a song. That's it. Not even a full song. So unless you're fond of Nu-Metal, don't look into this album. Get the first two albums. They are better. Don't buy this and expect this to be all synthy, a little vague and science fiction'y."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suppose it was inevitable","review":"*sigh* It seems to be a trend with good bands lately. What with Powerman 5000 abandoning their sci-fi theme, and now Orgy abandoning just about everything that made them what they were, it will be a suprise if we have any good original artists left anymore by 2010. Not that this album is pure trash, because it really isn't. It just further proves one thing: don't mess with a good thing. I won't be suprised if this album is the end of Orgy's career, which will be quite saddening indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame.","review":"this album still upsets me and is about as far as anything orgy should have came up with for a third album. my advice? stick to candyass / vapor transmission. i always admired jay gordon and his gang... but gordon seemed to take over the psp with his anger and immaturity. but not all is lost, if you are interested in something close to this genre and their musical members... be sure to look out for \\"julien-k\\"... they're the latest and greatest thing. i'm sure jay gordon will continue to bless us with amazing vocals sometime in the future as well, so hopefully that'll keep us on our toes...oh and if i had to give this album any stars at all, it's because amir, ryan, bobby, and paige are such fantastic musicians.... they deserve all the glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree","review":"the band has almost left what made them unique and cool to listen too.the drums,gutar,the dark sounding melodys are all but gone this is something I didnt expect from orgy and when it took so long,its not there best."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like the cover","review":"well to tell the truth i was worried about this cd release. i am a big fan of orgy's first two albums and i saw a month or so ago on a local radio station's website that orgy will be releasing punk statik paranoia on feb 24. that was the only advertising for this cd that i had seen, and in addition to that, the first and only time so far i have heard their new song \\"ashamed\\" on the radio was the day before its release. So i was a bit worried but as a determined orgy fan i picked up the cd anyway.The reason why i only gave the cd four stars rather than five was for one reason: its too short! only nine tracks? but nonetheless those nine tracks do stand out very well, i just wish they put a few more on the discoverall the songs on the cd are fantastic and fit orgy well and i definitely recommend the cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it brought me to tears","review":"I have been waiting for this cd for a long time....a really long time. Finally on 2/24/04, the wait was over. Let me say that it was TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!! Although it only has 9 tracks, it is just as long as many other major releases.Orgy lost the make-up but haven't lost the style and flair that made them famous. I HIGHLY suggest getting this cd, you will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?!?","review":"Some bands are able to make a kick ass debut album that leads to more good albums. Orgy is not one of those bands. The originality, melody, uniqueness is all but gone. This album(if you could call it that) is not good for several reasons. For one, It only has 9 songs and clocks in at a lil' over half an hour(the last one was way longer). You think they could write more than that in 4 years. The songs are mediocre and bland. They dont have that awesome synth melody behind the guitars anymore(so what's Amir doing on this record?). Its all typical, worn out nu-metal riffs. The lyrics arent interesting either, they are dumb and very repetative. Jay does try to scream on this one, which is ok I guess. He even gets a lil' rappy at times, which is not ok by Orgy standards. I gave this album 2 stars b/c it does surprisingly have its good moments. This is not a nice review I know, but the evidence is on the record. This album is going to be the permanent end of Orgy's career for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears to my Eyes","review":"What happened? Can someone please tell me what's going on? No wonder Ryan and Amir have Julien-K.And yes, if you know Julien-K, you know what that means. Where did all the dazzling synth-guitar parts go? Where did all the v-drums go? There is barely any of their electronic roots at all on this album. They definately have turned their backs on everything they were about.This album is nu-metal. The lyrics are so insanely horrible. Look at the lyrics Orgy used to write for their songs. They were all so akward and clever and just down-right awesome. These are sobby heartache songs. I don't understand how you do that.What happened to Orgy? The only good songs are Vague and The Obvious. That's about it. And please don't scream Jay. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orgy died","review":"I enjoyed Candyass and VP and was excited to hear they put out a new CD.......yeah. Well, the new record is terrible. Musically, they have turned into another nu-metal band. Lyrically, they have turned into another nu-metal band. Jay Gorden writes cliche' lyrics that are not clever and the rest of the band plays mediocre music. They have lost their uniqueness.Then again, some people seem to really like this record. If you enjoy bands like Linkin Park, new Korn, Staind, and bland nu-metal bands, this is the record for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk Static Dissapointment","review":"To begin I must say that I liked Candyass and deeply enjoyed Vapor Transmission. And (not to seem like I'm comparing this album to those cd's) Punk Static Paranoia for an Orgy fan such as my self was a huge let-down. It has been four years since the last album and when they do return, they are singing colorless, boring, and poorly written songs. The sound is different, something similar to Linkin Park, but still with the Orgy/synth-pop-rock sound. The new style isn't that bad, but it doesn't feel genuine at times (and it ends up sounding silly). Don't waste time with this cd unless you are a big fan. The best thing about the new Orgy cd is that it was released, making Orgy fans hopeful for future releases/tours. Sorry Orgy, maybe next time.Support your FavoritesThank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh oh.","review":"Although I haven't been an Orgy fan for too long (2 years), I still think I'm entitled to say that Punk Statik Paranoia was less than good.I read someone else's review and they referred to the newer sound being somewhat similar to that of Nine Inch Nials, which I think is way off. Orgy definitley sounded like NIN on Candyass and still a bit on Vapor transmission, and to be honest, I really love Trent Reznor's music. But on PSP they edged away from that, their dark apocolyptic cyber goth sound gone for good.As for the album, I heard \\"Beautiful Disgrace\\" and thought I had put a Linkin Park song onto one of my mix CD's by accident, literally. I understand that Jay helped out with Reanimation, but Linkin Park's sound should stay theirs and Orgy should really dust off the synthesizers and bring back the industrial."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORGY!!! for ever.","review":"YES!!!... Orgy is back again!. I must admit that I had the chance to hear some songs over the internet, so I knew what to expect, but it still was great to hear the songs with high quality digital audio. My favorites: 1) Vague... 2) Ashamed... 3) Can't take this...Seriously, it is better than Vapor Transmission (and that was good too!). Bottom line: Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One big anticlimactic downer of an album...","review":"Having been a HUGE fan of the first 2 Orgy albums, I, like many other Orgy fans flocked to the store to grab the new one as soon as it was out... what a disappointment. The only word I can use that accurately describes this album is anti-climactic. Every single song comes dangerously close to rocking... but I found myself unfulfilled at the end of each song. A chorus is rarely heard on this compilation... a good hook is also missing through most of it as well. Jay rambles like a 12 year old throwing temper tantrums... they nu-metal screaming thing ...... Jay had such a good voice before... perfect for the music style... now he's gotta pretend to be hardcore... ugh... stay away from this one folks... it ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"It still hasn't left my cd player","review":"I knew who Orgy was but the only song I ever heard from them was Blue Monday. I went out to buy this cd two weeks ago and haven't stopped listening to it. I love Jay's voice on it and (despite what other people may say) I think he has a good screaming voice also. Punk Statik Parinoia turned me into a big fan of Orgy. It does sound different from their previous cds but a band's style eventually changes right? I think that this was a good change."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen?????????","review":"This album is the down fall of the band. I loved Candyass and Vapor Transmission. I seems as if Jay Gordon is trying to hard to mix in with the mainstream with the other punk rock wannabe bands out there. Please bring the gayness back Jay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars? You're obviously obsessed fans in denial","review":"This album is horrible. I mean excrutiatingly bad. It IS nu metal crap that was clearly manufactured to appeal to a wider audience to make as much money as possible. All of us fans who have been waiting this whole time got screwed. I, for one, will no longer be supporting Jay's drug habbit. They've clearly lost it. This doesn't even vaguely sound like orgy and Jay's vocals just get worse with each album. I find it appaulling that even the reviewers on here that admitted it wasn't that great gave it 5 stars. Wtf people? Everything that was cool about them is gone [i.e. electronics, make up].This is the biggest buzzkill ever.There is no way I can convince myself this is acceptable, let alone, worth listening too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Orgy","review":"Orgy is currently my all time favorite band, they only put out 3 CD's, and I have all 3. Kidneythieves, The Birthday Massacre, and Demon Hunter are also on my top favorite band list. I'm currently vetting Kylie Minogue, who, I read, went diamond in Russia. I also like With Sympathy by Ministry, The remasters of Billy Idol's first 2 CD's, and I recently ordered Move Like This by the Cars, (I haven't found a reasonable deal on the remasters of The Cars first 3 CD's yet). I also recently ordered 13 by Megadeth, I own 7 other Megadeth CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"travel that goes nowhere","review":"I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book. Yes, the author travels (though this book is more driving writing than travel writing), but other than brief descriptions of a town he passes through, or the empty field next to the road he's on, the majority of this book is just boring anecdotes, and remarks on his own assorted works, which he mentions quite frequently. If I wanted to read LONESOME DOVE, i would have bought it. He almost never stops driving, he doesn't talk to anybody, and on top of that he chooses to drive some of the world's most boring stretches of highway. This kind of travel and this kind of writing do not suit McMurtry's storytelling style. Do us all a favor Larry and leave he road trips to the college students . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"very strange","review":"Very strange \\"travel\\" book; McMurty's admits his prime goal in traveling is to cover mileage, he puts in ten hour driving days- covers 600 miles a day, sticks to interstates, rarely talks to anyone, soaks up no local culture, visits no museums or cultural targets, eats and sleeps on the interstate. Very boring, banal, tedious. Why would anyone write this? Why would anyone publish it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Asa","review":"You get to meet the real person, Larry McMurtry, who comes off as a sour and self-absorbed bore. Perhaps the title of this book should have been \\"All the Places I Hate to Drive Through in America\\". I expected a more pleasant ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry's Depressed","review":"Seems McMurtry, after producing some ponderous epics, like Lonesome Dove, has declined to penning quick, non-fiction little tomes to gin a few bucks for his wallet. Don't get me wrong, McMurtry is one of my favorite authors, but Driving America and his biography of Crazy Horse, just don't come up to his earlier standards. Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen nearly slips into the catetory with Driving and Crazy, and only some frequent good passages helps McMurty keep his nose above the water line. Driving and Crazy Horse are thin soup for the price. I thought McMurty's Driving would be a great sequel to Michael Paterniti's Driving Mr. Albert. Not so. Paterniti drives a five-speed stick with 300 horsepower by comparision."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more about McMurtry than the road","review":"This short and interesting non-fiction work by Larry McMurtry provides additonal insight into the author's mind and experiences. I recommend reading \\"Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen...\\" before reading \\"Roads\\". I think that provides a better context into what's going on with the author at this time of his life. He seems to be trying to tie up literary loose ends before he stops writing. I like his musings but really miss the fiction, which I'm afraid he won't write anymore.The other value in \\"Roads\\" are the references to some of the classic travel books of all times. Also, I highly recommend driving U.S. Highway 281, a great highway that runs through Archer City."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nomad with a mission","review":"This book was my entertainment on a recent trip to Northern Cal and Southern AZ during Thanksgiving week (in 2004). Mr. McMurty has a slightly different motivation for road excursions than most. He focuses on things most of us overlook or tire of, e.g., the open vistas driving through the Great Plains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please","review":"The book has an interesting premise, ie the author's thoughts while roaring along selected interstate highways. And, it has its moments, but not nearly enough to justify your spending time reading it. McMurtry should be ashamed at writing what is so clearly a shallow book to make a few dollars based on his name. Reader beware. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange, but wonderful","review":"This is not your normal travel book, but about 50 pages into it,i marched out into the garden, threw it in my mothers lap and announced it was time for a road trip. so the van is getting checked out and we will take off soon. this little book has a strange quality about it. it not a love song of the road, it lacks all the criteria of a \\"true\\" travel book, and somehow you can't put the damm thing down. having a roap map nearby is very helpful, authors should have to put maps in travel books! be warned, you could be throwing gear into your van and taking off too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the diary of a lonely man.","review":"Mr. McMurtry is a very introspective man, and American roads are intimately connected to his soul. In these roads he sees his past, which he contrasts with the present, sometimes drawing fabulous analogies. Our roads are the rivers of the past. But my overall impression of this formidable book, is that Mr. McMurtry is sad, and even though that might not have been his motivation in writing this book, his sadness comes across very strongly. It is a good book, despite several editorial errors that should have been caught by his legendary editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roads, roads, and more roads.","review":"Larry McMurtry's book Roads is perfectly titled. His book is a nine month adventure of the wonderful highways and byways of the United States. He takes us through almost the entire U.S. of A. All the while throwing in little interesting tid bits here and there. Each place he visits he knows of at least one famous author from the town. He has a vast knowledge of towns, perhaps because he has visited each one multiple times. However he does, his travels take you on a peaceful journey, for the most part, from town to town. He also takes the time to mention many of the museums you could visit if you followed the paths of Larry McMurtry, many of which sound intersting enough to pay a visit. The book has an overall good and peaceful feel to it. A man on his journey through the U.S. with nothing but his rental car, a TIME magazine, and the open road all equal to a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have kept the car in the garage","review":"McMurty's book looked promising, as literary travel books of a personal nature usually have an interesting point of view. In this case McMurtry totally lost me with his aloofness and lack of any kind of insight. He travels huge distances on the interstate and other roads and appears to see nothing. He is so miserable and self-indulgent that he might as well have stayed at home and written the same book. Now Paul Theroux is as miserable as they come sometimes, but I devoured every word of his adventures. Not so here, Roads was a very disappointing read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Larry Bother?","review":"I am a very big fan of a) Larry McMurtry, and b) Travel Books of all kinds. I hated this book. Anyone who travels 1500 miles in a day and a half is not observing the road nor its surroundings, and is therefore not able to write about it. I got so sick of 'I passed near Anytown Texas where Danny Deck did such and such in my book Blah Blah', 'I was droving through Mississippi when I thought of an amusing story about Eudora Welty and William Faulkner'. Do not waste your time or money on this...publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Roads","review":"The moment McMurtry gets \\"on the road\\" his lack of passion or even interest in the roads that he traverses becomes obvious. \\"ROADS\\" is a haphazard mutt of a book: it is part memoir, part book review, and part history of America. He does not stop for anything, except the occasional burrito at a gas station or night at a Holiday Inn. Since he is not exploring, the scenes are long, usually tiring commentaries about events that have happened in the towns that he passes at seventy miles per hour. McMurtry's love for the plains occasionally shines through, but ROADS is otherwise lacking in the perfect storytelling that made him famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why leave home, Larry?","review":"I don't understand why McMurtry felt it was necessary to leave his Archer City Bookstore to wander the highways of America. He doesnt' stop to see anything of any interest, doesn't talk to anybody, eats at predictable tollway fast food stops, sleeps at tollway motels and makes most of his observations at a speed in excess of 80 miles an hour. Most of the time he is simply using the places he whizzes past as a launching point for his insufferable ruminations. Couldn't he have done this from the comfort of his own home? If he wasn't a famous author he never would have got this tepid travelogue past the receptionists desk at the publisher's office. To me, McMurtry makes life on the road a grim and mundane prospect."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love OS X, but be wary of the server version","review":"my advice is to make sure you need it before you buy it, but if you know you need it, then buy it. How will you know? If you need it, you would already know that you do. If you don't know that you need server version, then you probably don't need it. Most day to day tasks are done by the normal version of the os in ways that are much simpler than the server tools. Now you do get a variety of nice things with the unlimited client, such as server managment systems, monitoring systems, etc., but if you are just doing a basic install without a complex networking or users/groups system, then you probably should try to do what you need to do with a 10.1 or 10.2 and see if you actually have to own the server. I would say the ideal application of a server install is for a medium to large lab install using netboot, where the actual cost of doing it via server will lower the TCO significantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and enjoyable recording","review":"This is one of my favorite Rasputina albums.

You can only view the clock with the radio off, and when off, the face doesn't illuminate.

Since they failed to mention the mm of this eyepiece, it should come as no surprise that Meade also fails to mention the use of filters with this eyepiece - neutral density or variable polarizers (which is nice to have for lunar observation), or Light Pollution/Broadband filters for deep-space observation (which is a must-have if you live in/near the city).You may very well be able to see some deep space objects using this eyepiece with the proper filter - I have no clue yet.

It wasn't.I saw a preview a few years ago of a movie called \\"Not Without My Baby.\\" The preview was so upsetting that I didn't see the movie, although I'm sure the movie was gripping and thought-provoking. Part of this book reminded me of that upsetting preview and was hard to read. I'm also not sure that the changes in the characters' desires and personalities rang true. Yes, there was some great sexual tension, but all in all the book was quite disappointing.I look forward to reading more of Jane Porter's books - hopefully the next one I read will be more rewarding like the other two I mentioned above.

He smokes 'opium cigarettes' and hangs out in a complex Thieves' Den called Smith's Kitchen in the heart of London. The police of three continents seek him and he laughs in their faces! This is 1930s hokum at its finest and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this kind of escapism and hasn't been able to find any more good examples.

Save it for something written by Robert Solomon or Martha Nussbaum."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This was a giant waste of money. To much work! I would not recommend to anyone very poor quality too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"Not a good product at all. Horrible design, flimsy. Only used it like 4 times and it broke. Oh well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I was concerned that it would be delicate since it is plastic. This is not and it works very well!!! I have had it 1 week and have used it 3 times! Family is amazed at how they can eat carrotts and not choke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really give 2.5 stars but it won't let me","review":"Like the caption says I really give it 2.5 stars, not 2. It's not hard to use and it works but it doesn't exactly do what I thought it would. I thought it would make spaghetti-like strands instead it makes curly fetuccini (thin strips) which is not horrible but I can basically do that with a potato peeler for 3 bucks. I was going to return it but I am stuck with it now because some tomato juice got on the long pin and ate away at the fake metal veneer before I realized it was there and had a chance to clean it. Should be priced at 6 bucks, I know $17.00 is not a lot but when you include shipping..I just feel it's mediocre for the money spent. Also annoyed with Amazon b/c I was supposed to get free shipping (yes I know they don't care and are not reading this) on my multi-item order which was over $25. I will gift this to some poor college student raw vegan and look for a better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"Wow, what a waste of money. It's just a piece of junk. Does not work well at all. It is quicker and more attractive to slice by hand. Don't waste your money. I'm sending this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Changed By Manufacturer - Not what it used to be","review":"I purchased a Joyce Chen Spiral Slicer last year and loved it for making wonderful angel hair \\"pasta\\" from zucchini, in fact I loved this gadget so much I recently bought six more to give as gifts to family and friends. Was then very upset when I opened one of the \\"new\\" slicers and tried to use it only to discover that the manufacturer had changed the unit and replaced the metal shredding blade with a plastic \\"blade\\". I believe they may have had liability concerns about the sharpness of the metal blade but the problem with plastic \\"blade\\" is that it isn't sharp enough and just makes mush instead of the lovely \\"pasta\\" it used to make. I tried it several times using very firm zucchini and it was a mess each time. I wish they'd go back to the old model since this one just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Saladacco","review":"This is so frustrating. Some Saladaccos come with all metal blades, like it should. Mine, on the other hand, came with a plastic shredding blade. The Saladacco creates beautiful spiral slices, but it also can make thin strips from those spirals with the additional blades. Well, my additional blades are little plastic rivots...It can't even shred a zucchini. My mom bought 2, 1 came with the plastic piece, the other with the good metal piece. WTF? And there is no way of knowing which you'll get! The metal one is great. The plastic one sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy kitchen tool","review":"This spiral slicer is easy to use & makes perfect raw vegetable \\"angel hair pasta.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had not bought this","review":"My friend had bought the Saladacco spiral slicer, NOT Joyce Chen's and she loved it. I thought I was purchasing that also, but got this product instead. My husband and I both find it very difficult to manage. Forget the fact that the veggies have to be cut to certain lengths, etc. The main thing is that the teeth that cut the veggies to make them into thin angel hair \\"pasta\\" only make an impression in the zucchini, and cut them rather thick. The plastic housing is difficult to get apart, and after once in the dishwasher, there was rust on the metal pieces. I wish I had not bought this and only hope I can get my money back so I can buy the one that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought Two - Both Broke","review":"We bought our first about two years ago, and loved making angel hair pasta out of zucchini. However, after about maybe five dinners, the angel-hair attachment broke off, and I was unable to use the machine except to make the spiral cut (not into noodles). Flash forward to this spring, and we purchased a second one, at the advice of other raw food enthusiasts. We wrongly thought that maybe our first one was defective. So we took a chance. What a disappointment! It broke the same way as the first, after one use!!!! I am now shopping for a quality product that does the same thing. Do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome while it lasted, but it didn't last!","review":"This spiral slicer is just what I had hoped it would be when I got it. Raw zucchini noodles are fantastic & filling. This tool will certainly help me reach my goals in 2012 of eating more veggies! You do have to cut your veggies to size to fit in the slicer. I can't speak to how long this slicer will last, since I just got this for Christmas. But the price is right on Amazon compared to other \\"Raw\\" sites.I'm back to update my review, as my slicer has broken! After about 5-6 uses the plastic that holds the blade in place has crumbled away! This slicer is useless now :( I'm looking for a better quality replacement hopefully in stainless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"makes great potato nests","review":"I bought this at a kitchen boutique and paid $30. Wow, that was not a good move.... It is cheaply made and looks like it will probably fall apart shortly. And what happens when the blades get dull ????Its 1 redeeming feature is that it will make very thin potato strands which can be deep fried into tasty potato nests.... its an easy and interestingaddition to a plate of fried chicken or barbeque...We tried to make potato chips and they were a disaster... either way too thin or they came out in a really odd shape...I would suggest one of the other non plastic models .... and I learned it pays to do your homework on any product and not go for the impulse buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get it to work!","review":"Hi, I need help! I cannot get this to work correctly. I've tried to make spirals with beets and with carrots. They don't come out spiraled, rather in bits. Am I doing it correctly? I bought another at the some time to give as a gift, but don't want to now because I can't get it to work! I'd like to send them both back.Thanks, Kathleen"},{"rating":"1","title":"half the people don't like it , me among them","review":"Compared with the \\"spirooli\\" or \\"World Cuisine Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer\\" or Benriner, this is balky and hard to use in a class of finicky tools.Hard to center and demands short firm trimmed chunks to begin to get it right.Julienne blade is plastic and hard to position.thickness is non adjustableIts advantage is being compact and for potato and apple slicing it does ok"},{"rating":"1","title":"More trouble than its worth","review":"This product is cheaply made. One day I hope I will learn how to handle this finicky product just so I don't feel like I completely wasted my money.

It changes the flavor of veggies.(ie. beets and carrots) Yumm!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and avoid this!","review":"AA real disappointment, this spiral slicer is cheaply made and fails to perform reliably and adequately. It can be used best on large chunks of such vegetables as carrots, zucchini and cucumber, but forget about smaller or slender pieces, or small vegetables such as radishes, which it just can't seem to process at all. It also produces a great of waste. You also have to be careful that it doesn't come apart in your hands as you turn the crank. While it does (when you can get it to work) produce pretty strands and spirals (it has two different settings), its reliability and limitations make this a poor choice for the consumer. You'd be better off investing in a good-quality mandoline or a food processor (or purchasing an affordable Microplane grater)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially, a disposal problem...","review":"What a piece of junk! You'll do better with a box grater. I payed around $7 for this from a clearance table at Linens and Things. Can't believe MSRP is over $30. What a rip! The real japanese garnish makers are quite pricey(over $50). If that's what you really want pay for the real thing. This one is simply a waste of money at any price.Would give a negative rating if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad driven me to write a review","review":"I guess if all you ever want to spiralize is zucchini your OK, partly. I was very excited to get this to unyuckify my raw food dinners. First night I cut up my zucchini, used it without trouble and had a great set of noodles. Then I put the second piece in. A piece without skin on the top and all this thing did was make circles in the top of the zucchini, didn't spin it at all. A bit disappointing but still had a plate of noodles from half a zucchini. Next night I got a little crazy, tried a piece of butternut squash. This thing totally failed AND the plastic grippers that are supposed to hold the veggie BROKE OFF so now the whole top is useless and I have to spin my zucchini by hand until I replace it with a unit that works. Place your expectation for a good product elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, too.","review":"I almost didn't buy this slicer because of all the negative reviews. But I got it, pulled it out of the box, READ THE SHORT & SIMPLE DIRECTIONS, and was making gorgeous zuccini pasta in five minutes. I think it's well made, sturdy, easy to use, and quick. I had two huge plates of zuccini pasta within fifteen minutes (includes time to make the sauce). It's my new favorite toy. I don't know what's up with all the other bad reviews. Worked fine, immediately, for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for raw foodists","review":"I really love this tool because I'm a raw vegan and I can make cool pasta noodles made out of zucchini. I can also make \\"chips\\" from other hard vegetables. It works nicely, but you definitely need to learn how to use it, otherwise it will feel like a cheap toy that never did what you wanted it to. I was frustrated when I first tried to use it, but now that I know how it's a dream to make noodles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spiral slicer","review":"Joyce Chen Sadadacco Spiral Slicer is a wonderful item to have in your kitchen if you are into raw foods or enjoy using it for slicing.

I've used other spiral cutters and this one won't do it. The blades are too short...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"New to raw food and excited about making zucchini \\"spaghetti,\\" I bought this item at the recommendation of several people. You need to have great strength to push down and turn the handle simultaneously; the food needs to be \\"perfect\\" as far as how it's cut, the length, width, etc.; there is always big chunks of food left over. They say you can use any fruit/veg as long as it's the right size, but cucumber just makes a huge, gloppy mess. Big regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, broken, blade was very inconsistent at cutting","review":"One plastic tooth broke during shipping, the screws were stripped and would not properly assemble, instructions were terrible and the blade does a horribly inconsistent job of cutting noodles! Some have to be pulled apart by hand, and certain softer or more water-filled vegetables will not cut into \\"noodles\\" at all.Buy the spirooli instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a lot of work and very little to show for it","review":"I am really looking for a vegetable slicer to give me those thin strands that look like spaghetti, but this one is WAY too much work...if anyone knows of a solid vegetable slicer, like the ones they use in restaurants, please post!

I have never, ever seen such a piece of junk that doesn't come even close to doing what it says it can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money, get a spirooli instead","review":"I bought this spiral slizer and I regret it completely. I have never ever gotten consistent results, even with much practice. It really just shreds your food rather than creates spirals unless you can find picture perfectly shaped veggies. You have to cut the veggies to a precise length for them to fit. There are two settings, one for slices, one for \\"spirals\\" and it keeps popping back and forth between the two settings so you never get anything consistent. If you push too hard it fails, if you push too easily it fails. It is really a useless piece of junk. I finally spent the money for a Spirooli and I am much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I know this gadget has gotten some mixed reviews. I love it. It is easy to use, easy to store and makes incredible speghetti strands. The drawbacks are, and that is why I gave it 4 stars, it is a very simple gadget. Even though it is not the sturdiest piece,it works great for what it is intended to do .I only use it to shred zucchinni and potatoes, and it does it easily in seconds and the clean up takes less than a minute. So, I highly recommend it to make no carb pasta from raw zucchini and easy to shred potato strands to cook for potato pancakes ( much easier and less messy than grating) Also, your hands never get dirty. Take it for what it is, a simple helpful gadget. I consider it one of my best gadgets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saladacco Spiral Slicer","review":"It's not quite what we thought it would be, the quality is not the best, it will not withstand lot's of spiraling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Zucchini Pasta","review":"Despite reading some negative comments about how cheaply it was made, I purchased this item anyway, and am glad that I did.

Buying this was the equivalent of throwing $20 in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Spiral Slicer is Awesome!!!","review":"I love using this to make zuccini noodles with marinara sauce or buttered creamed sauce made from pine nuts and cold pressed olive oil! This spiral slicer is extremely easy to use and I like the fact that I am using my bodies energy instead of electricity!!! I highly recommend this to all of my friends who are interested in making \\"noodles\\" from vegetables instead of processed wheat which is harder for your body to digest. Enjoy and be creative!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no, no!","review":"I was told it would make hard vegetables, like squash, into pasta like strands. It sort of makes little, almost hair thin, strands within a larger one I could have used a regular vegetable peeler for. On my first use, about 6 of the little pegs broke off of the round disc into the squash. This product did not do what I thought it would do and is easily breakable. I would NOT recommend buying this product. Mine is sitting in the back of my cupboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLS APART AFTER 1 MONTH AND IT'S RUSTING!!!","review":"I'm very disappointed in this slicer. It is VERY cheaply made! After only a month of occasional use the blade just fell out and won't stay in now and it's rusting in spots (where the metal is of course). I am beyond disappointed because I need it for my new raw foods lifestyle. I didn't mind that I had to hand wash it or cut my vegetables in half to use it but now it's rusting and useless because it's falling apart! BUY A BETTER MODEL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saladacco spiral slicer","review":"I have to complain about this product. I've had mine about 6 months and purchased it specifically to make zucchini angel hair pasta....which is about the only use for this very cheap plastic item, and unfortuantely I paid in the $30 range. I used it tonight again, and yes there's a rediculous amount of Zucchini I end up using my grater for because of the limitations on the size of the piece this unit will hold. I've tried using this unit about 15 times and it's been a struggle every time, and tonight a piece of plastic in the upper turning unit broke. I plan on dumping this very poorly made item and investing in a substantial, and yes much more expensive, but reliable vegetable spiral unit. I do not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The Joyce Chen spiral slicer is useless.

Both front & back covers show quilts in bright, clear colors. But inside the book itself, all photos of the quilts throughout the project pages are very poor; they are very dark, nothing like the cover photos. When you \\"Look inside this book\\" on Amazon, the photos on the inside of the book are not available for viewing. If they had been, I would not have purchased this book. The paper used inside the book also is sub-standard, not the quality at all of what I am used to finding in a quilt book. The publisher is C&T Publishing but the book itself was printed in China. Is nothing made in the USA anymore??????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peachy!","review":"I certainly agree with the reviewer who said this peeler performed awesomely on peaches.

The serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. Also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers.

That never happened before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"time saver","review":"I used old fashioned way to peel bell pepers:burning the skins and cleaning mess after, so I gave up peeling them completely.

It removes the peels easily on some things I was never able to peel properly before. I even used it on kiwi-fruit and it did an awesome job.For fruits like peaches, nectarines, and apricots, it just makes peeling a breeze. And I also love it for things like very thin-skinned potatoes (like red potatoes or Yukon Golds).I wouldn't want to ever have to again make a meal without having this peeler available in the kitchen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"This peeler certainly did not perform up to expectations. I had several pounds of ripe peaches to peel and this peeler just got stuck in the flesh and did not peel nicely. The teeth dug in to the soft flesh and tore out huge hunks. What a waste of nice organic fruit. I attempted to peel two different peaches, then gave up and went back to a simple paring knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Meghan White is one of the best dvd instructors out there.

It releases the back and the psoas muscles.As far as the overall, this is great! I love it. Right now I've been doing the 30 minute Mat exercises and I sweat hard where drips fall off of me!

Bill Nighy and this high calibre cast were just right, well suited to their roles. I was expecting more screen time for Rachel Weisz, Judy Davis and Mr. Gambon.

I knew something might be askew with the show when Michael Gambon exits early on. Also, Bill Nighy is asked to play a manniquin type character with utter and complete flatness for the entire show. I disagree totally with the positive reviews. The writing is dull and the director (also the writer) fails to narrate a rather simple story.

However, the way in which it was presented left it somewhat unactionable as most of the content focuses on desired results and expected emotional responses rather than on details of how to make an effective transition to this organizational style. The book is strewn with examples from companies that have \\"made the change\\" and talks about how they improved profitability, morale, and retention.

It contained many typos and the standard of grammar was typical of that expected from a primary school pupil.The messages contained within this collection of poems portray Christianity as a violent and uncompromising religion, which is clearly inaccurate and offensive to those of the Christian faith. Many of the messages conveyed by these poems suggest that Christianity is incompatible with democracy. I for one consider this to be fallacious as Christianity has survived and indeed flourished in many democratic nations i.e. the United States, where many Christian organisations are free to spread the message of god without interference from the government etc.I believe that this collection of poems is best avoided as there are many good alternatives, which give a much more balanced view of the Christian faith without the typos and schoolboy grammatical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality poetry","review":"The quality of the poetry was very poor and the messages conveyed within it distort the values attributed to the Christian faith.As a Christian myself I have always seen the faith as one that preaches tolerance and forgiveness of the sins of our foes etc. The messages conveyed by this collection of poems are contrary to Christian faith as they support the idea of revenge and the use of violence to convert non-Christians. These messages are somewhat decadent in that the idea of intolerance and violent conversion has long disappeared (since the crusades in the 12th and 13th centuries and Spanish conquests of Latin America in the 15th /16th century) from the faith.I concur with the first reviewer who stated that the standard of English used was very poor.I have to say that this book is best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This poetry book was sadly lacking in all aspects. The poetry was dull and the content varied from puerile to religious extremism.Like most reviewers, I found the poems rather repetitive. I got the impression the author was trying to inspire a Christian 'backlash' against the Jews by reminding them of the Jewish complicity in the murder of Jesus Christ. One or two poems were slightly strange in that they were completely irrelevant to the Philippians e.g. there was a poem about sexy women.Overall, I must say that Kim has disappointed me with this book since I expected a lot better from a student studying a Ph. D. in Hebrew, Jewish and early Christian studies at Jesus College, Cambridge. As a fellow Cantabrigenarian, I have to say that this work is not typical of the academic standard at Cambridge. It is more in keeping with that at APU. Please avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"After reading a couple of Kim's poems I became so board that I almost fell asleep. The poetry was so dull and failed to inspire me at all.Kim seemed rather confused at times as the idea he tries to put across changes mid-way through the poem. I found a few of the poems didn't make sense; perhaps Kim had just learned English so he found it difficult to translate them from his native language. Kim presents a rather extreme Evangelical view of the Christian faith as mainstream; some Christians may find this offensive. Kim seems to promote violence and intolerance in these poems, which I feel is not in keeping with the Christian ideology.As a first attempt at writing poetry in a second language, this wasn't a bad attempt. The reason why I give the book such a low mark is that the author claims he studied for degrees in America and Israel. If this is true, his English should be flawless and this collection of poems would represent a very poor attempt at writing literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poet commentator par excellence ha ha ha ha you're joking!","review":"This is one of many Christian 'Dim' poetry books that fail to live up to expectation.

I advise potential readers against purchasing this predictably boring Christian 'Dim' poetry book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Poetry Commentary!","review":"This is the most refreshing commentary on the book of Philippians I have read in my life. H. C. Kim is clearly an expert who has a grasp on the New Testament. What's more, his commentary is relevant to today.

Little ridges on the bottom caused some worry for me at first, thinking sauces would stick and accumulate in them but this pan has proven itself 3 times in the last 3 weeks. I had to get a different lid (the kind that fits any pan) to get a good seal as the locking lid has holes in it that cannot be closed. I would like to see that added but definately not needed for straining pasta.I had hoped that getting a bigger pan would make it easier to cook my large meals but I seem to have ended up increasing the size of my meals to accomodate the larger size (smile). That's okay as I love leftovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumping for Health: A Guide to Rebounding Aerobics","review":"I have to disagree with the one review listed here. I found the book to be quite informative. It discusses the phyisiological benefits of jumping -- including muscle toning, better posture, lymphatic cleansing, stress reduction, anti-aging, increased balance and coordination, improvements in vision -- and more. I have no idea how sound the medical information is in the book, and actually, I'm not reading it for that content. Intuitively, I sense the it's got to be healthy no matter what the medical details are. There are a total of 33 illustrated exercises graded from basic to advanced. I'm 51 and I'm doing the exercises in the book. My muscles are toning nicely and there's no doubt in my mind that my posture is improving and I'm healthier all around. The book is a pretty good guide in getting started gently. The advanced exercises are a real workout. I recommend the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinging to the past","review":"Diner was a good movie. Avalon was a great movie. Tin Men was a very funny movie. Liberty Heights was a bit repetitive after Diner and Avalon, but good.Sixty-six is purely retread of already covered ground. We know Levinon grew up in Baltimore and we know he feels a very strong connection with it. But Levinson waxes so nostalgic about the power of Baltimore and the diner, that it bleeds into overkill.If you've never seen his movies, this book may appeal to you. But for those of you picking up this book because of his movies, he already put most of this book into his movies and this attempt at pulling a Forrest Gump here and having the turbulence of the 60s unfold around these diner folk seems added on.Character development here is in the form of dialogue and repetition of phrases here is grating.Mr. Levinson, we understand, you enjoyed your time growing up in Baltimore. Great, we're happy for you. Got anything else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel or Memoir?","review":"When I discovered this book in the library I was very excited. After all, I love Levinson movies, and Baltimore was my second home. I visited my father in Baltimore from my mother's home in NYC once a month for about 18 years. Of course, I came of age about half-a-generation after these characters.Unfortunately, the book reads not like a novel, but like a memoir. As Neil quotes Twain in the book (and I paraphrase) \\"the difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to be logical\\". Well this fiction is too logical, too crafted, too contrived. I guess I don't believe that, in a true novel, these characters would have all these unspectacular and predictable misadventures.Some of this reaction stems, I'm sure from knowing Levinson's background and having seen his movies.I look for spontanaiety in a book. This book has no surprises.I give it 2 stars for the Baltimore nostalgia, but overall it is a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A La Carte tracks for the first time on CD","review":"Finally Coconut Records decided to release A La Carte tracks on CD.

It has decent acoustics, however it is CONSIDERABLY heavier than a Littman, and does not even come close to the Littman quality of sound. The earpieces also come loose in about 2 seconds, and you have to tweak the stethoscope as you listen to get a good seal.

I find I much prefer the latter! Not that there isn't some philosophizing going on, but the power of the arguments derive from the poetry and the emotions. This is incandescent writing, and I wanted to share practically every paragraph with my friends - and in fact there will be several Christmas stockings stuffed with this little book this year. My only disappointment is that, although she makes a case for an emotional connection to place being as important as our attachment to family, she doesn't seem to come up with a prescription for making that connection more universal in our sadly disconnected world.

This album missed the mark in both respects. Chris has an average singing voice that doesn't offend the ears and Herb hits some good high notes.

Unfortunately, the side affects are monstrous- quite literally, thus begins a \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" story for the modern age.Pro's: I liked the film 'noir' setting. The cool costumes, and the acting.Cons: I just didn't like the Quentin character. Perhaps if he'd been a more likeable guy, I would've felt sorry for him.

I had hopes for Akroyd due to his work in previous Horror/Comedies and even a few dramatic performances. Unfortunately, he and all the other actors play it for high drama.

Cooley will learn, one hopes, that it's not such a great idea to have characters launch into soliloquies of self explanation, over and over, as a way to advance the story.

But I ended up hating this book and was barely able to finish it. This book tries to cover too many things, including the Holocaust, the life of a weird librarian, his \\"relationship\\" with a student, and his crazy wife who is now deceased. Everyone in the book is obsessed with the poet T.S. Eliot and snippets of his poems are scattered throughout the book at random and awkward moments which ultimately detract from the story instead of enhancing it. Cooley has an abstract philosophical way of writing which I found extremely annoying. The characters are too involved in their own selfish worlds and were completely uninteresting. Terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Archivist","review":"Martha Cooley's first novel is definitely accomplished, but I found the middle third of the book to be quite arduous. While it had at first seemed wonderful that the characters were T.S. Eliot fans, it soon became annoyingly pretentious when they quoted Eliot to refer to events or emotions in their lives. Particularly harrowing was the middle third of the book which is a seemingly endless series of journal entries from a manic depressive? woman who quotes Eliot without cease and obsesses over the holocaust and her lost heritage. This section could definitely have been re-worked. The central \\"mystery\\" of the novel, if it can be called that, is very unengaging and I felt utterly deflated by the end. I resold the book the first chance I got. The concepts were interesting, as was the smooth prose style--but the parallels being drawn between the lives of the characters and that of T.S.

A black (or Hispanic) male gets out with a gun and tells the female lead to get in the car. Of course he calls her a b**** and uses the gun to keep the hero (who happens to be white) at bay and kidnaps the beautiful redhead.It is the year 2012 and racial stereotypes still live.

I think it has the potential to become something really good! I laughed, I was worried, I liked the characters. I wasn't sure if it was going for a dark comedy scheme or not, but it could! I definitely think the musical soundtrack could use a little work-- there are a lot of dead spots with no noise that could be filled in with appropriate music.

I prefer to watch indie movies because they do not follow the 'abc' rules of Hollywood films. With that being stated this film was okay. I enjoyed that it did not follow the rules but there were a little things that were kinda crazy. First, let me note that the actors were awesome. Some of the starting actors like Jessica did okay, but the main four were cool. The white biker type bodyguard or whatever he is; did not fit. That was kinda of awkward. I don't want to get harsh on the film itself. Oh, wait; the cinematography was on point, good job, very good job. Mo-ju, I think her name is; is my girl. I love her character, love. it.

It was a very neat idea but any video that is watchable needs a rating. Weather its beta or not. This video was a neat idea but I would not recommend it for children to watch it. It was neat how you added facebook actions as part of the movie but the actors in the video said a few things I am not sure young children should listen to.

In addition to the previous comments about lack of durability and the soundness of the design, the rules make absolutely no sense. Player can either choose to pass the finish line OR go backwards and collect more Krabby Patties (making the game theoretically unending). This is just the most glaring problem, and there are a few others.

It's not very convenient to carry it in a plastic bag, that will tear eventually, or just in a pocket, for it will catch on fabric's threads.

This telescope is garbage, I was given one for Christmas several years ago and returned it. The optics are just terrible, the mount unstable and the 60 mm objective appeture will let you see the moon and not much else. For just a few dollars more, you can purchase a SkyQuest 4 - 1/2 inch dobsonian telescope from Orion that is dozens of times better. Meade does make some nice scopes, but these low end ones are only going to wind up in the junk. I would recommend that before anyone purchase a telescope they first read a book called Nightwatch by Terrence Dickenson, or do some research on the internet. There are many good websites...I have owned several telescopes including another one by Meade and the Saturn is one of the worst telescopes that I've looked through."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inexpensive way to see the stars!","review":"I was able to see so many great details of our solar system when I got this telescope.

In fact, I had to pull out my tool box and in particular my hammer (the \\"Persuader\\") to get it together. It was quite an undertaking. Once assembled, it was \\"wobbly\\" and I anchored it to the wall even though it is a \\"gravity\\" rack. So much for gravity. All in all, I won and beat the beast and it does work. It was, nonetheless, poorly made and a complete pain to assemble. Be warned, you will need to work to get this put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY!","review":"This stand is so easy to set up and store. It may require a little adjusting of the arms if your bikes are short, but it is so handy to stack a light road bike on top of a mountain bike. I wouldn't take any chances by not bolting it to the wall (there's even an included screw for that), but it is such a space-saver that keeps the bikes off the carpet (which saves on the wear/tear of the carpet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works With Limitations","review":"This assembles in 10 minutes and the quality of the materials is good for the price I paid, $50.00. I did not secure the stand to the wall because it was very stable. How level your floor is will effect the stability of this stand. I placed one bike which has a straight top tube on the upper brackets and it holds it well. However, my big Electra Townie 8 cruiser bike with a sloping top tube did not sit well on the lower brackets no matter how I adjusted the brackets. This bike is heavy and it was impossible to balance this bike in the confined space where I set the rack. Besides, it looked goofy, lopsided and it interfered with the top bike. So I use the kickstand and park it below the top bike and removed the lower brackets. It's a clean organized look, but for safety reasons, I wouldn't compromise this way if I had children. For what I paid, it works for me and it's a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could work, but it did not for me","review":"The \\"Gravity Freestanding Bike stand\\" did not work for me. I could see the product working if it was firmly bolted onto a wall, but \\"free standing\\" did not work. In the instructions it recommends you put the safety bolt, but as poorly as this product stood up, it would just have ripped the bolt out of the wall. It needs to be fastened securely to a wall with more than just what it came with.One good thing is that it was very simple to assemble. Also, the material felt sturdy... it just didn't manage to balance as advertise, at least not for me.I don't recommend this product unless you plan on bolting it to a wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, look elsewhere","review":"We purchased this bike rack a little over 2 years ago. Not only does the rubber covering easily tear and come off the two pieces of metal used to hold each bike, but the metal column does a poor job of holding the top bike without a constant fear of it collapsing on whatever you have below. Have something custom made at your local metal fabrication or welding shop instead of buying this poorly made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel and useful","review":"Definitely does the job. Easy to set up and use. Does work as free-standing unit, though a bit unsteady.

It won't even stay up unless you prop it up against a wall, for crying out loud! At least once it's holding a bike or two it stands up by itself... in a wobbly kind of way. A small child could very easily destabilize it and tip it over, with potentially disastrous consequences.Another fairly major flaw of this rack is that the hooks holding the bike frame are not sturdy and bend easily.Considering its very low price, it's relatively acceptable as long as you're willing to bolt it to the wall; just don't expect to receive a rack that even remotely resembles the description made on the Amazon page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the picture - but USELESS","review":"The stand looks and does just what it should. But it's in no way a space saver. Infact it take a lot more space then the two bikes put next to each other.

The only thing it does is keep the bikes off the floor...if that's important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gravity too much","review":"Put the stand together.

This rack is not as advertised.To start, the box that the rack came in was so disheveled it looked like someone had already opened it. Additionally, the pieces themselves were dirty and had scratches all over. Assembly of the rack was easy, however the pieces of the vertical post do not lock into place tightly which results in complete instability. The top section of the vertical post leans away from the wall ~1/2 foot instead of resting against the wall. When I placed a bike in the top rack, the whole thing almost came crashing down because of the severity of the lean.I do not recommend this product which is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure, very dangerous","review":"This bike rack did not fit together very well. While it was easy to assemble, the main support (which comes in a total of 4 pieces) didn't connect in a secure manner. Once I had it assembled I put two mountain bikes on it which caused it to lean at a 30 degree angle away from the wall. It took less than a pinkie finger worth of pressure to start the entire thing falling. It did come with a wall anchor, however we can't fasten anything on outside walls of our condo (it was for the balcony).

Informed me that the unit will eventually rust if left in the rain. I'd give 5 stars if it wouldn't rust!Edit: A HUGE wind storm blew the stand over. Poor bike!

Assembly was quick and connects with four loosely fitting pieces plus the four twisting arm hangers. The stand leans due to construction of the frame pieces. However, I did not bolt to the wall, instead I wedged a small piece of rebar under the frontend of the base to keep the stand firmly against the wall. That way when ever I remove either bike the stand remains against the wall. It appears to do the job.

For an inexpensive item, I have no complaints. Certainly, it's only as sturdy as your wall-mount point (since the spine is assembled from several shorter square pipe segments, it would not hold vertical by itself, even if bike weight were well balanced). If I had my druthers, it would not hang the bikes quite as far out from the wall (a road bike or kids bike only needs 10-inch arm for hook, and this is longer), but it's a one-size-fits-all solution, and will handle even fairly wide mountain bars easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to my garage!","review":"Almost perfect - my only gripe is that the adjustable arms are a bit tricky to remove from the stand (the reason for four rather than five stars).

I tried to hang my two adult bikes without attaching the unit to the wall and found that there was too much play in doing so. I simply used the supplied toggle bolt and anchored into the drywall (not the stud). I have had zero movement since - the toggle bolt provides enough stability without finding a stud. The adjustment of the arms is relatively easy although they fit tight in the slots on either side of the post. The \\"hands\\" that hold the bikes are coated with plastic and do not damage the frames in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Effective","review":"This bike rack went together in a snap, with no tools.

It was a bit challenging putting the rack together. The bottom ring did not line up exactly when bolting it together. Otherwise, once it is put together, it is a sturdy, space saving rack that keeps the tires elevated. It is great year round because it is easy to take the bike down and put it back on the rack. I'd suggest putting the least used bikes on the top. The hangers are covered in thick plastic so that it will not scratch the frame of the bike. I am very impressed with the rack. I think it is perfect for storing bikes and the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend it, it will help keep the tires in good shape, keep the frame scratch free, and uses very little space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift, well received","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my Dad who had this on his Amazon wish list.

If you put the bottom piece on wrong, it won't be stable; it's also not a \\"freestanding\\" rack, meaning it does need to be leaning up against a wall, you can just set it in the middle of the room.The rack went together in about 5 minutes, and has held our two road bikes just fine. It sits right on the wall, which was great for us because we were looking for a way to store our bikes in our small apartment. We've had our bikes on this rack nearly a month now, and there hasn't been anything that would cause me to worry.The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because the joint between the upper two pieces on my rack is a bit loose, and I would like it to be a bit tighter, but I think some shelf liner wrapped around the inside will fix it just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Two","review":"This is a nice bike stand if you need to keep 2 bikes stored.

I wanted to go vertical but needed a freestanding rack because of shelving/etc around the walls, hence my choice of this product.I am very happy with the purchase. It was easy to assemble, and is easy to adjust the mounting bars to the heights I need for the different bikes. Also I can have a different height for the front versus back of each bike, which is nice because these are all mountain bikes with a sloping cross-bar.The rack seems pretty stable, even with just one bike hung at the top.

The adjustable arms are great when deciding where to place bikes and adapt to different kinds of bikes. The rack is also a bit larger than I thought based on the pictures but works great!

I found that these stands do the best job when space is limited. This was really easy to install and needed no tools. Unfortunately, it really does need the weight of the bike to keep it standing upright. Without the bikes the stand leans on the wall and ultimately scratches the paint. I alleviated this problem by using a small towel to pad the area between the stand and the wall. It doesn't seem 100% sturdy, but for about $60 the Racor Pro does it's job for a decent price.

It seems very cheap since all the pieces just slide (insecurely) onto each other. It still does the job of holding your bike, but it just doesn't seem worth the price. It may look nice and secure when it is stationary, but during mounting or unmounting bikes, the cheap quality becomes very apparent. It would have been much better if the pieces were securely attached to one another using bolts or screws rather than just loosely sliding on. If you live in an earthquake area, you would most likely want to bolt this to a secure beam and not just the dry wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last more than a couple of years","review":"I've had this stand for a few years.

That's no problem for me.My problem is the crappy plastic receivers in the arms where the hooks are bolted. After enough times lifting bikes into and out of the hooks, the bolts just pull out of the stripped plastic. It happened first with the lower hooks (okay, I was hanging a tandem, it's a little heavy), but the upper rack's just been holding a relatively light-weight hybrid (I never kept my road bike on this stand; I keep it on the trainer when I'm not riding it).I'm buying a da Vinci which doesn't appear to have the swinging hooks (which require the bolt-and-receiver system), but simple arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.

Very simple--probably took less than 15 minutes to assemble. It is plenty sturdy, and doesn't take up a lot of space. The only problem I have with it is the arms that hold the bikes. They would work great for traditional bike frames, but now days every bike seems to have the bars going every which way and the cross tube of the bike frame doesn't generally run parallel to the ground. The odd shaps of my kids bikes make it a little difficult, but I got it to work by hanging the bikes using the handle bars and seats. Of course it would be too difficult for a child to remove their bike from the stand, or put it back on there. So a parent will have to always help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bike rack","review":"Package was ripped upon arrival. The bike rack is not very good quality, at least not the one I received.

While those attractions still hold true after a week or ownership, there are a few things I wish I would have known at the time of my order. There are zero screws holding this thing together. If you want to move it, you have to either disassemble it, or hold it vertically while you kick it across the floor. It is designed to be used with one screw at the top of the post, to hold it against the wall. It is absolutely essential that you use this, because taking the bikes on or off will cause it to fall over if you're not very careful. It does come with one wood screw and one toggle bolt. The wood screw was too short to reach the stud, so I ended up using the toggle bolt.

Once assembled it tips backward. It can only be balanced by actually placing a bicycle on it. One bike gives moderate balance but the weight of two is preferable (which means that you must be very careful when removing one). Anchoring it to a wall is NOT useful if the anchor is a wire or chain. This is because the rack falls backwards, not forwards. To anchor it properly you will need a solid pole to hold it away from the wall behind. And contrary to another person's review, no anchoring parts come with the unit. The instructions in my box referred to an 'optional' anchoring kit. Good luck. This is poorly designed and is not really free standing.

This one's sure to be a big hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book","review":"This book is such a pleasure to read! The illustrations are fabulous, and the story flows so well... not that we have to read it any more because we all have it memorized! We purchase this book for all new moms and dads, and for many birthdays, too. In a world of children's books where well-written and beautifully illustrated often do not seem to intersect, this book is a gem. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This book flows beautifully, it's so fun to read. My 2 year old son loves the book--mostly the well illustrated pictures, but for the cadence as well. I highly recommend Fudwupper to readers of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I love this book. It is just as fun to read as it is for my son to hear it. Other adults in our family enjoy reading it to my son to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I ,unlike most of these reviewers, was not a fan of the cartoonist, infact, had never heard of him! I ordered this book with my 6 year old son in mind , and he absolutely loves this book! So much so, that I have also ordered \\"Goodnight Opus\\" and \\"The Last Basselope\\". I love the illustrations and so does my son. This is a fantastic boys book, if I could give it 6 stars I would, because my son loves it so much!My son took it to school and the principal has ordered it for the school library! I recommend it for children aged 5-8, maybe a little older, and of course their parents will also love it!THIS BOOK IS A CLASSIC!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The boy is disturbingly grotesque, the story over the top","review":"I don't think war is humorous, even against space aliens. That boy is bizarre-looking, I'm not sure why the author gave him that appearance. The verses seem to be a direct knock-off of the Dr. Seuss style. The art is beautiful, the story is not particularly warm or appealing - almost a parody of a children's book, for the adults to snicker at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dedication dissapointment","review":"I enjoyed the story of Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big. However, when I read the dedication page I knew I could never recommend this book to others who buy children's books.

That makes this book a very fast read. There are no boring spots.It's no prize-winner with deep thoughts but it's an honest, almost simple book by a guy who loved what he did and was grateful to be doing it.I would like to have heard more details of the Cardinals and Cubs, the two teams he announced for many years.....but I'm not complaining. I enjoyed the book, and it made me really miss hearing Harry on the radio and TV. To me, he was one of best baseball announcers of all time, and probably the most entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BRIEF BUT NICE STORY","review":"THIS IS ABOUT THE VETERAN ANNOUNCER OF BASEBALL FOR OVER 40 YEARS. HARRY DOES A VERY QUICK AND EFFECTIVE JOB OF HIS LIFE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DETAILED STORY OF HIS LIFE THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT. IF YOU WANT A WELL WRITTEN, INTERESTING, LOADED WITH GREAT STORIES, ACCOUNT OF HIS CAREER, THEN THIS IS IT. I LIKED THIS BOOK BUT HOPED THERE WAS MORE. I STILL RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS (ESPECIALLY CUB FANS). A SOLID READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book SHOWS instead of telling.","review":"How does a family change from being \\"a mess\\" to success? The author presents a story of a fictional family that shows you. No preaching and no psychobabble, just a good example. Rather than 450 pages of filler, this book gets right to the point in an enjoyable plot.This is a sequel that stands alone very well. Now I'll go back to the first one and very much look forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful table - poor chairs","review":"We've been using this table just about 2 months. Took some time for your kitchen makeover to be ready for the table.

Already, 2 of them have broken - the breaks are where the legs attach to the bottom of the seat. The piece of wood that holds the two leg spindles has split down the middle. Now the legs wobble, and we're afraid they will just collapse. We're on the look out for some similar chairs that will hold up longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the version pictured!

It opens up some very interesting new options for long hikes in the Canyon. However these hikes are long, tough and rarely anywhere near a trail. Oh by the way, also very beautiful and peaceful.

It looks somewhat like the photo, only because it is intended for the same use. Otherwise, it looks different enough to leave no room for speculation that the manufacturer might have taken the die to a new plant in China. It ISN'T the listed product. More like a dollar-store item.It's going back.However, if the incorrect item is listed at the correct price point ($1- $1.50), then it'd be a five-star buy based on quality and usability.

Just a piece of metal in a bag with a barcode sticker on the back. And a label that says \\"Made in China\\". You know those little gold oval ones for cheap items? Well, this is described as a $20 piece of 18/10 stainless from Italy. It is NOT. There is a black powder along the edges of some of the draining openings. The item I received has three ridges on each side which does not match the photo. Buyer Beware! You are not getting what you ordered on this one. I am sending mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Navajo contemporary culture and life observed","review":"This is a well written, thoughtful book about the author's experience on the Navajo reservation. Although the author, John Farella is an anthropologist, he brings a sensitivity and perspective that is often missing in strictly scientific books. This slim volume highlights a few specific Navajo people and gives the reader unique insight to contemporary life on the Navajo reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The instructions are vague at best.","review":"I am nearly done with this book and I must say that it has been a rather grueling experience at times. The author needs to improve how he writes his instructions. He'll tell you to do something but won't tell you HOW to go about doing it. And this book is for beginners? It has nothing to do with the software. Maya may have a high learning curve, but if you are willing to work hard at it everyday you will get through it. That said, it seems that the author was in a hurry to write this, and at times rambles on about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BEGGINERS","review":"This book is a big waste of time and money just like many other Maya books. I have bought and read over 5 Maya books geared towards begginers and none of them including this one is helpful. They have many great tutorials, but all the directions are very hard to understand because they leave alot of missing information out. Its like they expect you to really know the software in and out to study their beginner books series.My advice for begginners is to use a less demanding program. Many people who use Maya are pros and thats not to say you won't be either. But unless you go to school, these books in my opionion are worthless. Even though the tutorials are made by people who have big names in the CGI industry, doesn't mean they have the teaching skills to get us small people going.I recommend Lightwave, because the book, Inside Lightwave 8 taught me in a breeze how to ge up and running fast-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I come from the computers/engineering field into 3D computer graphics. This was the first book that I read. The book delivers what it promises - it is a good first step for 3D newcomers. It is easy to follow - exercises are explained step-to-step wise and it covers the most basic features of Maya. The book prepares you well for the Alias-book Maya Foundations, which gives you enough background to start making small animated films."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book put a smile on my face!","review":"This book was given to me by a friend.

My skin was particularly bad this week, so I applied it overnight and to my surprise woke up to a much better looking skin. It significantly reduced the inflammation, I've been using it for few days so far and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated without being greasy and seems to keep major breakouts at bay.

The second I stop using, I break out. It's good for either oily, dry or combination skin. In fact, during cold winters, I use another super moisturing serum underneath this cream, and it still penetrates to get its job done. I've given this cream to all my friends, cousins, and even my teenage daughter, who is now religiously using it 2x/day.I do have one negative comment though... The manufacturer changed formulation of this product last year, and it's now much denser and doesn't spread as easily. Still 5 stars though!

She was about 19 months when we first got it, and just disassembled it as the other reviewers described. She actually had fun just doing that, so we went with it and let her have her fun. After about a month of that kind of play, all of the sudden, the lights went on, and she just loves bouncing the balls. She also likes to try bouncing other things, like the Little People characters, on the trampoline. She also has started to learn to assemble it. She was running by the time she got it, so she didn't pull herself up with it. I would probably put 18 months and up on this item. The toy works best when put on a hard surface, like a table top or wood/linoleum floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy for the price","review":"While the concept of this toy is great, it was just to flimsy to play with. I bought it for my daughter when she turned a year old.

Pieces don't hold together, particularly the base and the trampoline. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy has one too many flaws","review":"I bought this for my young toddler because he's obsessed with balls and bouncy things, and what a disappointment! The ball bouncer works, but only when the parts stay together. The two bases come apart constantly due to poor design. That makes this toy more trouble than it's worth. Secondly, the plastic is so flimsy on this thing that the parts of the tower are constantly becoming misaligned thereby causing the balls to all over.Do yourself a favor, save your money on this shoddily designed and implemented toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts don't stay in place","review":"I bought this for my 22 month old. The bottom part is separate from the tower but they overlap to attach- not permanently though. Every time my son puts the balls in the tower and puts the slightest pressure on the tower, it disconnects from the base= no allignment so no bounce. Nice concept but unless you wish to reassemble this toy every time your child plays with it, don't bother. Too expensive for what it is as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy for children with low vision!","review":"I'm an Early Intervention Teacher, working with families of infants and toddlers who have low vision. I start out just with some of the pieces, with the parents showing them to the child for mouthing and peeking through the openings (I give them two pieces at a time.) The babies love peeking through the transparent \\"trampolene\\" piece. At a certain age, most of them still want to mouth the toy to explore. When they aren't as interested in mouthing, and understand that the ball can fit into the opening, I begin to build the toy, gradually. By the time the child is two or three, they easily understand the activity of this toy, and there is less need for supervision. I think of toys not as \\"babysitters\\" but as tools for learning, and it's wonderful for parents to play with their children. I have used tape to keep some of the sections together, but do appreciate the way this toy breaks down into pieces for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult Supervison required","review":"The biggest complaint I have about this is the pieces do not snap together, but only sit on top of one another.

Not very helpful. *The volume is VERY flimsy (79 pages + about 12 pages of almost useless \\"resources\\". *The rules are simplistic to a fault.

There is no cohesion (apart from the fact that all tracks are in some way acoustic), and the sound quality ranges from excellent studio to okay home demo. I love most of Lennon's material, but some of the song choices,Woman is the N***** of the World, Luck of the Irish (with Yoko), What You Got, just aren't anything special. If you're looking for something truly excellent from John, check out the newly remastered and expanded Rock and Roll album. Maybe next year we'll get the One to One concerts or at least something more worthy of becoming a part of Lennon's body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Lennon Unplugged","review":"This is not only a very good album, but also a very interesting album. Working Class Hero, Imagine, and Look At Me are especially great. The live acoustic recording of Imagine is worth the whole album. Real Love with the different words is also very interesting. My only complaint is that the version of God on this album is not my favorite. It is much better on Wonsaponatime in my opinion. The sound quality is poor on Cold Turkey, but you can really feel his pain more then on the electric version. The combination of John Lennon's voice and acoustic guitar is very intimate on this CD. This CD shows John Lennon fans how great a song writer and poet he was."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoko, ferchrissakes, ENOUGH!","review":"baby, please, stop releasing this stuff of mine, will ya! you have enough cash to rule the world, so stop with the unnecessary release of my work tracks! i mean this stuff is only for the most diehard fans of meself or that band i did a few thingys with. to anyone who bought this already, thank you from the beyond. to those who think they might like to purchase it, STOP, it ain't worth yer money! remember me as i was on my other releases i had a hand in, i mean i think i did alright, but please stay away from this acoostic stuff. forty-four minutes on a cd that could otherwise get loaded up with at least seventy minutes, c'mon yer not gettin' yer $$$'s worth!so long for now and give peace a chance!- JL"},{"rating":"1","title":"For hardcore fans only","review":"This is obviously a collection of mostly demos and really only belongs in the collection of hardcore fans for the sake of completeness. There are better versions available of all of these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake!","review":"This recording is in such a pure condition that it is clearly only fordie hard fans.Lennons songs are truly amazing no matter what - but this package does not give them justice.Die hard fans - get the albumAll other fans - save your money and get the fantastic Lennon Collection instead.This one sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A porly produced Yoko Album","review":"John Lennons newest release, Acoustic has many flaws.First, The album contains many very rough cuts including those of imagine, real love and Watching the wheels. These track could have very well have been remastered but Yoko had to produce it.Second, The tech, Yoko, have played with a few to many effects such as terribly sounding reverb and underwater chorusey effects and have thrown them on everything! Matter a fact.....it was so bad i shut it off after track five later finding out that the rest were just the same.Also, the version of cold turkey is terrible due to Yoko's imput of John's voice.Over all this has been one of the worst albums released of John's.....thanks to Yoko Ono. If only it had been produced by Jeff Lyne or even his son, Julian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never should have been released","review":"Ok, the quality on this album is really really bad. Most of the songs on here are home recordings that should never have been released as an official CD. I can understand releasing this for free so the hardcore fans could hear it. This is at best a bootleg quality recording except they are charging full price and acting like it is professionally done. Which is a complete shame. They tried to \\"improve\\" the quality of the home recordings and all it did was turn the recording into a really strange tinny, unnatural sound. The is barrel scraping and money grubbing at its worst. DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"The only thing good here is the live stuff. Imagine is superb, John Sinclair is good, Luck of the Irish is a nice treat ... the rest is crap demos. I can't believe you Yoko, you have truly raped & ravaged the Lennon legacy! And Sean, you've grown up to be an annoying, spoiled b*stard!Don't get me wrong folks, these songs are true Lennon in every spirit of the word ... they're also crap demo sounding material, all of which are available in bootleg form ... ( a much better investment than this collection.)Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a gem or two...","review":"There's just no escaping the fact that most of the tracks on this CD are of a quality you might expect from the kind of never-intended-to-be-released demos you could find on KaZaa or Napster. That's not to say they're worthless -- just not what you'd expect from a modern release on a major label.The 'live' tracks work best... especially a terrific live performance of 'Imagine'.The inclusion of guitar tablature for each song in the enclosed booklet is a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play guitar with John","review":"This Cd should be titled \\"Play guitar with john\\" for beginners.These are poorly recorded accoustic demos with a booklet includind the lyrics and guitar chords.If that's what you want it's ok, unless forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lennon Unplugged","review":"\\"Acoustic\\" should have been a cause for celebration. There were plenty of acoustic recordings and demos in the John Lennon vaults to warrant a 75-minute disc. Instead, we get 44 minutes - with most of the material PREVIOUSLY released. No wonder the bootleggers continue to thrive! Despite a few Lennon gems (notably the superior demo of \\"Watching the Wheels\\"), \\"Acoustic\\" is a money-grubbing letdown on par with The Beatles' \\"Let It Be . . . Naked.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoko Should Be Ashamed","review":"If John were alive when this album was released...well...he'd never permit its release! The quality is poor and every track sounds like he is just doing a run thru..no passion no commitment. The liner notes make a reference that the album was made with aspiring guitar players in mind. So now John's a music teacher? Maybe he'd be ok with that but these recordings were never meant for release and Yoko should never have let it happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not More Demos!","review":"I'm a big Beatles fan both together and as individuals and I have most of their releases. Lately, John's albums have been rereleased with bonus tracks just to make fans like me shell out more money for a few bonus tracks which are mostly demos. This is just what I need to buy, more demo stuff (I can't believe Yoko doesn't have completed songs that were never released). There's a few live songs but I already have those same ones.In the booklet, Yoko seems to want \\"future guitarists\\" to learn to play the guitar from these songs (Great, having a young kid playing and singing WORKING CLASS HERO). So thanks Yoko, milk as much as you can from John.Now don't get me wrong, i'm also a Yoko fan too. I have all her releases both on vinyl and CD. Her voice is not good but she writes very good melodies.Oh! Yoko: next time please release songs that we never heard before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoustic by John Lennon","review":"What a huge disapointment this was.

It seems every few years Yoko goes to the vaults and throws this stuff at us. the box-set was awful. this is all my opinion, but anything after \\"Walls and Bridges\\" was a waste, including \\"Double Fantasy\\"John was great as a Beatle, so-so as a solo artist. People seem to be afraid to say anything negative about his music.these are all very rough tracks, i zipped through it and filed it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Response To Nathanial Nease","review":"Every generation has their own music and musical heroes. I can almost guarrentee you Nathanial that 20 years from now, people will not be listening to Papa Roach or any of the artists you are currently listening to but people will still be listening to John Lennon. You're young and you still have some growing to do musically. No better time to start than right now. Listen to your elders. Lennon is for real."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sham(e)!","review":"This CD is the final rip-off of JL's legacy: home demo or live versions of songs that exist in superior versions on his regular albums (especially the non-remixed, original LPs and CDs!) or on the John Lennon Anthology. And these are not simply the cassette-demos cleaned up and presented in style, most tracks are actually treated with some flanging or chorus effect to make the guitar and the voice sound more 'full'. This only results in a cheap, artificial sound, that completely takes away whatever charm these demos might have had for the JL-fan. If you want to play the songs on guitar, you better buy a JL songbook with guitar tabs. 'Real Love' can be found on the Imagine soundtrack album in its pure form. Dont buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the casual John Lennon listener","review":"Although I basically enjoy this disc, I was hoping for something a bit more listenable. There are three or four excellent tracks, sampling what John did best \\"raw\\" and without the trappings of full production sound. However, if you have only a passing interest in John Lennon or are expecting a collection of polished acoustic works, forget it. The sound quality on several tracks is terrible, the vocals are rough (remember, these were sub-demo recordings never intended for release) and you wonder whether Lennon himself would have wanted us to hear them. Maybe. Listen carefully to the Amazon samples from each track before you decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was very excited to get this CD as Im a HUGE John Lennon fan. So disappointed! The tracks are muffled and the sound quality is very poor. There is only a few songs that sound clear (one of which is the song that plays when you preview the album so thats very deceiving). Some of the songs, while John is playing the guitar, you can hear Yoko talking in the background. If you want to hear old tapes of John recording in the studio this is your CD. The quality of the sound is what is so annoying...but at the end of the day its John Lennon, and we listen to it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lennon Acoustic","review":"This is a piece of Lennon history. It travels from some intimate moments with John, to some stellar live performances. The album moves at a nice pace, it doesn't drag at all. The three live recordings are very good. Real Love sounds great here. What caught me by surprise was Look At Me. Though it has a great message, the sound of the original always turned me off a bit. This version helped me to embrace John's lyrics.For some reason, Amazon lists an extra track, \\"I'm A Man\\". This is not a track on the album. Check the back cover, shown as a customer image, to see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Duplication","review":"Like so many others, I was very excited about the prospects of this release, but was diappointed (big time) upon purchasing it.Out of 16 songs, only 7 have not been released before.

Others are clever, but do not rise to the level of being funny. For example: A stranger to law courts hearing a judge call a sergeant \\"brother,\\" expressed his surprise. \\"Oh,\\" said one present, \\"they are brothers - brothers in law.\\" Or to quote another joke: The government, having threatened to proceed rigorously against those who refused to pay the assessed taxes, offered to them a remission of one fourth. \\"This at least,\\" said one sufferer, \\"may be called, giving them some quarter.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting ready...","review":"Well, yes, this is a simple home-made production but they do give some very practical and good advice including the beauty and realities of cruising.

A worthy DVD for ones collection as you'll want to watch it more than once to take in all the advice which is shown in detail on their own boat and advice of what you can expect at different ports around the world as far as people and supplies go...like how to refill your propane tank when there is no pressure fitting and other such things as you might not have considered.

I'd like to meet these two folks but this is probably the closest I'll ccome. Some of what I learned- some good ideas for setting up ground tackle, great stuff on their instant spinnaker pole arrangement, good stuff about storing gear well.This wasn't a guide for going cruising though, so I docked it one star - on the other hand, combined with their great books, it works pretty darned well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to Thor!!","review":"This was my introduction to \\"The Mighty Thor.\\" I had read several positive reviews and thought I'd try it myself.

I kept getting hung up though on the puny attempts at making this an interesting story. There was no depth to the story and the characters were very poorly built. How could Burke have been so devoted to Alys when he merely kissed her a few times. Alys was ever stubborn when Burke attempted to tell her his story. Yet she believed her family that had abused her. Silly, silly, she could stand up to Burke, but not the aunt who berated and beat her. This was no Cinderella story, just a sad attempt at some off beat fantasy.

When I received it, it did not come with instructions, but I thought, no problem, I am sure I can put salad in a bowl and pull the string. I was wrong. I can have a dinner party for 30 people and watch my two kids at the same time while talking on the phone and folding clothes, but CAN NOT get this to spin without the lid flying off.In order to get it going, I needed my daughter to hold the thing down so the top did not pop off. Why has not one person said that the top has no latch feature to secure it to the bowl? If anyone wants to scan and emil me the instructions, that would be great, if not I will give it to my daughter to spin her barbies, like a carnival ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't Spinning Salad be Easy?","review":"I bought this after my OXO spinner broke, and I've had it for a year, and am desperately waiting for it to break so I can get something else. The trouble isn't the string (which might appeal to you if you miss the old-fashioned lawn mowers with the pull-start) but the amount of parts. Most other spinners have 3 parts: a bowl, a spinning drainer inside, and a lid/spinner. This one has a lid AND a spinner top. 4 parts. I know, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but you have to get the lid on exactly the right way or the mechanism doesn't work. It adds an unnecessary step, which gets frustrating when you're just trying to dry some lettuce. The pull string works fine, though sometimes it slackens and doesn't go back into its housing, and you have to kind of coax it back in. A little too much effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zyliss no longer a reliable brand- now Made in China","review":"This is first Zyliss purchase I've made in about 5 years. It will be my last.

It seems to work fine but has a funny moldy smell that has not gone away even after repeated washings in numerous different cleaning products. I've tried liquid dish soap, vinegar, soaking in baking soda and water, all to no avail. I store it uncovered, which takes up more space. Overall, I wish I would have bought a different brand. I can also see that one drop on the floor will break the outer bowl, because it's a rigid plastic. I had a white Copco brand salad spinner that lasted me 15 years.

I'll be lucky to get a year out of this item.Good functional design, poor choice of materials.Update: less than three years laterIt finally died - no more of the tabs broke off, as I got used to holding the top down firmly.

When I heard about them, I laughed, thinking it was a way for companies to fill a need that wasn't there and make a few bucks. However...When I finally took my Zyliss Eay Spin Salad Spinner out of the box and actually used it, I was totally sold. It seems pretty sturdy, but if anything ever happens to it, I'll definitely buy another one.Don't live without one! They are GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it when it worked...","review":"I really loved this salad spinner when it worked. The string, however, was unable to spin the lid and bowl after less than 30 times' use in total.

If it is fixable, I would give it 3-4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Worked only 1 time!","review":"I bought this salad spinner at Target. It was fantastic the first time that I used it, and I was excited with my new toy. I made sure to handwash it. The following week, it no longer worked. The string mechanism would sporadically spin the top part of the lid - perhaps only once for every 20 pulls. I'm terribly disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within two months!","review":"I bought one of these at target and it worked well while I had it, however the string that you pull to spin the salad got freyed and eventually ripped apart leaving the salad spinner useless.

After I read exactly how much carbon energy is used for a bag of greens, which tends to cost about $3.99, I decided they would only be for special occasions.While I love to cook, I HATE washing lettuce. I can never get it clean enough, and if I do I can never get it dry enough... watery salads are gross, a dish rack is not an appropriate place to dry lettuce, and I like getting my vegetables.This salad spinner does exactly what it should, and my only problem is that occasionally the spinning part, which is affixed to the lid, doesn't connect with the basket that does the spinning. 95% of the time, however, this is a great kitchen tool. I keep it out on the counter, I use it so much. And I don't buy bagged lettuce or dangle greens from the dish rack anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I use it on all my salads. I especially like it because I can rinse a pre-cut bag of greens in the strainer, which freshens it, then spin it and it comes out fresh as if I had just chopped it myself. Spinach, pre-cut cole slaw, iceberg, romaine, I've noticed it works tasty with it all. I'll throw in cherry tomatoes, baby carrots, cucumber slices, mushrooms and what not with iceberg lettuce, prep it with this product, then change my mind and saran wrap it for another day; the salad was still fresh two days later. Amazing salad spinner. I don't give pencil whipped reviews and if this salad spinner was crap, I would tell you. To be honest, I wish I'd bought one 10 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best salad spinner I've ever had","review":"I first experienced this spinner at a friends house when I was making a salad for our dinner party. I was impressed with the fact that it spun ALL of the water off of the lettuce. And it was easy to use. It seems that most of the salad spinners I've had, there's an awkward position you have to get into with your body over it to hold the thing steady. Not this one. It's easy to use. The pull-string is an ingenious invention. And I love the color selection! I bought the red one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it Now!","review":"I purchased the pretty green Zyliss salad spinner at the end of last year. I've used it weekly since then. At first use, I couldn't figure out how to spin it and not have the top move. It is all in how you place the other hand, a bit difficult at first, but I've got it now! Really, really like the product. I wash the romaine in the bowl first, drain and then spin the whole bag at one time. Excellent results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the pull string mechanism & ample size","review":"I'm still testing it/getting a feel for it, but so far, so good. The pull string works well, though I'm finding that to get the lettuce dry, I need to pull quite vigorously and a few more times than I originally thought I would need. I like the large size (can dry a head of lettuce). I'm relieved at how easy it is to clean compared to the plunger type salad spinner I used before (disassembling that to clean was a chore I didn't look forward to). I love the cheery green color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a pretty good job","review":"I bought this salad spinner going on two years ago now. It still works just as well as new.I'm quite pleased with it.My former spinner's string broke after 4 years of use. When I couldn't find the same kind for sale I decided to try this Zyliss. My former spinner spun the basket back & forth and it got the leaves a bit dryer.But this Zyliss spinner does a pretty good job, it looks nice, and I like that I can store or serve my salad in the bowl.I haven't regretted it's purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsolved mystery","review":"The author has tried to build up to a climax in a mystery only to give no clues as to the identity of the villian.

The story line is just background for the P.I. and his girlfriend. I have read other Texas Trueblood books and at the end of the story we have a conclusion. Nothing at the end of this story.

This opinion is based on personal experience with ever game on the market. These animals are highly intellegent and the locations have excellent visual appearances. The Bow hunting is far supperior to most games which add bow and arrow without any real interest in the realism. If anyone can show me a hunting game that matches this one I'd be very surprised. I play this game on a 500 mega hertz machine with voodoo 5 video card and 256 RAM. I'm not sure how other systems play this game but a first rate video card and audio program are a must.

I was absolutely thrilled to find Dave's CD collection of his 60's hits when browsing the net. For anyone who loves 60's music, this is a must for their collection, the quality and presentation on this album are as good as anything put out today, it has truly stood the test of time.

Looking at track listings I was familiar with some of his songs as covers, but I had no idea how he sounded. His Top 5 hit \\"The Crying Game\\" was included on the soundtrack of the same name, so I sampled it at a CD store. I liked the sound enough to take a chance and buy this CD. I was pleasantly surprised to find the CD an excellent compilation of British sixties pop. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I wish I had learned of Dave Berry years earlier. As a fan of British beat music of '63-'66, I have a growing collection of CDs by many of the UK groups which did not gain popularity in the US. I believe Dave Berry should have.

If you're a true Crystal Lewis fan, then you'll love this DVD. If the concert wasn't enough for you, there's some great outakes which show how she can turn some embarrassing moments into something comical.

The only good thing about it is the front cover (and that it is mercifully short). This book has little to do with Zen. The majority of the quotes are by people who are not Buddhists or Taoists of any stripe. The quotes themsleves have almost nothing to do with Zen. The quotes tend to be taken out of context and are much too short. The overall effect is to make great thinkers sound like followers of New Age mee krob (that's a South Park reference).

I emailed the author to ask and was told he was behind and hasn't finished any of it yet.

I like the Bob's Red Mill brownies but these cookies have a horrible aftertaste that does not go away after they are cooked as one reviewer stated. In fact, after making the first batch and reading the glowing reviews here I bought another bag and made them again because I figured I must have had a bad bag but the second bag was just as bad.

Take one cookie to Bob and make him taste it to know how these bean paste curd turds taste like pure evil. Somebody please come to my house and wash out my mouth so I never taste this again.

There are so many flour alternatives on the market and they put beans in this recipe. And the dough really does have a bean aftertaste. It starts off sweet and then the lasting effect is garbazo beans. Not what I want in a cookie. To make them better, we added more vanilla and then rolled the cookie dough in sugar. It was the only way to cut the bean flavoring. Also I think they only add 25 chips so be sure and add more to your own recipe.

I love the way you can knock the trays down for compact storage. My only complaints were HOLY COW this thing is HUGE! I went to a few local stores checking out the Q's, but apparently they all stock the Baby Q's because the 300 is a FULL SIZE grill with a full grilling surface! It heats super fast so everything can go on relatively quickly. I was not planning on storing a large grill, but its just more to love.

The WEBER Q300 has a heavy iron grate that is heated by 3 stainless steel burners. You pre-heat the grilling surface and sear in the juices, then cook the meat with the grill cover closed using only the middle burner. This results in efficient use of propane and rapid, even cooking. The fat is collected in a pan at the bottom and rather than creating smoke and charring the meat, may be discarded later.

He didn't poop at all the next day, and didn't poop (or drop a puddle, frankly) until the following evening (that's TWO DAYS!). He also whined and cried and was often sitting in the \\"sphinx\\" position (indicating his cramping and discomfort) and he drank more water than his usual intake. I basically had to let him out every hour or so. Obviously I stopped after 2 days of the medication and the diarrhea stopped in about 18 hours or so.In all fairness, the side effects are clearly listed, I just want to encourage other pet owners to take them seriously.

In the face of such tragedy, he aquires an embarrasment of riches, three women wanting to heal his wounds, a huge grant to think interesting thoughts about similarities between human and aliens and talk about them, and university administrators pleased at the attention he is generating. Then his troubles multiply, fire bombs, computer viruses, and kidnapping to name a few. Through it all, the wife keeps coming back, refusing to be shut out, refusing to get on with her own life, and refusing to let him get on with his.

Most of his short story collections have a unifying theme -- either a character or several characters whose different adventures and/or mysteries one follows in each story.

This book had themes within themes and as the story unraveled - the reader learned more and more about the characters. The reader can tell that Landay takes his time with each word.

Set in Boston in the '60s, the story centers on three Irish brothers and their extended families. Born in the Irish section of Boston into a policeman's family, each brother has chosen a separate path - prosecutor, policeman, and burglar. While very different in every way with the rivalries common to brothers, they are still of one family, each affected by their larger-than-life father who was murdered in the line of duty in an unsolved case. The story tracts a period of their lives where each is tested separately with personal choices and face the consequences of those choices. In the background is the case of the Boston Strangler which plays into the story with fascinating impact.Landay has a fine sense of Boston: the neighborhoods, the language, and its unique DNA.

Director Kareem Mortimer has set this beautiful story in an island paradise. But the characters he has created keep finding ways to keep paradise from coming true for them. The acting in this movie is revelatory. All of he performances are top notch, especially those by Johnny Ferro, Stephen Tyrone Williams and Margaret Laurena Kemp.

So you pick up Air not knowing quite what to expect. Set in a fictional \\"stan\\" where the isolated villagers face the imposition of world e-culture feeding straight to the head, Ryman uses the underlying SF tropes with characterstic lightness of touch to tell a story about the way that people use their lives, and use others' lives.It is a truly brilliant book.

They are easy for her to squeeze and control. The semi-transparent effect of the paint allows her to overlap the colors, creating news ones (and unknowingly explore color theory!) The paint easily washes off her hands and a simple baby wipe gets the paint off of her clothes. The brushes cap easily, so our paint does not dry out. Because the brushes are very durable and put up with a lot of abuse, I also refill these with regular tempura paint, but she likes the glitter paint much better.I don't write reviews too often, but after reading the other review posted here, I felt that my very positive experience with this product should be shared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with other washable paints","review":"This is a good idea, but doesn't work well in practice. First of all, they are very hard to squeeze out for small hands. My 3yr old cannot do it. Second, they seem to get clogged, so when you squeeze, the paint ends up squirting out near the cap (the brush cap), not the brush. And when there is only a small amount left, but still some usable paint, that doesn't squeeze out. We had to take the brush cap off, and dip our paintbrush right into it.We have both the glitter and non-glitter ones. I threw out the glitter ones. They may say washable, but they don't wash off the kids hands easy, because its very sticky. You have to almost peel it off using your own hands. The regular kind washes off fine.I have other kids washable paints, and washable watercolor paints, for them that are much easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise View of Madison","review":"Recent scholarship has revealed a much more consistent 'Madison' than some historians have granted 'The Father of the Constitution'.Scholars Rosen, Banning, and Rakove have lead the way in this regard.

However this one I simply could notget into. It seemed long, drawn out and boring to me. The violentattack on Brett twice was just too much and too graphic. I think oneof the problems in our country today is TV and authors believe thatwe will not buy their merchandise unless there is loads of violenceand sex in them With Leon, it,s the violence. I agree that most ofher books do not have that much graphic violence in them but this oneand one other have. It is sad it has to be in there as the maincharacters are drawn up beautifully; Brunetti and his lovingfamily and his care for the underdog. This book really consistedmore of Flavia and Brett-to me it just got tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aqua Alta (Audio Book)","review":"I have listened with appreciation to five of Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti novels. Now I have come to Aqua Alto and sadly must give an emphatic thumbs down! This negative review is not because of the gay advocacy theme, which IMO is an interesting and credible commentary. The negativity comes from the atrocious Blackstone Audiobooks production which used some untrained 19-yr-old American English speaker for Brunetti and other male voices. The male readings are a disaster and a violation of the author's work. In the context of the gay advocacy theme, the crude lack of artistry of the male voices turns the gay advocacy into mockery and polemic - not the author's intention I assume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite work","review":"For me this book didn't work. I found myself skipping bits and getting bored. The author tries, but does not succeed, to merge the daily life of her characters with the tension of the crime story. None of the characters quite come to life. Brunetti seems bland. I will not read any other books by this author in this series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked interest","review":"There was really not enough here to hold my interest.

Read the dramatic first chapter and you will be hooked all the way to the end, perhaps the most satisfying climax (and the most action) of all her Brunetti ouevre--though, true to Leon's vision of Venetian politics, still somewhat ambiguous and certainly not pat. (Note: it is helpful but not essential to have read \\"Death at La Fenice,\\" the first Brunetti mystery, which is also easily findable in the U.S. in paperback and which introduces two main characters in \\"Acqua Alta.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Commissario Guido Brunetti Seeks Justice Again","review":"Donna Leon again creates an ambience in Venice that few tourists ever come into contact with. Her descriptions of the city; the crime and violence; the moral values of the typical Venetian; the rampant corruption in government; and the pollution that will ultimately destroy Venice, are juxtaposed with the normal life of the Brunetti family of 4, and the exquisite Italian (Venetian) food that is so lovingly described. Leon's characters -- good and evil -- are fully developed, and her storytelling abilities are excellent. These are books that are impossible to set down even for a minute: one must read them from start to finish, as I have done 10 of them in the last 2 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Chances at New Life","review":"I struggled with the concept of second innocence (still do); however, the premise is that we can maintain or recapture a sense of wonder, delight (whatever you want to call it) throughout our lives.

The idea is to hook you in so you'll buy the others. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't.For me, this one dose of Mossy Creek is enough. They're pleasant enough, the people of Mossy Creek, but quickly forgettable, and with so many truly great books out there, why spend money on a series I know to be middling?If you enjoy the small town, \\"everyone knows your business\\" kind of atmosphere in a book, this one may be just your speed.

One difference is that in this book, each chapter was a separate story profiling a different character in the town. The stories did build on each other, layering different elements of the town, presenting a variety of facets until a rich tapestry is completed of Mossy Creek. Since there is some overlap of characters, you learn more about some of the characters in later chapters.

I love reading it to the guys I date as they get a chance to see what a true romantic I am. Anyone who can read this story aloud to someone they love without getting all choked up needs to turn down their medication.Mr. Card has taken me many wonderful places.

I bought my copy before I knew anything about boat construction, and the more I learn, the more I enjoy casually thumbing through it.

I've been a fan of Yngwie ever since the first demo (and I do own all of his CD's!), but this is a truly sub-par work. The songs are mindless repetitive junk with lousy melody lines and a horrible singer. You'd think Mark Boals would at least sound decent, but no, we don't even get that. But those are not even my biggest gripes with the CD. The biggest problem is the quality of the recording itself. It sounds like it was recorded in a barrel with overbearing drums and especially bass that almost completely drown out the guitar and vocals. Are there keyboards on this CD? I can't tell, the bass drowns them out too! It baffles my mind how Yngwie can release drivel like this. You'd think he would have at least played it to some people before putting it out and you'd think that at least one of them would have had the guts to honestly tell him how bad the recording was. But no, we are forced to endure this dud instead. Don't waste your money like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the F---?","review":"Yngwie is more than talented. The guy can play. Period. And he's even written a good song or two in the past (Soldier Without Faith, Blackstar), but this album is unforgiveable! There might be some genuinely good songs on this album, but I can't tell! The production is so headache inducing that I haven't actually made it through the whole thing in one sitting yet. I've had to break it up so as to let my migraines subside before continuing. How could Malmsteen put his name on something so amateurish and poorly executed? Nothing AND I MEAN NOTHING should ever be lobbed at an unexpecting public if it has production quality like this! Unforgivable, unlistenable, unacceptable, yet wholly understandable, since it seems Malmsteen has been working toward something this bad for several years now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disasterous...","review":"Guys who like Malm's Alchemy, do not read further. But ones who like malmsteen's earlier albums and wonder what has happened to him, since Concerto Suite, will find these lines familiar. First of all, the bad musical perspective in the Alchemy continues. Speed without emotion and musicality was malmsteen's biggest drawback since Rising Force album, but somehow most pieces were listenable. In alchemy and w.t.e.a.w, you can't resume listening after several seconds of a track. It is very bad to say this but, he even made Pagannini's caprice a disaster with his playing... Yuck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, that this has to be one of the worst produced albums I have every heard. This albums sound quality reminds me of a poorly recorded demo album. I am not sure what Yngwie was thinking releasing the album produced so poorly. The guitars and vocals are drowned out by the thumping bass and drums. It is no wonder the vocalist left the day before the album was released.The production is so bad, that after a few listens, I am still unable to determine if the album contains anything worthwhile. I feel that Yngwie needs to take a long look at his music and consider taking some time off to regroup. He should look hard to find a quality singer (and try to maintain a professional relationship with him).If you are looking for a great Yngwie album go out and get Oddessy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen!","review":"My God, what a disappointing album this was. Now we find out what an album produced and engineered by Yngwie sounds like, without the objectivity of a good producer to keep him from hanging himself. As much as I hate to say it, this garage-quality recording is poor even by Shrapnel standards.If you can get past the poor lyrics, poor sound and just plain shock value, there is some phenomenal soloing here - but does Yngwie need to prove himself anymore?

After the wonderful \\"Alchemy\\" I expected a disaster- and got one all right...but not for the reasons one might think from this Wizard of the Strat. It is the final MIX! The album has great songs, solos, and arrangements-but has the worst final mix I have ever heard...and I mean B-A-D!!! Did Yngwie listen to the master? The bass guitar covers everything. Mark Boals is BURIED in the noise. The choral-vocal parts stand out, but in all...the CD is unlistenable due to the noise. Compare the Engineering to \\"Odyssey\\" (1988) or \\"Magnum Opus\\", (1994) and see what I mean. Oh Yngwie is KING. The \\"Double Live\\" CD from Spitfire took the place in my collection of this disaster in my collection, however. What a shame. Can anyone say : \\"RE-MIX\\"???? Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a change","review":"I bought this CD and had the luxury of listening to it over a 4 hour car ride. Here is why you are better off spending your money elsewhere:1) Same solos as always only more out-of-time 2) Does Yngwie practice or is he just filling holes in the songs? 3) Yngwie's claim in the 80's was he listened to classical musians. He must have lost his hearing 4) His playing sounds sloppy although it is hard to tell because of the ... production (Yngwie produced the CD) 5) What's next? How about spending more time crafting logical solos instead of writing stupid lyrics.I saw Yngwie on the War tour in Pittsburgh before he fired his band. It was my fifth Malmsteen concert and by far his worst. There were no new amazing guitar licks but rather, sloppy playing of the ones he repeats almost every song. This CD is the same - a poor repeat performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"super Gothic !","review":"Yingwie is back, gothic as he's never been. On this album he ascends to the roots of Goth metal, even close to black metal. The sound is very meaty, not as piercing as on Alchemy. he uses a lot of open chords, all the solos sound like played on tube amplification, overdriven, overloading on low segments.the first track has a nice leading tune, and the solo begins with pagannini's 24th caprice. Catch 22 is one of the best tracks, vampire-kind of black metal, fast and furious.Mark Boals delivers amazing vocals, very suitable for this particular album. It took me 2 or 3 listens before I saw it in all its solidness and beauty. I rank it one of the coolest maestro's works, along with Trilogy and Alchemy. I definitely recommend it to any serious Yngwie's fan and collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"it had crappy resolution, then, it stopped working out of nowhere and hasn't worked since. get the apple cinema display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story.","review":"All her life Melanie Visser yearned for a loving home.

I much prefer the stories she wrote for Grace Chapel Hill and will not be wasting my time on this series from Steeple Hill. The story line was okay, but nothing to hold my interest. A couple of twists at the end were so obvious that its hard to believe an adult wrote this as a book for adults, I'm sad to have to say.

I bought it because the product is labeled as 26-Ounce Stainless-Steel Espresso Maker, all true except that it's not 26 ounce! It's 18 ounce. It's a 9 demitasse size pot, which in Italian Espresso measurement a demitasse is 2 ounce.Plus I agree with the previous reviewer this is horribly poor design. The column where the pressurized coffee would rise is so close to the hinged lid that the coffee blow the lid open during brewing. So forcefully did it blow that there's coffee stain every where after I brewed coffee.I too am returning this to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very DANGEROUS coffee maker!","review":"This espresso maker is very poorly (or cheaply!) designed, causing a severe danger to any users. The threads for the screw-on top are not secure. With the build up of internal pressure from the boiling water, the top half of the espresso maker blew right off, spewing boiling water/coffee everywhere. So much for the pressure release safety valve. Had I been anywhere near the stove at the time, I would have been rushed to the emergency room. I've been using stovetop espresso pots for years so I'm quite familiar with proper usage. It wasn't due to user negligence. Just to be sure, it was tested again with the top screwed on as tightly as possible. And, yet again, it blew off. Luckily, I held a tall stockpot over it and was able to contain the blast, but only seconds before it happened. This product should be taken off of the market, it is by no means safe to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it less than zero stars","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS ESPRESSO MAKER!!!.

When I made it the first time, it was not even brewed correctly, not even to pass for regular coffee. The second time I used it, it boiled over, making a mess of my stove and leaked while it was brewing.

Stainless steel, dishwasher safe, nice looks. All of those are true. Unfortunately it takes the strength of Hercules to get the top on tight enough so it doesn't spit out the sides. When you get that done it spits coffee out the top and makes a mess out of the entire top of the stovetop.I did manage to get one decent pot of coffee out of it however. What I did differently I don't know. Screwing the top on as tight as humanly possible and not packing in the espresso grounds seem to help. The old one was still better (and cheaper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Us Poor Bastards","review":"Pure and Simple, Garbage of the highest order. Not original, just pure trash.

In their place are clean, bright illustrations, skillfully obscured (and therefore ageless) automobiles and in this case, a plot that evokes the memory of old Lucy shows as seen through the gaze of nostalgia.

The content of her material is from Course in Miracles and The Work is very similar to Ken Keyes -- always good to be reminded of deep wisdom -- however, the narrative and Katie's stories are brimming with ego -- though she says over and over again that she doesn't have a story -- hilarious!

Where would I be without you Katie..","review":"Byron Katie's latest I think is her best work, which is saying a lot. Each chapter(about 2 or 3 pages) is a great story or learning lesson about how to deal with life's problems. The simple solution is just question your thoughts. Every time we are unhappy, we are attached to an unhappy thought. Question this thought and the unhappiness goes away. There is no exception to this.I have read some other reviews of Katie's previous books that criticize The Work for being practical only to a certain point. All I can say is go see her in person and watch her use The Work to deal with any problem. I recently went to her School and all I can say is that it changed my life more than anything. I saw her actually deal with a cancer patient and bring him to tears of joy.Thank you Katie, for all the help you give to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This and loving as is...","review":"I read both the books and giving a collective review - the work works no doubt as questioning gives answers which are RELATIVELY true.I personally found both the books disturbing low of energy and a lot of gloom.Secondly the author keeps herself in a high point of reference and 'bestows' her observation to 'these' people.

But it almost feels like a sham, like the Emperor has no clothes. So on the whole, I admit that I don't get about half of what she's saying - I think a little more background or examples might help. I dunno. I'm not sure if I had a stroke in the desert that I would be comforted by her simply staring at me \\"in love\\". (from one of the chapters).

Despite a witty and well written introduction by the Craigmeister himself, page after page of Five Questions tends to wear on the nerves a bit. It was interesting to read through once, but it is not the kind of book you'll read again and again. I suppose you get what's advertised, but you could always watch reruns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Mystery Lovers","review":"Don't let the title mislead you, this book is a poor excuse for a mystery. I was surprised to find that I had actually guessed the murderer and motive before I was even a third of the way into the book. Perhaps for someone who isn't a hardcore mystery fan it would take a little longer to figure it out, but still there's no genius to the murder mystery part. The plot was fast-paced, perhaps a bit too fast paced for my taste, but by being fast-paced it always has a interesting change of scenery. The romance in it was okay, at times it dragged unlike the story. Jim Walker certainly makes use of his knowledge of civil war history. (as far as that's concerned I'm impressed with the book) Anyone who enjoys reading Gilbert Morris's work will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Failure","review":"This soundtrack could have been awesome. It is such a dud! First of all, prior to the film's release, the trailer shown in the movie theatre's had the most awesome, funky instrumental version of the Bewitched Theme and it never made it to the soundtrack. That is what I wanted the most. Nora's chop job on the film really took what could have been an amazing film and soundtrack and destroyed the concept. There are so many great tracks that could have been used on this LP. Nicole could have recorded Sabrina's I'm Gonna Blow You a Kiss in the Wind for instance. This was a failure in my book. One star is too much. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"This CD should have been all studio tracks. I think that she needs to polish up on her live singing. Maybe if she gets some vocal rest, she'll sound better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good to me","review":"Seems like she just tried to do a carbon copy of her sister's first album. I would rather her come up with something more original instead of copying. She sings with feeling, but she sounds so bad. Some of her diction is off too. The song with her sisters is the best live song on the album. The quality of her voice just decreases on the other songs. Her studio work is nice though. She sounds ok but I think she should stick to preaching. Everybody just not cut out to go solo. I feel like she is one of those people after listening to this album. If she wants to do another album she should rest her voice, add some more producers along with PAJAM to it, and let somebody else write her songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO MUCH!!","review":"THIS ALBUM IS ONE THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE BROUGHT IN A LONG TIME.

This CD ministers to you from beginning to end. I have always loved the Clark Sisters and was anxiously awaiting Dorinda's solo project. But this went beyond my imagination. You can just feel the anointing when you listen to the music. I especially love, \\"No not one\\", \\"I'm still here\\", \\"I'm coming Out\\". I love all the songs. Buy this CD and Be Blessed. I hope Dorinda gets an award for this one. She deserves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's comin out!","review":"Dorinda's debut album will surely make an inpact in the Gospel world.

People of all ages will like this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best...","review":"This album is one of the best of all the solo Clark Sisters recordings I've heard and definitely one of the best of 2002. The album starts of with the introductory \\"If It Had Not Been For The Lord\\" and smooths out into \\"No Not One\\", featuring Clark's cousin, producer J. Moss. Then there's my personal favorite, the celebratory \\"I'm Coming Out\\". The album fails to disappoint, offering track after track of Dorinda's classy Holy-Ghost filled, jazzy rasp. Other standouts include the majestic \\"You Can't Take My Joy\\", the sassy, \\"You Can't Hurry God\\", the J. Moss produced \\"It's Not Me\\", the inspirational \\"I'm Still Here\\", and \\"You Don't Have To Leave\\" and lastly, the urban-flavored \\"You Can\\", another one featuring J. Moss. Like I said, one of the year's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome voice","review":"Dorinda has an awesome voice! I love to hear her sing. However,I will talk about the good and the bad, so here goes the bad. Four of her songs are produced by her cousin, J. Moss. Truth be told, she should have recorded just one of his songs, \\"No Not One\\". Listen folks, J. Moss' songs are not for everybody and not everybody sounds right singing his songs. Of course, Dorinda sounds good anyway, but some of those songs just didn't fit her style. \\"If It Had Not Been For The Lord\\" is an excellent tune. \\"You Don't Have to Leave Here\\" is my favorite out of all the songs. \\"You Can't Take My Joy\\" has that familiar Clark Sisters sound. Of course the Clark Sisters join in together on \\"Show Me The Way\\". Dorinda's voice is great and most of the songs were wonderfully written. Overall this CD is pretty good and I am glad to see Dorinda with her own project. We deserve an album that is totally Dorinda Clark-Cole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Singer, but needs to reach for a Higher Annointing","review":"God knows I love Dorinda Clark. She's a wonderful talented singer with an angelic voice, so powerful and strong. I believe her songs are truly uplifting for praise service, but she has the potential to really break some demonic forces and if she would really reach for a higher annointing, I promise you will see a powerful lady! Through it all you would not mind purchasing her cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"off the hook","review":"Well i think this Cd was off the hook.

I had been looking for an archival quality storage box for a collection of 100 year old photographs. This box was described in terms that made it seem perfect. But, when I first opened it, I noticed that a little packet of dividers included inside the box seemed blackened on its edges. No wonder, a black powdery residue was freely coming off on my hands as I handled the black material on the box's exterior and interior. Thankfully, I returned the box to its shipping container before I was foolish enough to store anything in it. Definitely a bust. I spent a great deal more on archival photo storage boxes from the Container Store which have worked beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a box","review":"It's a box. It's pretty functional and stores neatly--as you'd expect--for a box. I've given it 4/5 stars because I've only had it a few months and can't tell if it will hold up over time. So far so good; it's full of photos and sitting on my shelf--as you'd expect--for a box. I could easily give it 5 stars really. I have 1200 4x6 photos with dividers in this photo box. I had a hard time finding an adequate photo storage box in brick and morter stores, even photo shops, so I was happy to find this one on line. It fits my needs perfectly.

I couldnt help but think the guy who wrote it has some kind of personal grudge against the author.I did not buy this book to learn how to spell, and I know the poker hand rankings. To write off a book as it fails to deliver on these two fronts is laughable.I think this book is right up there with any I have read, and perhaps brings poker literature into the 21st century. The game has changed since the likes of Brunson and Sklansky and though their offerings are excellent, I find this book much easier to read and relate to as the author has vast internet experience.As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the shorthand section is second to none and I could see improvements in my game within minutes.I buy a poker book purely to improve my poker game. I strongly recommend you buy this one and reap the benefits."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of mistakes","review":"The book is full of obvious mistakes. On page 25 the author confuses a flush with a pair; on page 26 he uses a full house as an example of a three of a kind; on the same page he uses the same full house as an example of a two pair hand; on page 27 he uses the same full house yet again to demonstrate a one pair.This review refers to the 2005 edition, ISBN 1-4027-2962-6.

I think that we can learn everything that we need to know about life from them. Apparently Kathleen Dean Moore agrees. In this beautiful collection of essays, Moore catches and expresses the beauty of the wandering river with a poetic presentation that left me wanting more. I appreciate how she sees the world, how she extrapolates wisdom from nature, how she loves with such passion yet allows her humanity and the questions that may not have answers space to be.

Reflections.","review":"\\"Reflections\\" in the subtitle is very descriptive of this collection of essays. Very serene musings. In this book, Moore is very perceptive. Conveys very well how oneself fits into everything in one's surroundings. Very descriptive observations. Good balance of observations and musings. Sometimes books of this genre are closer to a collection of random thoughts that are not necessarily interesting to others. This book is not like that. Just enough details of places to make it substantive and interesting, and just enough musings to get one thinking somewhat along the same lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"the word \\"rivers\\" caught my attention","review":"I thought this book was about the rivers themselves--perhaps she had floated these rivers and was writing about the sights and scenes. My mistake. The essays are very well done and I appreciate her sincerity and insights. Although there is not a description of the Brazos River in the essay about the Brazos. I enjoyed the human interest but was left wondering how the daughter's relationship turned out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish","review":"The concept for this story is very promising--one boy DOESN'T have magic, as opposed to the predictable boy who DOES have magic. And the world was beautiful and interesting. But the writing was so sluggish, I couldn't get into it. The paragraphs were too loooooong for the target age group. The plot chugs along at an agonizingly slow pace. Even the action scenes are sluggish, rather than exciting. I tried skipping every other sentence. A good editor should have eliminated a quarter of the pages, which would have improved the pacing. It's a shame no one did, because the idea is worth the effort. Instead, the intriguing concept fails due to the slow pace. I read stacks of books every month, and it's extremely rare for me to stop in the middle . . . but this one did me in. I stopped half way through and put it back on the shelf. I didn't even read the back page to see how it ended, which shows how bored I was.

Don't buy this if you actually plan to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as they used to be","review":"Like the vast majority of products these days, this Zyllis spinner is not as good as its predecessor. I know because my old one just broke and I went out and bought a new one. The spinner is not as easy to work and it does not do as good a job of spinning the water out of the greens. Also, I can tell that the plastic will not last as long - its thinner plastic. And the spin mechanism is likely to not last as long because you have to yank on it more to get the spin going fast enough to do some good.

When I moved to the USA, I used it less than 10x and it stopped working (the rope stopped recoiling). I ignored it for a few days, it worked for about 2 pulls and was dead again. For the number of times I used this, it isn't worth any price. It is not durable. It was great for when it worked.

My wife was looking for more hard cheese in the kitchen just to be able to grate more! The only negative we can say about this product is a user warning. The grater does not descriminate between food and your hand. Be careful what you rub against it because it will come out in little bits on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Competent Addition to Your Kitchen","review":"I purchased this grater after being fed up with a cheap grater that seemed to have more plastic than metal. I normally grate parmigiano reggiano for pasta and this grater fills the role nicely.The handle allows for different methods of holding the grater which helps vary up the repetitive motion of grating. The build quality is sturdy and the metal doesn't flex under the pressure needed to grate hard cheese. I appreciate the sharpness of the cutting surface as it allows you to grate more cheese with less effort than cheap graters. The whole device cleans up relatively easily under running water (of course this depends on what you grate)My only nit-pick is that the protective cover is difficult to slide on and off the cutting surface and as such creates a safety hazard if you're not careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"Very sharp, durable and comfortable to use.

Nice for carrots, dakon radish or regular radish etc.BTW with this it isn't necessary to have the chocolate at just the right temperature it can be chilled (still works best with the temperature between 65 and 75F depending on the chocolate).

I noticed that I didn't have any new real rides but I had lots of senery, but it was too much to really use all of it.SO basically, I was just really disappointed with it.

They did the same thing that they did in Wacky Worlds, replaced the old car with a different looking one. Some new ride.To conclude... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. YOUR NOT MISSING ANYTHING. But if you really wan't all that scenery and new scenorios, borrow it from somebody cause you don't need the disc to play it (you use the RCT2 disc).

Relative to physics textbooks in general, it went into great detail concerning fairly advanced topics. However, it did not do a good enough job of laying down the fundamental principles of physics, which makes it more difficult to comprehend the more involved topics. The book also lacks a glossary and a comprehensive index. The examples are either too complex or too simplistic, and I have been forced to use several other books as auxiliary materials. If you are a physics instructor, I implore you, please DO NOT USE this text in an introductory course, unless the primary goal of your class is to drive away students from the study of physics, ranting madly about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pedagogic","review":"I am an introductory student in physics and our techer told us to buy this book since he thought it was a very good book.I don't agree.The book contains a lot of interesting material, but has few examples which can tell you how to use the new knowledge.

Since it, mostly, takes place in one spot, it allowed the writers and actors to really focus on the two people you are engaging with.I gave it a 4 star, simply because it does not fit into my favorites.

While the book started with an interesting premise of terrorists using nukes against the US, it quickly degraded into something barely worthy of a comic book. The so-called hero is pathetically lame and all of the other characters are complete cardboard cut-outs (especially Sargent-MAJOR Jefferson). Maybe a cartoon show about the exoskeleton (the main character I think) in action might appeal to 8 year olds.

There is a plot, but the author tries to stretch a 25 page short story into 400 pages of boring, repetitive dialog. The first 200 pages alone consist of the characters mainly struggling arguing with each one another on how to run a special terrorist ops group.

We never learn how the task force gets it's intelligence to be where the terrorists turn up, how they get into position, what planning is done or if there is any plan. Each time, they just suddenly appear at the right time and surprise the terrorists.The action in each of the battles is slow. You can almost count the minutes that the task force is standing around idle whilst the terrorists are firing away.. and of course, most of them get away each time.The dialogue between characters is incredibly weak and could easily have been written by a 14 year old.

The beats on this album in particular are... uninteresting. At best they are boring, at worst they are headache-inducing. And the nature of the music is such that there's not much to talk about *besides* the beats.When the album dips into more ambient territory, the quality picks up, which earns it two stars.In the end, I'd say don't gamble on this disc unless you know what you are getting into. Thursell's bands with Peiter Bourke are far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Right, and I am Right, Even thou we Do Not Agree","review":"This is a very interesting book on the way we identify what is important to each of us and then how we communicate to each other. The author provides a \\"model\\" of how to understand what is important to you based on your drives, etc. Imagine two people arguing over something simple. Now imagine if what each person values is different. One person values color, the other texture. If one person has read the book there is an oppurtunity for this person to identify the difference in communication styles. In other words, you may not be disagreeing with the other person, you are both talking about something different, what is important to you. In other words, there is an oppurtunity to build a bond with better communication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and yummy!","review":"Many people think that they can just chop up some veggies and meat, add soy sauce, and have a great meal...not true. This book gives you the details you need (such as, once you add the meat, stir every 20 seconds so it will brown properly) to create restaurant-quality stir-fry. And the All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce recipe in the beginning is really excellent, although I like to add cornstarch & extra water to mine to make a thicker sauce. I have not tried any of the non-Asian inspired dishes, and frankly think that they should not have been included, but all of the ones I have tried (Orange-Chili Beef, Beef Asparagus & Red Pepper, Minced Chicken in Lettuce Cups, Kung Pao Chicken--my husband's new favorite for dinner guests, Snapper with Tangarine-Chili sauce, Ants on a Hill, Quick Pot Stickers--a little tricky until you get used to the folding) have all been very good and have been made more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic ligabue style","review":"Ligabue's latest release has several short comings that caused it to lose the fifth star in my book. While vacationing in italy i found myself channel surfing one day and i saw a live ligabue concert on rai due. I immediately fell in love with the bands sound and character, as well as zanny yet powerful songs. However many of the songs rely heavily on slang and play on words, which makes understanding very difficult for the average american listener. Also many of the best songs are explained much more in depth by their music video, and as i have yet to see an italian song on MTV...However ligabue is good enough that their lyrics do not need to be understood, the music can just carry you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ligabue: World-class rock musician, seriously","review":"This is LL's latest (\\"Fuori come va?\\" = How's it out there?). He does not disappoint here. Rather, he confirms his condition of a top-notch rocker, with a stupendous guitar work form his bandmates Mel Previte & Fede Poggipollini in every song. \\"Nato per me\\" is pure rock in the best Ligabue's style. \\"Tutti vogliono viaggare in prima\\"(Everybody wants to travel in first-class) opens with an anguishing, high-pitched guitar in the background as the song unfolds. \\"Ti sento\\", \\"Tu che conosci il cielo\\" and \\"voglio volere\\" are beautiful ballads. This latter song starts with piano and struck me when Ligabue played it live in Florence on September 10, 2002. However, it seems the song gets lost at the very end.Again, a must for those who love rock 'n' roll. It isn't the best of Ligabue's album but should be ranked among his top works, along with Buon Compleanno Elvis, and Su e giu da un palco"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hassle for new mom","review":"not sure why people would want to use this. it seems like too much hassle and not effect for my issues. case of 3 is over kill. planning to give the extras as baby shower gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rubbish","review":"This is yet another example of Kim's awful poetry. Having a read a couple of Kim's poetry books ('Going the Distance' and 'Total Depravity'), I am simply astounded as to the low standard of his work. I can understand the quality of the author's first poetry book being a little 'ropey', but surely the second book would be an improvement. It seems to me that Kim doesn't learn from his mistakes. If I were he I would take a professional writers course specialising in poetry, maybe that will enable him to produce material of an acceptable standard.The content of this collection of poems was rather far-fetched and childish. There was also some material describing sexually explicit scenes, which may cause offence to those, who are not used to such things.This is certainly not a good book and should be consigned to the scrapheap of poetry books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"'Total Depravity' is one of the worst books I've ever read; both the quality of the poetry and the content was awful.After reading a few of the poems, I found myself struck by the ideas that were being conveyed. Racist and anti-Semitic views were prevalent throughout the book. A large number of the poems contained sexually explicit material that may be unsuitable for some readers. I got the impression from reading this book that the author had lead a sheltered life, where contact with women is minimised or non-existent. Kim appears not to have a clue about women and heterosexual relationships; this was clearly evident from the content of these poems.The messages being put across in the poems were often confused and poor quality/non-existent editing did not help this. This book is clearly lacking in every department and should be avoided since it represents very poor value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry as Art form","review":"I love the way Kim uses poetry as an art form. His critics do not seem to understand the mechanics of poetry and how art operates. They should take a basic poetry 101 class at their local college. That'll shut up their puerile criticism against art form of poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible poetry","review":"This collection of poems was a real disappointment! I was expecting good poetry and a great deal of humour from Kim's book, unfortunately, it consisted of a collection of very poorly written poems that were predictable and contained a hidden religious message. The poems appear to be based on the experiences of a man who has never had a girlfriend or had much contact with girls in general.Metaphors were used inappropriately and the standard of English was disappointing low.I afraid this one gets the thumbs down from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably poor","review":"I was amazed how such poor poetry could be published. One can only assume that Kim publishes such rubbish himself. The poems were uninspiring, boring and lacked flow or direction. The material contained within these poems was childish and totally inane. Some of the poems contained material of an explicit nature. I was disappointed at the number of basic errors and typos. One wouldn't expect that from a supposedly top class author such as Kim. I feel that Kim's poetry needs to improve considerably if he wishes to pursue a career in that field."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let down!","review":"This collection of poems was a total let down. The poetry was of a very low quality, typical of that expected in a beginner's rough draft. Many of the poems just didn't make sense and were rather weird i.e. power cables taking on animal forms etc. Kim needs to think carefully before embarking on a career in writing since he has a lot to learn. These poems are very far-fetched and childish, therefore, they should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"peurile","review":"When I purchased this book from my local Borders, I was expecting an interesting and lively set of poems. After reading the first few poems, I realised that I've been duped. The poetry was pathetically poor and very dull to read. The content was very childish with inanimate objects taking up human properties. I suppose the author was targeting readers that are stupid enough to believe that a computer mouse squeaks in a similar fashion to a real mouse. Kim really has a lot to learn when it comes to writing good poetry that is suitable for an intelligent, mature and inquisitive readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"The work of a 'sex-pest'","review":"This poetry book is a typical example of Kim's toxic literature. Kim's poetry is crap. Kim's poems are based on his own sexual fantasies. Most of the poems are based upon his pathetic attempts to get a girlfriend.

I doubt very much if the author has met a woman apart from his mother/sisters. Kim seems to have no understanding of the female mind and that was evident from many of his poems.I found many poems that were based on childish and weird ideas e.g. USB cords taking up human form. The quality of poetry was unspeakably poor. I am surprised that any self-respecting publisher would endorse such inept literature.As with much of Kim's literary works, the usual religious ideas were incorporated i.e. all Jews are bad, Christians must fight Jews etc. I doubt very much that any reader would find these poems interesting or good to read and many will be offended by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously far fetched","review":"When I purchased this collection of poems by Kim, I thought I was going to be entertained and humoured.Unfortunately, the poems flattered to deceive as I found them to be ridiculously far-fetched e.g. inanimate objects took on human properties; and very poorly constructed.

I think most youngsters could write more humorous and inspiring poems.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far fetched, wierd and nonsensical","review":"I found this collection of poems by Kim to be the wierdest I've ever read. They were so far fetched e.g. we had computer cables taking on human appearence and personality. I feel that even five to six year old kids would find these poems rather peurile and babyish. The quality of poetry was some of the worst I've ever read, it was badly edited and appears to be the work of an amateur. Some of the poems were sexually explicit and could cause offence to certain readers.

It took 5 listens before I realized that I was hooked to their endearingly sloppy, country leaning brand of melancholic pop. If you don't mind lyrics which exist to be clever/obscure (the record starts with the words 'There goes George C. Scott/ In a blue range rover', and that more or less sets the tone), there is definitely enough pure emotion in the shambling music to reel you in. Think of some strange happy medium between the Mekons and Elliott Smith (and yes, there is a bit of Go-Betweens in there, too), and you should have something akin to the Bitter Springs. If this description interests you, you will be dependent on 'From the Parish of Arthritus' within a week of owning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only the translation was better","review":"This book is beautiful and would have been even more so if the translation wasn't so bad.

There is one thing I hate in a story and it is the constant appearance of the phrase 'as if'. It was in the book about three to four times per page and when it appears that often I come to near tweeking myself near to a stroke. Okay, the story was interesting enough even though I had practically guessed the whole plot beforehand, but even though the general explained everything down to the teeth, there were still too many unanswered questions. I nearly screamed when he threw Krisztina's journal in the fire. COME ON! You seriously kept your wife's journal sealed for forty-one years without opening it and just tossed it to the flames in front of Konrad.

Today, its absence of self-referential irony would appear fatal. Still, the novel itself is suffused with a Weltschmerz that approximates irony. The comparison to Thomas Mann is instructive here: Marai might be termed the Ironic Hungarian. Certainly, his tendency to speculate about meaning and every subtle variation therein links him to the great Central European tradition of fiction. His style is less bombastic than Mann's, however. The construction is spare and elegant and the language is stripped of rhetorical ornament. The novel functions best as an intellectual exercise, however, so anyone desiring fully developed characters, narrative flow, or crisis and catharsis might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A meaty read.....","review":"Our thirty-member book club had a very spirited discussion about this book--many aspects were covered.

The writing style does not allow the reader to be \\"spoon-fed\\" so to speak, so might appeal to more thoughtful readers rather than those that enjoy more superficial escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think the many high reviews for this book have more to do with what it promises than what it actually delivers. The title, itself, calls up wonderful images and the story line is, in theory, fine material. The actual experience of reading the book was frustrating, though. I simply got bored by the oblique narrative style and the dolorous atmosphere of the book. Marai shoots for a very sophisticated and roundabout way of introducing the facts of the narrative, but he doesn't quite pull it off. Two novels which do a better job of playing out the same basic story line (i.e., recalling youthful friendships later in life, in a European historical context), are Olaf Olafsson's Absolution and Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited."},{"rating":"1","title":"this not a translation from hungarian","review":"I find it shameful that this book is not translated from the original Hungarian, but that it is a translation of a German translation (I dont know about the Penguin edition - I wonder). Of course presses save money by hiring translators of more common languages (competition drives translation prices down, therefore a translator from GErman might cost less than one from Hungarian). However, I would think that an author of this statue would deserve an original translation, and that a press of this caliber (Random House) would have the honesty to hire a Hungarian translator. I can't believe that in the entire English speaking world there would not be qualified writers to do it. In all other languages, the translation is direct from the original(and, in the case of Spanish, beautifully I must say). What we are reading here has little to do with the original: this is cheating for the sake of profit.

It was way to expensive and the only really nice thing about it were the info on the scouts! And even then they missed Pluto! It had hardly any color pictures and the rest were black and white not to mention fuzzy . I give this book 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Talk about one heck of a movie","review":"Brilliant! I absolutely loved this movie. I found that I can relate to all or most of the characters in the movie. Each one reminds me of either a family member or someone that I know. I loved it from beginning to end. I had always by passed it at Blockbuster, but then a friend recommended it and I said what the heck, I have nothing better to do, so I rented it, and loved it. It was amazing. Now I can't stop recommending it to everyone I know. Watch this movie. I am sure you will find elements of yourselves and those you love in this movie. Enjoy! Happy Watching!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you watch no other dramatic movies this year.....","review":"This movie is a compelling story of modern American cultural society, multiple marriages, estranged family members, and a incredible story of one man's struggles to rid himself of his demons of the past while attempting to save his son from the same fate. The story is moving, funny, sad, joyous and with a surprise stunning ending that shows that if Life is a house, Kevin Kline managed to leave behind a home that symbolized an atonement for two generations of sorrow and anger.IF you live with troubled teens, have children from multiple marriages or have ever found yourself set adrift in the modern economic times, this movie will touch you as few I have seen I the last year.DON\\"T MISS THIS MOVIE..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfying movie","review":"My wife and I loved this movie. Kevin Klein still has it after all these years. He can make us laugh (\\"A fish called Wanda\\") and now make us cry...The rest of the cast is fantastic as well. Kristin Scott Thomas does an excellent job at bringing out the emotions of the moment. \\"Young Anakin\\" does a great job at the troubled youth with teenage angst role. All in all, this movie is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"We're watching the first twenty minutes, and all I could think was \\"predictable boring family drama\\" - and basically that's what this movie is. Kevin Kline seems to be the same in all his movies - this film actually reminded me of him in \\"Grand Canyon\\".'My Life As A House' comprises a selection of odd characters who end up helping a dying man build a house he should have built many years before. By the end of the movie, I cared no more for this character or his \\"wayward son come good\\". The characters just didn't have enough spark to make me feel any compassion for them.I realise that reviews will discuss the special meanings of this movie - such as the importance of family, the need to follow your dreams, good health etc etc, but you will be none the wiser after watching this typical American family crisis movie.Yawn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera atrocity","review":"Listen to the music: mildly interesting & disonant at the start, basic happy-birthday-to-you consonance at the end - the plot is an extended cliche, with a shocking waste of good acting talent, especially that of Kevin Kline, who ought to know better than to pick up spare change in slumming expeditions like this. At the start, I wanted to push the kid off a cliff, at the end I wanted to drop the entire cast out of a stratospheric research baloon. Don't bother with this one unless you've taken a lot of bad drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nearly complete rip off of American Beauty","review":"This movie could've been great. I was looking forward to it for months. Hayden Christenson was the only bright side to this movie, in full punk attire no less. Then towards the end he became to resemble a logger or something to that flannel clad extent. Metaphores were slammed down viewers throats without need. Life As A House basically took American Beauty, mixed in some Story of Us, and California-ed better movies. The neighbor girl was entirely unbelieveable.The movie still has potential to be great if you get rid of the script and start over, get a new director and camera man (due to the excessive montages), keep hayden as the punk but don't de-punk him and keep the mother, but lose everyone else and the origional footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly depressing","review":"If your up for a sad, spirit killing, depressing, downer of a movie, than have a ball with this one. I haven't seen this much crying in one place by so many people at one time sinse the twin towers came down on the 11th. What a great holiday movie.NOT!! The acting was good but the story was a total downer. Devorced guy looses everything meaningfull in his life including his son only to find out he is going to die of cancer. My idea of a good movie isn't about watching some poor guy whose about to die spend his last few days trying to make up for all the things he didn't do in the past. Is there not enough depressing stuff going on in the real word these days. My opinion this holiday, do yourself and your soul a favor, go see a happy, fun, uplifting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAW, VULNERABILITY","review":"You will cry. No way around it. This is a heart-wrenching and heart warming movie.It is about family, the value of life, the quality of life, correcting the past, facing the future, breaking down barriers, showing love and accepting love (which is often the hardest thing to do), all symbolized through the the building of a house. Fathers, sons, mothers, daughters all bravely striving for love and redemption under time limited circumstances.Although the film is heavy in its emotional themes, it triumphantly uplifts and focuses on the things we should appreciate as human beings. This film is in no way contrite. It is raw in its portrayal of vulnerability. You will never forget this movie.The cast is superb. Kevin Kline is amazing as is Hayden Christensen.This is a real gem, a movie of depth and meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances in this Tear Jerker","review":"Kevin Kline gives an incredible performance in this film. Where's the Oscar nomination for him?Hayden Christensen and Kristen Scott Thomas both give great performances as well.This film is indeed a tear jerker. There were many scenes where I wanted to grab the kleenex box. It's a feel good movie.The DVD isn't incredible, but it is good. The director's commentary is very good, and I say this DVD is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning House","review":"Life As A House is an excellent movie. I think Kevin Kline and Kristin Scott Thomas both do excellent jobs. The real shining star in this movie, however, is Hayden Christensen. For a new actor with not alot under his belt he is believable, entrancing, and smoldering (I guess this is why he was cast to play Anakin Skywalker). Everyone else included, a great movie that you should definitely go see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life As a House","review":"Good story of a man dying of cancer and trying to rebuild his life without the usual cliches. Kevin Kline and Kristen Scott-Thomas put in their usual stellar performances, but it is Hayden Christensen that viewers won't be able to keep their eyes off."},{"rating":"2","title":"He woke up one day to find his world has changed.","review":"Most of the time people go to movies to escape the reality of life. If it's a real needs the movie? In this case it is that reality that is used as a diversion. You find yourself routing and cringing from it all the characters. If you've been around anybody who's dying or the people they've been around that person than you could really recognize them in this movie. And you can definitely see Kevin Klein's hand in this movie.This is the story of an old curmudgeon who you'd like to like but he just won't let you. Realizing his own mortality he attempts to make amends. This takes the form of building a house and rebuilding relationships that parallel. I don't mean for this movie to sound like some philosophical artsy type film. It is just people being people.Aside from the movie the DVD has all the standard DVD goodies. The deleted scenes actually helped to realize what the story was all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was great!","review":"I really did enjoy this movie. Hayden Christenson and Kevin Kline gave excellent performances. I believe that they may both be nominated for some Oscars this year. This was a great drama and I highly reccomend it.

I have already seen it twice, and will probably end up seeing it again because i am slowly dragging all my friends - and when it's over, they thank me! I saw this movie for the first time one week ago and I cannot get it off my mind. This movie changes the way you think, changes the way you feel, and changes the way you love.

The only thing I thought the movie had going for it is the great acting, but thats all. The idea of a father trying to take is pot head son into building a house by hand with him and the help of others sounded like an amusing subbject matter, but I was disappointed by \\"Life as a House\\".If your a big fan of mellow drama(very much in the caliber of a day time soup opera) then this is a treat for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding...","review":"Gosh, I can't believe so many people enjoyed this movie. This film's only saving grace was Kirsten Scott-Thomas and Kevin Kline's acting. The rest of the movie was made up of good actors with trivial dialogue, or new actors still developing their skills. In order to get the project off the ground, the screenwriter dusted off a cacophony of old clich��s and hammered them together to elicit the emotions his skills were otherwise unable to obtain. This movie simply fails where \\"American Beauty\\" succeeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"life as a house","review":"For some reason I was sent a DVD that will not work on my DVD player.

No one I know has ever heard of this..It should be explained more clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, mildly disappointing","review":"Kevin Kline was wonderful, as usual. The acting in general was great. Scenery was spectacular. The house, when done, is beautiful. I found the predictibility caused the movie to be dull. Everything and everyone in chaos at the beginning, everyone and everything perfect at the end. Slight unexpected ending, but nothing really great there. Two sex scenes: one was funny; the other in the shower was just weird and stupid.Can't say I would recommend anyone spend money in a theater for this. Maybe rent it when it comes out. It just wasn't that good overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greats...","review":"I feel this is one of my top 5 movies I have ever watched. Highly recommended. triumph over adversity and work toward goodness. I LOVE this movie!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful metaphor","review":"In this movie, Kevin Kline plays a dying man who wishes to rebuild his life and relationships with his family. While living in a shack in the shadow of his ex-wife's home, he reaches out to his son, a drug-abusing, profane teenager whose aimless rebellion is distasteful to everyone around him. Kline begins tearing down his old house while reliving unhappy memories of his own father. He shares reminiscences with his son, and slowly begins building a new house and a new relationship. Various neighbors are portrayed as the dysfunctional people they are, but eventually the whole neighborhood gets into the act and the building progresses at a dramatic rate. Excellent performances are turned in by Kevin Kline, Hayden Christensen as his son, and Kristen Scott-Thomas as his ex-wife. This one is worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life as a House","review":"I'm very pleased with this movie. It was still in its original wrapping and the DVD was in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Loss of a House","review":"Kevin Kline did a remarkable job as the distraught George Monroe and how he took action on rebuilding his past life and bitter memories of his late father in hopes of leaving a legacy for his son Sam. The closeness of his ex-wife, her young sons in the story illustrated the warmth of a family and their love with a fast moving pace bringing the family together during a final hour done in a subdued manner and so believable. It was blended with some humor to get over the loss of a man everyone fell in love with I could have watched this movie over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Love this movie, made a wonderful christmas gift for my sister. Would order a copy for myself in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realigning your priorities..........","review":"Life seems to rotate around one's job, the amount of money you make, and the amount of material possessions we can accumulate. Movies like this and \\"A Walk to Remember\\".......inspire you to take a look at your priorities. If they do not cause you to take another look at your life and your relationships with your family and loved ones then maybe you should unplg from Twitter and Facebook and slow your life down."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY WARM AND VERY HUMAN","review":"I don't know why but this film was a surprise for me. I did not go to see it at the movies and somehow I was relactant to see it at all. Than I had a chance to see it on the DVD and everything turned around. Everything was good there and I liked it all. It was good, solid, well made American film with a little tough of Europe. In short, it was generating a very warm and a very human feeling. That is how I felt after it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching, romantic, humorous family drama!","review":"...his story is about a man named George, who has been divorced for a decade, is estranged from his 16 year old son Sam...and is jobless. But when he finds out that he's got cancer and has only 4 months to live, he does what he's always wanted to do... build a house.So he knocks down his \\"house\\" (which is really a shack), and begins construction on his new house...This is a very touching drama, that every person in the house should watch.The movie is rated R, and is recommended for 15 and over, due to the drug use, language and mild sexuality. Great movie, great storyline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Viewing","review":"This movie is one of the Top 5 movies released in 2001. The movie made me laugh hysterically until I was falling out of my seat, it made me think in a way that very few movies do about my own life and priorities, it made me bawl like a baby, and it made me cheer out loud for the good guys and I felt like hissing at the bad guys in this movie. The humor is subtle and isn't slapstick, it works quite well with the movie. This movie is for anyone that just wants to see an extremely well made movie, that will take them on a rollercoaster of emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"great life drama","review":"This was on the most wonderful studies of life as we live it.Kevin Kline was excellent in this academy award performance.Do not miss this feature film, it will make you laugh and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie","review":"This movie was based on a child that didnt really get along with his father and its about him and his father getting to no eachother well building a house.Honestly this was the based movie i have seen i cried i laughed i cheered anyone would liek this movie it has a bit of everything and i would die to meat Hayden Christensen!!He was great no other movie could be better he was PERFECT for the part i always that that he was PERFECT for the part in strike BUT he was better in this movie than anyother movie he has ever played in.The neighbor was the best for the part as well she was smart prissey but nice and intelligent and pretty.

This movie teaches you alot bout life and watch it see what u can learn!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral low road","review":"I purchased this movie because of the wonderful reviews that I had read, and I will agree that while it was a great movie feel, none of the reviews I read mentioned there was an auto-erotic scene involving the teenage son,(which could lead to dangerous experiments by teenage viewers), there was more than one teenage shower scene, a sex scene between an adult woman and a teenage boy, and a homosexual scene where one boy pimps out the services of the son so he can earn money for drugs. It is too bad that such a wonderful movie was ruined by these overtly sexual scenes. This movie should not have been rated R. It has too much more soft porn,... It would be nice if the movie industry kept this kind of material for x-rated films. Don't buy this one, there's too much garbage to was through to get to the good stuff. I'm sincerely sorry I saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"This movie is so sentimental it makes Artificial Inteligence look like American History X. When an entire film is devoted as an allegory for a house, and not a normal house, a Full House family, you known cringing in your seat will at least provide sweat and the possibility to burn calories. Contrived movies do one thing well; con. Many people were conned into believing this film posesses significance. This film holds about as much significance as a stupid ordinary house. You have your rooms, your kitchen and of course your bathroom, the only holy quarter where one can relieve his or her/self from the burden that weighs one down. However, one can avoid being stuck in the bathroom of a house, cringe in your seat and you'll sweat and burn your burden."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.O Hayden Christensen...","review":"So hella hot in this movie as a goth-punk kid! I love goth-punk boys, so hott...lol but anyways, this movie is a good movie. Jena Malone is in it also. She's a good actress..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never get tired of this movie!!!!","review":"My wife and I saw this on our honeymoon. It was playing on our television on our cruise ship. We enjoyed it so much that we must have watched it three or four times in that seven day span. Kevin Kline is absolutly a great actor. Its about a boy and his father who are not very close. The boy lives with his mom b/c his parents are divorced. When the boys father discovers that he is dying of cancer and is given a short time to live, he asks that his son come and stay with him for the summer and help him build a house. Dispite his rebellous sons complaints, and what seems like disgust of his father........well, I really dont want to give anymore of the movie away, but I can tell you that you wont regret seeing this film. There are so many other interesting events that take place in this movie, and so many suprises. Your garenteed to laugh, cry, and watch this movie over and over. This is one of those rare movies that leaves you feeling good after you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Look At Love And Life...","review":"When I rented this film I had no idea what I had rented, but after seeing this film I found my heart deeply stirred. This was an amazing movie that portrayed interpersonal relationships (the hurts, the joys, the passion, and depth) that so many have experienced in one way or another. I highly recommend this film and hope that it inspires others who are struggling in relationships to believe again that love in action has many rewards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the good acting. This is for \\"feel good,\\" tearjerker fans.","review":"Almost everyone writing reviews of this film love to cry, apparently. The acting is good, but the film becomes much too \\"feel good\\" for me. (One of the shmaltzy musical background bits almost made me stop watching it.) (I recorded it from TV.) I did watch it all the way through, though, and I liked Kevin Kline's acting.For me, the test of a really good film is to want to keep it in my film collection, to see it again sometime. This one got erased as the final credits were rolling. The ending of the film, which some people loved, made me want to erase the film as fast as possible. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you were a house, what kind would you be?","review":"This was an awesome movie. I've been hearing raving reviews about it and when I finally saw it, I loved it. Hayden Christensen truly shines as an actor here, more so than in Star Wars.The movie is about a man who is divorced, his son has gone wild and doesn't care about anything. He gets fired from his job and soon after finds out he's dying. There is the summer left for him to get his son to love him...I want a copy of this movie to buy. I am definitely going to go out and recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life as a House","review":"I walked away from this movie affected more than I have been from a movie in a long time.

Kevin Kline does a superb job acting as a man that changes the course of his life in the face of grave difficulties. Hayden Christensen shows of his true acting ability as Sam, and it is incredibly touching to watch his character develop. It's very easy to relate to the characters, not necessarily to the events of the movie but to the feelings and relationships between the people. There are quite a few parts in the movie that will bring you close to tears if not outright sobbing. This movie is highly recommended for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to see this movie!","review":"This is such a good movie! Kevin Kline plays a man who has a bad relationship with his wife (the lovely Kristin Scott-Thomas) and his son (Hayden Christensen, pre-Anakin Skywalker). A terminal illness forces him to reevaluate his life and try to make the most of the time he has left. This is an incredibly emotional film that always, always makes me cry. All three of the lead performers should have received Oscar nominations, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesnt get any better","review":"Everyone should at least see this film if not own it. Once you see it, it will become one of the most cherished items in any movie lovers collection.Kevin Kline and Hayden Christiansen are outstanding. For young hayden Christiansen this is perhaps the best performance he has given to date. And it doesn't need to be said, but Kline is at the top of his game.The relationships evolving between, father and son, husband and wife/ ex-wife as the case may be, boy and girl, the list goes on and on, are all brilliantly woven together in a story you will watch over and over again. I have owned my copy for over a year and I still watch it at least once or twice a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't deserve anything under 5 stars","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I've seen it at least ten times, and I still love it. The story was well written, and there was great character development.

Still, keep watching. The ending is a beautiful pay-off to the viewing experience. The ever-reliable Kevin Kline and scifi favorites Scott Bakula (from the TV shows Enterprise and Quantum Leap) and Hayden Christensen (from Star Wars, Episodes 2 and 3) give their expected good performances; in fact, all of the actors shine in their own way. The writing seems forced at times, but the acting covers up any weaknesses in the script. As you've heard, bring a tissue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life as a house","review":"This film ,Life as a House, is truly a unique and insightful movie that is packed with true emotion.The acting is amazing from a terrific performance by Kevin Kline to Jena Malone a real favorite among great actors. This has everything you could want in a true to life film,some comedic moments take this film which deals with problems within a semi-dysfunctional family and makes moments that could certainly be heart wrenching and traumatic to open a lighter side. I have a son of similar age to Hayden Christensen character and it certainly opens your eyes inside and out! I can't recommend this film enough,I only wish that I knew of this film when it was first released. Again Jena Malone , who I feel never seems to be in a bad movie and this is certainly no exception;a gift of a film! Enjoy it,with a open mind but you will enjoy this GREAT movie!

He says the boots look like regular work boots but are not heavy and are great for long busy days of constant walking.

So he said he liked them and will do the trick, the only thing for him is that he has trouble putting them on and taking them off. He does not suffer from any kind of joint problem or arthritis that would make it difficult for him . I know that some boots just are plain difficult to put on and take off. Thus far that is his only complaint, but I am not sure if due to the difficulty of putting on and off this will deter him from actually wanting to wear them when he gardens (which is everyday for hours on end).

There's no lining and a really low-end sole insert. More importantly, the sizing is unusual. Unlike other comments that complain the boot is too large, I ordered a size up from my actual shoe size and discovered that while the sole was fine, the calf was way too tight. For rubber boots you want to be able to tuck jeans, etc. INSIDE the boot to keep them dry/clean, and you can't do it with this one. It's WAY too small in the neck, and with no lining, you're just going to rub your leg raw on the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"weather proof steel toe boots","review":"amazing, amazing price on tall, weatherproof, rubber, steel toe boot, i paid $15 for these hard to find boots, great boots, great price, great seller, i would recommend and buy again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Heels are improperly molded, creating a decided slant to the back and outside edge.

All the songs are done well and you will enjoy the whole CD. The CD starts off with a beautiful song called Prayer it has a Celtic flare as much of the album does. Hayley does nice renditions of Both Sides Now, Never Saw Blue, May it Be, You Are Water, She Moves through the fair, My Heart Belongs to You and Ave Maria. Hayley does a nice version of Andrea Bocelli's Song, Dell Amore non Si SA, Heylay sings the lines of the song in English and Bocelli sings the Chorus in Italian, and then at the end of the song Both Bocelli and Westernra sing in Italian together; It sounds wonderful. Then the Album closes with a Gospel song, which is a change up, called I Say Grace. A very good song. Overall a 5 star album and a must have for those who love beautiful singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, but who wrote those songs?!?","review":"Hayley Westenra has a very beautiful voice, and I honestly didn't know what to expect from this cd. The real reason I bought the cd was for the Ave Maria, which is my favorite song on the cd. But when I loaded this cd on my Ipod that was the only song I put on. This cd was just too much for my mental \\"sweet tooth.\\" Singing about ice cream castles and angels, it makes me ask the question to whoever wrote that crap: what world are you living in? Are you here, on Earth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enchanting Voice","review":"Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and do not equal the vocal talent.There was an advertising tag on this CD that stated \\"The female Josh Grobin\\", but I think a more accurate sentiment would be \\"a young Sarah Brightman\\". ODYSSEY is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes, all of which match up well with Westenra's abilities. Bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet, Dell Amore Non Si Sa. They pair up for that one song, but the rest is all Westenra.This is smooth, soothing and easy listening. If you like Brightman, you will truly appreciate the voice of Westenra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was hoping this would be at least as good as Pure I loved so much but this is just a huge step backwards. Every song has a nasal sound to it. I wanted to cry it was so below average, so blase. My sister has a better voice.Each song was more boring than the next. It took effort, real effort just to listen to them. Im so depressed.I kinda liked Both Sides Now and even then she sorta butchered that one, to. It made me sad cause I know she had a good voice before. I dont know what happened to it as its not the same as it was on Pure.I like Hayley Westenra. I only wish I liked Odyssey. It is a major disappointment.Heres hoping the next one returns to the greatness of Pure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Covers Honey!","review":"Don't get me wrong, Hayley is alright.

Do these record execs think that us music buyers are so gullible that changing the album cover and adding a couple of 'new' tracks are going to make us buy a brand new cd? Well, I'm just not impressed with this girl's voice to buy 5 different Odyssey versions just for the sake of obtaining 5 extra songs. She has a pretty enough voice but it tends to be flat and far too pretty without real emotion behind it.Scarborough fair? What you never know? Sarah Brightman-esque much???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...A True Talent!","review":"I was really surprised to read the less than stellar reviews on this CD. I think she is an extraordinary singer, and does an excellent job on \\"Odyssey\\". So what if she doesn't write her own songs! How many singers do?? What were you doing at 18!!It's a mellow CD, lots of love songs and beautiful music. My favorite is \\"May It Be\\"; I want to keep putting it on repeat, it's so mesmerizing and magical!If you want to just hear beautiful music from a true talent, then get this CD. I'm now going to buy the DVD to watch Hayley perform these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haley does it again!!!! ***** album","review":"Haley Westenra has done it again.

Really want a studio high quality CD of their duets..."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"I am only going to comment on the first track of this CD , \\"Prayer\\". Hayley Westenra has a great voice, but she's simply not suited for this song. The song is composed and originally performed by Secret Garden in their release of \\"Dawn Of A New Century\\". In \\"Dawn Of A New Century\\", the song is performed in such a way that it brings out the feeling of harmony and intimacy of prayers (the singer isn't the center point of the whole song). However, in this CD, Hayley simply sings through the song with her big voice, which totally destroyed the intimacies of prayers. Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled that Hayley had chosen Secret Garden's music as her first track on this CD. But she has to either change her singing style for this type of songs, or she will have to sing songs that suit her big voice well. If you like the \\"Prayer\\", give Secret Garden's version a try; I am sure you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Video!","review":"This is a really good video of the band live in Japan.

KEF differs from the competition in that they use a coaxial midrange/tweeter design. The advantage is mostly in coherency and imaging. The low range drivers flesh things out and blend seamlessly. Regardless, a sub is definitely recommended. They're capable of filling a large room without distorting. When they do reach their limit, the bass drivers chuff a little. They're very smooth and comparable to a pair of speakers I use with ribbon tweeters. In the world of higher end speakers, these are definitely a bargain. The fit and finish is excellent with a unique cabinet design. Two pairs of banana plugs are available for those that want to bi-amp or bi-wire. Note that the 600 price Amazon lists is for one speaker. You'll pay 1200 for a pair.

There's everything a self-publisher might need to know like how to construct a publishing timeline, how to calculate the size of a print run, ideas on how to sell more copies, how to cut costs, how to deal with printers and even how to organise a book launch.The aspect I really love is that this book caters for those who want to do a small print run (even a single, special book) as well as for those who want thousands of copies. A little of the information (copyright in particular) is specific to the Australian and New Zealand markets, but most of this book is universal in appeal - there's plenty in it to make it worth buying no matter where you live.This is one terrific book and one I recommend unreservedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Safety's Sake....Buy this Attachment!","review":"The Microplane graters are an absolute must-have in any kitchen. Cheese simply disappears into fluffy mounds within seconds. BUT...the sharpness of the blades creates a potential safety hazard. If your fingers come into contact with the blades, count on receiving a nasty cut. The slider attachment is a small price to pay for security.Hard cheeses and nutmeg are very easy to grate with the attachment although as a previous reviewer noted, you must use small chunks. The results will impress you. Soft cheeses however, are a little harder to grate. The cheese tends to mash against the blade unless you apply the right amount of pressure and keep up a steady grating motion. It will however, produce finely shredded cheese.That is a mere quibble with the attachment. It will 'complete' your Microplane grater set and you can confidently and safely use this remarkable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea but not all that","review":"When I bought my coarse microplane I saw this little doo dad next to it and thought, 'cool! something to save my fingers from the sharp blades of the microplane!'I took them home and tried them out together.

Added on top of that you had to hold the stuff and the lid over the top of it.

That may be fun for high school, but I needed something more professional looking and feeling. This pack is solid and rigid, is just the right size, has all the necessary compartments, looks professional and has a base that makes is stable upright. The soft top handle is comfortable.

And if the movie was supposed to be based on the book, it should have followed the book.

Also, the novel give a better account of both historical and fictional events. Salma had the right idea; however, the film came short of being powerful and unduring.

I bought the small guard to go with it but haven't used it yet since most everything I've grated so far has been a lemon and/or lime skin. I can see where some things like maybe garlic, horseradish or ginger would work well in the guard and be a real plus to own. Would most definitely buy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great microplane","review":"This is a great microplane which seems very sturdy. I love that it's all stainless steel. My only complaint is that there are three sticky labels on it! I removed the labels but the sticky is left behind. I have been soaking the microplane all afternoon and still haven't removed all the stickiness!! I wish they would package it and label the packaging, NOT the item itself!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent product, horrible packaging","review":"This is an excellent product, but the manufacturer or the retailer put not one but two hard-to-peel labels directly on the grater. Are these people numb? You cannot peel it off without cutting yourself, they wouldn't soak off in soapy water, and if you try to use a scrubby, you just end up grating your scrubby. It earned my \\"WTF Award\\" for Xmas 2012 just based on the idiotic labeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"We have a set of three of these graters over 10 years ago. We got sick and tired of rotary grinders, saw the Microplane's in Switzerland and picked them up. At the time they were made in the USA (perhaps still are). Unusual as US cookware does not sell, at all, in Europe, and in spite of it being made in the USA, the quality was superb.These grinders rock. They can take a beating, stay sharp as a razor no matter what you put through them and are stable and easy to handle. One comment though, keep your knuckles clear of the teeth when you get close to the end of whatever you're grinding. They are sharp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use, best grater","review":"For so long I have been using inferior graters as microplane products are very expensive in Aus. Finally bit the bullet and brought several, love them all and the covers that come with them protect the product and my hands when getting th in and out of the drawer. Love this for spices and lemon/lime zest"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"I had high hopes for this zester. I own a very basic microplane classic zester (model 40001) and it seems like after a few years of use it's gotten a bit dull in places. So I ordered this zester. I loved the fact that it's stainless steel throughout and won't break like the ones with plastic handles. But I find the teeth to be just too small, items kind of catch and skip, but don't slide. I am always afraid of skinning my fingers on this. It's very difficult to grate anything, from lemon zest, to nutmeg, to garlic, which is what I am used to using my old microplane bar zester for. I always try to use this one, but give up and use my old one instead.Perhaps I will try one with larger teeth, but I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Easy to use, easy to clean.

I didn't even know it was out. He doesn't have the promotion like other rappers who aren't even an 1/8 as nice as him. This album is definately a classic. I have always liked AZ's rhyme style, the guy is deep and he is on another level compared to the emcees dropping there trash today. It's just too bad he didn't have better promotion. I highly recommend this album if you are looking to add a classic album to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Az","review":"az is an underground legend and it continues here nice preformance and range on this disc he has deep songs and a couple club bangers check it out y'all9.5 of 10 lyrics 9.5 of 10 beats"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical Perfection","review":"First and for most I must agree that this album has to be THE BEST lyrical form of expression I have heard since Biggie's and Tupac's untimely demise. I first copped this album after hearing one song . . . I was hooked. This is an album that we needed for the summer of 2K2. AZ hits you with laid back beats, tight ... collaborations(song # 5 w/Nas) and hella ... flows for your mind. I guarantee that YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM. Get at this album like yesterday.-One"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment? I want my money back!","review":"I just downloaded this album, I know somebody already stated this but this album feels like a P.Diddy/Jay-Z album. Its feels SO mainstream,commercialized,overproduced r&b; beats and some of the subject matter ohhh man. I was hoping to find something like Doe or Die,some mafioso type of hip hop from him. Why AZ? There's only a few good tracks on here,which I recommend to just download a few tracks. Here are my picks:track 5. The Essencetrack 7. Fan Mailtrack 8. Paradisetrack 11. Hustlertrack 12. Rebirth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is Aziatic so slept on?","review":"This album deserves 6 stars. Az displays the essence of hip hop in this classic. I have no ideal why this album is not certifed platinum; The 50 cents of the world can sell millions while constantly spitting the same old stuff(ill rob and kill you), without the truth gift of lyrical talent and flow. On the other hand, Az brings you into a focus realm of knowledge and flow. The album is incredible. AZ delivers a message to the youth, a track for the ladies, and a incredible track where he puts his fan mail to beats. Amazing! This album is almost 2 years old and it remains in my car. A classic, enough said. STOP SLEAPING ON AZ. THIS IS FIRE! Keep real hip hop alive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the Best Album of 2002","review":"Year 2002 was the year of a lot of .... hip hop cds. Well, Aziatic wasn't one of them. This is his best album. The second-best rap album in year 2002 behind Scarface's The Fix. I can't stop bumpin that booty chasin' \\"Take It Off,\\" though \\"Wanne Be There\\" and \\"Essence\\" are the best songs. I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars if Amazon would allow me to. Anyway, the only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because it has one garbage song \\"Take Care of Me.\\" That song was too bad to overlook, but 13 out of 14 songs are bangers. AZ's back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but it received too much hype.","review":"AZ is one of the better rappers from the East Coast, but he has never blown up like Nas. In as sense this is good, because his rap remains faithful to his personality. This is better than half of the rap out there right now, but AZ is becoming more commercial.The album is good, but not as good as 9 lives for the simple reason that on too many occasions, AZ raps over mediocre beats. The track with Nas could have been better. Apart from these two weaknesses, I have nothing else to complain about this album. One can't complain about AZ'S flows-they are almost perfect-but if he had rapped over better beats, this album would have been a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album By AZ","review":"First Off this AZ album is really good, it might not have the emotion and feeling as Doe or Die but its just as good then any of the recent s**t that been going on, Rappers who cannot rap are getting platinum albums, now AZ's worse song in this album is \\"Take It Off\\" and its better than any 50 cent song i heard.This guy is just under-rated if it was upto me i would rank him above the likes of Nas, no disrespect to Nas but AZ did kill him on \\"Life is a B***h\\" on illmaticOverall Album Score By Me 9/10(just because of that one song..But still great songs like \\"Fan Mail\\" Make up for it)Must Have for a True Rap Fan(if you like rhymes by 50cent dont buy this, you wont understand one line)Peace Out.."},{"rating":"1","title":"True headz look elsewhere","review":"I heard from a few people that the new AZ album was really tight so I got a copy of it and was really disappointed. First of all, if you are a fan of the album Doe or Die and its raw east coast beats provided by Pete Rock and Buckwild amongst others, then look elsewhere. This whole album is so commercialized you will confuse the beats for those heard on albums like Puffy's and Jay-Z's, I'm talking seriously wack beats with way too much r&b tendency. It doesn't even sound like a rap album. If you are a fan of played out commercialized bland hip hop then get this album, but if you are looking for that raw energy AZ dished out on Doe or Die, then keep listening to that because it still holds as his best album to date and none of his others can even compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone mainstream?","review":"When i got the classic \\"Doe or Die\\" i thought Az had a lot of talent and potential, but as his next few albums dropped, \\"pieces of a man\\" and \\"9 lives\\" i slowly lost hope. Every new album that dropped the more mainstream it sounded until finally Aziatic was released. reading other people reviews on this site made me hope that he went back to his doe or die style/rawness and i decided to cop the album. I listened to a couple songs and it made me sick. for the exception of #'s 5 , 7 , 8 which were OK but not great the songs sounded as mainstream as u can get. Overly produced beats, lack of lyrical horizons, an all out dissapointment for real hip hop heads. IF u wanna hear REAL hip hop buy his album \\"Doe or Die\\" u wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"once again flawless flow","review":"AZ's talent has never been disputed but this cd brings to an end any notion that he can't consistently find a decent beat. pieces of a man showed weaknesses in that area but the flow has always been off the chart. aziatic finally combines for the first time since doe or die his ill flow with blazin production!! AZ says he doesn't need or want the fame but it would be nice to see a true rapper rapping about things other than the bling bling over and over making it commercially. I have always been a major Nas fan with AZ trailing closely behind. in my opinion this cd pushes AZ right next to Nas as top dog of the east coast. the one line that shows AZ's true status is on Just Wanna Be There when he raps \\"never sold millions but....... i'm here to save the babies\\". AZ keep pushing and maybe one day everyone will wake up and cop this album and his others"},{"rating":"2","title":"People Stop Sleeping on AZ","review":"This is one of the best albums of 2002. Not to many rappers can have some commercial flava in an album and still keep it real and AZ is one of them. He has some club bangers and some real hip hop joints in an album (which is rare). People seriously gotta stop sleeping on AZ, I hope this album goes platinum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Back Bangin Albums","review":"Yes this album is tight. And Az's album called 9 Lives (released before this one) is just as dope. I say AZ and Syles have the 2 hottest rap albums this year. No lie. peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"AZ is at it again........","review":"True Hiphop is back AZ is a lyrical genius. I highly recommend this record. I did not think AZ could follow up \\"9 lives\\" with such strenght but I was obviously wrong. AZ has risen once again and delivered a great Hiphop album, forget what you heard about nelleyville if you must buy a record buy Aziatic. In the name of the Force who is the Source. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AZ is \\"Rather Unique\\"","review":"I have followed this man since his career began and his spiritual & proverbial lyrics has impacted my life in many aspects. No, Im not a crazy or obsessed fan, but on each album he drops, his life and mine are paralell in certain ways. To put it all into perspective the industry should be much obliged to give AZ his fruit. Az has become a victim of commercialism the game displays today. It's sad because Az may not be the head of his class, but it does not take long to call the roll. -AllotofVision-"},{"rating":"2","title":"AZCRACKED IT","review":"Az has finally arrived, he has produced a tight album good production, he seems to have taken up a formula out of Jay- Z blueprint album, to quite a good effect. In a time where hip-hop is suffereing AZ album is a breath of fresh air, and his lyrics and flow are tight. The best track on the album is, \\"The Essence\\" with Nas just to here both rappers trading verses to a soulful loop is a delight, other stand out tracks are A1 perfomance, Take it off, Wanna be there and I'm back. If you bought the Blueprint go and kop this album, you are missing out if this album isn't already in your album collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good figure overall","review":"The first bit of bad news. Balthier's head fell off the moment I took the figure out of the package. From the looks of it, the head wasn't molded on properly. The good news is that I was able to glue the head back on. There's a limitation to head articulation, but then again, who really goes out of their way to turn a figure's head endlessly anyways? The arm and waist articulation is pretty good. The leg articulation is decent, but not as good as some of the other figures out there. The figure stands well with of without the stand. A good figure overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balthier is a great addition to any collection.","review":"The reason it has such low stars on fun and education is because it is not really meant to be a \\"toy\\" that you play with.

There are a couple of other OK songs on here, but in my opinion, there are also some stinkers. Although I am not a fan or proponent of download music services while they are so expensive, this is one instance where I would say if there is a song you particularly like off the show, go download it there.

Heat from sleeping in them will dispell any wrinkles on the first night, in my experience. It's possible that your house is not properly humidified, as this helps with evening out wrinkles.For $15, these sheets simply can't be beat. They're smooth, well made (no loose threads) and very sturdy - definitely not thin like most other sheets. They are almost hotel quality.The only qualm that we had was that the pillow cases included were not actually pillow cases, but sham cases. This is not a problem if you already have pillow cases, but be aware that if you are buying these for a complete set, as the included cases are likely much too large for normal pillows.

The typical theme of teens going to a place to party and have a good time and end up being killed by a maniac, one by one. The acting in the movie plain sucks as do the special effects. The whole story is poorly done. Someone needs an F for this job. Watch it if you want to learn how to not make a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHREDDER WHEAT","review":"SHREDDER is filled with many of the cliches that abound in this ominously overused genre. Slasher killer on the slopes who kills for revenge, and particularly those who don't follow the orders of the vacated resort. There are some incredibly funny scenes like the poor girl dangling from the ski lift that no one seems to notice. Brad Hawkins' horrible European accent, whatever country he's supposed to be from. The horrid overacting of Lindsey McKeon; the deadpan awfulness of Scott Weinger. There are few chills and those that do come are highly predictable.Not the worst of the slasher lot, but definitely a sign to leave this genre alone for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low On Originality and Scares","review":"Shredder may have been not quite a low budget movie. It had a high budget for a straight-to-video film. However, it was low on originality and scares. The movie's originality was so basic. When the ending came up I thought to myself \\"Of course I should of known.\\" The ending was completely un-original. Also the movie wasn't quite scary. Although I did like one murder. But Bottom-Line is that it wasn't one of the worst straight-to-video horror movies I ever saw, but it wasn't one of the best either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsey Mckeon is a goddess!!!","review":"This is a slasher with a standard plot and an extraordinary female star. Lindsey McKeon,(you may remember her from \\"Saved by the Bell:The New Class\\" or from her current role on CBS's \\"Guiding Light\\"), is the reason to see this movie. She is an Emmy nominated actress who gives a strong, seductive and revealing (not nude} performance that is definitely worth checking out. It's not \\"Citizen Cane\\", but she is very, VERY fun to watch. Frankly, this may not be the movie she wants you to see her in, but, it is a movie that demonstrates her star potential. She's willing to take chances, she packs some serious heat and she's got the talent to back it all up. I'm sure great roles are in her future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay so far...some concerns","review":"I bought this and the first thing I noticed was no power supply.

I reformatted to get out of the FAT32 and still 149GB. The hard drive capacity shows 160GB but whatever they put on there to run the drive takes up 11GB! That is huge. My operating system on my pc doesn't even take up that much space.It was easy and total plug-n-play. It took about an hour to back up 19GB, which included confirming the files.

Big mistake! My Imac didn't recognize the drive and I needed a software patch from Smartdisk, but I had to go to another Mac with an older operation system than what was on my G5. Then, once that software patch was saved onto my new hard drive, I still had to reformat the drive to work on an Apple. Confused?! So was I!

I have a laptop with WinXP. The drive will mysteriously 'disconnect' without warning. For example, it just disconnected 4 times in the time it took to copy 500 MB. The first 3 times, the drive would reconnect when I unplugged then re-plugged the firewire. After the fourth time, the drive would not reconnect at all. It would only connect again after restarting the computer.This is typical of every time I've attempted to use the drive. I exchanged it, because I thought it was broken. However, the replacement drive has the same exact problem.The size and the design of the drive are okay. I was impressed with the features and the price.

I exchanged it for a replacement and tried that out. While it does seem to do all that it claims, I was amazed to find that this multi-disc player has NO multi-disc functions! To change discs, you have to get up and push a button on the front of the machine. If I am doing that I might as well change the disc myself. I expected as a minimum that it would play 5 audio CDs in sequence - it won't, and it won't play 2 movies in a row either. Also, the remote stopped working for a while, then started again. My experience with RCA/GE is that the quality control has been terrible for several years, and it seems nothing has changed. I will return this unit and buy a better brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays Everything I Throw At It","review":"At first I was a little disappointed by this unit because it does ocasionally lock up for no reason, but unplugging and then (re)plugging the unit always restores it back to factory settings. Be careful when moving the unit since it is easy to cause discs to become lodged back near the reader. What I love about this DVD player (and I'm looking for another used one) is that it plays every disc I throw at it, whether PAL or NTSC, with strange color formats, widescreen or fullscreen, and I like the direct remote buttons for subtitles, audio, views, etc. If you like to burn your own dvd's, this is a great player for your home burned collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I own this unit and it does not function properly. If I am not unplugging it in order to reset it so that it will turn off or on, I am banging my head against the wall while attempting to get it to play factory DVDs and CDs. The unit also tends to skip ahead a chapter when the fast-forward button is pushed. This piece of equipment is frustrating to try to use.

Usually, the characters of Smith's books are compelling and interesting, but in Alice at Heart they are colorless, at the most an intense beige. I understand this book is a first in a series, but it will be the the last and only one on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to quit less than halfway thru","review":"Wow, I hope I got this for free but I really don't remember. It was soooo slow and so detailed I felt as though it was more about Alice's hairstyle and her singing than anything mermaid related. The author was trying so desperately to draw a fantastical picture for the reader, that I think the plot was forgotten. I read almost half the book hoping something would begin to happen. It didn't. If you love to read magical descriptions and have a pretty picture painted for you, this is the book. If you like substance skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"This was a fun and interesting story. A few twists and turns, a little mystery, some fantasy, a love story on many levels. I quite enjoyed it, and I will be putting it on my list to read again someday. I've never read a mermaid story quite like this, with the mermaids being more like benevolent young/old ladies than anything else. This book was filled with likable characters that I would have liked to have gotten to know even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Alice at Heart","review":"What an..odd book.First, the bad things. The cover art is HORRIBLE. Seriously, I never wanted to pick up this book. It looks like something out of the 70's. Horrible, horrible cover. Also, the type is horrible. It's huge. The book should have been half as long as it was because of how big that type was.Story-wise, this was like reading ..hm, a peaceful mystery? I guess. The characters had interesting depths and quirks to them. Their motto really made no sense and the story moved at a snails pace.I'm being generous giving the book 2 stars, and it only gets that because the characters were interesting - but they aren't interesting enough for me to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I was lucky enough to get this as a promotional free kindle edition and I was pleasantly surprised. The writing was fantastic and completely sucked me in and the world Smith creats is enchanting and incredibly real. The story was sweet and while I may have gotten frustrated with Alice at times, I see that as a compliment to the writer as she created a well-rounded believable character. This story left me wanting more in a good way.

The feminity of the characters and the lush love that is displayed between them had my heart longing and growing with every page. The sheer beauty of these women (from their thick, lustrous hair to their jewel fashioned finned toes) and the way they love each other and the adventures of the mysterious sea all folded together so nicely it was a dream to read. A beautiful book of adventure, love, chance and finding who you are and loving yourself with all of your uniqueness. Who are you at heart?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Story","review":"This is not the type of story that I would usually read. I have never really been into fantasy storys.

While the author has a wonderful way with words, at 72% of the book......nothing has happened yet. The characters of the sisters are still so one dimensional, Alice is so very vanilla and some of the dialogue borders on the absurd. While there is nothing really hate-able about this book, it's not swoon worthy either, if I can't find another book to download, I may finish it. That being said, I'm going to be searching rather actively for another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing premise","review":"I enjoyed this book and appreciated the world created by the author. The love story was predictable and I figured out the mystery early. however, I didn't mind that at all. I wanted to see how it played out.

Even Alice is transformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Paranormal/Fantasy","review":"Although you'll find some typical situations and plots, this book was fresh due to the \\"mermaid\\" theme. I normally don't like a full page of descriptions of the scene in front of a character (i.e. how the beach looked, or what the house looked like). I tend to just want to get to the story. But, this author was able to describe scenery in a captivating way that entertwined with the story. I liked the heroine of the story. Overall, it was worth my time and I will most likely buy another ebook from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I've always like Deborah Smith's books, but something about this one was really special.

Got a great mix, from the rocking poppy tunes Reach (Caleigh peters) and You Set Me Free (Michelle Branch) to the funky, retro sounding Lucy Woodward, who sings It's Oh So Quiet-- the tune that plays during the recital featuring all those cute kids in flower costumes. Now whenever I hear the song No One (Aly and A.J.), I can't help but think of the film's opening sequence, Casey gracefully skating and clearing her mind on the pond near her house. The effect that song has is similar to that of the song Perfect Day, also an opening sequence song, which is in the movie Legally Blonde. You just hear it and suddenly you're in the movie. Great CD-- perfect for a day out with the girls or just for shaking your booty in your room or flitting around the house pretending like you're an ice skater.

Focusing matches from the WCW Television shows will really give it that feeling of why you can see why WCW was so great and why it fell. I would say that you don't include any high-profile Pay-Per-View matches at all! All these matches can be found on WWE Superstar DVDs (The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, Legends of Wrestling, etc.) and anthology DVDs like The Essential Starrcade.Grabbing matches from Saturday Night, Power Hour, Main Event, Saturday Morning Pro, World Wide, Nitro, Thunder and Clash of the Champions...would make this DVD a true gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliving World Championship Wrestling","review":"Wow, at last WWE is finally releasing the very best of WCW on DVD with the rise and fall of World Championship Wrestling.I just hope WWE covers the birth of WCW from when Ted Turner bought the company under Jim Crockett in 1988 to Eric Bischoff as the president who ran WCW to the debut of Nitro, nWo, Goldberg's rise to stardom, Sting, and heaps others.As much as i love the WWF/E, WCW was my favorite as well for certainly one reason at the time, Bill Goldberg and now the nWo, Sting, Sid Vicious, etc.Yes, thanks WWE and give you credit for the Monday Night War DVD, nWo, The Best of Starrcade and now Rise & Fall of WCW.The sad thing, however, Eric Bischoff is not going to be part of this new production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome boxset ...Great edition","review":"Absolutely loved wcw ..this dvd set is a great edition for any wrestling fan ..the extras are great but i feel could have used a bit more matches ...the documentary itself is informative with just a few important factors left out such as, if only we can 1 day be previledged to get an interview from Mr. WCW himself Steve Borden \\"Sting\\" also 1 fall in WCW that were not mentioned was the short term apperance by the Ultimate Warrior i believe this was a huge impact in the companys history but was failed to be mentioned ...

While there are new interviews from people such as Kevin Sullivan, Harvey Schiller, Bill Watts, etc. it comes off rushed and recycled and was a major let down. Those that know a lot about wrestling history know a ton of important facts were left out of this DVD. This might be the worst Documentary that WWE has ever done. It was a major let down in my opinion and I would rather see some sort of indie documentary about the rise and fall of WCW, similar to \\"The Heroes of World Class\\" where actual research is done and more people are interviewed with less fluff, while being more in depth.

Nothing on Sting, Nikita Koloff, The Stiener Bros, The Varsity Club, The 4 Horsemen, Lex Luger , Barry Windham, Ron Simmons, Road Warriors, the Great Muta, Dusty....NWA/WCW had the best rivalries and title matches. They had Good guys vs Good guys which was unheard of in the WWE until Warrior/Hogan. This leaky ship jumped right into the Monday Night Wars which was significant but focused on who ran WCW more than the wrestlers. It also had a bitter WWE feel to it like the WCW was a shithouse.

And while the Monday Night War was very one sided, I think that this documentary will be more even. Former WCW'ers like Big Show, Ric Flair, Rey Mysterio, Hurricane Helms, Chavo Guerrero, Arn Anderson, William Regal, Ricky Steamboat, Dean Malenko and Jim Ross all will be included for sure. Plus I'm sure they have stock footage of Hall, Nash, Booker, Bischoff, Steiner, Bret (from his dvd), Eddie and Goldberg talking about it as well.

Ross has turned into a WWE house boy, and TS was the voice for the promotion for nearly 20 years. It was bad enough we had to stomach him on the AWA DVD....a company he never worked for and had nothing to do with, but he said a little too much, and the World Class DVD for that matter. I am sick of Jim Ross, when he talks about these other promotions, he always has to add the WWE twist on it, how they are successful and how the other companies crumbled. Tony Schivone should have been on this DVD, I always liked him better than Jim Ross anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great matches, terrible documentary","review":"This set has some great matches attached to it that are worth seeing.

You can get one of those WWEClassics subscriptions and get access to MUCH better matches than this DVD set had.The documentary portion was a disappointment. A big one.They spent too much time on how WCW came to be, and not enough time on what WCW was when it was at it's highpoint and how bad it was when it died. It's almost like they forgot to include more than five minutes of coverage for 1999-2001. They could've covered nWo Wolfpac vs nWo Hollywood, Raven's Flock, Millionaire's Club/New Blood feud, some of WCW's crazy endings that made NO sense.

Included are easy to follow explanations which guide the student from the simple through the more advanced techniques of blues piano. An accompanying CD gives the student a bass and drums rhythm accompainment at various tempos. Here's an overall view quoted from Swain:\\"I approached the writing of this book alway asking: what concepts have proved essential to my own growth and to the growth of my students? With this question as the focal point, the book began to write itself.

Heather's character doesn't want to get divorced because her mom stoically refused to do same for the sake of the children. Oh, but Heather's character doesnt have children.Can movies be on prozac?

An earlier review likened this movie to a Woody Allen movie - there's no resemblance - Woody Allen's movies, generally, are very witty and insightful whereas this movie was merely crude.

Somewhat like Woody Allen, (a writer/director/actor who makes most of his films in New York)although Burns' films ring truer, and are in my opinion funnier.\\"Sidewalks\\" is, like his other films, an honest look at everyday people and this thing we call love. The film is humourous, touching, and insightful. Although, since the movie is shot in documentary style, it makes it seem even more like a slice of life. With on-street interviews, jarring camera work and jump-cuts, the movie has the look of a PBS piece.

He's a talented actor. As for writing and directing, he's no Woody Allen. I found this film to be very amusing. At the same time, it has a distinct Woody Allen-esque feel that was somewhat wasted on the material. From the music to the style of filming, it seemed like Mr. Burns too strictly emulated his predecessor. That being said, what was better about the Burns film in comparison to Allen films was that while Allen reserves his best dialogue for the male characters, Burns assigns the best lines to his female characters. The best was the intermittent discussion of cologne on balls. The only thing that could have been better would have been to answer the question, \\"Why do some men put cologne on their balls?\\" Thanks, Mr. Burns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STALE ROMANCE, TRIES ON A WOODY ALLEN DRESS, FORGETS CHARM","review":"Overdrawn conversations and inter-twined relationships in Manhattan. Can't get any more Woody Allen than that. Yet there is so much wrong with this movie that makes it an ersatz, charmless clone of Allen's films.The cinematography is (perhaps purposefully) scattershot, cutting abruptly between long scenes. This doesn't really make for the stylization that the directors were apparently going for, it just comes off as epileptic camerawork.Then there is slobby vulgarity including adoloscent malarkey about applying cologne to your pubic areas or forgetting to shower before dates. There is an annoyingly prolonged shot of Ed Burns' armpits.What really gets your goat after a while though is the endless chitter chatter that lacks any semplance of sense or wit.While the movie does have its moments, an occasion or two where you may even laugh out loud, overall it is a disappointing waste of film.

And it ranges forward through time, ending with Renato Guttuso, who was born in 1912 and died in 1987.There is a separate section for each artist, with greater artists getting more space than the lesser. For instance, there are sixteen illustrations of the art of Giambattista Tiepolo, but two for his less talented son, Giandomenico Tiepolo.

The movie is obliquely about her character, but she is on screen for ten minutes or so. It reminded me of a cross between Amelie and the Richard Linklater movie Slacker, but with none of the charm of the former and none of the character of the latter. Most of the characters are losers, but instead of being loveable, interesting losers, you keep hoping that one or more of them will get hit by a bus or something. The only one to root for is Audrey Tautou, but her fate is decided by some idiot throwing stones at a statue in a park, so there's no point in hoping.Most importantly: while this movie is rated R, it is for a pointless scene of unflattering full frontal nudity of a man, and the actresses who would have been quite appealing in some stage of dishabille remain fully clothed. That alone is reason to get your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Boring.","review":"Maybe I was a bit tired. Maybe it was the hot humid day.

Big koi and smaller koi. I also noticed while cleaning my filter, that there were small things moving around.In four years I've had the pond, nothing like this has ever happened before.

The one answer I didn't get was why Mao Zedong thought this was a good idea. Although there are countless good things I can say about this movie, the things that stick in my mind the most are the grotesque sex (for lack of a better word) scenes. They just made me sick.

Particularly the last hour is a transparent set-up culminating in a manipulative ending. It is a shame really that this movie went the path of melodrama, because an honest portayal of sent-down youth would be extremely interesting. There is no doubt of the insanity of the Cultural Revolution, but the reality was far more complicated than Joan Chen wants to portray here. Ironically, she seems in the end to be making a anti-PRC film as propaganda driven as anything originating from the Cultural Revolution.

If however, the prospect of watching one of the bleakest, most disturbing loss of innocence films gives you pause, this is fair warning. Joan-sorry about the one-star. It's not the directing, acting or cinematography (all of which is stellar).It's just that sick feeling you get when the credits roll and you realize you just watched an innocent person destroyed to their core. There is no pleasure in this film. But maybe that's the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"gratuitous tragedy","review":"i felt like i'd been beaten over the head with violence. then i felt like a puppeteer (joan chen) pulled at my heartstrings like a sad violin. all this would have been fine, and even good, if after the movie i felt there had been some truth revealed some chaos ordered into art. some character fleshed out beyond the narrow role of the story. but there wasn't. this is the kind of movie that leaves me furious --- a hallmark card made by someone with far too much talent to sink to this. it was heavyhanded melodrama, and perhaps the most gratuitous and two dimensional treatment i've seen in recent years.ugh, save yourself some grief and don't see this movie. if youre gonna be censored for what you do, at least make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desicration of innocence","review":"Joan Chen was going for a movie about China on the surface, but what I really saw was a movie about weak people. Xiu Xiu sells her self in vain for the sliver of hope that she might be sent home. Men coming into her and Loa Jins tent in the middle of the night to rape her, and she takes it! How she was objectified and blatantly used enraged and depressed me. Lao Jin (lopsang) understands XuiXui(lulu)yet does almost nothing to stop her, yet he loves her. Her innocence is destroyed and she might as well be dead, she is worth nothing to herself anymore. I am disturbed, and enlightened. I am provoked and stirred. Congrats Chen.

While there are students with B's on their transcripts attending these schools, these students also scored within a high 20 to mid 20 on their tests, and I am certain that they have 3.o plus gpas.I guess my major difficulty with the book is that is doesn't deliver what the title promises.

Rotella finds much to love in the south, including the people who've always been tied to the land; the beauty of the land with its mountains and oceans; and the produce, that is, the oranges and the olives and the incredible figs.Rotella has a nice way of telling a story.

The digital one registered 14 degrees F low, and then in a separate trial two degrees F too low.So I decided to compare them on some salmon I was cooking. The analog thermometers were consistent with each other, reading 120 degrees F. The digital one first read 92 degrees F, and then read 186 degrees F.

Definitely worth the money--a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Currently occupying the rear of the junk drawer","review":"Ordered this thermometer to take advantage of more precise digital temps, but overall found that a standard old fashioned thermometer is better at this price point.There are two major cons with this unit in my opinion.1. Takes a fair amount of time to register the temperature. My understanding is you can buy more expensive digital units which register the meat temp very quickly, this is not one of those.2. Breaks or runs out of battery juice fairly quickly. This should draw little power and I would expect to last years and years on a battery. But mine died within a year.So, since this is no faster at registering temp than an old fashioned thermometer and is more likely to fail, I don't see a reason to use this over one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficiently durable.","review":"When I first got this thermometer I thought I had gotten away with something. It wasn't as fast as the Thermapen is alleged to be, but it was plenty fast, accurate and dirt cheap.Unfortunately, after a year, the little rubber stopper to the battery compartment is broken, the numbers are too faded to read from a distance and the accuracy is gone. Sigh, I guess it's time to put that expensive Thermapen on the ol' wish list.I gave it two stars instead of just one because theoretically you could buy a new one every year for 10 years and still not spend as much as on the industry's big gun. If that's how you roll, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, disappointing junk.","review":"Thermometer arrived, didn't work out of the packaging, tested the battery, dead.

It doesn't come with a clip to hold it to the side of a pan, which has caused me many problems.I've dropped mine into hot pans multiple times, because I don't always have a hand to keep on it, and if I pull it out, the reading goes down and takes a while to come back up. Because I dropped it into something at 165 C, the covering over the display wrinkled, but it still works, and is still water proof.I recommend buying a thermometer clip to go with it, or buy something else.

And that seems fine and tolerant of my high grilling temperatures. However, it is really, really slow, sometimes taking 10 seconds to stabilize on a temperature. It also requires you do insert an inch into whatever you're cooking. I don't grill things that thick on the grill all that often. This was mainly a bad choice to get this thermometer based upon the type of cooking I usually do; but, I don't see much of a need for it in other types of cooking in which non-pen-like thermometers would be better suited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations...that remain unfufilled","review":"I have been searching for a reliable, instant readout digital thermometer for a while now. I don't expect to find one that will survive a dishwasher or a nuclear holocaust; but I would hope at the least that it would survive hand washing and become a reliable part of my kitchen for the next year or so.Unfortunately, what I got was a cute, bright colored thermometer that died in less than 5 uses. I never submerged it in water; I always turned the unit off when not using it. I used it for less than a minute each time.I figured that it was something I did. Maybe it got hit by some stray bit of water (I had no idea that it was meant to be waterproof and had been treating it with kid gloves). It wasn't until I went online to buy a new one that I even found out that it was supposed to be waterproof.At $13-$15 dollars retail, I figure that my instant readouts cost about $2.50 to $3 dollars each."},{"rating":"1","title":"digital thermometer","review":"I was very unhappy with the product performance. It takes longer than the time indicated in the user information to reach a stable temperature. The readout is very difficult to see as the characters are quite small and the contrast is not great.

The only redeeming feature is the battery saver which turns it off after a few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty accurate, inexpensive thermometer","review":"I have had a few of these thermometers and I find them to be pretty accurate. If you leave them outside then you must put them in a ziploc freezer bag to make sure they don't get wet (as that will eventually rust the battery connectors). You can drop them a couple of times but they aren't rugged so be careful with them. Replacing the battery has worked about 1/2 the time but I just buy them in pairs so I'm not left without one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"The thermometer worked for a month or so and then could not be adjusted and it fogged up so you could not see the digital readout (it is supposed to be waterproof and I was pretty careful with submerging it in water because of other reviews).

Out of the box, this thermometer read 42 instead, which is of course what calibrating if for. Except that the calibration screw on this unit doesn't do a thing. Even then, I figured I could just mentally subtract 10 degrees to all my measurements, which although far from ideal, is still perfectly usable. But, when I measured boiling water, I got a reading of ~190 instead of 212. This non-linear inaccuracy makes the thermometer completely useless.The second unit I received had the exact same problems as the first, but with one more flaw. The diameter of the metal probe was much smaller, such that it didn't even fit snugly into the storage sleeve.Bottom line: This thermometer has some serious QC issues. I would avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to calibrate.","review":"This thermometer is always off by a few degrees.

I replaced the battery and it seems to work. I tested the temperature in crushed ice water and it says the temperature is 40.9 degrees F, about 9 degrees F too high (or 5 degrees C too high). I tried to use the calibration screw on the front and it does absolutely nothing to offset the temperature reading. I haven't tried in boiling water yet, but I have already lost confidence in the readings. My microwave oven has a temperature monitoring capability and when I tested the water set at 70 degrees C from the microwave oven, the Taylor unit says 90 degrees C - which I know is incorrect. The Taylor model is cheap, and mine could be a defect - or they could all be hit or miss. Should I risk buying another one?

Most who have read the Gospels will be aware of verses that make you uncomfortable but Goldhagen has the count up to 310! anti-semitic verses. When Jesus or John the Baptist (both Jews by the way)criticize Pharisee or Sadducee or other group that constitutes anti-semitism in Goldhagen's book.

All in all an awesome set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Lego sets","review":"The Castle Dwarves' mine is one of my favorite. I bought two of them for that reason. The Dwarves are just awesome; they have appropriate beards, and the fairly new short legs make them height appropriate. It also comes with a giant troll ogre figure which is adequate. I'm less enthusiastic about that because the pins don't seem to hold his arms in well.Over all I give this set 10/10 on the Xak rating scale. Would buy again, but there are so many awesome sets out now it's hard to pick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the virgin coutesan and the English Lord...","review":"Does a person's past actions dictate if they are worthy of true love? This is the question that this book is based on. Cathy Maxwell has written a wonderful, sweet tale about the hardships that all of us-rich and poor-have to sometimes face, and what our choices mean to our future.I found all the characters interesting-a few who are stalwart, and some to be enjoyed if for no other reason than their obvious flawed character. The hero and heroine are beautiful-but not perfect-and that is what endears them to the reader. The hero in particular is a genuinely good man, and good lord to his people. They are both, along with the oppressive mother in law, in heart lonely and in search of a family. They are also ruled by the dictates of the regency era ton. A thoroughly enjoyable book that I heartily recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Fairytales Are Made Of","review":"Cathy Maxwell does it again with this wonderful story of an uncommon earl - Lord of Penhollow - Pierce Kirrier and the beautiful and mysterious Eden who he rescued from the sea.You do have to believe, of course, that she is what the villagers have conjured up for their beloved Earl. They knew he must marry and beget his heirs and he was so loved by all, that they just had to believe that the perfect bride would show up.Well, maybe not so perfect, but appearing so, the very elegant, beautiful and accomplished Eden did wash up on their shores, and it was something of an instantaneous love at first sight kind of attraction. But where would any story be without the mystery and the secret of who Eden really was.Delightful, warm, loving and just the type of novel to curl up with any old day and fall in love all over again. Personally, I'd like to conjure up an Earl of Penhollow - dreamy, noble, sexy and strong! Lovely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Luscious Romance","review":"This book isn't as funny as Falling In Love Again or You and No Other, but it is still a good read. Whimsical, sensual, light - Cathy Maxwell's latest is all this.I especially love how Miss Maxwell depicted Eden's confusion and later acceptance of her destiny. She is a smart girl, and her dilemma is understandable. In her shoes, I too will have lots of thoughts before even daring to confess her secret to Pierce. And Pierce is a wonderful man. Charming, witty, and totally Prince Charming material.My only complain is the obligatory Big Misunderstanding plot. Sure, I'm expecting it to happen - it must happen - but somehow it detracts from the otherwise special story of a fairy tale come true. Yet, all in all, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Delightful! Funny! The Best!","review":"Cathy Maxwell does it again. True love finds a home between a wonderful heroine and a to-die-for sexy hero. No one writes it better than Maxwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historicial literature","review":"This book was a journey through the origins of higher education. It makes sense looking at where we are today, and what directions we still need to go. Great book for every educator..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing release","review":"This is the Mozart's setting of the Handel's work, but there is no mention on the jacket notes. This is misleading to buyers. Overall, either the performance or the audio recording are acceptable, but here the problem is the video direction. Clearly, director Georges Bessonnet had no idea of what he was shooting: never his cameras are ready for soloists or choir or instrument entries. So you can hear the sopranos singing while you are watching the basses silent, or you can see the flutes not playing while the mezzo is singing, and so on. This is frustrating and irritating and soon it makes you want to watch or listen to someting else. A disappointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Library safe","review":"Thankfully, we picked this one up at the library. It would have been a disappointed buy. We had bought the Kings College version a few months ago (previously mentioned by a reviewer)which I would recommend also... 5 stars.We thought this DVD was a little too sublime, as a matter of fact so sublime one couldn't ever ever ever hear the harpsichord let alone see the player finger the keyboard. The Mezzo soprano was without volume or any ummph. Maybe it was my DVD but the whole performance seemed to be recorded with insufficient volume. Panning of the camera was like being on a carousel horse whirlling around seeing blurred faces go by. Legatto without a strong downbeat. We agree it should have said on the jacket 'In a Classical Style not Baroque'.On the positive side ...the tapestries in the Abbey were nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is Timeless","review":"I first heard this album in 1973 - 1974. It's hypnotic music transfixed me as a teenager and was deeply embossed into my tender young psychy. I bought the album last year and played it again and I continue to enjoy it - why did I buy it again ? - because I still hadn't gotten Hallogallo to stop playing in my head !

Yeah it's wierd - but if you get it - you get it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Formal Experiment!","review":"Neu! extends their hypnotic style from the first album, throwing in tape experimentation, slowing down and speeding up the music.

I weigh 125 and the puppy weighs 11. Should be able to handle that and I shouldn't have to sit down perfectly. I'm glad it wasn't someone infirmed or elderly. Quite dangerous! Someone caught us thank goodness or I would have hit my head. The chair is splintered. I believe this is my first one star review. I am usually quite soft-but not only is this junk-someone could get hurt. Too bad-great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky","review":"I received this chair today and was surprised by the \\"oversized\\" seat. It is really big and hard to carry. I take the train to concerts and it would be very inconvenient to maneuver. The padded shoulder support on the strap was missing so the strap would dig into your skin after carrying this for a while. Also, the pockets were not as pictured. The picture shows 4 large pockets, but the one I got had 6 much smaller pockets and the velcro does not hold them closed because they are so small. This chair is probably ok for a big man, but I am 5'1\\" and 70 years old so I am returning it. Too bad because I really like the attached table idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strap hook broke on first use.","review":"The chair is great but the strap hook broke on the first use.

Very well made and comfortable seat (unlike those horrible sling chairs that are hard to get out of).

I'm 6', 210 lbs, and I felt like a dwarf in this chair. If you are 250 lbs plus, then this is the chair for you. The back rest should at least start in the low back, but this one starts just below the shoulders. Result is that there is no low back support. The chrome colored frame is awful. The chair looks like something that should be in a hospital. I'm trying to return it but the return instructions to CostBuy are not easily found. I'm waiting for a response from them. Not real happy about that. Returns directly to Amazon are easy, but not the same to CostBuy so far.On the positive side, the chair is very light, and very well built and solid.

When he finaly gets there (and doesn't seem to stay long) his observations are sparce and the language that he uses is dry and lacks colour. I realy expected more from this book as I had heard so much about his other work 'Portrait of a Turkish family' and I thought his biography of Ataturk one of the best written.Oh and P.S This book has nothing to do with and no imput on Ottoman history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with Bardon's other work","review":"Not one of Bardon's written works, more just a collection of comments by him on various subjects, collected - I gather - from the notes of students, and then cut up and each prefaced with a \\"question\\" that seems derived from the comment after the fact.Bardon's other 4 books (which are more properly called his written work than is this one) are *excellent*.

Block Block is kind of stupid and I don't know if it is black tiger or tiger road but that game is lame and hard.

If you are unaware of your surroundings or ignorant to the danger you may be putting yourself in (i.e. Natalie Holloway comes to mind) you will be crippled with fear and possibly put in a life threatening position.As I was reading some of the other reviews for this book, I was amazed - don't blame this book for teaching a criminal mind, we have Hollywood/TV for that - praise this book for trying to combat the wickedness and give you a tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"One of the main reasons I picked up this book was the DVD that came with it. I am not surprised that none of the reviewers above mentioned it, because there was nothing of value on it! It was a ten-minute teaser that ended up referring you to the author's web site so you could buy a $25 video of his self-defense system. Since the book is nearly all text (only thirty-eight photos)it was assumed, at least by me, that the instruction was on the DVD. It felt like those times when you think you are watching a really interesting review of a new product on TV only to find out it is an informercial.Don't get me wrong, there is some good information in the text. But the scenario-based, physical self-defense instruction portion of the book was much weaker for lack of illustration--and the DVD is just a marketing trick to get you to buy his video after you have already paid $23 for a book (with a DVD!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on mental BAD on physical!","review":"The mental components covered in this book are good. However, the physical skills taught are NOT recommended for those who truely care about their safety.The author bases the skills on traditional martial arts training when they should instead be based on the realities of life-or-death altercations. The skills should be based on modern physiological and psychological research as well as adhere to the current understanding of motor-skill research.In short, while the section on mental self-defense is good, there are better books out there covering this subject. I would recommend caution for any reader who believes the physical skills taught in this book will help them in a life-or-death altercation. Also, the book is completely lacking in the area of de-escalation or verbal self-defense, which should be considered long before physical self-defense is attempted."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This book is a waste of paper.

Playing out closer to a Dust Brothers disc, this meandering score may work well as background music, though rarely has little of substance to offer when examined closely. In between rambling keyboards and textbook beats Massive Attack does manage to throw a few tracks worth revisiting, but a majority of this generically diverse score fails to engage outside it's cinematic counterpart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Nightmare!","review":"I had high hopes for this DVD, as several people had posted favorable reviews of it. Indeed, it is well sung, and the orchestra sounds great. However, this is simply the most irritating staging of an opera that I've seen in my life. There is never a moment, and I mean NEVER, when there aren't hundreds of extras flitting about like idiots. It becomes impossible to listen to the opera.One would be tempted to listen to the DVD with the picture off, but all those people running around make a great deal of noise, and their stomping frequently drowns out the music.It is an incredible display of directorial self-indulgence! Dario Fo is the director, and If I ever meet him, I'm going to slap him as hard as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW TO RUIN AN OPERA","review":"This is one of those unfortunate situations where the opera is ruined by weird over-the-top production. The stupid never-ending antics on stage totally distract the watcher from the music and singing, which is for the most part so-so. The only saving grace - and she is gorgeous - is the Rosina of Jennifer Larmore. Her coloratura is fantastic, she is totally irresistible and is the (only) star of the piece. Richard Croft is passable, Alaimo is not at his best, the Figaro is barely adequate and Dr Bartolo is painful to watch. Oh, for a tenor like Raul Gimenez as Almaviva! Buy the DVD to watch Larmore - the rest is best skipped over."},{"rating":"1","title":"This version is a fiasco","review":"Don't buy this version. Wait until some other performance is available. Lots of silly people doing nonsense (clown stuff) around the singers, distracting the audience from the performance. Loud footsteps disturbing the music. The singers seem they can not stay still for any second. The director added what he probably thought is humorous, and got as a result something worse than the Three Stooges at their worst. The only good thing to say about this version is that the singers are not bad (can not be blamed for the fiasco) and they do not sing out of tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality less than expected","review":"While a fine opera, the sound was terrible.

Despite this being a decent observation that pertains to some humor, Gruner claims this is the case of ALL humor. In fact, he goes to great lengths to \\"demonstrate\\" how every joke or pun involves a winner and a loser. However, many of his examples are quite stretched to fit his personal grand theory. As far as I was concerned, his credibility fell apart after he refused to admit there were limitations to the generalizability of his theory; and of course there are limitations to every theory. Also, I found the book was quite long-winded and repetitive. It could have all been stated in under 100 pages.

I agree.","review":"Zweig takes the classic book by Ben Graham (Intelligent investor, 1949 -- updated and rewritten several times) and adds lots and lots of commentary. Every other chapter is Zweig. Almost every page has a Zweig comment on something Graham says. If you are a Graham fan and CAN read his work easily (very tough for me, as he reads like Winston Churchill) you will find Zweig annoying ... but if you are moderately versed in value investing terminology but not an expert, you'll find his \\"translation\\"/commentary very helpful. Zweig also gives lots of modern examples of how with value investing, the Graham way, investors could have avoided the recent bubble burst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Text and data are great but Kindle edition is horrible","review":"Hi,The good: everything you have read about Benjamin Graham's classic is true AND the text is well written. Jason Zwieg's comments at the end of each chapter and footnotes are excellent. Both Graham and Zwieg make excellent use of data to back up their ideas.The bad: every page or two brings more examples of the horrors of the Kindle edition. The data tables are illegible even when one zooms in to them. The footnotes make forward and backward references to page numbers in the print edition but do not link to those locations. Thus, Amazon has managed to use digital technology to make an excellent book look quite poor. Perhaps they were afraid that diligent readers would look too deeply into the investment quality of Amazon stock.While this book is a must read, and Kindle addicts will want the electronic version, Amazon really needs better quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Books for the Price of 1","review":"Some reviews have commented on how Zweig explains what Graham said, making it more understandable. Others have said that his commentary is not useful and is annoying. I would disagree with both. Zweig's commentary is not particularly useful for explaining what Graham said because Graham's writing is so clear and understandable that no further explanation is needed.Zweig's commentaries are still worthwhile, though, because he makes the same points Graham makes (and also adds some of his own insights), but with modern examples. This updates the book and reminds the reader that everything Graham wrote is still relevant. No investor (or speculator for that matter) should be without this book.The price of the book relative to the knowledge to be gained from it means that buying this book is one of the best value investments an investor will make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Investor CD","review":"Have the book and the CD. They work well together. The CD is great just after reading the book to hammer some of the big picture concepts. The CD is wonderful rush hour material to get you out of that rush hour driving sooner! It is worth the $$ to have both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read save yourself a life time of mistakes","review":"I was eager to use this books with my economics background to cleverly out think the market. While not theorietically impossible, Graham tells us that trying is a fools errand. The time involved and psychological challenges to being an enterprising investor are just too high to make sense. Buying this book and hearing Graham describe the stock market for myself so that I could choose the path for myself was the best investment I'll ever make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advice for life","review":"This is the bible for the indivdual small investor. My copy is highlighted and full of notes. I read and read it again and again. However dated, the Intelligent Investor simplifies investing down to a few basics. It is managing fear and greed. It is exhaustively researching the company and the balance sheet. You learn to grasp the concept of owning the company and its assests vs speculating by renting the stock. It is patience to stick by your choices. It really boils down to junior high math and adult decisions when facing emotions. If you look at the family tree of Graham... aka the Super Investors of Graham and Doddsville (Buffett, Schloss, Knapp, among others) each had at their DNA core the principals of Graham but grew to be different in many respects. I highly endorse the book as a core foundation to any investment library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An investment series of cases","review":"This is the first book written on the subject of describing/detailing life cycles of stocks/mutual funds and really getting into the detail so its all understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around investment advice.","review":"I got a book of financial advice from many CEOs of famous companies and many of them cited this book.

If I were, I'd give it 5 stars, because Graham's clear prose is filled with useful data, anecdotes, and advice. And that's part of the problem. With a book like this, you want to read it with a highlighter, so you can quickly scan chapters back over again and pick out the most important parts. But if you try to do that with this book, you'll just go mad. I have tissues that are thicker are less-porous than the pages of this book. My toilet paper is made of sterner stuff. Highlight the front of the page, and the highlighter is almost more visible from the back. No matter how you try, using a highlighter on this book just creates an unwieldy mess.If you want a copy of Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor just to read through casually, this particular one will be just fine. But if you want to actually study Graham, do yourself a favor and find a better copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference, but only if you're already investing","review":"I am not an experienced investor, and maybe that's why I found I did not understand enough of this book to make it worth my time. I am interested in jumping into the market (as soon as it seems like a reasonable time to do so), and picked up this book as a reference guide to help me get started. But most of the material went over my head.I think the audience for this book is mainly experienced investors or students studying finance. Indeed, Benjamin Graham taught finance at Columbia University.Now don't get me wrong, the book is brilliant.

It gives you the mindset to understand stock pricing through economic cycles and why does history indeed repeats itself, or at least when it comes the ups and downs of the market.

I am still reading the book, but find it both informative and interesting in that it goes to great lengths (which is good for me) to explain differences between investing and speculating (of which I have been doing more of the latter, regretfully). The book also explains some of the psychologies of various investing strategies; why, how and who uses them and, more importantly when to use them. I am still learning about various bond strategies and plan on purchasing government bonds as a hedge against inflation in my IRA. This is a great book to keep nearby when you don't want to watch TV during the holidays (or for any time for that matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good book but needs more","review":"This book is very fundamental to the concept of investing but should be used together with books from real traders and portfolio managers. The works of Linda Raschke and Toby Crabel are the finest in terms of learning to trade and make money. If you fan find these on Amazon or Ebay - go for it, even that they may be out of print. The author of this book is academician and the book reads as such. Some people swear by it as classic, i think it is useless used by itself.

Before I got to chapter 8 he had convinced me that individual stock picking was a waste of my time. Dollar cost averaging into Index Funds and ETFs while they're cheap, balancing towards bonds when they're not; these are easy \\"set and forget\\" strategies and Graham has convinced me that they pay off.I'll still buy a few individual stocks, just like I still like to shoot craps in Vegas.

There is no knowledge to be gained by reading Graham, no edge you can gain. The best you can do is follow in the footsteps of half the world and become another fish swimming with the school, a cow in the herd.I am one of the top stock traders in the country with the trade receipts to prove it. The one fact of the market is that if you want to outperform, you need to have superior tactics. You need an edge. This book can never give you an edge.

Zweig helps apply Graham's principles to modern era scenarios, and succeeds quite well.Originally I was going to opt for the Classic version but decided to go with this copy, and I am more than glad I did, Zweig's commentary adds a new perspective which allows one to better understand Graham's philosophy.Intelligent Investor is a must read for anyone seriously interested in the financial markets, from student to professional everyone can benefit handsomely from his time tested advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is still great, revision stunk","review":"The book is still great, however the revision was the worst.

The acting is wooden, and although there are some reasonable special effects, it does not make up for the story line.

The plot is silly, the cast are a either bunch of maggot-sized brainees (case example: a. policemen who takes aim at Ray and doesn't fire, just to be shot down the next nanosecond) or they throw in an OTT performance (that Ray moron, without a doubt), and the movie is a waste of time.

Anyone that listened to BC way back when and got caught up by the anthemic sounds of their early work should definitely invest in 'Why the Long Face.'

I'm still in a bit mixed feelings about this album, but it rocks hard enough when it needs to, and although it may not contain the absolutely best Big Country songs, it does have plenty of good music. \\"Take you to the moon\\" is a good example of the band's better songs. \\"Sail into nothing\\" could also have been a hit single.A good album.

BUT, beware the so called less effort-just 4 swift pumps of the lever (or even 10 pumps ) does a minimal job of creating any vacuum in the opened bottle. A real bust for $30.00. In addition , we have had no response from our complaints and return of product from the Metrokane Co."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior item","review":"I purchased the Rabbit vacuum pump in December, 2003.

I've tried telephoning them several times and all I get is voice mail. I've sent them an e-mail without response. I've since purchased a Vacu-Vin Concerto pump and I am very happy with it. It creates a much better vacuum than the Rabbit Lever Pump. It costs less ($19.95 vs. $30.00) and I bet the company is more responsive. In general, I think their products are inferior. Their wine opener is much less expensive than comparable bottle openers such as the Lever-Pull, but they break and the Lever-Pull lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item does not work","review":"This product simply does not work. The vacuum is so weak that it does not preserve the wine, even for a day. I have used a Vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost.

I am seeking a return and refund, either through Amazon or Metrokane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better looking but poorer vacuum than the alternatives","review":"I bought this, although I already had the Vacuvin vacuum pump, because it looked more durable and easier to use. It IS nicer looking than the white plastic vacuvin (although it's grey plastic not metal), but it takes more pumps to create a vacuum and the vacuum is much weaker than with the vacuvin. since the metrokane is also twice as expensive, you'd be better off buying the vacuvin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product.","review":"Like the majority of the reviews relating to this product, I was disapointed in it's performance.

It was also bulky and difficult to store, so I'm looking to replace it with the Houdini or Vinovac which both get much better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"This device has two major flaws, both of which alone would render it useless. First, it simply does not pump well. One has to work a lot and there is almost no result. Second the stopper breaks after a couple of uses.

This of course makes you wonder why he bothered to write this book. (apparently in the past he's written mostly about famous chefs!) The book has its moments (few and far-between), but the author gets carried away with the research, giving you all the technical minutiae of boat construction--way more than you need, which will put most readers to sleep, even if they're boatbuilding enthusiasts. The real focus of the book (the lives of the men who build these boats) gets utterly lost in a morass of boring details. All in all, very unenlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This reads like an overly-long magazine article--it's greatly padded. The true focus of this book (the story of the lives of the men who build these boats) is often muddled, and displaced by excessive details on boat building techniques. Such minutiae serves to distract the reader. There is a book here somewhere, but the author hasn't quite found it yet. On the plus side, the writing style can be engaging at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Woods","review":"This book is great, but it is not the junior version, and has a strange ending. It helped me keep my mind off of some stressful episodes at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Woods","review":"A friend made me aware of this book while we were in a production of \\"Into The Woods\\" this summer. Anyone who is acquainted with this musical will thoroughly enjoy this book as much as I did. The text is a wonderful version of the libretto and the illustrations are grand! In fact, I will be giving copies as Christmas gifts this year. Thank you and WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new twist","review":"This book gives a new twist on some old stories. By way of the Woods, the story created a way to entertwine them all. We go through the experiences of Cinderella, Jack and the Bean Stalk, and the Baker & his wife who are in want of a child, and let us not forget, the Witch and her Rapunzel. Each character wants more than anything in the world something, and they sneak around eachother at times and at others work together to eventually find a happy ending for them all. Also, for those of you who sang \\"Into the Woods\\" in school or who have seen the play enough, there are times when you can just start to sing it out for your toddler's amusement. Though I cannot forget that some parts with the Princes have a bit of suggestive talk, but nothing truely in appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I am in a junior version of this play, meaning that we only do the first half (actually, later in the day that I am writing this and I am planning to be in a production) and I just wanted to say that this book is great! It helped me clearly understand the second half, 'cause the little booklet that comes w/ the CD doesn't really help you understand! Highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre talent gets his own DVD anthology","review":"No one can deny that Hulk Hogan was the biggest single star in Wrestling in the 1980's but he was only has good as his opponents made him look. He got by on the fact that he was in Rocky III, and just happened to be in the right place at the right time. His skills are horrendous, and his opponents made him look larger than life. 20 years later at near 60, Hogan still tries to hang on to his cult status any way he can. Buy this for nostalgia, but hopefully Hogan will fade into the sunset finally to give the American public a break from having to look hat his half mullet."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"i love hulk hogan since i was a little boy and this item has all his great fights from the 80's and 90's and his fights in the early 2000's and his hall of fame introduction so if u love hulk hogan purchase this item"},{"rating":"1","title":"The man that ruined pro wrestling","review":"Hogan was a ego maniac. He held talent down and gave jobs to people that weren't even great wrestlers. This dvd is nothing new in the Hogan cannon. They released a dvd set of Hogan matches that had better matches on the other dvd, Hulk Still Rules. The WCW matches that are new- facing Giant and Sting, are a complete waste of dvd transfer. I bought this set because there was an extra disc with a all new matches and he was a good showman and he could wrestle a good match on occasion. The problem I have with Hogan was reading about him in the Death of WCW. Now you can call me bias, but I do believe they were right about Hogan. He is ego maniac and wont job to wrestles younger then him and dont put over anyone younger either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content Great - Book Binding Falling Apart","review":"We have had this book for not even a month and it is falling apart.

The diagrams and instructions are wonderfully clear and presented on big pages surrounded by lots of calming white space.I've been teaching origami to 20 third graders (an interesting volunteer experience!). *Origami in Action* is one of my top suggestions when a parent asks me to recommend an origami book for an eight or nine year old.But this book is also great fun for grownups -- even origami-addicted grownups and other advanced folders.

I can see the hands of time turn back as he watches the tape or turns the pages of the book. I know he wishes Grandpop was here to share it with him, but I think this helps him remember all the great memories they shared thanks to the game of baseball.

Their home lives were so bad that they would rather face that uncertainty than the abuse of whoever they lived with. And they didn't all turn to drugs or alcohol or prostitution. They weren't all bad people. Most of them were just trying to make it through one more day, ya know? I can relate to this book. I've known the kids it's talking about.

First of all it includes the studio version of \\"Lithium\\", easaily one of their best songs, but the real reason to buy this single is for the B-sides. First of all there is a great live version of Been a son, wich sounds just as good at the studio version.

Christian attempts to demonstrate how the Jews planned 9/11 and planted a hydrogen bomb in the Andaman-Sumatran trench leading to the the Tsunami of December 26th 2004. Apparently the Jews were responsible for the Holocaust and 7/7 attacks on London. Christian concludes by proposing a solution to all these problems i.e. The Final Solution.

Tried it on a bottle of Italian wine I drink nearly 50% of the time. Initially it does pump the air out, which can be verified by pulling on the tab with a resulting hiss. However, in subsequent testing the seal wouldn't stay airtight for even 1 hour.The stoppers feel rather soft/flimsy and do not allow for variance in bottle sizes (which according to other reviews are pretty common). And no, I'm not talking about 1.5l vs. 750ml bottles- just the difference in neck/lip diameter.So perhaps they work ok for a specific bottle size, but YMMV.

Well, they did not work the same! I could not seem to ever get any air out with this Houdini. When you open the stopper after using the vacu vin, you hear a little whoosh sound...so you know you had all the air out.

These are glorified corks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep a seal","review":"This wine preserver doesn't keep a seal for very long. If you seal the bottle, and then remove the stopper right away, you will hear the satisfying vacuum sound, indicating that the bottle has been sealed correctly.

One of the supplied corks developed a bit of a tear/vacuum leak in it so decided to replace it. The new product came in black which seemed ok however it would not hold a vacuum for even an hour like the original had and was nowhere near as well built. The first one would hold a vacuum for many days. The company must have found a cheaper offshore group to produce it but I would not purchase another one from them as it is in a word (JUNK) . Of course Amazon refunded it no questions asked. I am quite sure they get most of them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"A few months ago I purchase this wine preserver, and so far it has been reliably done it is job. I have tried several other products; however, I cannot say the same. This vacuum sealer is quick and easy to use--insert the plug and a couple of pumps, and you've got a good seal. Plus, it nicely matches my other Metrokane wine tools, e.g. Rabbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work Consistently","review":"I had one of these for a few years (grey not black) which worked great, but recently the stoppers started to wear out. I purchased a new pump and a few extra new stoppers.

I pumped the remainder of a good bottle of wine until I felt a fair amount of resistance. Unfortunately, a few days later it tasted awful, no better than if I'd used a cork. I gave one to my boyfriend and he says it doesn't even work for a day. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Houdini Wine Preserver","review":"Love it!! Works great.

The stoppers have a little stick/button on the top for releasing the pressure, and I'm not uncoordinated :) but I found it nearly impossible to pump the vacuum without hitting the little button and releasing the vacuum.Overall, this device has great Amazon reviews, but \\"my mileage varies.\\" I'm going to return it and try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good seal","review":"I bought this and the stainless steel one from another company.

It's well balanced and feels good in your hand, and the blade is quite sharp and very sturdy. It is worth $32, but I bought it for $19, and that is the only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars. It is large and impressive looking, and it has never failed to cut anything. The tip does not deform either, even after stabbing it into many hard surfaces to prove how sharp it is. This knife will easily stick into a hardwood surface far enough that it is difficult to remove. The back-locking closing mechanism is, in my opinion, better than the standard type found on most other pocket knives in this price range. This knife has become a constant companion, and one of the most reliable tools I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Conka Bonkers Everyone!","review":"Reading this book, that I got at the LIBRARY, (THANK THE LORD)had me bowled over with canned laughter coming outta my whothave you, but that was just from looking at the cover, and the back of the cover, which you can plainly see merely by seeing the picture of it online. Any book that features the words \\"LOL\\" in it's introduction, is never to be taken seriously, and is therefore doomed.Nothing about this book is even moderately funny.

Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler.

For some reason during the Christmas season they never show this movie on any of the numerous cable stations anyore. I haven't seen this movie on tv since the 1980's and I don't understand why, it is such a good movie and Henry Winkler's performance is terrific. I believe Happy Days was still on tv at this time albiet it was probably during the end of the series. The only place to find this movie was through Amazon just as they don't play it on tv you can't find the dvd in the stores either so the ability to find this movie was almost impossible except thankfully through Amazon. I would never pay as much for a dvd as I did for this one but it is one of my husbands favorite Christmas movies so it had a special meaning to surprise him with this as a gift, so thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Christmas Carol (DVD)","review":"A classic tale which has not been regularly shown on TV for years.

I first saw this movie online recently and wonder how I missed never seeing it on TV. And not just his acting but it seemed all actors did a great job in this American version of Scrooge. After seeing it online I ordered it right away to add to our Christmas collection. If you haven't seen it I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy other adaptations of Scrooge you will certainly enjoy this movie.If you would like to read more or order the dvd click this link.

I watched this movie when it was first released on TV during his Fonzie heyday, and I never once saw that 50's character. He is immersed in his character and is a completely convincing \\"Scrooge.\\"I'm disappointed that this isn't shown on TV, and I have purchased it so I can enjoy it again and again along with my husband and little girl.My top three \\"A Christmas Carol\\" versions star \\"A Christmas Carol\\" with Alistair Sim, \\"Scrooge\\" with Albert Finney, and \\"An American Christmas Carol\\" with Henry Winkler. I won't bother with the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Carol to be remembered","review":"When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was \\"A Christmas Carol\\". I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year. When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish. Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad. To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods. Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever. Get it now and on disc before it gets away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even very good acting by Henry Winkler can't save this flop.","review":"The premise of swapping the settings of a Christmas Carol to the Great Depression era was an interesting concept. The main problem is the storyline and script. Winkler is cast as a seller of furniture items, radios, etc who re-possesses these items from people on Christmas Eve. It's really hard to get upset over people losing non-essential consumer items. At one point Slade(scrooge) fires his Bob Crachett assistant and does a pretty good job of explaining why it was justified.(So much so it had me on Slade's side.) The visitations by the spirits were simply not very compelling. I found myself sympathizing with the young Slade as he tried to convince his boss to improve productivity and to tighten business practices, to no avail. This movie is alright if you want to pass an hour and a half with something Christmas themed on in the background, but it's hardly Miracle on 32nd Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Christmas Carol","review":"The best Christmas movie ever! I saw this when it was aired on TV back in 1979 and purchased it on VHS when it became available. It was our family tradition for years to watch this on Thanksgivng evening. I bought DVD copies for my children who now have families of their own who will carry on the tradition.Henry Winkler is amazing in this! No matter how many times I've seen this, I still laugh and cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Christmas Carol","review":"\\"An American Christmas Carol \\"is different in some ways from the original \\" A Christmas Carol \\". At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them.This is not my most favorite version of all,but it is maybe my fourth favorite.I like the original story better, that is why I gave it 4 stars.It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge, even with the name changes. It is the same general idea.

It's poor quality film, dated and badly written. Henry Winkler's make up is just awful. I couldn't watch it through to the end. I collect Christmas Carol films but this one that will never go in the dvd player again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Tale Revisited","review":"Awesome. If you like Christmas, then you'll like this movie. Just as the original by Dickens, it teaches us the true meaning of Christmas. I have been hooked since seeing this movie as a young adult and it still delivers. I enjoy the American twist on Dicken's story. You won't get a Victorian town in England, but you will get a simpler America and the American entrepreneurial spirit. Henry Winkler gives a commendable performance and the supporting cast works well. All in all, a must see for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart gripper","review":"First time i saw this movie was 1985 on television. Henry Winkler was excellent! Actually, the whole cast was great. I spent 17 years trying to locate this movie. You won't find it in a video store, at least where i live. And they don't show it on regular t.v. anymore. It is a MUST HAVE if you collect christmas movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist on the classic.","review":"As we were picking Christmas movies this year, I remembered seeing one with Henry Winkler.

It was just what I was looking for. Thanks so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Christmas Carol","review":"Since I was a child many years past I have been interested in Dickens Christmas Carol. When I saw this version it stood out amoung the many other versions out there. Henry Winkler plays a good scrooge charactor. The story itself is based on Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol and the story sticks very close to the original with a 1920s depiction of the American depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I went with Fluenz","review":"Fluenz is one of the most impressive learning, training or general education software applications in the market. Their interface is attractive and intuitive, their use of video to guide and help you as you learn is right on the money, and using English to learn Mandarin is both obvious and unique in the world of language software. The workouts are fun, well-designed and useful. What's impressive is not that they have invented some technology that wasn't available, but that they identified the best that was out there, created a smart learning system, and made it happen. I recommend it to anyone who's interested in learning Mandarin Chinese.Moises Szarf, Miami Florida"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but too short, overpriced","review":"The content is too short for its price.It consists of 45 chapters, but they are quite short.At chapter 45, you are left with still too few tools to maintain a conversation.This just helps you to not get lost, order at a restaurant, buy a ticket and situational chit chat.A good starter, but not for the serious learner.Way overpriced!!!After buying a series of 5 text books to learn mandarin, i feel i wasted money on that dvd.The dvd content is covered within the first half of the first textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, full of new ideas and very helpful","review":"I'm using FLUENZ Mandarin 1+2 daily now and I'm totally satisfied.It's a wonderful software for language-learning and in my opinion, the approach to this sometimes very frustrating procedure is excellent, full of new ideas and very helpful. The FLUENZ team did a very good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got halfway through lessons before trip to China...very helpful","review":"I bought this programmed learning experience because of an upcoming post-cruise tour of China. We were in China for 12 days, after being at sea for 2 weeks, and even though I had only gone through 22 of the 45 lessons before leaving the U.S., what I had learned was very helpful and serviceable. I also had tried to use the Rosetta Stone program at my university, but it was so cumbersome as to be ineffective. As a teacher, I think that the Fluenz program does a very good job of preparing the traveler for travel conversations and basic communication, which, believe me, was very much appreciated by the Chinese people we encountered in the 3 cities we visited. I recommend this program to anyone who wants to jump start their learning of useful Chinese sentences. I have Windows Vista Ultimate and the program worked fine with my 3 gigs of ram."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent program","review":"Preparing for a trip to China, I have found this program to be very helpful. The DVD ROM is well-organized, has enough repetition to be useful, but not so much as to be monotonous. The teacher, Sonya, is enjoyable, and the approach to teaching Mandarin by using practical scenarios keeps the interest up. On the other hand, I found the CD to be quite redundant, (the words for I, you and he/she/it were reviewed ad nauseum) and it could have included a lot more grammar. I was disappointed the supplementary podcasts were not available, but I understand they soon will be. So, for anyone looking to learn conversational Mandarin, I would wholeheartedly recommend this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin","review":"This is a worthy product, especially for those just starting to learn Mandarin. It is very interactive and can help build your vocabulary and speaking/listening skills. It is especially good for visual learners. However, if you are looking to learn characters, this program focuses on Pinyin, which actually works well for English speakers. However, Fluenz could improve this product by including characters. Maybe they'll do it in a future version. For now, I suggest Tuttle's Learning Chinese Characters for characters. I'm using Fluenz in conjunction with the Pimsleur series (which is great for speaking/listening)- and I think they compliment each other. Though it's not cheap, I think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"fluenz mandarin","review":"I have only completed 4 of the lessons so far. But I am living in Taiwan and it is nice that this product starts off teaching you things that you can really use. It does have its limitations and I have already noticed that there are differences in expression between the mandarin Chinese used in Taiwan and that of Sonja who went to China. Other than that, this product has already been useful in helping me survive on my own while living here."},{"rating":"2","title":"AI - Best in Class","review":"Authors have done a geat job with a complicated matter being communicated to prospective users interested in more effective leadership strategies.

This book lets you get the most out of QuickBooks, and shows you how to run your business properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"More smart music from Melanie Doane!","review":"Music with broad appeal, this long-awaited CD is even better than Adam's Rib...everything about this album is good - great voice, Mel's own back-up vocals, thoughtful/fun lyrics, sweet guitar, great production.Still Desire You - instantly recognizable intro, nice rocky sound and infectious lyrics - making a big statement on Canadian radio right now, and video airing on MuchMoreMusic featuring scenes from \\"Black Swan\\" combined with Mel's usual rockin' performance shots.As I Am - a \\"sleeper\\" which begs to be listened to - starts quietly and builds into an amazing \\"anthem\\" to an enviable relationship...Wilma or a Betty Man - which one are you? listen and find out, or maybe you're a bit of both :) Can't stop humming this one!Way Past Blue - a wrenching, intelligent song that takes you into the depths and stays glued in your mind.Just a taste of this CD - a must for summer 2003!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price on a Network Printer","review":"An amazing printer for the money. I am in charge of technology in a high school and I have several of these printers in small offices with 5 - 10 users per printer. Easily networked and great for low to medium volume printing. They have held up so well I bought one for my home network and at under $150 it is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"Let's start with the problems. After two cartridges failed in less than 400 pages total, I'm returning the printer. The documentation is terrible. Just try setting a static IP address on the thing! I had to call technical support a few times to get correct and complete instructions. Which brings be to the third problem. Their tech support sucks. Their hours are limited and their people are not too bright. Expect to get about 500 pages out of the original cartridge. At least that's what tech support told me. I got 70. On the plus side, they only gave me a little push back when I asked them to replace the printer. They want to replace the printer but not the photo conductor. But, they finally saw the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor printer, poor service","review":"I do a lot of work on pre-printed forms (single sheet, normal weight paper). This printer constantly pulled in the paper incorrectly and thereby printed crookedly on the paper. My inkjet worked fine on the forms, but I need the greater permanence of the laser print. I worked with Lexmark customer service and they were kind enough to replace my first 120n, but the replacement was actually worse. I spent nearly three hours with an online service person concerning the second printer only to finally realize they couldn't or wouldn't do anything for me. So I will buy another printer and chalk this up to a lesson learned. The quality of the print and speed of the printer were great, but I have to have an image that is straight on the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"e120n - success in a wireless network.","review":"For the four days I've owned this printer, it has done a great job printing for my home wireless network.This printer set up relatively easily for me; I connected it via cable to my wireless router (had to buy the router-connection cable separately). Once connected, the printer spat our a test page that included an IP address for the printer.Then I downloaded drivers for Vista 64-bit and XP, since I have two laptops. I got both off of the Lexmark website, since I wanted the most current drivers. The 64-bit Vista driver is on the website, but it takes a lot of work to find it.As I ran the 'printer setup wizard' or similar program, I had the \\"Connect Printer through TCP/IP\\" option pop up, so I decided to try that option and use the IP address that had spat out on the test page. The end result - both laptops print wirelessly now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Louisiana Read","review":"Being from Southern Louisiana, I found this book both interesting and heartbreaking.The characters are well described, the setting (Pilotville) still exists under another nameand I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a page turner","review":"Really enjoyed the authors style of writing, as well as the story line.

I am not an easy-to-please reader and for me to give a book a rating of 4 stars or more means that the book HAS to a page turner. This one was certainly that, and I lost sleep staying up late to read because it was hard to put down. Although I was able to figure out some of the twists and turns before we got to them, there were still others that completely eluded me, as a good mystery should. I highly recommend this book, and gave it four stars only because it would have had to keep me from doing anything else, including sleep, until I finished it. At least I forced myself to put it down long enough to cook meals and clean up afterward. ;-) It is a tale I will long remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Otherwise everything as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling First Novel","review":"Athol Dickson is a rarity among novelists in that he has written a story that is both suspenseful and well-crafted. His prose is unblemished, but he never neglects his plot. The biblical imagery woven throughout River Rising comes across as organic, rather than forced. The novel's suprises are satisfying and rich.It was eery reading this book in the wake of Katrina. River Rising helped me understand the geography of the region as well as the culture of southern Louisiana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Great Author, this book was a very intense reading ,could not put it down.

There is no creativity, the instrumentation is poor, lyrics stupid, and this album is just plain freakin boring. Don't get me wrong, I love this band. Loved them for a long time. Love them for their own quirky, unique style. But, dang. They have strayed so far away from who they are it doesn't even need the band name newsboys on it. Sure, they can say \\"oh, we were inspired by our heavenly influence to do 'another' worhip album.\\" It's obvious they just made this one to cash in more on the current \\"let's all do worship albums\\" trend. I have nothing against worhip albums...i loved the last one they did. This one just plain sucks and i regret i gotta pay the bill on this one. Mr. Fuller, here's a suggestion. Go back to the inspiration that you got on Thrive and start from there....cause, dang man...one more like this and the fans will start dropping over dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Worse Newsboys Album","review":"Why not follow a bad effort with a worse one? Why not abandon all early fans? Why not make an album that's just made for the pathetic radio crowd? That's what they did. \\"Presence\\" is just as bad as \\"Amazing Love\\" and song like \\"Blessed Be Your Name\\" are downright pathetic covers, and some of the worst in the industry.Overall, boycott this sad effort from the Newsboys. It's a truly bad album with no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid set of inspiration","review":"I bought my first Newsboys CD many years ago, based mostly on the fact that Steve Taylor wrote much of it and produced it (Take Me To Your Leader). In the intervening years, I admitedly lost touch. That is until I heard their version of \\"Blessed Be Your Name\\". Perhaps it was by chance or by Grand design...Nevertheless, in the few times I've listened to it since buying it, I must say it's one of my favorites.Many of the reviews here are true; don't listen to critics. Anyone can sit back and detract. But it takes the serious listener to absorb the words and works in this CD.Steve Taylor (I Want to Be a Clone) is still here, but that's no longer the primary reason I love this CD. It's all about the message. Just ask my six-year-old daughter. She is a fan, and not just of the band.Pick it up and put it in your basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"Excellent gift for our granddaughter.

This book does present the technical facts about the case, but he goes out of his way to paint the town with a negative, \\"redneck\\" flavor. Sure, there are \\"redneck\\" folks around, but they're in every town.Honesdale isn't a bad little town. Just a normal, everyday America small town. It's a decent place to live, just not a lot going on. This was one of the biggest stories of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"monster cable","review":"Amazon had the best price on this cable.

Has just enough pockets for laptop (including protective pocket big enough for my 15 inch Mac book pro), files for work, and pockets to store my phone, badge, pager, pen/highlighter), and zip pocket for things like wallet.The only annoying thing: when my laptop is in the bag, the bag is unbalanced and tends to fall over on the front...everything stays safe inside, just annoying that it will fall over....but maybe because it is a light bag otherwise, which I appreciate.Bag came well packaged, safe, fast, no issues with packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at great value","review":"Saw this exact item for ~33% more in office supply stores.

You can clearly see on the picture and you can read in the description that a removable pouch for accessories is included. It is also stated on the label that came with the bag.Nevertheless the bag came without the pouch. I filed a claim, but the only thing Adorama is doing, is sending first a couple of emails apologizing for the delay in their answer and subsequently saying that the pouch is not included.I think this is misleading the client and a lack of responsibility.Don't buy from this company if you want to be sure that you get what they promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really like the bag but the leather is already peeling off","review":"I purchased this bag from Amazon in April of this year (i.e., three months ago). I have never traveled with it and simply carry it as a briefcase to work. This consists of being driven in the back seat of my car to my office. Otherwise, it is simply carried from my house to my car and from my parking space to my office. It is more than fair to say this bag has lived a very gentle life.However, the leather is already peeling off, as shown in the user picture I've added here. I realize the bag was reasonably priced, but I would expect it to be presentable for more than three months. So, I'm very disappointed it's falling apart already. It really was a nice bag that I was hoping to travel with but I don't see this Solo bag lasting much longer.I've emailed the company and I'll post an update based on customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"The brown/espresso color is *very* dark.","review":"Nice bag. Well made, sturdy (and not shiny) leather, just the right size for carrying the stuff you might actually use on the plane, has a convenient pocket that's fully accessible from the front, suitable for a passport and boarding pass (I hate rooting around inside the bag for these). The shoulder strap is nice and wide and it rolls well.On the negative side, it's a bit heavy (but that's to be expected in leather). I got the brown color, thinking that the light tan, though good looking out of the box, would get dirty too fast. However, the brown is so dark as to look black except in direct sunlight---darker than it appears in the pictures. Had I known that, I may have risked the lighter tan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"Appears to be an excellent quality, attractive, business-like case.

This book is especially appropriate for divorced or separated fathers, and Will Smith has stated that the song is in part a tribute to the good parenting relationship he has with his ex-wife.

However, every time she has turned to \\"The Missing Manual\\" she can not find the answer to what she feels is a simple problem.Just today she made a comment that we should just burn the book because it simply has never once taught her anything. Yes, it is full of hints and suggestions but to call it a \\"manual\\" is misleading.

Anyway! thanks a lot in advance and Merry X'mas for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shoe","review":"I really like this shoe and it's casual-yet-classy look. It's very comfortable. My only complaint is that because it has an open back and most of my other shoes don't, I've partially walked out of it a few times, and it's very uncomfortable when your arch lands on the back edge of the shoe! So that just means I have to be a little more careful how I walk and slow down a bit (I have a tendency to walk quickly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement Parts are Nonexistent","review":"I didn't know I was buying a Disposable Electric Razor when I bought this, but I contacted Remington about replacement parts and they said: \\"it's supposed to be used a couple of times and thrown away.\\" What A joke!!!

I am always looking for books on the subject. Forensic anthropology is not my area of expertise, and I've read the memoirs of many forensic anthropologists. The TV series \\"Bones\\" has stimulated a lot of interest in the field. Forensic Detective, How I Cracked the World's Toughest Cases will go a long way to killing interest in the field. I hat to stop reading it, because I was in too much pain, the book kept hitting me in the face as I fell asleep reading it. The chapter about how Dr. Mann got into the field was mildly interesting, and the bits about the politics of choosing the unknown soldier was also interesting. For the rest, I just couldn't finish the book. The material has been gone over before, and better, by other authors. Dr. Mann would have been helped by a better ghostwriter.Bottom line, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cross-section of the Life of a Forensic Anthropologist","review":"There are many fascinating books for the general public on forensic anthropology. What makes this one different from those that I have read so far is that, in addition to descriptions of efforts towards resolving murder cases, it contains several stories about the identification of the remains of soldiers who have died in various military conflicts, e.g., both World Wars, Korea, etc. The author has also included some honest and open-hearted autobiographical information. The writing style is friendly and engaging. The book should be of interest to forensics buffs, but especially those with a penchant for forensic anthropology. I enjoyed this book and, as such, I have rated it as above average for this subject category, i.e., four stars; but I don't think that it quite has the gripping edge that would make it five star material, as some such books that I have read do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Mann is an interesting person, but he cracked no cases in this book. At best, he provided evidence that supported what police were just about 100% certain of already.

Carl was (and still is) highly regarded as a songwriter, but he was also a fine performer. This album is a collection of songs released during his days with RCA Victor in the 1960's. Most recognizable to fans of that era will be \\"Hello Out There\\", \\"Odd Man Out\\", \\"Boston Jail\\", \\"Walking Shadow, Talking Memory\\", \\"Crystal Chandelier\\", and \\"Am I That Easy to Forget?\\". I gave only four stars because of the omission of \\"Lonely Street\\" and \\"Pretty Brown Eyes\\". Also missing is Carl's pre-RCA rockabilly work and his later work that included duets with Betty Jean Robinson.All in all, though, a very good collection from a solid artist. If you remember Carl Belew and liked him at all, this is the only collection you'll find to date. It's well worth the money for fans of \\"real\\" country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This One While You Can","review":"I have never encountered another collection of Carl Belew's songs, so this 19 Track disc has been long-coming. If you're not familiar with Carl Belew, you owe it to yourself to grab this album and give it a listen. Carl was an excellent songwriter, much in the same vein as Don Gibson. Just as important, Carl was a talented singer, although stuck in the \\"Nashville Sound\\" for much of his career. His voice is 80% Bobby Bare and 20% Ferlin Husky; he could easily be mistaken for a younger Bobby Bare on the earlier recordings. Like many songwriters though, it was the \\"other\\" artist who got the glory with his songs. Still, you will enjoy this album immensely.....especially so if you're a fan of the polished country music of the '60's. A set of liner notes is included, and the sound on this CD is just fine. Get it while you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, boring book","review":"I bought this book thinking that it had a wonderful twist on apocalyptic science fiction, is a favorite sub-genre of mine. It starts out promising and then about a quarter of the way through becomes a woefully boring waste. The characters are one dimensional and one could care less about any of them. Compare this to someone like Jack McDevitt. In his novels one feels like one really KNOWS Chase or Hutch or for that matter any of the characters he builds. The characters in this book are downright cliches. I have to say that I had to fight my way through to finish it and wound up giving it away to a friend of mine who teaches Environmental Science. Thumbs down big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed It","review":"The book was entertaining and I enjoyed it. A nice enjoyable, believable end of the world (as we know it) book. If you enjoy disaster novels where civilization crumbles and society caves you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good concept, completely wasted","review":"I picked this up in an airport based on the books concept (a good one). I soon asked \\"why am I reading this?\\" Its full of scientific holes and inaccuracies. Perhaps an alternate reality where everyone is dumb. If there is no more plastic, and you want to generate power, why try to launch something into space, just build a dam. This would be entertaining if you don't consider yourself very smart. The only reason I didn't give it a lower score was that I was able to finish it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept--Pathetic Realization","review":"This was a fabulous concept for a book--a kind of Andromeda Strain, only the bugs didn't just decide to turn benign and fly off into space, but ate all the oil, natural gas and plastic on the planet. But the authors have no imagination at all. Their descriptions of how quiet and peaceful it is after the disaster in various places around the Bay Area evince the worldview of an unimaginative, media-fed fourteen-year-old boy. The main characters' obsessions with rail guns, small satellites and puny electrical generation schemes simply run past ludicrous to depressing. What about the ten million starving people?The fact that this book and ones like it can be written and published and read as entertainment provides a disturbing index of our society's level of conscience and awareness of the reality of human-human and human-environmental interdependence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating concept but ultimately falls flat.","review":"Imagine a world in which petroleum products suddenly disappeared, along with all the machines and gadgets that use them. This would include gasoline, oil, and all plastics. That's the premise of this imaginative novel. It's just a shame that the authors couldn't quite flesh it out. It's an unusual techno-thriller in that there's virtually nothing military about it, which was refreshing. However, Ill Wind suffers from a typical failing of techno-thrillers, cardboard cut-out characters and painfully stilted dialogue, especially between men and women. It seems as if the authors learned their dramatic skills from watching canned television mini-series rather than reading real literature. The concept is enough to get you about halfway through the book, but then it just gets tedious and you find yourself praying for a nuclear war to just put an end to the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ill Wind Highly Entertaining","review":"Ill Wind was a very entertaining read. Anderson and Beason carefully describes the people, places and events. Though the story is perhaps a bit implausible, that doesn't make it any less entertaining. In fact, much good science fiction depends on a slightly implausible plot. The authors obviously spent a lot of time researching for this book. This one is difficult to put down once you pick it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide to engine swapping.","review":"Ever thought about putting a chev V8 into a VW bettle or how about a Porsche,may be a 454 into a Vega?

There were some differing opinions, in regards to the sound quality of that cd, but nothing that took away from the selections.As the name of this title \\"More German Military Marches & Polkas Vol.II\\" suggests, this cd would be a addendum to the previous volume. This is not the case for this cd, as it is a completely different selection of tracks and genre.I am not a military marches expert, but I do have a collection and an idea of what I expect from a cd entitled Military Marches & Polkas. This recent volume is primarily a collection of bland polkas. Maybe a Polka fan would like this volume, but if you are looking for good military marches, as found on the original cd, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Magic Collector Statue","review":"This two dragon statue is very unusual - an imaginative and creative design; I've never seen anything quite like it - they have a \\"puppy-ish\\" and interesting look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This was my first Stella Cameron book and it just might be my last. I wish I could rate this book woth NO stars! It was awful. I did not even finish reading it.The book starts out very slowly, but I was interested in the past that these two characters shared. After their history was described, however, the storyline degenerated into nothing. I could not figure out what the motivation was for any of these character's actions. Their personalities were never truly defined, and whatever spark of interest I had died with the convolted machinations of these characters.I never did figure out what was going on in the book. All I knew was some rich guy came back to his hometown, one of the reasons being he wanted to rekindle an old high school romance. But beyond that, I couldn't tell you. This book went on for pages and pages and pages about NOTHING before I finally gave up threw it across the room and into the garbage....

I found this book entertaining with it's main characters having once lost their love, and then regaining it again after so many years. Some of the characters living around Bliss sounded really weird but those kinds of people really do exist. I did enjoy the mystery that was weaved into the story, it added greatly to the story. One of the characters, Polly Crow has her story continued in \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" which in turn also came from \\"Sheer Pleasures\\". I liked those two better, but I did enjoy this one .

Those that aren't, are burned from Enigma. I'm sure some people will like this, but I can't get past the sound of someone trying way too hard.

Garrett Schwarz has worked magic, crafting lovely music that is reminiscent of Delerium, but more mainstream. Featured vocalists Jody Quine, Kristy Thirsk (of Delerium), Colleen Coadic, Beverley Staunton, Camille Miller, Jennifer Hershman, and Jennifer Baldwin are each incredible in their own right.

Yet, i still havent scratched the surface of what Balligomingo is all about. This music goes beyond drum loops and catchy one-liners.

The liner notes say that some of the sets were 90 feet high!The movie, which was the most popular movie of 1922 according to PhotoPlay Magazine, seems to drag a little, occasionally, but tells the rarely told story of Robin Hood's life prior to King Richard's departure on the crusades. The action helps keep the movie going through a lot of it -- but be prepared for a silent-era epic. The film, overall, was enjoyable.The Kino DVD is great. The picture is generally very clear -- with some scratches. The tinting was superb.

Frankly, I was bored. Mailer opens his examination of Lee Harvey Oswald with an exhaustive, numbing biography of his wife Marina's ancestors and Oswald's adolescence in Russia. I did not care to know so much about Marina's cousins or Oswald's Russian girlfriends. Furthermore, Mailer writes these chapters in a simple, almost oral way, so they do not benefit from his wry, spirited voice and style. It is possible that the book improves once Mailer digs into the meat of the assassination and Oswald's potential motives, however I will never know for sure. Maybe Mailer should have started the novel at that point instead--then I might have read until the end. After reading and enjoying The Naked and the Dead, The Fight, and especially Harlot's Ghost, I found Oswald's Tale to be a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among Norman's Very Best!","review":"Let's face it! There's been tons of (often far out) research in to LH Oswald that it's tough to decide which books on the subject are worth looking into. The number of theories/ideas/plots etc. could fill a library (and probably do). So it's a real treat to read a highly researched, authoritative, and slightly imaginative book that goes beyond the standard \\"Loser\\", \\"Stooge\\" or worse hypothesis, and goes into about every aspect of this 23 year old assassin's life, especially his problematic,very strange, time in the USSR.Remember, after some time in the Marines, he defected to Minsk at the age of 21. So what happened there? This book makes a valiant attempt to find out, and probably comes as close to the truth as we'll ever get! So put this at the top of the list in the top shelf in the library of JFK Assassination Books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but sub-par","review":"While the book is certainly informative in respects to Oswald's personal life, many points are left on the surface, especially many regarding Oswald's role in the assassination. While Mailer's style is as excellent as ever, readers would do better to turn to Anthony Summers' 'Conspiracy', which is a comprhensive view not only of Oswald but of the entire affair. Also written from a journalistic perspective, it examines many of the areas that Mailer leaves to superficiality in much more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Unit","review":"Installed this unit on a rental property with a well pump. Wired a second unit in parallel for the hot water heater in the utility room. The controller is then wired through a pump controller to disable the pump if it senses water on the floor from a leak. Works great and easy to install and test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"This is a solid working hitch. I purchased it to use hauling a 5000 pound travel trailer and it has been great. The bolts pattern matched up perfectly on my 2000 Ford Expedition and I was able to install the hitch in under 15 minutes. I highly reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"If you're a phan, place your order right away. You will not regret it. Excellent footage of the band's humourous antics before and after shows. Great jams - the DWD jam is the best on the origional release as well as the Punch you which was added to the dvd. Great footage of great went which captures that phat festival...featuring bands sentiments after good and bad sets. All around great movie. A++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get much better","review":"Doesn't get much better than this if you like concert movies. Only rivaled by \\"Stop Making Sense\\" (Talking Heads) and The granddaddy fo them all, \\"The Last Waltz\\" (The Band & friends). Mike Gordon is hilarious in this movie. Watch what he does in his interviews. Trey comes out looking like an ..., but what he lacks in kindness and humbleness he makes up for with incredible guitar playing. Maybe he's not cocky, but just that good. A must have for anyone that remotely likes the music of Phish, Rolling Stones, Talking Heads, Ween, or basically any real music fan. If you watch MTV on a regular basis, please don't watch this movie, your taste [is bad]. If you listen to top 40 radio, don't watch this movie, your taste also [is bad] and may God hae mercy on your souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"must see for any phish phan","review":"I was lucky enough to catch this one in theaters couple months back, and i was very impressed. I have been a big phish phan for years now, and i was overjoyed to see how personal they get in this documentury. you get know all about the band. good stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the rest of the band?","review":"Wow, I guess it is safe to say that Tray thinks Tray is god's gift to the world. Some of the music is really, really good. However, Tray's attitude over shadows his bandmates excellent contributions. Perhaps this is the reason the band split for now? Maybe the movie should have been clips of highlights of various shows instead of concentrating on Tray's love of himself. I guess it would have been much better if he actually had something real to say instead of snippets of shallow comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough, I suppose.","review":"Mike telling Trey that he played too many notes the night before is almost worth the price of the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate Look at Phish","review":"I have been a Phish fan for only a couple years, and I really enjoyed this documentary. Actually, I watched it 3 times the first day. It gives a unique perspective on the band and their interactions with each other. My favorite parts were where they were just sitting around goofing off with each other. I think you have to have some prior interest in Phish to enjoy the documentary. I showed it to some friends who don't follow the band, and they weren't all that excited. All in all, a good documentary with funny scenes and good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for a Phish show...look elsewhere","review":"The DVD wasn't bad if you wanted to know every little background detail about the band that they could squeeze into 2 hours. I found myself saying play some... music already. When they did it was only a 30sec to 2 minute tease. Bottom line if you are looking for a Phish concert on DVD, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page!!!!","review":"Here's why the video's worth it. You've never heard Phish sound like this. In the concert footage, Page is maybe twice as loud as in concert (at least in the last couple of years). It's wonderful to actually hear him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never got it","review":"same thing as my doctor who order, i have not recieved anything in the mail. please contact me as soon as possible"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},x={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-b51a74b8"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/51.md","filePath":"sponsor/51.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/51.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
