Matt Foyer was really well cast as the typical Lovecraftian anti-hero, who is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders - in relative secret.If you're a fan it's worth a look, and not just to snicker and disparage. Consider what the creators were aiming for and you'll see how much they were able to capture the hopelessness of Lovecraft's mythos. The sense of despair at being unable to stem the tide of the cult's influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"Hmm...a Call of Cthulhu silent film. Sounds interesting. Sounds like everyone loves it..It just isn't very good. I was more or less in agony watching it and by the end I actually felt a bit ripped off after it was over.It's just so low budget and it just plain doesn't work. Cthulhu in particular was disappointing. The whole film felt like a sort of \\"test film\\" to show investors...not a finished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets Hear it for Silent Films","review":"Wow, this silent movie left me speechless and wanting more, what a fantastic piece of cinematic art as well as a timeless classic. For a \\"Horror Movie\\" of its time, it gives todays horror movies a run for their money. The screenplay is well adopted form the HP Lovecraft story, the direction is focused and to the point and even the special effects of the time are superb. This movie deserves the same merit as the Dracula and Frankenstien movies of their day, excellent from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"silent movie with subtitles","review":"I just wanted to give viewers a heads-up. This is a silent movie with subtitles. Unfortunately, subtitles give me headaches. I couldn't watch this movie because of the headache, but there are five other reviews at this time from people who did (I assume). Four of them gave it a good rating, one didn't. If subtitles makes a difference to you, I'm glad to provide the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish effort best avoided","review":"Speaking as a long-time silent film enthusiast and collector as well as a Lovecraft fan, I agree with the 1-star by a Mr Davis that the result is amateurish. In fact he's being polite. It's downright bad. Furthermore, it wouldn't even be a good student project. At least not if the student had any delusions of getting a passing grade. The idea is good but it needs to be done by people with talent, something this effort wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claymation Cthulhu? Booooo....","review":"If this was some kids senior project for his first film class maybe I'd have some sympathy. But if you're going to do one of the greatest monsters ever conceived you better have some real payoff monster scenes. This has this weak, super choppy, barely lit claymation Cthulhu at the end and it sucks. SUCKS. If you're dying to see it, just check it out on youtube before you waste 45 minutes of your life. I just don't get why this story never gets made the way it deserves. Remember that octopus monster that attacks Frodo in LOTR? That's as close to Cthulhu as movies have gotten, and even that is nowhere near as cool as the story. Benecio Del Toro, if you're reading this, screw making the Hobbit, and get New Line working on a decent film version of Cthulhu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Cool Film!","review":"For Lovecraft mavens, it doesn't get a lot better than this! Made by serious fans as a labor of love, this film faithfully translates a virtually untranslatable story to the screen. The central conceit - making a film in the style of the era when the story was first published - is brilliant, and while the film's (extremely) low-budget edges certainly show, they lend a charm to the whole undertaking. At 47 minutes, it never wears out its welcome and as a silent film, it captures the feel of the original story in ways that a lot of dialogue simply wouldn't have. This is a delightful romp, if that word can truly be applied to an author whose work virtually defines the idea of \\"dread.\\" For any Lovecraft fans, this is an absolute must-see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"Low budget, low effect, and silent...but they deliever better then anyone the Lovecraft story...I've seen almost every Lovecraft type movie out there...other then \\"The Thing\\" by John Carpenter...

I loved the story, and when I heard about this movie I couldn't wait to get it. I loved the way they \\"antiqued\\" the film, giving it an old-fashioned 20's look, right down to the makeup on the actors' faces. Making it a silent film was brilliant, as well. A lot of people have been very critical of the climax of the film, saying the the Cthulhu \\"monster\\" was very unrealistic looking. The whole feel of the movie was supposed to be from the old days! Sorry, there wasn't CGI in the 20's, I hate to disappoint you. This is as good as it would have gotten, and it was still good.

Did I want to see a low-budget horror film done in the style of a 1920's silent film?It turns out that YES, I did. I enjoy Lovecraft stories and was a little hesitant about what I THOUGHT was a film done by fans who want to live out their fantasies. We all know what kind of product THAT makes.NONE of what I feared was true. This is an excellent film and was made with great care with the budget they had. The soundtrack is excellent and I especially liked the stop-motion Cthulhu. It brought me back to my childhood of watching Harryhausen films on tv.I can only imagine what these folks can do with a real budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Survival from out of the Elder Dark...","review":"This DVD presents H.P. Lovecraft's most famous story 'The Call of Cthulhu' as if it were a 1920s silent movie, entirely appropriate for a story published in 1926. This a remarkable if low-budget production and clearly was a labour of love for all concerned. I am sure H.P. Lovecraft would have been highly entertained by it!Might be heavy going for the non-enthusiast, due to the silent format (albeit with very atmospheric music) and a film style which is very reminiscent of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' or maybe a mixture of 'Metropolis' and 'Nosferatu'! Period-style special effects and characterful acting add enormously to the atmosphere, which is chilling in places.I highly recommend this DVD of 'The Call of Cthulhu' to any aficionado of H.P. Lovecraft or anyone wanting to find out more about the Mythos. I feel it is an essential addition to any Lovecraft collection.The Call of Cthulhu: The Celebrated Story by H.P.

Somebody should have done it long ago. But the fact is, nobody has until now.Serious fans of the Cthulhu mythos deserve to see this movie. It does not disappoint on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valient effort, low budget","review":"I really enjoyed this worthy effort to get Lovecraft right. There were some budget/technical issues. For instance, the stop-motion Cthulu wasn't very satisfying, even given the low budget. In fact, the design of the hideous statues and such wasn't very satisfying in general. But the weird angular design of buildings in the dreams and finally the island were very well done, both creepy and \\"modern\\". The actors did a great job, and the script was wonderfully faithful to the source material. If you love the story and can put up with a pretty heinous Cthulu special effect, this is well worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan Noise is very disturbing","review":"This is an Excelent Machine with High Def capabilities, but the built in FAN noise is making me go mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album Full of Mighty Songs of Joy","review":"An overlooked great album. Imagine if you will, an alternative reality. Go back in time... the surf sound is ringing over the waves in California, skiffle sounds in England are forming the beat backbone of a future British invasion of America, and over in Detroit City the sounds of racing V8 engines inspire a new sound full of energy, crunchy guitars and harmony and uniquely American. That sound is The Vandalias! OK, it didn't happen that way, but put on your headphones and listen to this record and you will almost think that it did and you somehow missed the boat.

The new Sentenced are excellent! I really enjoyed the female vocals on this CD! The only problem that I had with this CD is that Ville's vocals weren't turned up enough. He is presented as very quiet and a lot of the harmonies would be better if you didn't have to strain to hear them! Also, it is a little difficult to hear what he's yelling about! The mixing on Crimson and Frozen are much better! This is a must for Sentenced fans old and new! I used to like their earlier stuff a lot, but then I grew out of that Death Metal phase! Five years later, I heard Crimson, found out that they've had a new vocalist for the last three albums, and then I went out and bought those ones! These guys are great if you like that brutal and blunt style of metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"Down is a blend of Crimson and Amok. Some of the deathy sound is still present, but Ville's (new vocalist) voice is still great. The female vocals on this album are a fresh change and the riffs are much heavier than Frozen and Crimson. A must buy for Sentenced fans and metal fans as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentenced's Best CD","review":"This is one of the best cds I've ever heard. It is a fine example of dark melodic metal done the right way, the finnish way. Everything about this cd is perfect, from the dark suicidal lyrics to the almost pop-sounding riffs to Ville's amazing voice. And lets not forget Miika Tenkula's amazing songwriting talents. This is truly a band to be reckoned with. If you are at all interested in this kind of metal, I tell you to stop hesitating and buy this now. Every single track is good, but standout tracks include \\"Bleed\\", \\"Warrior Of Life\\" and \\"I'll Throw The First Rock\\". I also want to point out the excellent instrumentals, the intro \\"The Gate\\" and \\"0132\\". Most bands don't have many instrumentals these days and this is something we need to see more of.

Battery fully charged didn't get a full hour out off. Heated up pretty much when played plugged in to ac for the amount of time it took to watch 1 movie. Not practical to run off of battery.Maybe if you use in dc or ac if you don't mind the heat. Hot enough that I did not like holding on lap. But then it is not a portable dvd if you have to plug it in. I was discouraged with its ablity to work off battery. Didn't play blank recorded dvd disk to well. At first I thought disk but played in other players no problem. I sent back for refund, not because of playing of blank disk. But overall performce is not close to what advertized. Buttons did not seem like they would take alot of wear. If you are looking for something to hang on back of a car seat and plug into car for the kids to watch cartoons on and don't want to spend alot of money. Maybe this is what you want. But although it has alot of features, it lacks quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"I bought this DVD player less than a month ago in anticipation of a long road trip and was very dissapointed to find that on the second movie I tried playing it wouldn't work. The first time it worked fine but when I took it back out a few weeks later it wouldn't read the disc and once it did it kept getting stuck and skipping. Luckily this happened before we went on the road. This one will go back and I am staying away from this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a few days..........","review":"The DVD player works fine if you do not mind it starting over again and again every time you try to move the player or press fast forward or any other button - this causes the player to READ the disk again which starts the movie over from the beginning. Also the player has a short where the plug for the car adapter and battery adapter plug in. IT IS NOT A CORD SHORT - IT IS A SHORT ON THE INSIDE OF THE PLAYER where the AC/DC adapter goes into the player. This renders the player useless. As I have read, I am not the only person with this problem. Unfortunately I have read reviews for several other players here and at other retailers and do not see any portable DVD players that have wonderful reviews so I may hang on to my money for a while to see if the industry improves this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"the first one i bought i had a major problem with. it doens't play most of my dvds. whats the use of having a dvd player when it doesn't play all of your favorite dvds. i say get a diffrent brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading product representation","review":"I recently purchased this DVD player from Amazon.com specifically because your product description states that it supports DVD-r & DVD rw playback.

It is so versatile. You can use pods or grind your own but you will need to purchase a real tamper (57mm) - the little plastic one just doesn't cut it. What is GREAT about this machine (frankly AMAZING) is that you can steam a jug of milk, run a bit of water through the grouphead, and be at optimal brewing temperature within 10 seconds after you steamed. Even the Isomac Zaffiro can't match that.The espresso quality is okay when using pods. But with a really good burr grinder and the right tamp, you can pull astonishingly good shots with plenty of crema. All this in such a tiny and cute package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built to last","review":"I've been using my X3 for over a year now (averaging 8 shots per day) and have had no problems at all with performance.

I would buy another in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great espresso, but not for long....","review":"I really liked this machine -- the espresso was very good and the steamer heated quicky....until it broke less than two years after purchase. For the cost of the X3, I expect more longevity. Since I am beyond the one-year warranty, the repair is at my expense, which is estimated to be $300, plus shipping and handling both directions (around $20 each way) -- which is almost the cost of a new machine. So, in spite of the nice brew, I can't recommend this machine --it's simply too costly for you and the environment to purchase a machine that breaks so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Here I have a refurbished Palinato X3; textured, very hardy stainless; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws, -170 to start (6 mo warranty).But let me correct one point made in these reviews, the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic, a rather new trend that works quite well, the steam nob as well seems to be this material.All around this is quite an improvement on the X1: more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the X1. Cups warm quicker also.It also seems to handle ground coffee a little better. Still it's important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder, and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming, fat content just makes more fat, not true foamed milk."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 x-3 units, both failed","review":"I have now purhcased two Francis x-3 units and both have failed.

It really looks like something from the 80's. Yogi Marlon seems like a genuinely warm person, who is competent in her practice of yoga. But, the DVD totally detracts from that. I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape I had of Yoga Journal's Yoga Inroduction with Patricia Walden because my VCR finally gave out. I thought the VHS was OK. It served it's purpose very well, and was excellent for beginners. I was hoping this new DVD would be easy enough for my 3 boys (ages 11, 12 & 13) to follow but they get distracted by some of the things she says, and the sort of \\"subliminal images\\" in one of the sections.

Add to this Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals annd this is certainly an album that should appeal to fans of that band.This is a very melancholy album (something which applies to every Katatonia album actually) and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like sad music.

Definitely not your usual studio album! Several great songs on here, as well as an updated \\"Jesus' Blood\\" from the \\"Mezzamorphis\\" cd. \\"Awaken the Dawn\\" is great, and the first song \\"God You are my God\\" is fabulous!

As a worship leader, I've used somewhere around ten of the songs from \\"Cutting Edge\\" in congregational worship. Martin Smith is an amazing songwriter and worshipper... I was just hoping for some more great worship material, and didn't get it. If you like \\"Mezzamorphis\\" and \\"King Of Fools\\", (and I do by the way) you will like this as well!

I would not buy this particular edition of the book and in fact i returned it for a refund and got instead the Basic Books, paperback version published in 2008 which was available for about the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tragedy","review":"Firstly after reading other reviews i feel i should just say the lenght of the book does not really matter and that if you are to judge a book fairly you should forget about the length and focus on whats inside. Now thats finished i can tell you about this truly wonderful book which, i feel, captures the emotion and drama of Scott's Last Polar Expedition. Cherry-Gerrard manages to bring all the trials and tribulations of Polar existence to life. Cherry-Gerrard was in the right place to tell all of this journey, including as many people forget, the Cape Crozier expedition which he undertook with Birdie Bowers and Bill Wilson who were both to die with Scott. That expedition gives the title for the book.This is a truly tragic story and was written beautifuly by one of the survivors of the Expedition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"Long after you've forgotten the timeline from Into Thin Air or the names of Muir's favorite valleys, you'll still be haunted by the terror, heroism, and despair of The Worst Journey in the World. This book is unforgettable. Yes, it is long, and yes, it's written in the gentlemanly British style of a bygone era, but between the encyclopedic descriptions and stiff-lipped objectivity, humanity and horror is bursting through the seams.One major publication listed The Worst Journey in the World as the #1 outdoor adventure story of all time. It is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible edition of a classic adventure saga","review":"This edition of Cherry-Garrard's classic was extremely disappointing. I received it as a gift and did not begin reading it immediately. If I had, I would have returned it immediately. It is an outwardly attractive paperback that seems sturdy and well bound, but, there is incomplete publishing information, illustrations are lacking, no forward or afterward, etc. The cover should have told the tale; the author's name is misspelled! I assume the complete text of the original is contained within the covers, but nothing else. This is a cheap knock-off of a classic text and the publisher should be ashamed of producing such an inferior product. This edition was published 25 February, 2012 according to my copy, but Amazon says December 23, 2011. I received this copy for Christmas, 2011, so the information on the last printed page of the book must be incorrect. Buyer beware, you can do much better by buying another edition of this incredible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reproduction, poor print job, no illustrations.","review":"I was very disappointed with this copy. No illustrations, just a cheaply typeset copy with many type errors like you would expect for a manual for a cheap product. \\" The Worst Copy in the World\\"!!! The Contents page lists illustrations that are not in the book. Also this is volume one of two volumes.The print job is also cheap with variance on the amount of ink from page to page.Overall just a cheap product that is difficult to read, and incomplete.

After reading about Shackleton's adventures in the book \\"Endurance\\", I longed to read more about antarctic exploration. However, \\"The Worst Journey in the World\\" fell far short of my expectations. The first half was too long and not written well enough to sustain my interest. The author kept going off on tangents that made it hard for me to focus on this book. The story picks up in the second half, but I was sorely disappointed. Check out \\"Endurance\\" for a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you review a book that you did not entirely read?","review":"I read about 50 pages and had to quit. Time was, I would never do that. I'm older now, and if the writing is way too verbose and stuck in irrelevant details that do not lend anything to the story, I quit. I really like adventure books and was surprised that this one wouldn't grab me. I don't think it is the story (from other reviews, the story is a good one); seems that the author and I just don't mix.Maybe I will pick it up again at some time and give it another shot. Looking at the size of this book, it is unlikely. If I do, I will give it a fair review.To put this review in context, I happened to have LOVED the story of Endurance by Alfred Lansing. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A highly over-rated book.","review":"This is at best a third-rate account of Scott's incompetent expedition. It is basically a compilation of snippets from three different diaries. The author has absolutely no perspective on the gross inadequacies in technology and leadership that needlessly cost several lives, and imperiled many more. This account is also unbelievable long and repetitive, making weeks seem like months, months like years, and years like decades.An infinitely superior treatment is Roland Huntford's \\"The Last Place on Earth\\" (originally published as \\"Amundson and Scott\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book simply has to be read in its entirety","review":"You cannot get the full impact of this whole era, the voyage, the way men were in that time, the astonishing depth of their isolation, etc. if you do not slog through Cherry's ambitious (and really long) work even as these mad Englishmen did through the Antarctic wilderness.Of course it's not \\"well-written.\\" It is, however, quite adequately written: it gets the point across. I defy anyone to read just the section called \\"The Winter Journey\\" and not want to scream at them: are you insane?Whether or not the writing is up to certain literary standards is entirely beside the point. It's about one of the most harrowing events of the 20th Century and should speak, however haltingly, for itself.Suggested also: \\"South\\" by Sir Ernest Shackleton about his 2-year nightmare in the Southern OceanAnd for an interesting fictive/literary take on Scott's voyage, \\"The Birthday Boys\\" by Beryl BainbridgeEKW"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so expensive chair cushions","review":"Very disappointed.

While Cossacks is no Age of Empires, it is a fun game to play. If you are someone who goes for total realism, this game may not be for you. Most of the time, I found the best strategy is to just mass produce units and thrown them at the enemy in swarms. Still there is something addictive about the gameplay, and I found myself up to the wee hours of the morning finishing differant levels. Average graphics, decent storyline, and wild battles make this worth the purchase. If you enjoy this, they have released Cossacks II and American Conquest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"there are quite a few games to choose from right now, but Cossacks are still worth money.I like the fact that this is the game that is historically accurate, has good graphics, and allows to create plenty of units.I used to like Age of Empires II (I know it's old), but that game had only 200 or so units. Cossacks, on the other hand, allow you to create thousands of units. When playing online, it's also great.I know this game is getting old, but it is still a good option if you like strategy games."},{"rating":"1","title":"CANNOT PLAY","review":"This is essentially the same review that I left for American Conquest Anthology.

I am playing Doom 3 with no problems, so it must be a problem with this game (and American Conquest Anthology). Is it a concidence that they are both packaged by the same company, in a generic red and clear package? I don't know, but I DO know that neither of these games will run on my new laptop.

No other Presidents, including the current one, are mentioned, nor is the President's role well defined. The book focuses as much on the Revolutionary and Civil Wars as on Presidents Day and portrays the Civil War as a war fought exclusively over slavery. It also implies that all southerners were pro-slavery and were slave owners.

It is the same sense that makes some metal fans buy The Gathering's \\"How to Measure a Planet?\\" or anything recent from Pyogenesis.

Granted, it's not perfect, but I gave it 5 stars since it's been a constant presence in my CD player for about 9 years. The only negative comment I can make is that it might be a little repetitive, but that doesn't bother me too much. The vocals (provided by Legion, former Marduk vocalist) are great and harsh, and stand in stark contrast to the music, which could not in the least be described as black metal. The riffs are more in the vein of melodic Black Sabbath, mostly consisting of single string, often blues-based melodies. The riffs seem to meander all over the place, but always maintain the same motif. It's rather simple, but quite unique and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure dissapointment","review":"I bought this cd few months after its release.

The story by itself keeps us gripped and interested. The way the story unfolds has a lot of energy and Almodovar surprises us with revelations at every corner.

Freemantle explains every topic she addresses clearly, simply, lucidly and thoroughly, without the confusing jargon that so often leaves the reader lost and confused in other similar books. One senses behind her written words the presence of a compassionate, knowledgeable and gentle friend who wants to make sure that you understand everything she is presenting.

There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie. Watching Leslie Neilson punch & slap every button on the space ship console while it makes beeping noises,to avoid a meteor shower. HILARIOUS!! Watching a guy slip around with a mop on a soapy floor for five minutes..HA! What a hoot! That's about the best of it I'm afraid, unless you count the red alien that sings\\" I want to eat your face\\". Had I not already heard about that part from other reviews before hand, I probably would have found that funny, but the punchline was wasted on me. Most of what fills this movie is simply a badly written script, Actors trying really hard to be funny,and it just doesn't work.

This spoof of Science Fiction movies (Alien moreso than most) comes across as a love letter from one fan of these films (and Airplane-like comedies) to the world. While Cindy Williams' solo song and dance number might have been a bit lack-luster, I loved the creatures \\"I Want To Eat Your Face\\" and the duet \\"Bachelor Bills\\"! There was even a limited edition soundtrack release which I had to buy! This is a guilty pleasure of the highest magnitude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I bought this DVD hoping to see one of my favorite comic actors, Leslie Nielsen, in another Airplane! type movie. I knew ahead of time that given its limited promotion that the movie would be along the lines off a low budget feature.

Rather, re-watch the Naked Gun series or Police Squad instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"why, oh why, do I have to give it ANY stars?!?","review":"I rented this and hated it.

This was originally released as \\"The Creature Wasn't Nice\\". I don't think the title change helps at all.This is basically an \\"Alien\\" spoof, where a creature roams the spaceship tormenting Leslie Nielson, Cindy Williams, et al, and of course hilarity is supposed to ensue. It doesn't. The whole mess is just one corny sight gag after another. This might fare well in the 8-13 age group, but adults will be embarrassed by the silliness.This is the same directing/writing team that put together \\"The First Nudie Musical\\", which was only slightly more amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY SPACE","review":"Filmed on a budget of probably no more than $1200, NAKED SPACE is one of the WORST Spoofs I've ever seen. Writer/director/co-star Bruce Kimmel bombards us with lame, humorless dialogue; a set that looks like Plan 9 from Outer Space with a budget cut, and the performances (save for Gerrit Graham's mugging) are unabashedly terrible. Never would I have thought Leslie Nielsen could be so unfunny, nor Cindy Williams and Patrick Macnee so obnoxious. As for Kimmel, what is it with the song and dance numbers? I Want to Eat Your Face was funny for about two seconds. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I did expect a laugh or two. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even funnier than Phantom Menace","review":"Our university roleplaying group had a regular video evening, where Mark Kelly would inflict all manner of trash on us. That's how I first encountered 'Spaceship' (The UK title). The inspired daftness had us crying with laughter. It might not appeal to all senses of humour but we loved the singing and dancing monster, the sci-fi in-jokes and the Bad Science dialogue, delivered with beautifully straight faces.\\"Their oxygen is compatible with ours\\".Cross 'Alien' with 'Dark Star' and you get the general idea. It's shot on a shoestring budget, but that's part of the charm. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves without treating it like a joke. If you like oddball, \\"what were they on ?\\" stuff, you'll love 'Spaceship'.I've spent more than two hours trying to track down a PAL video copy but it's not available anywhere.

This album (in my opintion, this is their best release to date) is dark and gloomy (although I wouldn't go so far as to call it depressing) but so beautiful that people who aren't into \\"doom\\" music can still appreciate it. The combination of Raymond's deep dark vocal rumblings and Liv Kristine's angelic soprano work perfectly to weave a tapestry of darkness and light that no other band has managed to capture or even approach.If you are interested in exploring something dark and beautiful, then this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh - it's depressing but good","review":"This is the saddest music I've heard - Yet the beautiful chords entwined with the unique voice of the female singer are most wonderful and entrancing. As I heard it, a kind of depression instantly invaded me, yet I could not stop listening to the amazing arrangements and the softest, sweetest voice I've ever heard on a woman. Particularly interesting was the track \\"and when he falleth\\", containing a great dialogue between the female singer and what I assume is an old man, but the voice of the old man seems taken from an old movie clip. This is definitely not a \\"party\\" record, but the music is deep and wonderful. Worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Although Theatre of Tragedy does sound a bit like Tristania. I love their music. The first song I've ever heard from Theatre of Tragedy was Seraphic Deviltry. I like the feel in this song how it is very melodic, but yet it is metal. I love the feel to this song. When I first heard it I went Wow. I suggest everyone go out and buy this album. This band is an amazing band that deserves to be regonized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, guys. Wake up!","review":"This music is cheesy. Do you think this is good goth or doom metal? What is this? The weak female voice is nothing. The growling male vocal is just so so. There is nothing serious in composition or playing. No good guitar riffs. The keyboard sounds like cheap (but deceiving) elevator music. The drumming is boring.This is one of the most horriblly commercial goth.(If it could be called goth).If you are looking for good moody sound, try My dying bride and Type O negative. At least they know how to compose. This cd is just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...is this a joke?","review":"What a great idea! Take a beautifully melodic female vocalist, lugubrious and moody music, and throw in a ridiculous sounding death metal vocalist to ruin the entire thing!Velvet Darkness They Fear has to have been one of the most confusing, downright weird musical journeys of my life. At first, I was rather impressed. You start with some cool, dark, quiet textures with some element of beauty. You also have a lovely female vocalist with a delightful voice. So why the stupid sounding death metal vox? Maybe it's \\"cool\\" or whatever, but to me it just sounded stupid. Why? Why? Why? It's dumb and ridiculous. If they wanted to preserve the gothic mood, it IS possible to find a vocalist with talent beyond growling that still sounds \\"dark\\" and \\"gothic.\\"Be warned. This music is strange and confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And When He Falleth\\" ~ Gothic Opera For A Post-Christian Age","review":"Liv Kristine's angelic soprano voice counterbalanced by the gruff, demonic refrains of Raymond Rohonniy work together perfectly in the Theatre of Tragedy -9 track- CD, 'Velvet Darkness They Fear.' Unlike many other Goth bands that rely too heavily on their female vocalist to keep their audience involved, Raymond somehow manages to bring his discordant vocals into an adversarial, yet complimentary relationship with Liv's ethereal incantations. Truly light and shadow have become one.Dark, Haunting, Unrelenting, Erotic and Beautiful. Everything you could ask for from a Goth/metal band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a Dictionary!","review":"Hope you are well-versed in your old-English before you listen to this. Actually, I have to say this is probably the most Vampiric album I have ever listened to - straight out of Dracula!

One of my favorite albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THANKS NOLO for putting this book out! JUST what I needed!","review":"I LOVE this book! Very thorough, endless hints and tips.

It hits right on the money when it talks about the court system and being treated wrongly because you choose to represent yourself versus paying a high priced lawyer.

It's very well produced, the actors are great, the story is interesting, everything is placed correctly, and as a result, you have a nice film to not only see, but also buy.It's all about Ethan's love issues, and sometimes, you can refer some of those issues to your own love life. If not, it's worth watching anyway, 'cause is cutely 'queer'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Romantic Comedy","review":"Is it as good as the comic strip? No but it comes close. Another in a line of excellent gay romantic comedies. Perfect for a quiet night at home with a date or partner. Eye candy galore and good acting. The director does a decent job covering up the fact that the film is low budget. The story follows the protagonist through his disasterous love life, which is basically what the comic strip is about. I especially enjoyed the supporting characters: the long suffering hunky ex-boyfriend, the protective \\"aunties\\" (the Hat Sisters), campy mother (nice to see Meredith back in action), a luscious lesbian roomate (love her), a deranged realator, a wide eyed twink who is anything but innocent, a gay republican businss man, and clueless Ethan.

Daniel Letterle is an okay actor, however his performance was a bit, shall we say, shy of a 'real' personality. I have seen it three times now since I have bought it 2 weeks ago.

When I tried to contact Francis Francis, I was only able to reach Illy. The machine was out of warranty, so it cost $10 for them to ship a box to me to have it FedEx'd to the service center. Before sending it in, I tried to find out how much I would be charged for the repair, but Illy could not provide an estimate; they did say it could be as much as $150.

The cost of fixing the machine is going to be upwards of $150. I'd rather put that toward a new machine of higher quality.

I expected something similar to the books that use the \\"Star Trek\\" characters in which relationships are explored and developed, where the past is explained and there is an effort to carry on continuity in the characters' lives. This is the second in the series and so far, it appears that the author doesn't seem to care about Matt, Miss Kitty and Doc because he doesn't seem to know much about them. In the first book of the series, Festus even reads a newpaper. In the second, Matt actually asks Kitty to marry him? The plots, although fairly standard, aren't objectionable. The characterization is what is off the mark. I hope the series continues but maybe the author should watch some more reruns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dillon was a UNITED STATES marshal !","review":"For Gunsmoke fans who crave tidbits of romantic verbal interplay between Matt and Kitty, this book is worth the reading.

Worse was the major plot device which contended that Matt was a lawman chosen by the town council and thus could be dismissed by them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big scam!","review":"My title says it all: this reprint is a piece of garbage and a total waste of money. The original publication dating back from 1915, I did not expect a perfect reprint, but this is an insult to buyers! The reprint is a collection of trashy, hardly legible photocopies. The plates are even worse as the photocopy process has bleached out the major part of the drawings and blotched whatever was left. The captions are illegible as well. The original information and illustrations being important to collectors and teachers, it would be of great importance to take utmost care in their reproduction. With today's technology, I cannot believe that the so-called publisher (Forgotten Books) could not have done a better job.

Only the mighty Meshuggah can surpass SYL (in terms of quality, intensity wise this wins easily). I mean as an avid listerner of some insanely heavy stuff (Nile, Emperor, Soilent Green among others) the sheer lethality of this blew me away! This stuff is plain dangerous its so crazy! Also check out the first album and Devin's side-project Ocean Machine, its worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete package!","review":"I bought this album simply because I noticed that Gene Hoglan did the drumming. I had never heard about SYL before, and even Devin Townsend himself was unknown to me (boy, do I feel dumb?). And together with the thundering bass, the massive guitars and Devin's brilliant voice Strapping Young Lad delivers a complete package of music and metal. You are totally exhausted after having just listened to it! Then imagine playing it?! And releasing so much energy?! Wow, I do admire Strapping Young Lad, and I think all of us should. \\"City\\" is the perfect cure for anger..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metal Masterpiece","review":"I heard SYL first on the Century Media Identity I compilation. I nearly passed out from lack of oxygen to the brain! I was absolutely breathless. I had never heard anything this intense. They are often compared to Fear Factory, and I guess this is fairly accurate. Just imagine Fear Factory on steroids, with the volume turned up to 20! But that is just the beginning. While many bands sacrifice musicianship for sheer brutality, this simply isn't the case with SYL. The songs are intense, brutal, and they flow.For this masterpiece, they enlist the services of Gene Hoglan, who is probably the best drummer in the genre. Honestly folks, I can't think of a better metal album in existence. I'm always searching, but this has yet to be topped. If you are a fan of extreme music, then this is right up your alley. If you are faint of heart, beware. This album might just bury you."},{"rating":"2","title":"killer","review":"this is a killer metal album. so fast, so hard, so heavy, so brutal, so insane. perhaps the most brutal metal album released..."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I expected better of this album.But,besides \\"Detox\\" and \\"Oh My F**king God\\",This album is kind of boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense yet somewhat overated","review":"It is defintley a very intense album but they dont even come close to reaching the brilliance of Meshuggah.Gene Hoglan's finest drumming is also left back in the days of Death where he worked with a truely magnificent and talented musician, Chuck Schuldiner, Devin Townsend really doesn't come close to Chuck's superb orchestrations and talent in song writing and guitar playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring nu-metal","review":"This isn't heavy at all.

The music is heavy but that is about the extent of anything good being found on this cd, its all tuned down distorted noises and effects.

If you want your guts to be wrenched and your head to hurt then I suggest you go out and get this album. I could go on about the time structure and harmonies and the juxtoposing of the songs and this and that; but to be honest, I don't care. To me, this record is the ultimate blast of pure noise. It is the heaviest forty minutes you'll ever hear. It is the finest record on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best 90s Metal Album, period.","review":"That's right, kiddies, you read correctly. This album, Devy's second endeavour unattached to Vai's apron strings into the big bad world of extreme metal, is a masterpiece on every level. Nine tracks of sheer neck-breaking metal. I still have not heard another album as heavy - and when I say heavy, I don't mean I haven't heard much metal. I HAVE heard Origin. I HAVE heard the Berzerker. They are heavy - VERY heavy: City is heavier, and I'll tell you why.This album has dynamics without ever losing the pace, intensity or insane yet calculated aura that most metal cannot replicate. This album sounds crazy when it's not and has a sound that not even black metal, death metal or a thousand blastbeats can imitate. A song like All Hail the New Flesh only comes along once in a metal half-life (something like 15 years, maybe). You don't have to concur. Listen for yourself. Redefine metal. City did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"When I began reading this book, I thought, \\"Oh my, this must this poor woman's first attempt at writing.\\" Then I learned that she has written others ... Grammatical mistakes aside, this book was not what I'd expected. I was looking for a book on gardening folklore. There is some of that, but it is arranged more like an old Farmer's Almanac, by month. There seems to be no real rhyme or reason as to how things were added, and I got a little tired of the religious references that are peppered throughout. I will continue to look for the type of book I had in mind. This book does have some interesting information, if you can find it buried within the text. There are also some very old recipes that look intriguing. I am giving two stars as follows: one because the woman completed the text; another because she managed to find someone to publish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very decent","review":"Well this album, like most Iced Earth Album, is generic Power Metal, but what the F*CK is wrong with that?

This cd is great for winding down in the afternoon or when you are thoroughly angry. There is just something hypnotic about the words and melodies. If you like Iced Earth I would also suggest Nightwish and Iron Maiden for you. Iced Earth has a unique sound all their own and I plan to acquire many more cd's by them soon. My fiancee got me to listen to Days of Purgatory and I loved it. This comes from a woman who listens to Hank Williams Jr., Reba, Garth Brooks, Mozart and Jessica Simpson. This cd was so out of my normal listening range and I love it. You should by or at least sample the songs. Check out Glorious Burden while you're at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"It is great to hear the old Iced Earth songs given new life by Matt Barlow. Barlow is unreal, his voice is perfect for these and all of Iced Erath's songs. I don't understand how a fan of Iced Earth could \\"talk bad\\" Barlow. The guy is awesome! The only thing cooler than his voice, is his hair. When he headbangs, it is like a massive wall of hair being flung all around.

Somehow, though, the rhythms and melodies have worked their way into my head, and I have grown to like this album. It isn't very intense, and seems to have a wandering sound, like it's not going anywhere. I find it almost relaxing to listen to, somehow. Anyway, if you like black metal at all i recommend that you get this album. While it contains the essence of traditional black metal, I think there is some originality too. Unfortunately the lyrics are satan-inspired. I guess I don't really care, but there have to be more interesting things to sing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

And this stinker only gets worse from there. Gere's acting range is limited to the number of times he can blink his eyes and squint, but this script doesn't call for much command of an emotional vocabulary. I found myself laughing out loud at the pathetic weakness of this plot. The reliance upon stale devices wouldn 't have been so humorous except there was no connection between them and the actual storyline. Just a jumbled mess of ideas and bad acting. I found no redeeming value in this one and I'm sorry I watched it all the way through hoping to find one. Topher needs a better vehicle and Martin Sheen must've needed a paycheck. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Wish I had, thats 90 minutes I'll never get back...."},{"rating":"2","title":"the double","review":"This will be a short and sweet review. Good movie.

I knew nothing about this film when I started watching it and was pleasantly surprised by the whole movie. This is one of the best things I have seen Richard Gere do in a long time and think the role is perfect for him. Topher Grace is great as the up and coming FBI kid who knows all about the man they are looking for.

The old CIA guy and the young FBI guy have to look for a Russian mole cum assassin who was supposed to be dead since long. Somebody plays both sides. The Russians turn out to be everywhere and they have Roman names like Cassius and Brutus. 25 years ago this would have looked like anti-communist paranoia.

A very poorly staged news interview with two alleged Senators that was obviously actors? The J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building with an obviously cheap wooden sign, really? Untold characters who drifted in and contributed little, then left the storyline?Wow, just stunningly bad. The actors seemed throughout to be in a hurry to get off the set and cash their checks before the film was seen by human beings.During the course of it playing, I found myself considering suicide as an option to end the pain.

I found this movie highly predicatble, boring with a weak overall story. The only one that provides some kind of aura and class to the movie is Richard Geere. Other than that the movie is a waste of time. Comparable stories like this one has shown on TV seen a million times; the russian spy motive is outdated in my opinion anyways. In terms of Spy Movies nothing comes close to Bourne Trilogy in my opinion, \\"The double\\" is light years away. An episode of Criminal Intend is more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gere with Grace - good grief!","review":"You need to get out more if a cardboard, cut-out thriller like this impresses you.

It doesn't even offer the exploitive charms that lots of cheap action flicks generally deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is unbelievably bad...","review":"A story that makes little sense and a bunch of actors that obviously turned up for the pay check. The budget obviously went in to the second rate cast. Everything is shot in some unused warehouse or slum. Gere just gets worse as he gets older. Behold one of the worse death scenes ever.

I agree with one of the other reviewer about the first scene when the woman at the ball park found R. Gere cute, instead she should have thought of him as a pedophile. Also, soon in the movie, they reveal who Cassius is and takes away any suspense or desire to continue watching that boring movie.

She finds this charming as opposed to alarming. It gets less believable from here.Spoilers Ahead: This movie is just a brutal, boring mess.

I spent a lot of time making it look nice, only to have every single one just fall off after a few weeks.

And I would have done so with this book, but as it was a gift from one of my students I felt somewhat obligated to finish it.The start of the story felt stereotypical with known characters and situations.And as it progressed I was unsure as to the book being fantasy or science fiction.(Guess it was neither).When I completed reading the book, I was surprised to realize I felt practically nothing for the characters nor the situations in which they found themselves...I can't remember the last time I had that kind of reaction to a book I had read.I will certainly ask my student what it was that held so much appeal to her.I am glad that I did not pay for this book as it seems hardly worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"Really, I don't understand what all the raves were about.

I had never heard of the book before someone mentioned it on the internet and I\\"m certain it will become a huge success once more people hear about it. It is a very moving, passionate story about New York and some of it's inhabitants through the twentieth century. The harshness of racism that runs through the story will remind some of Ragtime.

McCann manages to make both worlds come to life and simultaneously offers a fascinating examination of how one family's history evolves, for better or worse. His portrait of NYC's subterranean life feels true, and sympathetic, but without judgment, and never saccharine or condescending. These are real characters, and they will move you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book group material","review":"I came upon this book inadvertently during some surfing on Amazon.

Nowhere in the description does it explain this. It was shipped to me pretty quickly, which was nice, but the directions to assemble it were not clear at all, and the battery compartment was really hard to screw off, even for my husband. The decals were cheap and most of them tore when I tried peeling them off to adhere to the car. If my daughter wants to just ride on it without using the button to make it run, it is very noisy. When she pushes the button, it rides itself, but goes very slow and is very loud. The only thing that she really likes about this so far is the fireman hat that came with it--she wears it all the time. I would not purchase this again.

First, last i checked the US government has no need to contract mercenaries, we have the largest and most trained army in the world. The second thing i found really annoying is the aliens shape.

The concepts for this movie were likely copied from Alien, Predator, and Independence day. The DVD cover's alien looks similar to the creature from the Alien movies, however the actual movie's alien looks different from the DVD cover. The alien can become invisible like the creature from Predator. One scene was obviously copied from Independence day (the alien has it's tentacle around the dead scientists neck, making the scientist's body say \\"...r e l e a s e... m e...\\"). Perhaps the alien may have been more believable if it had been filmed under dim lighting conditions, however views of the alien were in full daylight making it obviously a badly designed fake rubber monster suit.The special features consists of an interview with the director who is wearing a rubber monster mask.

The actors go from intense overacting (the Phoebe character esp.) to not acting at all (Lorenzo Lamas and anyone in the OPI). The only redeeming portion of the movie is the beginning there is actually some nudity that is interesting, but it goes downhill as soon as they enter the cave and find the treasure.

Lorenzo Lamas, looking seriously bored and only in the movie for about 10 minutes, is pretty bad, but the rest of the cast is worse. The effects are some of the worst I've seen recently and the screenwriter is one of those who thinks that every character must have at least three profanities in his dialogue.

After the huge success of \\"Abba Generation\\", their debut album, a-teens is back for more, showing they can do more than abba covers. The original idea of bringing abba songs back, with a modern beat, was good, but their fans noticed a-teens had to perform their own songs to have a solid career.This second CD is great because all their songs are original, but at the same time the band manages to keep abba spirit alive. Some of the new songs are very similar to N'SYNC, Britney and BSB (\\"That's what (it's all about), Rockin'), but it is not only a repetition of these popular singer/bands. A-Teens has its own swedish style and it makes them great on stage.The whole album is good, specially \\"halfway round the world\\", \\"..to the music\\" and \\"upside down\\".

To The Music is pretty good. Halfway Around The World is one of the best songs on here, probably number 3 or 4. Firefly is my number 2. If you listen to it, it's kind of like a guy going to war and killed, but he had a family to support. Rockin' is awesome. I love this song because it's simple and easy to sing. For All That I Am and Morning Light are awesome, too. They're just well-written and well-sung. Marie and Sara have great voice, and Marie and Dhani are beautiful together in Morning Light.

Toklas\\" made Gertrude Stein a household name in America in the 1930s, and for good reason. This is Stein at her most accessible and I must highly suggest it for any first-time readers of this literary genius. The book has a light, breezy tone, interesting subject matter (Picasso & various renowned artists pop up throughout), and Stein's trademark intellectual brilliance. The device of using Toklas as an approach to Stein's life is certainly interesting and is responsible for some of the most entertaining passages. And this book is certainly entertaining, thanks to Stein's supreme wit and her clever descriptions of the people she interacts with and situations she finds herself in. I highly recommend this book, especially for those who haven't read Stein before. Her vivacity, wit, intelligence and skill are on display here in an accessible, classic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"This is the book that brought Stein into mainstream society, and not without reason. Considerably more accessible than her other work, she relays the story of her life through the personna of Alice B. Toklas, her life-long companion. Primarily consisting of remarks about the various movers of the Paris art and literary scene that took place at the turn of the century, Stein, above all, isn't afraid to say just what she thinks. However, her wry anecdotes and asides are not written without the greatest of attention to style, and the reader finds each sentence to be representative of the orignality in grammatical structure that made her famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Classic","review":"I picked up The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas after hearing about it for years. It is toted as a story about the relationship between two great influences in the Parisian world of arts and letters in the early 20th century. Instead I found a hagiography of Gertrude Stein written by Ms. Stein herself. According to her self-proclamations, she was a genius, a great writer, an auto mechanic, a great conversationalist, a supporter of the arts, etc., etc. The only one of these I feel competent to comment on is her skills as a writer. If this book is an example of her writing, then I am not convinced that she was a great writer.In its favor, The Autobiography does paint a picture, abstract but true, of the artistic world of Paris during the early 20th century. The most interesting chapter was the Was Years, where Alice and Gertrude Stein aided in support for soldiers during World War I.To me, this book is greatly overrated and not worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"history lesson","review":"if you want to know about paris and some clowns including picasso and others in a daily routine then OK, else a tabloid or something. just doesn't read well as a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great youth ministry tool","review":"This book is a great tool for any youth minister who is just getting started.

Diehl, who I found so enjoyable in his Martin Vail series, goes back to another time, and leads the reader on a journey of the heart and soul. He has two strong leads in Brodie Culhane and Zeke Bannon, and by the time these two collide, it's hard to decide who you want to root for. This is because Diehl builds such a strong character in Brodie, that you identify with him early in the book. When he's older and running for governor, it's hard to believe he's corrupt.A well written \\"noir\\", but something \\"moir,\\"...a heartfelt thriller.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diehl's best ever","review":"William Diehl's books are generally fun to read.

But Sheriff Culhane is no angel, either, and when a murder 20 years later brings Detective Zee Bannon sniffing around, the skeleton is Culhane's closet start rattling up a storm. A standard potboiler from Diehl (Sharky's Machine), an author who knows his way around them, Eureka's epic scope screams for a made-for-TNT adaption, but when aiming for grandiosity it stetches too thin. Not much gold in them thar pages, but if you'll settle for bronze you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story, ignore the editorial glitches","review":"This book is a very enjoyable read. The backstory begins around 1900, then the crime and subsequent investigation occur in 1941. The setting is California, the fictional town of Eureka to begin with, then Los Angeles is added in 1941. An apparently accidental death is suspected to be homicide, and the investigation that follows is most interesting. The characters are well-drawn and the setting is fully realized. In the early pages there are several instances of very sloppy editing - like a character getting into a Ford, then getting out of a Chevrolet a paragraph or two later. These are annoying, but they only occur in the first few pages of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diehl noir","review":"When I was younger I read a book that left me mesmerized. It was named \\"Primal fear\\". After that, I read other books by William Diehl, but none of them came close to that first one. \\"Eureka\\" doesn't come close to \\"Primal fear\\" either, but it's a different style.Set in the early forties, it deals with the apparent suicide, in Los Angeles, of a woman with no past. As Detective Sargeant Zeke Bannon and his part Ski Agassi investigate into the matter, they find out suspicious ties with the tiny rich-people paradise of Eureka, where a tough sheriff will do anything to stop the big-city cops to knoe the truth.While Diehl is effective on creating the noir atmosphere, the story is simple and the book is overlong. Mixing politics with murder and beautiful women, Diehl makes no big mistakes in this book. As I said, the book is long, but totally enjoyable. Anyway, is good to hear from the author of \\"Primal fear\\" after his last release, five years previously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I bought this book expecting the same suspense as the author's \\"Martin Vail\\" books.

Most annoying is the tiny water-reservoir, which is in the back and can only be accessed by pulling the 16 lb machine out to the front of the counter to fill it up. The machines switches are not labeled, which can make for confusing/dangerous situations like turning on the steam while you are trying to brew your shot. Also anybody who doesn't use this machine on a daily basis won't be able to figure it out.

We keep our expresso cups on top so that they warm up, or we warm them with some hot water just like fine restaurants do.

It's lyrics are haunting and the music is addictive. The sound is like no other in country music today and it will stop a person in their tracks the first time they hear it. I think Mrs. O'Neal is going to be a big hit on the country scene because she brings something new to country, which is hard to do these days. Her sound is enough in itself but with her ability to create her OWN music, she is here for good. In my opinion, there really is only one more song on this CD that will crack the top ten and it is the title song, \\"Shiver\\". The song with Mark Wills will make a run but I don't think it will make it. I enjoy all of the songs on the CD but none of the others have the same \\"gotcha\\" attribute as \\"Arizona\\".

If you're wanting something to stimulate your mind and emotion, this album is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but this doesn't do it for me...","review":"I purchased this CD as a gift for a friend and, long story short, I ended up with a second copy. Knowing it would be a waste of time to try to return it, I popped it open, slid it into the CD player and immediately went to track 2, \\"There is no Arizona\\", a really well done bluesy country song.Problem, for me anyway, is that this is the only song that comes even close to my taste in country music. The rest of the CD sounds like tunes that singers with better taste (or with handlers with better taste) passed on when listening to demos.I can only hope that the CD grows on me with repeated listenings or it will just join of pile of CDs that I should have waited for more singles to be released before I purchased them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I would just like to say that all of you people who gave this a high rating obviously are not country music fans. I do agree that \\"There Is No Arizona\\" is an appealing song, that is the reason I bought this album in the first place, but the rest of it is,well, rediculous. If she was going to make music she should go into a genre that suits her more, pop! She has a wonderful voice but clearly no taste. This is yet another embarassment to country music. Ive listened to this album once and I'll garuntee it will never be in my cd player again. Anyone who is thinking of buying this album, im warning you it SUCKS!

Fabulous voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiver one more schlok pop let down","review":"Jamie O'Neal can sing, true enough, but her material is just more of the same forgetable country-pop, and weak country-pop at that. The only song worth a second listen is \\"There is No Arizona\\". And maybe \\"She Hasn't Heard it Yet\\". The rest is a sad commentary on the state of country music today. Pick a path, Jamie, be brave! If the marginally talented Faith Hill can be a pop queen, then darn-it, so can you! Just don't use country music to get there - that's just slimey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sending A 'Shiver' Down the Spine","review":"Storming on to the scene with a voice that is Sara Evans by way of Martina McBride, O'Neal has an arsenal that most would kill for. Not only does she have vocal range to spare, she happens to be quite the substantial songwriter. For proof, go straight to 'There Is No Arizona', a stark, metaphorical tale of a lover who has ditched his loved one but good. With its blues-hued backdrop, it's like nothing else spinning on the radio right now and provides a welcome respite from the pop-taking-over-country of Faith Hill and Shania Twain. The goods don't stop there, especially the ballads--'Where We Belong' is a classic waiting to happen in the vein of Evans'equally classic 'No Place That Far', and 'She Hasn't Heard It Yet' and 'I'm Still Waiting' further back the notion that O'Neal is not merely a cog in the Nashville machine, but an original voice that actually deserves to be heard beyond the confines of country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every track is terrific. I highly recommend this one.","review":"I bought this based on hearing \\"There is no Arizona\\" and the reviews on Amazon. The 5-star reviews were absolutely dead-on. Great vocals, great songs sung with feeling. The last rave I made was for Shelby Lynne's \\"I am Shelby Lynne\\" CD. This one is very different in style, being country not bluesy, but as good in quality as that one.

See them live if you ever get the chance. Thomas Hughes' dancing while playing is infectious. The Hobson brothers are so low key but incredibly talented.Did I Tell You is a wonderful opening song.Brown Boxes (with its frequently reviewed kazoo riff) is probably my favorote song (although Sears took a liking to Oh Mandy and had it in one of their commericals for a while... if you ever get a chance to watch the video, it's very fun).This band has all the right music sensibilities.I look forward to their next disc and US Tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like","review":"just saw them open for the arctic monkeys at the henry fonda in hollywood lasst night and although the mics were skrewed up and i couldnt tell what they were saying half the time i still knew i wanted the album. i just got it and i love it. its different from other stuff out now and who doesn't love a bunch of guys who will no only play the kazoo in concert, but will also give them out for free after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely cracking. Give it a listen!","review":"Spinto are the sort of band that should be huge in Indie circles. Having seen them live, I can confirm there are about ten of them, and they fill the record in the same way they fill the stage. The music is short, sharp, bouncy and catchy. The highlights are Oh Mandy, with it's infectious toe-tapping chorus, Direct to Helmet, which builds into probably the most radio-friendly track on the album, and Mountains - shortest and sharpest of all - which for about two minutes rattles its way around a unique chorus melody and some super lyrics.Spinto sound like no one in the charts, and although they may sound a bit like lots of people from the past, there are enough unique things about this album to make it not sound a lot like anyone.I really like Spinto Band, can you tell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"krups duothek review","review":"I have had to return the product.

This was the perfect idea instead of have two separate coffee makers sitting on my counter. I liked the design, as it was not bulky. The coffee stayed hot in the insulated pots. It made great coffee. The only major problem was the the water leaked out from the top water reservoir, where the water drained into the pots. It had a selection between the on/off switches for making four cups or less. The switch could not be turn off. The left side is the side that this feature operated on, had the most water leaking out. There was probably about a half of cup of water each morning on my counter. The coffee maker cost too much money to have this problem. I returned the coffee pot within three days of making coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"lukewarm coffee","review":"I wish I had read the review of the duothek before I purchased it.

My husband wanted the dual caraffe that it touts. However, our previous coffeemaker had a timer and a one minute \\"sneak a cup\\" feature. I believe this machine is slower than what we had prior. I also have a problem with the temperature of the coffee. To boast that you blend a better cup of coffee doesn't matter if I end up putting my cup of cold coffee in the microwave to heat it up! I'm very dissatisfied with this machine. I expected more from KRUPS and can't believe the price. It is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and appearance for Krups DuoThek","review":"We ordered this product but when we opened it at Christmas, it was in very poor condition. Covered with white powdery substance that was like a greasy coating. Nothing cleaned it completely. It's as though the unit was subjected to high heat along the way and the plastic wrap stuck to the unit. It was unsanitary in appearance. The construction quality was sub par, not up to the price of the unit. We returned it (By the way, Amazon made us pay the return shipping costs!) We are continuing to look for an alternative elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced/Inferior","review":"This product is certainly not worth the money I paid for it.

For this price, it should have all of this but the worst of it is it does not keep the coffee warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk :-(","review":"We purchased this thinking it would be a great coffee maker and it is junk. The hoppers that hold the coffee don't pivot out from the maker they sit on top of the carafes. When you are making your coffee in the morning you have the two carafes, two hoppers, two bags of coffee and the grinder out at the same time. When the coffee is brewed you remove the carafe and hopper together and try to pour a cup of coffee holding the dripping hopper in one hand over the cup and pour out of the carafe at the same time. The hoppers don't have a drip stop feature. The carafes are open and have separate lids. I've had inexpensive makers that had drip stop, integral carafe lid and pivoting hoppers. I have not had the cold coffee problems other report.

Unforturnately the coffee when freshly brewed is not hot but a little past warm. I do not believe that the carafes, double walled with a vaccuum, work that well either in keeping the tepid coffee tepid. As far as the warmers go they do not keep the coffee warm like my old unit does. Possibly the double walled carafes are impacting the way these keep the coffee warm.

I saw it years ago with my children and they loved it so this Christmas I bought it for my daughter and we watched it again and were happy once more.It is the story of a town that doesn't allow noise of anykind to the point of extremes, like making your boots quiet. Then into town comes a woman that was expelled many years ago because she sang and that was noise. All the people in the old days were sent to a town far away for making noise, but she comes back because she promised a man that she would bring a gift to his grand daughter. This causes a uproar in the town and things get interesting. You find out in the end why the king made a silent law. All works out and every one is happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will find a place in your heart!","review":"I'd never heard of it, never seen it and happened upon it from simple curiousity.

Something truly different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic of discovery","review":"The girl Aurora has difficulty maintaining the perfect silence the authorities have imposed on the kingdom - she's not really rebellious, but she has a talent for not quite fitting in, and she's definitely the curious type. So when she meets a mysterious gypsy woman (Patti Lupone, a perfect cast) and discovers the magical beauty of music it's no wonder that she gets into major conflict with the establishment.This is an adventure movie of the finest sort without needing flashy effects a la Golden Compass, it is a beautifully acted and designed movie with enchanting characters that warms the heart, yet keeps you glued to your seat. Highest recommendation - absolutely unbelievable that this gem was never issued on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but I don't get the praise","review":"I had heard so many good things about this band that I bought two of their albums (this one and \\"Mandylion\\"). Well, the accolades given to this band are unjustified.Anneke's voice is WAY over the top. One reviewer stated that \\"she sounds like she's singing showtunes,\\" and that's an accurate assessment. Her vibrato is exaggerated, although she does have a unique style that works with some of the tracks.But there's no variation is song-tempo, which ultimately makes for a dull listen. If you're partial towards hard rock/metal with a female vocalist, you can do better than this (i.e., Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Evanescence...Amy Lee's vocals are unmatched, I'm sorry).Either this album blows you away or it doesn't, and I belong with the latter category."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe a little more variation...","review":"I have mixed feelings about The Gathering. I don't like Anneke's vocals that much because of the way she wails, but it's not that big of a deal. Their music gets a bit repetitive at times, and there's nothing about this album that can keep my attention for the entirety of it. The title track is excellent, and there are a few more that really stand out, but there are also those that aren't so good. I won't adorn this piece with praise and glory, but I do recommend checking it out. If you're one who likes vocals that dominate the music, then you'll love it. I will say that Anneke sings in a very down-to-earth and appropriate manner, but seems to push it sometimes. The music is very atmospheric; not necessarily gloomy (although it is in some places) but very sensual. It just can't hold my attention very long. But it may for others, so don't shy away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gathering","review":"My Husband love's gothic bands and he introduced me to bands like Lacuna Coil,Theater of Tragedy,ect. One day he played The Gathering for me. And I noticed that the lead singer sounds like the lead singer of HEART. So I came on to this web-site looking for more cds by The Gathering and realized that the lead singer of The Gathering has the same name as the singer from Heart. I freaked out. I'm so happy that Anne Wilson has turned goth I grew up listening to her wonderful voice. I've always been a huge fan of HEART now I'm a huge fan of The Gathering. If Anyone want's to hear Annes early stuff get Little Queen or Hearts greatest hits. Anne sings along with her sister nancy who plays lead guitar. Way to go Anne!!I love you.

Michael Moriarity is her nerd husband. Nick Nolte is a war vet who makes the mistake of not kicking these two losers to the gutter.The best parts of the movie are when Moriarity is tortured---really! One of his torturers is an actor who was a regular on the tv sitcom RHODA, so there's nothing cynical about that. And nerd Moriarity not only definately gets what he deserves, for messing with heroin smuggling, he has an unintentionally funny look on his face when he is tortured.Spoiler alert: junkie Weld and her nerd husband don't get killed, though if you watch this annoying movie you might wish they had been shot by Charles Bronson in some other movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, terrible movie","review":"I had recently read Robert Stone's book \\"Dog Soldiers\\" and thought it was very good. I had heard that this movie was a forgotten minor classic and since I like both the book and Nick Nolte, I thought, \\"How bad can it be.\\" Well, I hated it! Key events from the book were cast in a different light that completely changed the whole point of the story. The acting was for the most part weak, though Nick Nolte did wring as much as he possible could from the script. Michael Moriarty's character was weakly portrayed, and, again, in the book he is a much weaker and less sympathetic person, though his character is much more fleshed out. All the strengths of the book (strong characterization, flashes of humour among other things) are missing. Skip this and read the book instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"On my list of the ten worst films of all time","review":"The first mistake the filmmakers made was changing the title of this film from Robert Stone's great novel \\"Dog Soldiers\\" to \\"Who'll Stop the Rain.\\" A wimpy title attemping, and ultimately failing, at cashing in at the box office with a CCR tune, and not a particularly good one at that. Their second mistake was casting the lead with the most dull and unconvincing actor in Hollywood: Nick Nolte. Uninspired direction from Karel Reisz (who?) only adds to the insult. In the hands of a Scorsese or a Kubrick this could have been a great film. Alas, its a muddle and doesn't even get much air time on late-night TV.

We sautee veggies and meats on the grill top, then add them to the small dishes with cheese and cooked potatoes and broil them under the coils(untraditional, but delicious).The grill top is removeable, which makes it easy pop off and get into the sink, however I've noticed that some food stains the surface, and it can take a bit of scrubbing to remove.The only real negative so far is the heating dial. You alter the heat of the coils by turning a dial, but it is impossible to tell by looking if the dial is set to low, medium or high. The only real way to know is by how loudly your food is sizzling. This one area truly needs to be redesigned.Overall, it's a fine machine which will allow you to enjoy many warm, creative and delicious moments with friends and family.

When I first heard their single \\"Flavor of the Weak\\", I absolutely loved it, although it kinda reminded me of other bands (like Newfound Glory and Blink-182). But when I listened to the CD, it had a sound completely its own. It has a full, mature sound to it, and can range from serious and edgy to fun and cheerful to slow and sweet. One thing that surprised me about the album is the lack of swearing. Although is has a warning on it, only 3 songs contain any \\"explicit lyrics\\".

The entire CD screams impact. By far, the highlights include \\"Blue Day\\", \\"Hi-Fi Killer\\", \\"I'm A Fool\\" and of course the hit first single \\"Flavor of the Weak\\". However, if you're sick of the excessive over-playing of this single on the radio, its best to hear what other brilliance this band has to offer. You'll be glad you did.The entire CD rocks. Plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"If you are into modern rock bands then you definitely want this cd.

What I really learn from this book is how to draw some UML diagrams.I think this book assumes that you have minimal or no object oriented analysis, design, and programming.

Programmers often understand basic concepts of how to design objects and what attributes they should have; few are good at taking complex models that involve state transformations (not just talking FSMs) and coming out with a solid design. Now that the middle tier is taking over, people need to realize that the concepts of data integrity, transactional integrity, even simple transformational integrity are part of the requirements of a good object oriented design.

There's a danger in pushing these things too far and winding up with melodrama. Cook walks short of maximum tension but he uses setting and the observer's laconic self-derision to good effect. The book, for all that is is about a \\"u-boat\\" in space has some very memorable visual passages and could be a great movie if who ever owns the option would get off their keister and make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Garrett PI series #2","review":"I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories.

The lo-fi production does no harm to the music whatsoever. Everything is still amazingly put together, the primitive sound of black metal is still present throughout, the vocals are some of the best, the atmosphere is incredibly riveting, and there's not one throw-away song on the album.

Definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent album destroyed by poor sound","review":"The other reviewers have not sufficiently emphasized just how bad this album sounds! It is easily the tinniest, most sub-bootleg recording I've ever heard! It sounds like it's being blasted at full volume out of Walkman headphone speakers. Which is a shame, as the music itself is fairly well-structured black metal, with solid riffs and dynamics that work to the advantage of the songs rather than just to the need of the musicians to appear technically adept. It's just too bad that the minuses of the awful sound override the pluses of the music, and thus will confine this disc to the back of my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ulver's worst album.","review":"Century Media gave a s**tload of money for the recording of NATTENS MADRIGAL - in plain english, THE MADRIGAL OF THE NIGHT.

The rollicking \\"Nice girls do it!\\" approach is right out of Erica Jong's \\"Fear of Flying\\" from 30 years ago, but absent the brilliant cultural insights.

It would've seemed a lot more realistic set in a mediocre college than Yale for crying out loud!Overall, I don't recommend this book.

She never hooks up except once (in the first chapter, and they don't go very far by college standards, as she's a prude) and never really does anything. Also the climax happens entirely off-screen. She meets this guy riding a bus, has dinner with him, then the book is over and there's an epilogue where she says, Oh by the way, I fell in love. Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candace Bushnell she ain't","review":"I admit it--I love Sex and the City. And I bought Chloe Does Yale because I thought it might give me a little of the same guilty pleasure. Instead, I got a boring, half-baked ripoff. The thing about this book is that it feel so LAZY/ She didn't even try to write a plot...this could all be packed into a half hour sitcom with commercial breaks. And Chloe Carrington, the narrator, is so pathetic. She's not a strong character like Carrie.When Chloe gets a secret admirer on email, it's obvious who it is! And then Krinsky doesn't even take that plot anywhere...it's just such bad writing, and I felt really cheated by the book. The ending was nothing--the novel just stops suddenly. I should have stopped way before I got there. I'm sorry I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"It is hard for me to imagine who would like this book--apart maybe from the author's friends. It is a blatant ripoff of Sex and the City--except there is no sex. That's right--a book whose titles references an infamous porn film, promising at least some cheap entertainment--has no sex at all. \\"Chloe\\" never sleeps with anyone at all. So forget about titillation, if that's what you were looking for. Let's just get that out of the way now.As for literary quality...please. Natalie Krinsky doesn't know how to write. Not even a good sentence. And she went to Yale! Save your money and send your kids to a state school, if this book is any indication of the level of education in the Ivy Leagues. Krinsky writes about students \\"shakin' what their mama gave 'em\\" and uses bizarre, metaphors and similes like \\"He clams up like Snuggles in a brothel.\\" What? Her efforts to write are so strained at times I was afraid she'd get a hernia. Don't waste your money on this junk. Support good writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total lack of talent","review":"I wonder whether this novel's editor deserves contempt (for leaving so many errors, inaccuracies, and lazy passages in the book) or pity (for having to slog through so much junk that he/she couldn't possibly fix it all).Chloe Does Yale is terrible. Boring, unconvincing, and most of all bratty. As a college student myself, I wasn't moved or convinced by anything at all in this book. Natalie Krinsky just took a bunch of columns that she already wrote and slapped them together into a book. The worst part of it was when she has minor characters tell the main character (who's a blatant stand-in for Krinsky herself) what a wonderful writer she is. Actually, she isn't. This book is an insult to anyone who pays good money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello boring!","review":"Jeez, how hard can it be to make a book about sex entertaining? Especially when it's in the ivy league? Or maybe Ivy sex is actually just boring, I dunno. This book makes it seem like that. The first couple pages were kind of entertaining--the whole first chapter was decent I guess--but then it got so, so dull! Chloe is a dumb character, and she doesn't do anything interesting.Definitely not as good as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot mess","review":"this is the most horriblest album i've ever heard.i will not recommend this album to anyone. the song called \\"crave\\" is just that. i was craving the stop button. the music was trashy and the vocals were just ashyyyyyyy. do not quit your day job ms. jones. i mean just that, DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB. singing is not for you. so remember DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Beauty Made Easy and Fun!","review":"This is an amazing collection of natural beauty recipes -- I am having fun saving money and feeling super -- Making my own natural beauty products and treatments is super simple and the recipes are all easy to follow -- All my friends want be to make things for them!

Enjoy !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes not great","review":"I love the idea of this book however the recipes just aren't what I hoped they would be.They are not nice to use at all. Some of them it would be prefferable just to put oil on your skin and not waste all your time making something that feels like you're just putting oil on your skin. Home-made beauty products don't have to be like this, I've done a course on it since and the recipes we've been given definitley aren't like this.I think there are probably better books out there that use better ingredients (if you're going to use mineral oil you might as well just buy the mass produced crap)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand fun for adventurous souls!","review":"I bought this book when it first came out and have thoroughly enjoyed making many of the \\"recipes\\" in the book.Another reviewer noted that the author sometimes recommends petro-chemical based ingredients.The beauty of any homemade potion is that YOU, the manufacturere and end-user are in complete control of what goes into the products you make.Take the time to learn about the characteristics of the basic ingredients and you'll be custom-mixing exactly what you want in no time at all.Have fun creating something special for yourself, your family and your friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your homework first...","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this book for several reasons:1). The author mentions the use of mineral oil and petrolatum as a moisturizer (for those of you that don't know these are byproducts of gasoline and are AWFUL for your skin, the cosmetic/beauty industry only use it because it is dirt cheap and never goes bad).2). It is not practical to put your time and effort into making something for one application (will we really see results after just one use?). I suppose you can multiply the recipes but most of the recipes need to be used ASAP or they spoil. Needless to say I have not found a happy medium!3). I have coarse curly hair- I tried one of the \\"hair packs\\" and needless to say it was a MESS! It took several shampoos to get all of the stuff out of my hair.In conclusion, I would reccommend you research what products are actually good for you and not just convienient for the makers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super, easy recipes","review":"This book is great for a beginner like me. The ingredients that are required are either already in the home or easy to find. It asks for things like olive oil, baking soda, liquid soap, rose water, glycerine, pine needles, lavendar flowers, etc. The recipes for beauty treatments are usually small in quantity. You can learn to make cold creams, night creams, facial masks, bath salts, lip balms, massage oils, plus other things. You can add essential oils or fragrances or make frangrance-free potions for sensitive skins. Some of the recipes are said to be very old. Lye soap recipes are included, if you want to go that route. I am anxious to make gift baskets of personalized beauty and bath potions for my friends and family. It is so simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety for everyone, simple to the complex.","review":"Inspiration for anyone who is trying to remove harmful chemicals their skin and hair.The Book is beautifully laid out and easy to use.

The recipes are clear, and given the ingredients and Janice Cox's research should work as described. Certainly have for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy-to-make recipes!","review":"The recipes in this book don't require that you purchase expensive, hard-to-find ingredients. I bought this book because I have never made my own skin/hair care or bath and body products, so I wanted to start with recipes that a novice could make successfully. I was not disappointed! The first recipe I tried, grape seed lotion, turned out great! I will be making many more body care products using the recipes in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about trying to make their own beauty products at home but doesn't know where to start. The author provides a description of the ingredients and equipment she uses which I found very useful. I was able to find the ingredients I needed at my local co-op, but any health food store should stock them or you can find them online. You should be able to buy beeswax from your local beekeeper. I now feel confident that I can make my own products at home, thanks to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and fun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Initially, i borrowed this book from the library, but there was so much information, I had to buy my own copy. If you like to make your own beauty products and such, you'd probably enjoy it. There were several recipes that I had to tweak to make just right, but seeing as how everyone is different, that was to be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"I am truly enjoying this book! There are recipes for everything from facial cleansers and astringents to deodorants, dry shampoos and full body masks.

Cleopatra's Milk Bath smelled TERRIBLE; the clove mouth wash anesthesized my mouth for about five minutes so that I couldn't even talk; the cold-process soap recipes were so lye heavy that I actually received chemical burns when I grated the soap and tried to turn it into liquid soap; the almond oil shaving cream turns into a runny white liquid that won't even stay on your skin long enough to run the razor through it.

He advised me to order an external floppy drive recommeding one from iomega. Following his advice, I ordered the iomega 32663 USB floppy drive. Once received, out of the box, plugged it into the USB port and was done within 3 minutes. I've been happily transferring and storing data ever since. This product is sleek/compact looking and sits right on top of my desk.

The Potty Monkey really helped with this. We set up his toilet next to hers and he would encourage her to sit for long periods of time. We left him in the bathroom and when his alarm went of asking to go to the potty we would go into the bathroom. It was helpful and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety issue for my boys","review":"The monkey is an amazing concept and I love how it said it needed to go potty on a timer. I wanted to like this product and hope it would help me with potty training my just turned 3 year old twins boys. The back of the monkey is poorly constructed to here it is simply lightweight velcro and my boys ripped that open and ripped out the batteries and wires along with it. They did this the first day. I am surprised that this isn't constructed to keep the toddlers away from the wires and batteries. I am sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible - timer does not work","review":"The monkey did not work for us. The timer does not work.

But who in the world designed this monkey WITH A TAIL?!? It's nearly impossible to get either the diaper or underpants on or off, even for me, since you have to work the long tail through an extra tiny hole. The tail also gets in the way so the monkey can't balance on the toilet very well--he usually falls off. So instead, we use some of his other toys on the toilet instead. The adult's book that came with the set is very useful, the children's book so-so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for kids and parents needing help","review":"Got mine a gift. It's a cute setup of monkey toys and books. It has a lot of helpful advice and tools for helping with kid's bowel and bladder habits including toilet training (sometimes hard to do!) Overall, would recommend to parents with young kids or as a gift to expecting parents. Only drawback I could see: takes a little practice with some kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy but Effective","review":"I was searching for a potty timer, and after reading reviews for Potty Monkey, decided to give it a try. My nearly 3 year old son loves monkeys. I love the concept and frankly, it is effective in teaching the basics. My son wasn't quite ready to train when I first used it, but I'll be using the monkey again in a couple of months once he has turned three. The voice on it and the laugh are both a little creepy. And yes, after a while of it whining at you about needing to go potty, it does get annoying. But, my son took the monkey to the potty nearly every time it prompted him to, which made it helpful for getting my son to the potty too. I'll update my posting once we use it again. This time the Potty Monkey and my son will run around without underwear - it's such a pain to get the potty monkey underwear off in time, and pretty much the same for my son! BTW - the tail does get in the way, but we just push it up along his back so that his bum can make contact with the potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains some of JP's best songs","review":"I would not choose this album as JP's best album, that goes to Thane To The Throne, but it has some absolute gems. The album starts off with gem number one, the wicked BLACK. After some eerie violins and vocals a bitchin riff kicks in and the band starts rolling. The next gem is FUTURE SHOCK. I absolutely love the bridge and the guitar solo is great. SHADOW THIEF is a decent rock song, at least worthy enough to be on my i-pod. The next gem is SONNET OF SORROW, a short somber ballad featuring only vocals, guitar, and violin. The album closes with the last gem, the epic JUDGEMENT DAY. Great vocals, great chorus, great riffs, and awesome guitar solo! Joey Tafolla's lead playing is very melodic and extremely fluid. After the disappointing Dissident Alliance album it was great to have Joey and The Tyrant back in the band. I think most of JP's album have some great songs but this album has some of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Now the CIA Knows I Buy Books about Amanita Muscaria","review":"Notice I didn't say \\"Read Books\\".

In my association with Maasai people since 1985 I have never known, seen or been informed of such mystical objects. The accounts of the Maasai since Hinde, Hollis, Merker through to Klump and onwards have never alluded to the existence of such items. In talking to friends in the Loita Hills early in 2001 the items were dismissed as Kamba carvings. Turle provides no provenance for these objects and does not ever appear to have collected the items personally from the Maasai - which would heve been so easy to do - always by way of an intermediary, who obviously hot-footed it to the Kamba carvers south east of Nairobi to fulfil the next order. Turle and Beard should know better given the long association with Kenya.

I've never heard of Jessica Andrews before until I heard her song, \\"Who I Am\\", which is OK, but she's not as good or talented as LeAnn Rimes! And I heard the rest of this album, too. Most of the songs were pretty crappy, lame, and cheesy. If you're looking for good Country music, well you sure haven't found it here!

I was disappointed with this CD and found the music sounding senthesised and spacy. The drums sounded like a drum machine. Also, her vocals were unemotional and boring. In a number of instances instead of going for the higher range, she wimped out and sang the lower note. I don't think she used more than one octave on anything but Who I Am. Although I enjoy Jessica Andrew's voice, I found she went plastic and safe with no maturing from the first album. In all, totally a waste of money.

But like so many with the same starting-point he fails to show what he means by both the biological restraint and the moral freedom. His examples of instinct in people designed to prove our biological background are nothing but silly. A man responding to insult is one example. But everybody knows that there are many different ways of reacting to insults, from turning the other cheek to killing. So where is the instinct?

I, too bought this CD thinking I was getting the full length versions of these songs. The single edits have been used to death, making the unedited versions a rarity.How many Diana Ross compilations will Motown force us to buy? The Ultimate Collection had the single edits of Ain't No Mountain High Enough and Love Hangover but was marred by horrible sound quality. The Hitsville boxed sets had superior sound but again the single edits. The Millenium Collection of Diana Ross had...the single edits, and now this!The songs should be replaced and a new catalog number issued so music buyers will know the difference. Ones that were ripped off, should be able to return the discs for a replacement.A rip off of the first order!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diva's Best","review":"Miss Ross is a Diva of number one class, and the music on this cd, shares her fun times and also her touching moments, wonderful to listen to with guests over"},{"rating":"2","title":"These ARE Great Hits!","review":"Wow! What a collection. It opens up with ENDLESS LOVE and only gets better. From R&B to Disco to Motown. This album is truly well-rounded and a must-have for everyone!You can hear her vulnerability in songs like \\"It's My Turn,\\" \\"Theme From Mahogany (Do You know Where You're Going To)\\" and \\"Touch Me In the Morning.\\"She'll get you boogie-in' with \\"Upside Down,\\" \\"I'm Coming Out,\\" \\"The Boss\\" and \\"Love Hangover.\\"We even get treated with her old Supremes stuff. A medley of it! All in one! You must buy this CD! It's one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single with just two album tracks","review":"This is actually NOT the album (even Amazon says \\"rate this album\\") it's just the single that has the same title as the album.It contains the song \\"Scare Yourself\\" and \\"Last Chance To Change\\"; both available on the album.I have heard better D:A:D songs though. And a single with only two songs not having a non-album-track is not worth buying. So it only gets one star. Keep your hands off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for musiclovers","review":"This cd is full off great heavy rock-songs with melody, feeling, great lyrics and passion. One of the best from a great band with an even greater singer. In a world with Green Day and Foo Fighters it's a shame D-A-D isn't bigger because they are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"I ordered this album expecting the a CD with 11 tracks.Unfortunately when the CD arrived it was only a 2 track sample of the full album. The CD was labeled with the same name as the full CD. I checked this website and didn't see anything that would make me think the CD was only a sample.I notified Amazon returns and had a prompt apology and the promise of a new CD sent out.When the 2nd CD arrived it was the same 2 track CD!When I came back to Amazon and checked the CD listing again I saw someone else left a similiar review - they expected the full CD but only got the 2 track sample.It doesn't look like Amazon is able to get the full CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Miles with John","review":"This is a great album for those who remember this artist. From his early start including the stellar performance in Music, to his later work (during the time he was with the Alan Parsons Project) John Miles made great music. Lots of good arrangements, great guitar work and a truly awesome voice. If you used to have his stuff, this is a good reminder of how good music was from that time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Story?","review":"I can say with confidence that this book is the worst wrestling book written to date(including Chyna's). Austin has no story whatsoever and the stories he does have, have been told on numerous occasions through wwe publications, dvds, tv, etc. The average chapter is four pages long and half of that is Jim Ross saying the exact same thing that Austin just said. The only thing we do learn here is that Austin loves Vince McMahon and shocker! this just happens to be a WWE book. This book honestly falls into the negative star category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Cold Waste Of Time","review":"Let me first say that I'm a big wrestling fan, and that I think Steve Austin is one of the best things to happen to wrestling in a long time.Having said that - DON'T read this book. Of all the wrestling books I've read, this was by far the worst. If you've spent even a little time on the internet or read articles in the WWE magazines, then you already know everything covered in this book.I understand that alot of wrestling books are ghosted, but this was the worst case. Seriously I'm not going into alot of detail - don't pick this book up.And that's the bottom line..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Ross ruins this book","review":"I was under the impression this was supposed to be Steve Austin's autobiography, but I was wrong. What it turns out to be be is part Austin's book and part some fat man with one eye crying about people he doesn't like. Ross makes many tasteless comments that should not have been printed. Most have nothing to do with Austin or his career. It just has to do with many personal vendettas of this mutant. This was unnecessary and Ross should have just wrote the preface like normal people do. He totally butchered and destroyed the book and this will turn off the reader. Its a shame because Austin was very honest bu ti ti is overshadowed by Ross's crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Steve Austin has to be the most selfish, cold hearted, disrespectful, hypocritical, arrogant egomaniac since Hulk Hogan and/or Vince Mcmahon. Austin expresses no remorse over Owen Hart's death whatsoever, whines about what happened at Summerslam 97, sucks up to Vince Mcmahon. You know I understand that when your with the W.W.E your book can very easily be promoted, but where is the logic in promoting a book based upon a company that is responsible for the publication of the novel, how honost can this story really be. Plus its Steve Austin, he is not exactly the sharpest tool in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait!!!","review":"I, too, read the book in an afternoon - I couldn't put it down! Being a long-time Steve Austin fan, it was wonderful to get those stories from his beginnings to the present.I truly enjoyed the book from cover to cover, the many pictures, the family insights and tales, J.R.'s outlook, even the medical info was interesting (I'm a nurse ;))!You have to admire a man, who seems so private, to just put it out there like this. Although he has repeatedly stated that he doesn't want people to feel sorry for him, you can't help empathizing with him on the health and personal levels. This book shows that although he is adored by millions, he's also a man trying to live a life just like the rest of us - only the whole world is watching him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in Stone Cold's book mainly because after reading both of Mick Foley's books you really appreciate him writing it in his own language and style. You can totally tell a \\"ghost-writer\\" did Steve Austin's book and so the actual story doesnt feel like its coming straight form the hip...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable for the most part","review":"What a great read. This book was very interesting, altough some parts were a liitle too brief there is certainly more than enough information on the life of on of the greatest Wrestling stars and maybe even the best superstar in the wrestling bussiness. Peronally, I really enjoyed reading the whole story invoving Owen Hart. The whole story of him breifly leaving the company was also ver interesting. Overall, thereis plenty of information for any fan to enjoy this autobiography of Stone Cold Steve Austin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let The Truth Be Known","review":"Steve Austin's bio is an intriguing tale of how Steve Williams emerged as a wrestling icon. Some good information is provided about Steve's growing up in a fair but firm family environment. Steve's pre WWE days are discussed with some detail specifically is relationship with Brian Pillman. Steve certainly learned how to cut a promo from his former tag team partner.Of course the information on Steve's WWE escapades are extremely interesting. Steve does show how is in ring persona is an extension of his personality but not the true man inside. He discusses his relationship with Vince McMahon, Kevin Nash, Owen Hart, and others in a fair way. Steve is also fair in discussing his personal life and his failed marriages. He understands his shortcommings and that is the sign of a true man.The overall impression is that the reader gets a true inside story of Steve Austin, WWE icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENTERTAINING","review":"STONE COLD DOES A NICE JOB DESCRIBING HIS LIFE AND EXPERIENCES IN PRO WRESTLING. I ENJOYED THE EARLY PARTS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND FOOTBALL, BUT THE MEAT OF THIS BOOK IS HIS CAREER. STONE COLD WAS QUITE A CHARACTER AND MADE ME LAUGH MANY TIMES. I BELIEVE HE WAS ONE OF MOST POPULAR AND ENTERTAINING WRESTLERS OF HIS TIME. INJURIES, BURNOUT AND DIVORCE DID HIM IN. HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A BAD GUY, HOPEFULLY HE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIS DRINKING.

All kids would love this book and all in the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A turning point in Pentecotal theology","review":"William and Robert Menizes have turned a significant corner for Pentecostal theology with this book. Pentecostal theology is defined very clearly as centering on the charismatic nature of the gift of the Spirit as Luke understood it, and the reception of the gift subsequent to conversion. Perhaps the most significant contribution is articulating the rationale for Pentecostal theology as being the foundation for a universal expectation of empowered witness.The major streams of current scholarship, both Pentecostal and Evangelical, on Pentecostal issues is woven together in this book, presenting pastors and Bible students with the most current examination of Pentecostal issues to date.An outstanding read."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% perfect.","review":"Both disc were delivered in good time and perfect condition, just what I was asking for.

But, Merv Griffin's IT'S LIKE A DREAM cd is the real deal. Unlike these modern day singers who have no idea what the material is, you can tell Merv Griffin knows the songs and sings them perfectly. It's almost like an authentic 40's album, being released today. Some great songs on it are, THE MORE I SEE YOU, SONG FOR YOU, and especially, A NIGHTINGALE SANG IN BERKELEY SQUARE. So forget the new \\"SONGBOOK\\" cd's and get yourself the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never recieved the item.

Worth every penny and time in watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's Good Ones!","review":"I'm a King fan, but I can admit that the film adaptations of some of his books are real stinkers. Some just flat out suck. This film, on the other hand, is really good. It's not your typical horror, which I can appreciate, and it's definitely engaging. The actors did a great job; who doesn't love Kathy Bates? Also, they nailed the New England accent, which I also appreciate very much. Nothing does a film an injustice like a bad accent. Very good film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping!!

It does no justice to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolores Claiborne","review":"Taylor Hackford is not a great director, but Dolores Claiborne is a great film. Kathy Bates, in her best role, stars as the witty, sarcastic, and tough as nails Dolores, who makes the ultimate sacrifices for the people she loves. Most Stephen King stories take place in Maine, but this one has a real feel of authenticity. \\"Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Bates Kicks it in this Movie","review":"The story was perfect for Kathy Bates. I watch this movie and share it with everyone. Ms. Bates is an amazing actress, and the story builds throughout, leaving no stone unturned. Having been written by Steven King doesn't surprise me. One of Kathy Bates best pictures...among many! Gotta buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a storyline you won't soon forget","review":"Oh my goodness- THIS is a classic movie. The acting is top notch, storytelling believable and incredibly interesting, and one of those movies you will come back years from now and watch again. I guarantee you will. There's honestly not a single dull moment for the entire two hours. In fact, I'd go so far as to say Dolores Claiborne takes the whole murder mystery plot to a whole new level of excitement. Too many twists and turns to pick a highlight, but the relationship between Dolores and her daughter will win you over in the end. You just want them to both work out their differences, but there's so many thrilling moments and new bits to the storytelling being added to your surprise, you're not sure HOW you want the mother and daughter to react to each other. What a film. I don't remember when the film came out in the mid 90's, but after watching it this afternoon, I won't forget it. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Dolores Claiborne is one of my favorite Stephen King novels, and the movie was just as wonderful. The story is interesting, and the creepy Maine skies in the background add to the dreary mood so well. Kathy Bates is wonderful, as is Leigh. I highly highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bates Pulls it Off","review":"What could have been an overly dramatic, soppy Hollywood movie fraught with politically correct cliches, was saved by Kathy Bates with her understated facial expressions and believable stoicism.

One of the best live albuns ever....WELL DONE, EXODUS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of history, photos, and information","review":"Great for beginners -- full coverage of history, background, definitions, costume information. Excellent for all belly dancers -- covers everything. Much better than many previous belly dance books of the past. This one is scholarly, fun and easy to read. Recommended if you're not a belly dancer -- if you're interested in the dance or are another genre of dancer, this is an excellent way to learn what belly dancing really is (dispels myths). This book is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Everyone","review":"The beauty of this book is how it brings together all the different ideas and thoughts surrounding this exquisite and controversial dance form. I personally love the validation of the art form and expression of spirit that surrounds it. There are so many different ideas/facts about how belly dance originated, but when you get right down to it it's all about the dance!! Good Job!! There is no reason why any one who dances should not own this book. I encourage my students to have their own copy and explore all the facets of the book and dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good resource book.","review":"The information in this book is great.

As a large size dancer it has been an invaluable resource on how to create the perfect costume for my shape.

But he's definitely proved me wrong...Taylor is that rare breed of drummers who can write and sing and front a band. Here, he's made a really lovely rock record with great harmonies transposed by complex rhythms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Missing.....","review":"To keep this short and simple, the reason this recording got 2 stars (and not 3 or even 4) is because taylor hawkins has a long long way to go in finding his voice (like his counterpart, Grohl, I'm sure he will over time). The whisper-y, monotoned, near emotionless singing really takes a toll on the listener. The music is above average although I waited the entire cd for the guitar and drums to break open (they never did). They say this is classic rock, but its not. Classic rock finds a way to let loose and really take ahold, something these musicians never do. It felt as if the music was restrained, even held back. Nothing new or exciting was ever brought to the fore front. Very timid throughout. A few touch ups and reworking of the songs, more freedom for the musicians, some excitement and feeling from hawkins, and a good guitar solo would have put this cd over the top. Its too bad. Hawkins' drumming (his obvious natural talent) is awesome though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another rock drummer with \\"Taylor\\" in his name presents a great solo effort.","review":"You can hear Taylor's influences dripping out of each song, more so than you can the Foo Fighters. It's a fun album. Easy to listen to with plenty of great hooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Detective Series - Scariest Mystery Yet!","review":"I read this book to my 3 sons, ages 13, 10, and 8. There were times they were all scared and times they didn't want me to stop reading to them because they had to know what happened next. What more could you ask for in a book? This mystery was dedicated to all people who fight terrorists, both big and small. It was written with 9/11 in mind, and, in my opinion, it is a tribute to all the heroes of 9/11. Sammy's inability to understand why any teenager would want to get mixed up in a gang offers the reader constant reminders on how bad gangs can be and how, once you're in, it's almost impossible to get out. In my opinion, this book should replace the novel called the Outsiders (about gang warfare written in the 60's) from middle school reading lists. It is a fresh, more modern view on the subject and better written). My boys and I have read every book in this series and can't wait until the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy Keyes book report","review":"I read Sammy Keyes and the Search for Snake Eyes. I thought this was a book with suspense because it was a mystery finding out who was Snake Eyes, who spray-painted the walls putting the blame on Sammy, how could they get the idea that they were stupid to spray paint their names so everybody could see that they spray-painted the walls. I think kids in 4th and 5th grade would like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cemetary is alive!!","review":"When Cemetary split in 1997, I thought I could never listen to that incredible moisture of heavy and gothic sounds so genuine... but after I listened to Sundown, I had to admit: it's like the great Cemetary is back again and it's improved musically. Even more gothic than ever and better vocals!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Data Analysis","review":"The book was sent to me in good condition - the condition it was described. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Family Guy episode ever produced!","review":"I read a few reviews on this and decided to download it and see if the film was really this bad before buying it. IT STINKS! If you hated Jedi, you will think it was a masterpiece when compared to this DVD. When the beginning stated that Seth had ran out of ideas and was force by FOX to do this film, I knew it would be bad. Now if you are desperate to buy this DVD to complete your collection, I would wait until it drops to $5.00 or less before buying it, because it is not worth the current price. Personally I will be selling my copies of the first two after seeing this garbage, because I do not want it stinking up anything else I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: has soul-sucking copy protection","review":"I haven't even watched it yet because I'm so annoyed with the copy protection on this DVD. You can't rip this DVD to watch it when and how you want. Also, at least on a Mac, if you simply want to watch it you'll have to give over your admin password. WTF is up with that? I have to give a MOVIE admin privileges just in order to watch it on my computer? Let me guess -- it will root my system so that I can't make a personal copy of this or any other movie ever again? No thanks!If you care about being able to watch your movies when and how you want, I suggest you avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"A basic cut parody, without humor, family guy episode.

The DVD itself wont run in the DVD player software on my laptop it only plays on my stand alone dvd player. I am saying this b/c it really is an inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as fun as the others","review":"I am reviewing this, like I did with Partial Terms of Endearment, from a free rental I received before street date through my employer. Perhaps the lone perk of working in a video store!'It's a Trap' opens with your typical Star Wars style scroll in which Seth admits that he really didn't want to do this one, but with the success of the previous two Fox had demanded it. He does ask for viewers to suspend their expectations and promises a better product on their next venture, however I think this is largely tongue-in-cheek because this one was every bit as enjoyable as Blue Harvest, and in my opinion better than Something, Something. A few gags do drag a bit too long, and seem like they are just filler, but the laughs more than make up for the lags.Return of the Jedi is arguably the easiest of the Star Wars films to pick apart, and they do a great job with it. I didn't feel that the material was tired. It actually had some great moments. True fans of the show will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond disappointing","review":"This is a bit hard to write because there are just no words to describe how pathetic and lazy this effort was. Jedi should have been awesome. I didn't think part two captured the hilarious charm of part one, but it was still OK. This should never have been made. The ball was dropped so many times it wasn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Maybe we could've enjoyed this, as we did the first two.But when the producer himself is telling you, beforehand and during the episode, not to bother, well it's hard to fall for the tyranny of low expectations. Stick with the first one. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort, a blemish on the first two family guy efforts","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY.Buy blue harvest and something something something darkside, these were two GREAT features. Honestly, this remake starts off with an apology about how bad it is. At first I thought this was a joke then quickly realized it wasn't. Family Guy writers and Seth McFarlane should be ashamed, what a waste and abuse of viewer trust. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Watch It Again","review":"Blue Harvest was good. SSDS was a disappointment. This one was equally if not more disappointing. Not funny. Lots of time dragged out to the max. Clearly the Family Guy brand is dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a year until Fox airs it, save your money","review":"The crawl at the beginning has MacFarlane explaining that he didn't care about this and he let the assistants write it. Then the characters joke about how bad it is during the film. I loved the first two, but I didn't laugh more than about 3 times during this thing. Family Guy is great because it combines intelligent and low brow humor, which was severely lacking in this installment. Besides, Fox just likes to sell this on DVD first so they can make some cash, so just wait until Dec. 2011 and watch it for free on TV. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE, AND BETTER","review":"The first two of the Family Guy Star Wars parodies were quite funny. This one is just a retread of the jokes already covered in the other two, plus even more uninspired jokes on top of these. the writers, et al, even state in the crawl at the beginning of the feature that they were out of ideas. They were right. a waste of time that could have been better used watching the mold grow on the coffee grounds in the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Movie!!","review":"What can I say, I got this DVD for a great used price and it plays like its new!

I recomend this to every Family Guy Fan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the hatin'?","review":"Its a good Family Guy movie..Chill..A little more profane than the others, and even they acknowledge that maybe the shine has gone from the parodies, but no matter who ultimately wrote it, its funny, corny and irreverant, or everything Family Guy should be and is.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Seth, Why?","review":"This was terrible. I struggled to find anything at all humorous with this latest edition, which is hard to admit considering how much I liked the previous two. The beginning intro was not lying at the terrible quality of this release. I thought it was a joke, but watching it clearly shows it was completely serious.We get, its crap, but by saying its crap, doesn't excuse it being crap. And the only thing that you should have added to this intro of scrolling text was, \\"If you bought this DVD, you got screwed...\\"Do NOT waste your money on this. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for it to get under $10","review":"This edition to the Star Wars parodies was a big let down. Seth even mentions in the opening that they basically ran out of ideas for this one and other things, after watching this its SO true. I will admit I did laugh at a few things but that doesn't say much. I recommend waiting for this one to get down to the $5 price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good, but save your money","review":"Any show that opens up with an apology for such a lame event is either truly apologetic, or a cynical move at nudge-nudge-wink-wink, let's just pretend we're apologizing. Either way, this had a potential for being hilarious: the other two shows were quite good, \\"Blue Harvest\\" especially. Not this one. The opening title sequence even tells us that \\"assistants\\" did all of the writing, and it shows. I could even tell when the writing staff just said, \\"Hey, let's do another one of those extra-long 'jokes' like we do in 'Family Guy', where it stops being funny after 45 or 50 seconds of doing the same thing.\\" I bought the trilogy, having seen the other two before by borrowing my friends' DVDs, so the purchase wasn't a total waste. Save your money, just borrow it from someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh - so-so","review":"Meh - so-so as far as family guy material goes. I'd really like to rate this 2.5 stars - i wont go so far as to say 'i dont like it (2 stars)' but i'm not sure i'd say 'its ok (3 stars)' either. For me, it kinda dragged on. I've had louder and longer laughs watching family guy episodes on tv then i had with this. At best, this one got a couple of weak chuckles out of me. Sadly, i don't think it's worth $20. Wait for it on netflix or tv.Sorry seth - but i just had to come back and change it to 2 stars. I was about to submit it with 3 stars because in general i like your stuff, but this one really was just kinda lame for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I found the first two really funny. When the opening lines said that it was going to be really bad and to lower my expectations, I thought 'no that's not possible, family guy is always funny'. Sadly this was not, the jokes were very forced and relied heavily on jokes they have used in the episodes. Conway Twitty bit was boring as usual and when they all start signally each other jsut goes on far too long.To quote the comic book guy 'worst episode ever!!'Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoming it in","review":"Not worth it.The running joke of the show is \\"Fox made us do it\\". I'm sorry (Seth Mcfarline) you made a successful show ripping off another successful show and you have to carry the network. It's odvious the jokes are steal old Seth only does half the commentary no real extra to speak of. not worth buying wait for it to be on Adult Swim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dissapointing.","review":"The fact that in the first 3 minutes, the creator himself tells the audience that his creation was clearly rushed and says \\"Lower your expectations, okay?\\" was a truly disappointing sight. The movie itself had plenty of gaps, and was obviously not done well at all.I give the writers credit for their effort, but besides that, it was just... awful.Seth Macfarlane, you have saddened your fans. In my eyes, you have just made \\"It's a Trap\\" for your own profit, as you stated: \\"Fox wouldn't let me direct my movie if I didn't do Jedi\\". Great job Seth, great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but not as good as the first one","review":"The third installment is funny, but not as good as the first one. There were still some good moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"By telling us they didn't care ahead of time, it took all hope of it being funny out of it. Laughed maybe 3 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd","review":"what's not to like if you like family guy you'll really enjoy watching this well worth the money and love the amazon convenience of shopping"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than something \\"Something Something Something Dark Side...\\" still not as good as \\"Blue Harvest\\"","review":"The third installment has a few disclaimers at the beginning of it that I think would have been better served in the second installment 'something something something dark side'.This one is not as good as the first but is still entertaining and definitely has a few laugh out loud moments - as well as a few classic Family Guy moments that make you sigh/wince.Overall I do like this movie and I am glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trilogy should have ended at 2","review":"I am a big fan of Star Wars and loved the Family Guy spoofs of the first two. The third, however, lacked everything. The jokes and sly comments were lame, the story was boring and the conflicts so week it was non-existant. There was more hatred from Stewie towards Lois than from all the characters and Darth Vader/Lord Cydeaus. I have it to complete the set but I don't know when or if I'll watch it again. Not recommended if you haven't purchased it yet. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, about as lame as expected","review":"It's a Trap! is about as lame as you can expect. While it has its funny moments (Seth Green's Entourage mentions), it's no better than a lackluster regular episode. The only scenes really worth watching are the ones with Carter as Palpatine, and even then Stewie's awful Vader drag those down. Watch it when it comes to television. Don't waste your money on this painful hour of Family Guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first two.","review":"Don't waste your money. This was obviously put together in a hurry with little effort. Maybe if they stopped wasting time with The Cleveland Show (also bad)they could have produced a better version. Instead get your hands on the Family Guy/American Dad 2010 Christmas episodes (TiVo?), they where much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny conclusion to the trilogy","review":"Seth MacFarlane's take on the original Star Wars trilogy a la Family Guy is complete, and while It's a Trap isn't as overly funny or quite as fun as Blue Harvest or Something, Something, Something, Darkside; it still manages to deliver the goods and end things on a high enough note. The events of Return of the Jedi are played out funny enough, with enough Family Guy characters (as well as charcters from American Dad and The Cleveland Show) popping up to help keep your attention. Between that and the hysterical ribbing on Seth Green, It's a Trap is a worthwhile and funny conclusion to the trilogy. The opening scroll foretelling the suckage of It's a Trap is only half-true: it doesn't have that same feel to it that made Blue Harvest so great, but it's funny enough in its own right to warrant your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A TRAP","review":"It's ok. Worth it if you got the Blu-ray pack for 22.99$. It's a Trap! was the worst one of the bunch. Almost seemed as if they really didn't want to do that one. Way to much bad language(To much for kids anyway) in the last one with no point to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy... Brilliant Satire","review":"This is an awesome DVD. If you like Family Guy and Star Wars (kind of goes hand-in-hand), there are a lot of subtle allusions mixed in with the typical Family Guy sarcasm. Funniest Star Wars spin off Family Guy has done so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"almost as funny as Blue Harvest","review":"After the laugh-fest of Blue Harvest, I was a bit let down by Something... With that in mind, and seeing that others were left underwhelmed, I wasn't expecting much of It's A Trap. I shouldn't have worried. Jedi is much more ripe for parody than Empire, and the writers tee off on it mercilessly! For the money, I wouldn't have minded some more substantial bonus materials, but the episode itself is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break DVD, slash your wrists with shards- it will be more fun","review":"I own every Family Guy DVD set made, and bought this the day it became available. Family Guy is always hit and miss, but this is almost completely miss. It starts out by stating that they are out of gas, and don't care. This may have been intended as a joke, but seems to have been an omen. It falls flat, misses what would seem to be obvious jokes and seems to rely more on the fact that they can use language that will have to be edited when Fox eventually broadcasts this than on anything truly original. I truly believe that Seth and the gang have greatness n them, but like many pop culture phenoms before (Chris Carter, Joss Whedon) too many series at one time leads to a decline in quality (Cleveland Show- I mean you), which is certainly shown in this DVD.Do not buy this DVD. Wait until Fox shows it, or rent it, but trust me, you won't be watching it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pen did not work","review":"The pen looked great and did light up, unfortunately it did not write--The postage for one pen was $9.86. The company offered a refund with the return of the item in the original package(which I had discarded)but since I had alread paid postage nearly as much as the pen, I opted not to spend more money returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of $","review":"This book is a summary of learning methods, but deals mostly with theory, philosophy, details of research etc. I wonder why a scientist advertises approximated pronunciation- should he also advise approximations in the matter of his research??? This is not a book for linguists - here the language is just a tool. I could find on the net more than in this book. Alan Healey wrote a realy good one, maybe SIL still has it on microfiche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires VB.Net","review":"This tome is very poorly written. I suspect English is not the authors' first language. Of the four projects demonstrated, only the first uses VBA. The other three are built with VB.Net. Premier Press continues to be a book publisher to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"The book is very informative and covers all the aspects of VBA programming. It also gives a brief and intro to VB.net which is something I really liked. There are 4 projects in the book, which also gives you a hands-on the concepts taught in the book.I have done all the projects covered in the book myself and they seem to be very real-life applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Sludge!","review":"This is the most insipid piece of \\"writing\\" that I have read in 10 years. The author is puffed with self-importance and can't seem to decide whether he should be pretentious or facile. His passages on Africa are so cliched that one wonders whether he ever went there at all, or just saw the Meryl Streep movie. One clue about the quality of this book is the fact that all the positive reviews to date were submitted by the author's friends! Avoid paying money for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture","review":"Works great. Has a great picture on my Toshiba HD. As usual....remote is a bit complicated. I'm sure I don't use half the buttons. Very nice look to the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with my G5 iMac.","review":"Unlike other flash drives it stores document data, like icons and creation dates, when used with my iMac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"This book covers one of the more fascinating events of the 19th century--the rise of the Sudanese Mahdist Empire--solely in the terms of the series of Anglo-Egyptian expeditions to crush it. While one-sided histories aren't always bad, this one just sort of falls flat. There are better sources on the Mahdists and I'd recommend looking over this one unless you are solely interested in the military aspects [the British ones]. The maps were also of little use as they were zoomed out so much that the book's locales are hardly distinguishable--despite them being divided by great distances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject by bad writer","review":"First off I am not a book critic. My immediate observations about this book are that it is;poorly written, disjointed, rambling, with a smattering of incoherent sentence structures that leaves you wondering just what he is talking about. At times a jolly good read if you could deduce where they are and how they got there at any given time. What date it is anyway! What came first? Did, this chap die 20 pages ago or not? Most of the places mentioned are not on the map. (You will need a magnifying glass to read it) There is scant little development on the main participants and too much information on minor officers and men who die at a particular battle but have never been mentioned at all before.There may be some good history here but you will need to keep a scorecard ready to follow any chronological order. It seems clear that a good ( OBJECTIVE) book on this subject could not be accomplished in less then 700 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not general enough.","review":"You would have to have every kind of cast iron pan ever made to make all of these recipes. Plus some of them sound kinda nasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"There are some really great recipes in this book. I have been trying many of them. I recently bought a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven from Lodge cookware and my family has been enjoying many new meals.I also recommend the book \\"A Skillet Full\\" available here too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy, but NOT for sitting!","review":"I purchased two of these chairs for my twins, they love them. They keep getting dumped forward out of them, however, almost every time they try to sit in them. They are 16mo old, and not big babies, but they don't have room to turn around in them to sit without grabbing the top and pulling the whole thing over on top of themselves. They had a blast laughing and playing on top of the tipped over chairs however! (Once they got over the intial head bump on the carpeting!) Perhaps these chairs belong in a different category! They will be returned for sturdy upholstered chairs like my older children have had. The cover looked like it could easily be unzipped/removed for washing if needed. Cute and colorful, but not functional!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Topples too easily","review":"My daughter just rcv'd this chair for Christmas. She is a very active child and this chair is too narrow and unsturdy for her. She's fallen over several times, just bcs she has leaned to the side while sitting in it. I would NOT recommend this chair for any toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly...but she LOVES it! ;o)","review":"Well, when I saw this gift on Christmas morning I thought, \\"no way are we keeping that!\\" It's ugly, but growing on me. And, we are keeping it because my one year old daughter loves it. She can get into it by herself. My only complaint (other than how it looks) is that it tips over pretty easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book terrible translation","review":"First, I have read this book in French as it was available for free as a Kindle download and a friend suggested that its much better then the English translation. As my French is a bit rusty I decided to also read it in English. It was a mistake. The translation is a the worst I ever saw. It felt as if a 16 year old set down with a dictionary and attempted a word for word translation. It was so painful after the beautiful French version that I had to put it down 20 pages into the book, as it was unbearable. I am giving this rating for the terrible translation not to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I have more than my share of interior decorating books. This one is the best!

For that reason, I will give it 2 stars, but if the rest of the book was like what I read, I would lower that to 1 star. I have been an Evangelical Christian for over 20 years, yet I find much popular apologetics on Christianity to be disappointing and sometimes even dishonest. What I read in this book was definitely disappointing. It might confirm and affirm the beliefs of believers, but I do not see it being of much use at all for answering those who want real and in-depth answers to real and in-depth questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I am taking a class from one of the authors and I find the book to be well written and easy to understand.

Readers who expect a thorough mathematical introduction should read other books (e.g. Fudenberg&Tirole). But readers who want to understand the essence of game theoretical thinking and want to learn about many real-life applications (e.g. cold war) will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book.....","review":"The author is a fine economist, but he's written a lousy textbook. The only positive is that it's easy (indeed, almost to the point of being simplistic) so the uninitiated can learn from it rather readily. But it takes away any positive it provides by being rather nonstandard in its terminology and notations. Plus, I doubt anyone taking a college-level game theory class would be so untrained so as to need this sort of babying. Finally, the contents don't justify the sky-high price.If you need a good game theory text, buy Gintis for the intro. students and Osborne and Rubinstein for the reasonably advanced. These are affordable paperbacks that I think are as good as any hardcover. Don't waste money needlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and interesting introduction to game theory","review":"I really enjoyed this book. There were some areas where it was kind of confusing, but I found that overall it kept me interested. Their approach is good especially for those who want to learn about the topic and its applications but don't have much background in math or economics. Game theory is a really interesting field, and this text provides a good introduction for those who want to learn about it without getting bogged down in the math. The book does its best job I think in tying the principles to the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"beautiful coffee table book. not the sort of thing you sit and read, but great to have out when guests come over. fantastic images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"Received this book for Christmas.

Too much reliance on well-known names and very little writing that is fresh and exciting.

Even my older children, aged 12, 11, 9, and 7 stopped what they were doing to sit and watch it.From shapes to colors to good manners, puppets and real-life concepts, and narrated with a sweet voice, this educational DVD for children has pulled out all of the stops!You can see my full review here: http://www.mommyrantings.com/2012/01/start-to-finish-childrens-fun.htmlStep aside, Baby Einstein, Sid the Science Kid, Dora the Explorer and good ol' Sesame Street!

The 14 speed dial does not change the speed at all, it is low and high that's it. There was a some kind of metallic part that had come off or something and I could hear it hit the sides of the grinder when I shook the base portion of the grinder. I called the manufacturer and told them about this and their answer was, as long as the grinder works, that should not be a problem. The first time I used, I just made some apple milk shake and the grinder started smelling, like something burning inside. I did not want to use it any further and I returned it. Not a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging= poor customer service","review":"We were very dissapointed when we received the blender.

Maybe that will help me remember what color is what since I store them in a pencil cup and can't see the point size at a glance.

It is a testimony to the incredible spirit of all women, by exploring the journey most of these authors have taken while their immediate surrounding was experiencing significant turmoil and destruction. A voyage that was carried despite significant prejudice and eradication of an assortment of their basic rights. It is also a narrative of the immigration experience, being subjected to intolerance and narrow-mindedness on a different level and yet succeeding despite the odds. These incredible women are telling their story and the story of all of us who experience conflict, affection, separation, contradictions and intolerance, while struggling to maintain a conventional existence. A lesson for all of us in improved comprehension of one-another and recognizing the value of our differences.

As a Jets fan who sat in the stands when they were 1-15, I can tell you firsthand that Chrebet was the only reason to get excited during that season! Chrebet never gave up and luckily he was surrounded by family and friends that had the same attitude. Yeah, the writing isn't exactly Hemingway, but Chrebet is the everyman.

I brought the book to school the next two days... and I finished it. I normally hate to read but this book was great. I loved to learn about his life. How almost everyday when he was a kid he'd end up getting hurt, and he just kept doing it. I almost cried when he talked about his grandma and when he finally made the NFL.

This is a big, tough, serious drama, with tension and a big emotional punch that will connect. Brace yourself for a rocky ride.It might have been more believable if the kids were all geniuses from a magnet school. Frankly I have never been acquainted with anyone quite as precocious and independent as the characters in this film. But maybe this is where the human race is headed in the future.It offers a welcome respite from the same old saws being churned out by the movie industry.

That is why I chose this when I was looking for a lighter plunger router. The router is fine when in the fixed base, but the plunge base is a different story. There is quite a bit of slop in the plunge bushings which allow the router to angle from side to side as it is plunged, and it invariably binds in the process of plunging which forces you to rock it back and forth to complete the plunge. It is essentially useless for precision work. I had originally purchased it for exactly that; as a plunge router for use with guides on templates. The plunge base is now just a useless relic, and it is suitable for use with the fixed base only. If you're looking for a medium sized plunge router, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"D-base looked good, but plastic subase did not fit properly due to poorly machined router base.

To quote Bono from one of the live shows, this is the time period when Americans had thought U2 had gone \\"artsy\\", when really they were producing some of the most beautiful and incredible music of the decade. Even if you don't like U2 of the 90s, the 2 new tracks make this album worth buying. (by the way, the U2 of the 90s is the same U2 from the 80s...haha) As a few bonuses, theyve thrown a couple songs from the experimental Passengers group on this set as well, and a bonus DVD with great live performances from the decade.

All of the tracks from \\"POP\\" have been watered down and stripped to sound like stuff from their last record 'All that you can't leave behind\\". It seems as if U2 are embarressed of their explorations into disco and dance music instead of representing it for what it was. Once 'Discotheque' used to sound like a disco song...now the reworked version sounds like a rock song about a disco. Everything is really messed up on these versions. If you only like U2 a little bit and want a weak representation of their 90's work, this is a good record for you.

Call me old-fashioned but U2's experimental 'DISCOTHEQUE' and 'POP' was disgusting to the loyal,original U2 fans! Disheartened I was but I was 'ELEVATED' when 'ALL THAT YOU..' was released and I said to myself,\\"Yes! U2 is back for good!!\\" 'ELECTRICAL STORM' is fantastic, and what we need is a new album of this sort. To Bono and co, forget about compilation(no doubt 'BEST OF 80-90' gets the thumbs up),you guys are the best song and music writers and nothing is greater than the production of a new album(not a new image again,please..)for the sake of the all-time, loyal U2 fans all around the world!

This is the time when they became more experimental with thier sounds and were trying new things. Don't get me wrong, I love U2. They are the greatest rock band in the world, period. There is a good mix of songs from all thier albums in this time. Everything from One to Stuck in a Moment is on here. It is a pretty good mix. And add on that there is a second disk of new mixes and other songs is quite nice too (although, the new mix of If God Will Send His Angels absolutley sucks). All in all, if you are a U2 fan, pick it up no questions asked. If you are just getting into U2, I would reccomend starting at the best of 1980-1990, then getting this as an addendum to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collection","review":"This is an excellent collection of U2 songs.

I still give it 4 Stars (hey, it's U2 ^_~) because the selection of the first cd is nice, and there are a few interesting new mixes (discotheque has a very interesting new version), but on the cd 2 except the first 5 songs, the rest is a bunch of techno-heavy almost un-listenable remixes of classical song.

This limited edition also offers a free DVD containing 4 short films including a live performance of \\"PLease\\" filmed in 1997. My only let down on this set is the song \\"Lemon\\" is not among the 16 songs on the greatest hits but is on the B sides disc as a 5.29 jeep mix version.

Foregoing their tried and true militant musical style of the 1980's, U2 created such monolithic albums as \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" This was also a time during which U2 sought to expand their sound by venturing into the land of electronic music with the album Zooropa.The two CD set includes the songs that truly encapsulate the sound of U2 during the 90's, and even though the second CD has some of the less popular b-sides the first CD is nonstop musical bliss. This album is a must have for all fans of U2 and is a good place to start for those of you not familiar with the musical range of this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"All that they couldn't leave behind:The Fly, Lemon, Please..","review":"Ok, they should at least include The First Time as a hidden track, like October figured in The Best Of 1980-1990... but why the lack of gems like The Fly, Please, Lemon?

Not only does this CD set contain a great selection of there hits (Even Better Then The Real Thing, Mysterious Day, Beautiful Day, One, Miss Sarajevo, Stay, Gone, Until The End Of The World, Etc.,) from 1990-2000, it gives us alternative mixes some of the hits such as Gone, Discotheque and Starring At The Sun and two new songs Electrical Storm (two versions) and The Hands That Built America. It also gives us a whole disk of B sides (Dirty Day junk Day mix, North and South Of The River, Salome, If God Will Send His Angels, etc.,), which are all very cool and a bonus DVD. The three disk makes this package a very good bargain. The Bonus DVD includes The History Mix, U2 The Best Of 1990-2000 DVD trailer, Please-Live Mural Cut, and Beautiful Day-EZE Version.

First, the good: the William Orbit mix of Electrical Storm is a new classic. The Hands That Built America is also good, but along the lines of The Ground Beneath Her Feet (conspicuously missing from this compillation). The new mixes of the stuff from Pop were welcome, but also sounded re-recorded (maybe that was just the production). Drawbacks: while the B-Sides collection is pretty complete, noticeably missing is Holy Joe, Slow Dancing, and Satellite of Love. From the Best of side, they should have included Elevation, The Fly, and Night & Day. I was also disappointed by the bonus DVD. It didn't have too much other than the history mix and a few previews of the upcoming Best of DVD ...

The story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time,although I had a pretty good idea of who had sent the arrow. The appearance of Hercules was a pleasant bonus-no Xena story is really complete without him. Any Xena fan would love this book-I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"The only part about this book I enjoyed was the plot - which of course is not original! I found the characters extremely shallow and unbelievable. The swaying of emotion from deep despair to unbelievable joy on a single page by a single character did not ring true to me. The character of Guenevere annoyed me because she was such a victim to her emotions, while paradoxically being so \\"strong\\" (as the author attempted to make us believe). I have read plenty of other books in this same \\"style\\" (eg. Diana Gabaldon's wonderful books) and this does not even come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"this version of the Arthurian legends sets my teeth on edge.","review":"A few other reviewers went into great detail and said alot of things I have to agree with.I picked this book up as part of my resource and research materials for an Arthurian novel I'm in the process of writing, and the twists and turns and liberties she's taken with the traditional storyline just really bug me.If I wanted a pagan-heavy, feminist viewpointed version of the story, I'd reread Mists of Avalon. This was too heavy-handed and seems alot more like a romance novel than fantasy. Merlin was a twisted old man bent on revenge who hallucinated women and cackled..Guenevere was a pagan queen from a society that believed in polyamory and her right to change lovers/consorts every 7 years, and while Arthur did have the pendragon tattooos on his wrists (ties to the old ways) he followed the Christians.I just really couldn't stand the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off of The Mists of Avalon, with Guenevere as the hero","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote The Mists of Avalon, a retelling of the King Arthur story from a feminist/wiccan viewpoint. This book makes Guenevere the heroic pagan woman, and she is not the compelling character that Morgaine was in MZB's book. The christian Gwenyfhyr in MZB's book and the conflict between the woman and their faiths is not matched in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another romance novel.","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. I always like reading different spins on the Arthurian legend, but this one was just bad. First of all, there were too many anachronistic aspects. The story went back and forth from Dark Ages references to Middle Ages references. I could have handled this, however, if the book didn't turn into a typical romance novel. The story was OK, up until the point where Lancelot saved Guenevere. I honestly just got so sick of the description of them that I put the book down, never to even finish it. Sometimes, some good sex is entertaining and even meaningful, but in this case, it was ludricrous and irritating. I bought this book expecting to really enjoy a new take on King Arthur but ended up really disliking this book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that's read The Mists of Avalon or The Once and Future King or any other highly respected versions of the Matter of Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish","review":"This novel tells the story of Guenevere and Arthur. I started with high hopes, but those were quickly dashed. I kept trying, but the going got slower and slower and finally stopped altogether.The two main characters didn't interest me a lot, and when they did catch my attention they only irritated me. Several of the side characters seemed like they had potential to be deeper and more satisfying, but the book didn't focus much on them. The main reason I didn't finish was that the romance aspect of the novel was too much for me. It distracted me from the storyline (which itself was interesting) and again, made the characters less likeable to me.On the bright side, I did find the story fascinating and this book prompted me to try more books that tell the story of Camelot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best retelling","review":"As a fan of the Arthurian legend, I picked this book to read another take on the legend of Camelot. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. This retelling centers around Guinevere, the Queen of the Summer Country, a strong willed individual who marries Arthur to help her people. I admired Guinevere for about the first third of the novel and then slowly I tired of her. Same went for Arthur. He was depicted as he always is, manipulated, romantic, and weak.I found myself struggling to finish this book and knew for sure at the end of the book that I wouldn't be reading the rest of the trilogy. Bottom line: avoid this retelling and go read The Mists of Avalon instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting take on an old tale.","review":"I really enjoyed the romance and the magic in this story. However, it did seem to echo almost all of the other arthurian stories. It did shed some new light on the female perspective and this I thought, was a very interesting take on an old tale. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loved Mary Stewarts books. Its a good, simple book to read on a lazy day. One of those books that you don't have to think to much to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....ummmm....yea....","review":"Well, i picked up this novel because i was intrigued to see Guenevere portrayed as a strong-minded young woman. And was only mildly disappointed. She was strong, but maybe i had built up her image so big that the character just couldnt reach.Ummmm, overall it was good. The flow lacked and occasionally i put the book down because i was bored with the repetitiveness of it all.Yea, i would recommend this novel, but only if you're on a long road trip or stuck in detention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I have a penchant for books about the Arthurian legend and really tried to like this one. But, it was such a harlequin romance barely disguised as historical/mythological novel that I couldn't stomach it. Just so smarmy! Read the Mists of Avalon instead: granted, Guenevere is not given much sympathy in that novel, but it's better than this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly amusing, but completely misrepresents Catholicism","review":"I have always been intrigued by the Arthurian legends and thought that as a woman, I'd enjoy this book. Boy was I wrong! Guenevere was a whiny, self-centered woman, whom I would be ashamed to know. And I was sorely disappointed at the way the Catholic faith was misrepresented as a male-dominated cult."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Story Already Told Before","review":"Guenevere has indeed been described before and a much stronger and three dimensional characters can be found in Marion Zimmer Bradley's 'The Mists of Avalon'. 'Queen of the Summer Country' has borrowed a lot of its strength from Zimmer Bradley's story (that by the way was written in 1982 - long before this book was written.) The characters are flat, un-explored, and as someone already pointed out: the constant repetition of 'Arthur oh Arthur' is an effective tool to drive readers insane, sigh! I will not buy the next book but might borrow it from the library - I do love Arthurian stories..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed, I stopped reading","review":"I've struggled through 150 pages and I'm giving up. I'm a huge fan of Arthurian versions, and this one falls flat and far short of other versions. It is a pale pale imitation of the Mists of Avalaon. It drags in Guenevere as a follower of the old religion (pre-christian), yet does a poor job (so far) of describing it. All the characters seem like villians, and Guenevere garners no sympathy. She spends most of her flushing with embarrasement!Much better stories are Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, even if it isn't well written, I still care about the characters. Frank Whyte's Dream of Eagles series (8 books) gives a wonderful accounting of how Camalot grew into being, showing the co-existance of the old religions and how christianity came to the forefront. Its full of military battles that I prefer to skip over, but at least the battles make sense compared to this Guenevere tripe!I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money buying this Guenevere series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Storytelling","review":"I was immediately captivated by Guenevere. If you are looking for stiff one dimentional characters - this book is not for you. Rosalind Miles paints the most realistic, human versions of Guenevere and Aurther I have ever read. These people have fears and doubts and realistic emotions. They are not all-knowing. I have fallen in love with all of the characters - messy flaws and all.Beautifully written, it gives you the sense of being there. She describes each setting down to the smallest detail. Thrilling story. Thrilling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Legend","review":"Having read most of the feminist retellings of the Arthurian Legend, I have to admit that this was one of the most unimaginative versions to date. Aside from the preposterous notion of a matriarchal subkingdom within Arthur's Britain, there really isn't any original material within the 400 or so pages of this book. Guenevere is typically selfish and yet not quite as strong willed as she tends to be in other novels of this sort. The plot is just about as weak as the supporting characters, with the exception of Morgan Le Fay, whom I would have liked to see more of. Her background was fairly original following the outline of Le Morte D'Arthur where she is sent to convent, all in all a nice change. I would recomend this book only to those who have not sampled other literary offerings cut from the same mold."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Gueniviere books out there...","review":"I've been reading Arthurian novels lately, and I looked forward to reading this book to get a different perspective on Guinevere. And it is interesting that a legend is interpreted in so many ways, and this book does present a few different aspects.But I couldn't get into it. I wasn't able to connect with the Guenevere character, despite her happiness and sadness. She tended to be a little whiny, and Arthur seemed like a bit of a dolt sometimes.However, the most annoying thing about this book for me, personally, was the use of exclamation points! It seemed whenever there was a quote, it used an exclamation point! I felt like the characters were yelling all the time! After a while it was almost funny!I'd say this book would be okay to pick up from the library but I wouldn't recommend buying it. There seem to be better Gueniviere books out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Read This, Had Deja-Vu","review":"I am almost convinced that this novel is a... in essence of The Mists of Avalon. The whole Christian versus Pagan thing rears its head again, and again almost to the point of being preachy. It seems the author thought Mists' Gwenyfhar got short-shifted and so decided to turn her Guenevere into the kind of character Morgaine was. Maybe this would be really good for someone unfamiliar with Mists. In reality, it doesn't come close to Mists, but the same ideas are present..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"I wanted to read about Guinevere (I prefer this spelling) because I just loved her in First Knight. This book boasted of a strong heroine, one for all ages and so I was eager to read all about the Arthurian legends through her point of view. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be a big disappointment. The basics of the story had been twisted and told with little skill. Perhaps Guenevere would have been better without her redundant thoughts and complaints. Lancelot was NOT very likable at all. The antagonists, Malgaunt and Morgan, were pretty true. But I think that's about it, this isn't worth reading to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy","review":"This book was a fresh perspective of the Guenevere tale. However, it didn't really reach it's full potential in character portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guenevere: Queen of Summer Country","review":"i recieved the item in a good period of time and it was in the condition described. good seller to buy from :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles Has Done Better","review":"In the modern literature of the Arthurian legend the book rehabilitating the adultress High Queen has yet to be written. I very much enjoyed Rosalind Miles' \\"I, Elizabeth\\" and had high hopes for this volume. It might work as a juvenile, but everything about it is weak. Not one of the characters captures the imagination of the reader. I didn't hate it, but I did finish it constatntly hoping it would get better. I will not buy the second volume in this series. I might borrow it, but then only in the desperate hope that this effort by Ms. Miles was a fluke."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing perspective","review":"It's always a delight to find yet another perspective of the Arthurian legends, and this one is intriguing. I loved the Mists of Avalon, of course, but Ms. Miles' story encourages us to take another look at Bradley's Morgan and Guenevere. For those of us who haven't read the 80 plus Arthurian books that other reviewers refer to, this is a wonderful story that doesn't dull our wits with Welsh names that are impossible to pronounce (as much as I love Wales... don't get me wrong...). In short, it is a wonderful story and it presents the reader with new ideas. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it could have given the \\"witches\\" at Morgan's convent a more comprehensive historical background. I am looking forward to reading the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles creats a totally unsympathetic Guenevere","review":"Having read a good 80 books on the subjects of King Arthur and Guenevere, I was extremely disappointed in this one. Miles has created a completely unsympathetic character -- one that is so shallow, annoying and at times infuriating that I almost didn't care enough about her to finish the book. And what makes this even more disappointing is the fact that Miles' voice and writing style are good, and there is so much more she could have done. The story has so much potential that is squandered in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at the top of the Arthurian list","review":"This book and its sequel are so uninteresting that, although devoted to Arthuriana, I can't bring myself to read the third book in the series. There's no new perspective on the characters or story; it just grinds unpleasantly along. Strangely enough, this is one of four recent and dreary Arthurian series (along with those by Stephen Lawhead, Bernard Cornwell and Jack Whyte). I'd rather spend my time re-reading Mary Stewart's Merlin series, Persia Woolley's Guinevere trilogy, Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" or Rosemary Sutcliff's \\"Sword at Sunset.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Toyota Prius","review":"Not what I thought it would be. Made to dash look really sloppy. First thing I have returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"cultural awareness and biblical fidelity","review":"Guinness demonstrates an acute awareness of modern culture and its philisophical foundations. This is refreshing due to the apparent lack of evangelical critical thinking in the American church. While detractors will claim that you must embrace the modern for the sake of the gospel and to be \\"relevant\\" to modern and post-modern generations, Guinness points out that the Gospel is at odds with modernity. A clear argument is presented showing that the technologies and strategies used for presenting biblical truth actually subvert it due to the ideas that they embrace. At the very least a concise argument against main-stream church marketing and mega-churches. Food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"REQUIRED READING","review":"Guinness paints a very grim picture of the meagchurch's accoumadtions to modernity. In the face of rising hostility from mainstream culture nobody wants to face the fact that some of our greatest church \\"successes\\" are actually just as dangerous. This reality is not one Guinness relishes or is eager to report, but the story must be told. Very concise, well-written, well-researched, thoughtful. I wish every Christian in America could read thsi book. One of the ten most importnat things I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old arguments from an out of touch perspective.","review":"O.S. Guiness evidently does not understand the concept of form verses function. The function of the church never changes. The word of God never changes. The function of the church is to take the gospel of Christ to a lost world. The form we use must be relavant to the culture or the message will be rejected. If the church does not speak a language people can understand, people will not listen. This concept in no way implies compromising the truth or message of God's word. Mr. Guinness has a heart for God but a misunderstanding of this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and documented","review":"This is a poorly written book that quotes many people out of context. Moreover, the author aparrently does not trust the reader to look up the sources of these quotes, so he simply does not provide any.

A machining error in manufacture of the collet allowed it to throw the bit while cutting. Since it was mounted in a table with a guard, the only casualties were the bit and the guard.The nature of the error suggests a bad batch of collets.

However, because I could not prove to Porter Cable that the motor was bad they would not do anything about it. But, just as I expected, the motor went bad again and then the warranty was out. I bought a new unit, even though I was not happy with the first one. I don't think Porter Cable wants to make its customers happy. I would recommend another brand. They are the ones that caused me to write this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ideas - poor execution","review":"When everything is working, this is a great router system. Too bad, it seldom works. I've owned the router for over a year and for 6 months of that time it has been in and out of the shop. Problems include broken motor lock mechanism, broken worm gear to raise motor and broken shaft lock. Last time, I bought extra gears and shaft lock pins just to keep it out of the shop. Any sawdust clogs the mechanism so raising and lowering are tough. I've had several other PC routers and have been extremely pleased with all of them, but this one has just about made me lose the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 2 levers before I turned it on for the first time","review":"Using the router under the table has been impossible, since I keep snapping the cheap spun aluminum levers PC has used. This especially happens when using a socket to manipulate the lever. Loosening the lever screw so that the lever won't break does not adequately secure the router. The router design is brilliant in terms of the mechanism, but the parts need to be rock solid and they are not. I am extremely dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid router; Nice features","review":"I have used this router only under the table (inside a dust collection enclosure) for about a year now and I really like it. The router is solid as expected from PC. It is much more quiet/less obnoxious than the 690 series and has noticably more power. I don't have a need for the speed control that much. I love the height adjustment features, and even though I would like it even better if they made it out of aluminum, it has held up just fine so far. The only thing I dislike given that all the other features make it so convenient for under-table-use is the safety feature that requires you turn the router switch to the Off position in order to use the spindle lock feature: I use the tool with a table mounted switch in a dust collection enclosure and so I had to cut the plastic safety tab to circumvent this issue. Still like it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Tool","review":"I hung the Porter Cable 892 in my table using a Kreg Precision router lift. I built a set of raised panel oak doors.

It bogs down excessively and gets really hot on any kind of normal cut, sometimes to the point of tripping the breaker it's connected to (15A). This is using 1/2\\" diameter new, sharp 2 flute spiral carbide bits in MDF. I eventually settled on cutting at 1/8\\" depth of cut at 100ipm in order to not have it trip the breaker. My 11 year old Dewalt 1.5HP router will cut vastly better (more like 1/2\\" depth of cut at the same speed) using the exact same bit in the same material (even though the PC is supposed to be more powerful).

The power switch is better done. All in all a good router, especially for the price here. Compared to a more expensive router all you will loose with this is power and the ability to plunge (a separate plunge base can be purchased separately). Compared to a cheaper router this will have more features, have less runout (less wavey cuts that need sanding due to play in the shaft), have the ability to handle 1/2\\" bits, and is a quality tool... something lacking in many tools these days.

Worse still, there is very little in the way of deduction in this story.The title itself is a little misleading, and the depiction of the regulars (including Inspector Lestrade) is done more as parodies than characters.And then there is a jokey bit, where law officers refuse to believe that Holmes and Watson are themselves because they don't look like the Sidney Paget illustrations from the Strand magazine.

However, it is all too predictable and to me read like a laundry list of a life history. Adventures as a puppy, check. Life as an Indian sled dog, check. King of all fighting dogs, check. And it goes on and on and on.I wont give away the ending, but I was thoroughly disappointed.However, I believe that even though this was written in 1906 White Fang is still alive somewhere.

Jack London was able to let us get into the mind of man's best friend and view how they may look at us. There was happiness and heart ache, heros and villians.

To me however the ending was very unexpected. I would have never thought that he would have ended up in California. Despite this I still thouroughly enjoyed this book and would recomend it to anyone who enjoys Jack London, or any wilderness survival book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raised by Wolves","review":"With the insight Jack London provides in \\"White Fang\\", one must wonder if he was raised by wolves. It takes a sharp imagination to see through a wolf's eyes in this way.

From the ownership of Gray Beaver to Beauty Smith to Judge Scott, White Fang lived an interesting existence. From his humble beginnings as an abandoned puppy, the wolf is raised by She-Wolf. Almost accidently, White Fang learns to hunt. After the first taste of warm blood, the wolf becomes known for its savagery. In a twist of fate, White Fang gains fame to faithful service to humans and saving human lives.I felt the writing of London was a bit verbose at points in the book.

As he grows he learns famine and drought and by the time he is old enough to leave his den he is the only one left of his litter.White fang quickly leans the law of the wild, eat or be eaten.Later on in the story his mother stumbles across an Indian village.

It says how White Fang felt about humans and dogs. It also tells you what kinds of animals wolves hunt and eat.White Fang tells you how wolves survive in a pack. It also says how the leader of every pack gets food. White Fang also talks about when the females have their own pack. It says how they react when the males come around.

Jack London's writing style is very unique type. He uses large and choice vocabulary, he writes in dialect, in dialogue, and from the Dog's perspective at some points in the two books. Much of the writing is the same in these two books, since Wild Fang is a sequel of The Call of the Wild. His writing is very detailed and descriptive in these two books constantly. It creates a picture in the mind of the readers, and captures you into the book immediately when you start reading.

When the Indians found White Fang they treated him like a slave. They would beat and tease him and also work him very hard.The white men would treat him even worse than the indians. White Fang lived with thew indians for a while, they trained him to be mean and kill whatever trespassed. They called him the killer dog, and he was. A guy by the name Beuty Smith found White Fang and was no better than the indians since him also made him fight other dogs. After a while White Fang ran away into the wild with other animals.The other wolves wouldn't let him run the pack because he was half dog.

Then, absolutely nothing HAPPENED in 70 pages. These two wolves have a litter, only one of which survives. That's it. In 70 PAGES!!!! I just don't have enough time to waste it on books like this. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I found it boring. Since I was only reading it for pleasure, not assignment, I didn't see any reason to finish it.

After meeting Weedon Scott, White Fang starts to change. White Fang then shows he could also be a loving and caring dog, different from before. Throughout his journey, humans and the Wild shape his destiny to make this one interesting and awesome book.Jack London uses the ideas of survival of the fittest and primordial rememberences to make White Fang a high action-packed and awesome book!

After watching the movie, he couldn't remember what parts were accurate or less than so, and I wondered. So I read (re-read, if you want to count my first read x decades ago) it last night.The book and the movie, I decided, barely know each other. They may have met in a bar one night, somewhere in the Yukon, and shared a drink or two. The movie is a fun, upbeat adventure story. The book talks a lot about gods, and how mankind are gods to the dogs. It's an old book, two years younger than the boat I'll be eating dinner on tomorrow night, and it most certainly carries many of the prejudices of the time.But that is what it should do - it was not written for today, and it should not be sanitized, nor should some of those attitudes be idolized.

I think, as a writer, one runs out of ways to describe dog fights and such after a while and so whichever of these you read first will probably be the one for you which sticks and the other will seem derivative even if different themes are touched upon.In any event, London proves him again a master of story pacing and construction. It is like he is working from a textbook or is, himself, the embodiment of the rules one learns as one takes up writing.

Dead's vocals will blow you away and Euronymous' guitar work shreds. If anyone is interested in the true roots of the black metal scene, pick up this disc.

Her first single 'Billy S' is a joke! This isn't a song for kids - it's trying to sound rebellious but it just sounds really stupid. Dropping out of school is not cool, never was and never will be. Then she thinks she's edgy and rock with her other single 'Tangled Up in Me' - no substance, ONCE again.

Don't use money on this CD when you can buy a MUCH better one like Ashlee or JoJo. All of the songs (except those three) are negative. She talkes about not liking people and stuff like that. The songs sound a lot similar. If you like Ashlee Simpson, you will NOT like this. If you like JoJo, you will NOT like this. If you like Hilary or Lindsay, you will NOT like this. I wish I never bought this CD. I used to like Skye a lot, but now things are changing. Number One, Billy S., and Tangled Up in Me are the only good songs. \\"I Don't Really Like You\\"'s chorus is good, but not the rest. All the verses of all the songs sound so much like the same.

The leaking is also a problem, but generally it occurs only when the seal is not properly inserted into the blender after washing but it is tricky to get it exactly positioned to prevent leakage. If not properly reinserted, the replacement seal can even shred and require replacement! Now, both of these points can be written off as just user error, but even after owning this appliance for a while, it is still cumbersome.

But you can't see it and it pinches your fingers every time. Also, after using the food processor only a handful of times and washing it in the dishwasher, the lid began to form cracks. So, we went to handwashing. In a little less than a year, even with handwashing, a large crack develeped in the bowl.

Also, the food processor blade has begun to rust.3) The safety feature. Most of the time it's a battle just to get the blender to turn on.

And you know what, it is very well built. Not only for the price, but well built period! It has a \\"heft\\" to it that makes you feel the quality of the materials used. It works like a fine tool should.So, what is the BUT all about? You have to really crank down on the nut to get the collet to hold the bit firmly. Just using a wrench on the nut is not enough and there is no way to use a second wrench. You'll need to use pliers (I used small locking pliers). You want to be careful not to bung-up the knurls on the shaft when you do this. After the bit is tightened, the pin vise works like a champ.If the collets tightened by hand, or if there were an easier way to tighten the nut with wrenches, I would have given this product a glowing 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like soggy food that takes a long time to cook...","review":"Then buy this fryer.

The album is conceptual in the sense that all the songs seem to flow together well and the album can be listened to from beginning to end. Very few albums fall under that classification. Also, this is not an album just for the black metal genre. Though each of the members of Borknagar are from well known black metal groups, they have created a style of music that surpasses traditional black metal. All in all, a work of art. This is just my opinion though, you should listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome melodic black metal at its finest!","review":"Absolutely one of the best CDs I own. Every single song is outstanding. \\"Grimland Domain\\" might have to be the finest black metal masterpiece in existance. Great steady drumwork, amazing guitar with extreme high quality riffage, great melodic bass, awesome keyboards and atmospheric effects that really blend into the music, and last but definately not least, killer vocals by Garm -- Brutal high pitched screams and majestic singing. This album clearly shows Borknagar's finest work. Borknagar combines the technical melodies and harmonies of Thy Primordial but without the constant brutality, and the northern majesty of Emperor to create an epic masterpiece of black metal I highly recommend to anyone who digs the whole Scandinavian black metal scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing clean vocals and melodic riffs, mixed w/ black metal","review":"Amazing clean vocals and melodic riffs, usually mid-paced with an occasional black metal part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy for Developing Hand Skills","review":"My four-month-old daughter loves this toy and will almost always choose it over anything else in reach. The ring shape and the soft petals make it great for developing hand skills -- she has a pretty good success rate in her attempts to pick it up. The petals are stuffed with different materials with varied textures and sounds and the face in the middle spins and slides side to side making a clacking sound that is inoffensive to adult ears.

Coe is a rare novelist--someone equally concerned with (and in control of) style and storytelling. This novel has humor, wisdom, anger and soul.

McCone's latest employee, Julia Rafael, is charged with credit-card fraud, and McCone doesn't believe it, nor does anyone else who knows her. However, the person accusing her, Alex Aguilar, is a respected member of the Board of Supervisors and founder of a job-training center, and things do not look good.But McCone's investigation reveals that Aguilar may have plenty to hide, and that, in fact, a frame-up of Julia may have been set in place specifically to ruin McCone.One thing I like very much about this series is that McCone and other continuing characters do not remain static. In this book, McCone continues to deal with her reaction to her brother's suicide, to her discovery of her own adoption and reunion with her birth family, and with changes in her relationship with her lover, Hy Ripinsky.A fast-paced and well-written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book.

Well, I was pleased to find that one of the songs that I jam to while there happens to be by my sis in Christ Natalie Wilson. \\"Act Like you Know\\" is off da hook. I had no idea it was even here. I like her alot because she not only sings with a beautiful voice, but she has tight beats and I appreciate that. Alot of artists don't know how to put the two together well. I listened to some of the other samples here, and I like how through the whole CD she sounds like she is just having fun praising the Lord....no drama, and extras that we don't need. So I recommend this one to a person who might flow to secular music like Kelli Williams and Faith Evans maybe. This is a great alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel music at its best!","review":"I first heard of Natalie Wilson when I saw her video for \\"Act like you know\\" on one of the gospel channels.

So of course I bought the second album \\"The good life\\" first which is off the hook. I just purchased this one which is almost just as good but not as long.

Fireside has the beautiful feeling of being right in a room with Mary Summer Rain as a friend and having a long evening discussion on matters of heart, mind and spirit combined. She helps us open our hearts, minds and souls to see where we are in our search for truth in the way a warm, trusting friend would, and that is how I see her.

The way it is written as a conversation between Mary Summer Rain and her friend, Sally, allows you to be a part of their back and forth questions and reflections on subjects like personally held beliefs, ego, meditation, personal power and always this underlying existence of serenity. You can reflect on the questions and thoughts that are presented and see how these play out in your life and what may be driving away the serenity that can seem so elusive.

Her stories are good, her messages are valuable, and I re'read several of those books that I do have.However, the excellence of her books are made even more clear when I read this one. FIRESIDE is opinionated and subjective to the extreeme. Seldom have I seen a star fall so fast. Tolerance and respect for others are virtues that I thought those on the path should be striving for.

I learned a lot about wine, how to choose a good one, why wine changes from the moment you uncork it to your last mouthful.I learned about the regions where grapes are grown, and why some grapes grow better in certain regions. I learned that oftentimes how good a wine is depends not so much on the soil the grapes are grown in, but the patience, passion, and faith of the winemaker. Most of all, this book is about enjoying life. Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher definitely know how to do that! They're inspiring. A truly heart-warming story.

The stories (about Dottie and John and about famous and not-so-famous winemakers) are endearing and poignant and drove me to deplete the better part of a box of kleenex. It simultaneously took me back to my own wine roots in the 70's (Mateus, Gallo Hearty Burgundy) and gave me a history of wine in America.

I used the book to select two successive general practitioners and found their performance below average. They were not the diagnosticians I sought, but were primarily referral agents.In addition to the current problem of managed care expecting physicians to see another patient every 15 minutes, there is an additional pressure on Long Island---the high price of real estate. A doctor living in a $750,000 house on Long Island is barely living a middle class existence compared to Wall Street brokers. There is thus twice the pressure to have a rapid turnover of patients.People searching for doctors should continue to look for diplomas from the best medical schools...and then ask whether the doctor's mortgage is completely paid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid like it.","review":"I grew up with these songs, and I wanted my daughters to hear them as well.

I guess the marketers put a few songs like that on each disc of this collection, and hope we'll buy a bunch of discs for one or two songs.

Some of the songs (e.g., \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" by the Murmaids) are widely available on other, better collections. Check the track list before you buy to see if there are tracks you must have that aren't on a CD you already own.Sound quality is good enough, but, for whatever reason, most of these tracks sound like stereo (or in some cases, mono) versions of the original AM radio mixes.

The relationships between the characters are really deep and realistic too.My only complaint is that it drags out a little toward the end and gets a bit serious for an episode or two.

Basically one single night of so-called passion (with oddly placed flashbacks in the middle of torrid sex scenes), then the two profess their love for each other several orgasms later. Denny has no self confidence - we are told this over and over and over and... it just got old. No real romance, unintentionally funny dialog, and after awhile, the sex just gets tedious and boring.I have found that Ellora's Cave novels are a hit or a miss for me. This one falls way short of expectations, and at over $11 (or over $100 on the Ammy Marketplace), a huge waste of money.

This is a title that will satisfy the adventurous seasoned reader of \\"romantica\\", and will allow newcomers to the erotic genre to see how the old style romance novel can be ramped up and join the big dogs in erotica! I also like the fact that the heroine is not tall and a size zero! What a relief to read about someone who has a real world figure! I really want her to complete this story arc by writing a story for Jonah, as well as the other possibilities she mentions on the flyleaf; that would make for a wonderful series. Soon I hope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanctification","review":"This book gives good insight on living the holy sanctified life.

I would recommend this book to anyone who has the desire to be pure in heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"youth, crisis, friendship, and love","review":"This is a wonderful indie film that brought tears to my eyes. A man who is a mystery to his family comes to them with a revelation, a story of how he came to be an American in Paris. The story then cuts back to his early adolescence, when a series of events unfolded that abruptly changed his destiny.His mother, grieving for his dead father, is unable to overcome the weight of her life. The boy is supportive, but also rebellious, taking on some hilariously unusual friends in Manhattan. Only after a terrible crisis does he decide to leave everyone behind. It is an extremely sensitive portrayal of a survivor - leaving home at 13 to go to Paris - who reveals his true self for the first time about 20 years later. The best part, in many ways, is his return to Manhattan with his family, to seek out his old friends and show them what he has become.I loved this film. It is realistic and beautifully acted and directed. Warmly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour de Force","review":"This is a fantastic survey of the problems (and joys) of writing histories of the ancient Near East. This book rewards both novices and scholars in the field! The author is obviously familiar with the most up to date scholarship in Assyriology. The treatment of issues relating to intellectual history and the role of women in antiquity are expecially satisfying. Accessible and brief, the editors of the series are to be commended for inlcuding this treatment of the cuneiform world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book for any ancient historian. The author does a thorough survey of the methodology of ancient history and the nature of history itself.

You don't have to be an Assyriologist to appreciate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit old and stinky","review":"I've used this product before, but that was when I bought it from an outdoor retail store. They worked great then. The 12 pack I bought from Amazon, however, may have been old or something. The warmers smell really strange, kind of like fish, and they don't seem to get as warm as the ones I used before. My guess is that they expire after a while, and that these are just too old.

I use the 3/4 on a daily basis and, though it does need a bit of sharpening at the moment, it has held up pretty well in a variety of applications. It's busted through nails and screws, pried it's share of OSB into place, found use as a scraper (to clear dirt and debris from the top of a footing, inside a wall). Oh, and if a stud needs shortening to get the new plate in, it's been known to be used as a chisel.Long story short(er): If the 1/2 and 1\\" (either of which I have yet to use) are as good as the 3/4, then this set is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is so HOT...","review":"I keep it in the Freezer so it doesn't melt the rest of my Cd's.All kidding aside:This latest release finds Michael Sweet Jaywalking between the intersection of hard hitting Melodic Rock and Eclectic sounding Pop Rock.

This is Michael's best solo album. His first solo record stepped away from the Stryper sound and went more pop/rock. His second continued down that path with a few twists. With Truth, you can tell he starts to branch out! He does the pop/rock then goes heavy. Vocally he does things he's never done on any record. I remember reading a review of Stryper's new record 'Reborn' and the reviewer thought that Stryper's new sound came out of nowhere. He thought it would have been better to hear Stryper's progression through a few albums. I think Michael's solo works are a great progression into Stryper's new record. This is another good album to add to your music collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"different release with different songs","review":"This album has some songs from the other truth release but has some songs not on that release either.

But Sweet's recording of \\"Truth\\" is a gem among gems. If this really is the album Michael Sweet had always wanted to make, it was worth the wait. It is a tribute to him that he could produce such a brilliant work. Musically, some sounds on the harder rockin songs conjure images of Alice in Chains (such as in \\"Save Me\\"), and even a Queensryche style sound on \\"Trust.\\" What Sweet ends up with is a hard hitting album full of solid tunes to appease all kinds of music enthusiasts.

Ludlum is at his globe hopping best here, trekking through Scandinavia, Russia, France, Italy, the US, and Corsica. There is a love interest for Scofield that is handled fairly well, and there is SO MUCH action that it serves to break up the gunfights and beatings.

The ratcheting action, assuming that the racheting works at all and doesn't keep slipping, is so weak as to barely extrude the dough through the disc. I had to keep peeling half-made cookies off the bottom of the press and feeding the dough back through again. I am not kidding when I say that my arm was sore for 2 days afterward from struggling with this thing to make a single batch of spritz. It went into the trash as soon as the last cookie was agonizingly pressed out onto the cookie sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a better product from Wilton","review":"When I bought this cookie press I expected it to last a long time. It has lasted 3 years and the last two have been a fight to get it to work correctly. I have been making pressed cookies for 35 years and have never had so much trouble with a cookie press.

The single arm would sometimes flip over the rod that ratchets down to press dough, once filled it cannot be flipped back over the now extended rod. This tool has to be filled from the bottom, so you have to remove the pattern and it's holder to fill, there is no flat area or air escape on top, so you cannot rap it against the counter to seat the dough easily. You need your second hand to steady the other end, because once you start pressing this thing wants to kick out. Three out of four cookies didn't turn out well, and I was using a recipe and pattern that was identical to one I have been using for decades. I have used a caulking gun-style press for years but the plastic parts do get fatigued and crack, and was hoping this more solid model would last longer, I loved the extra ring that stores all the disks and the handle folding flat for storage is a good idea in theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theoretically sound.

I, too, received this press as a gift years ago and used it three to four times, all the while encountering resistance from the barrel while trying to move the dough through the mechanism. Looks great in a photograph but is poor in actuality. The plastic casing screwed to the metal frame cracked part way. Once it splits ocmpletely, the entire set is useless. Will not buy from this company in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of dough - pun intended","review":"Doesn't work. Hurts my hand because you have to press on the top as well.

Major design flaw!","review":"I purchased this expensive cookie press thinking I was going to avoid the poor quality of other plastic models. Yes, it is made of metal, however, little did I know, the main mechanism for pumping the dough at the top of the cylinder is made of plastic - which cracked the second time I tried to use it. I expect that from a cheap $10 model, but that's completely unacceptable for such an expensive model. Next time I will make sure the press is COMPLETELY metal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for Husbands","review":"I got this for Christmas 2 years ago. I couldn't use it for a while because the instructions didn't explain that the notches need to face the front in order for it to work. I used it twice & it worked great then it started slipping. I had to make cheese wafers for a wedding this past weekend and am very glad that my husband was home because He had the strength to push out the dough and then we had to cut the wafers from the long strings of wafer. It was an awful mess and took way too long. Now the pin keeps falling out that holds the press bar in place.

This year I took over the cookie and after 45 minutes threw in the towel and this cookie press into the trash. It is not only a cheaply made product but a bad design and even when it works, the cookies are smaller than quarters. Every year my mother, sister and I get together to make cookie during an all day bake-a-thon. I'm a grown woman with children of my own, and was temted to roll on the floor kicking and screaming like a mad child told no more cookies after my time spent with the cookie press.

Looks are deceiving.","review":"I make hundreds and hundreds of spritz cookies every Christmas. Each year, I am always looking for a new press because the previous one has failed...and always in the middle of baking. I did manage to find a plastic one a few years ago - made in Europe and equipped with two dough tubes that makes a good backup. I will often bring that press out to complete the spritz cookies... but it cannot be used on a constant basis. Dont know why. This Wilton model is stainless steel and seems to be well constructed. The press mechanism begins to slip causing the dough to back up. A real nuisance! You have to use a cool cookie sheet in order for the dough to adhere to once it's pressed.Cleaning it is time consuming. The whole thing must be taken apart. The nice thing about this model is that the die plates store in it own cap which screw onto the press for storage.Not using it this year. Going to try a more expensive European model this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this cookie press to make my favorite Christmas cookies-Spritz. I got the dough into the gun, squeezed the handle, kept squeezing the handle, and nothing. The mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping, and hence, no cookies. It was very frustrating, having everything ready to make the cookies, but with no way to properly form them. I would not recommend this cookie press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy returning useless products? This is for you...","review":"My old cookie press was my mother's and it was the old aluminum tube with a handle you had to turn manually to press out the dough. Remembering how she fussed and fumed with that, I thought buying a cookie press with the Wilton name would be a sure thing. Wrong! After I got one sheet of cookies out, the crank thingy quit pressing the dough down. I asked my husband to take a look at it since he's the fixer-of-all-things and even he couldn't get the thing to work. I returned it. Don't waste the time, money or effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I make hundreds of cookie batches every Christmas. Needless to say, my cookie presses never last.

Although she believes in what they are saying, she is torn because her brother Patrick (read the Journal of Patrick Flaherty also) is serving in Vietnam. Throughout the book, you'll encounter her thoughts about her rights and her country, which so many teens ask today. I feel this book was the most mature out of all of the Dear America. It centered more on social issues and two sides than others. All in all, The Diary of Molly Flaherty is a win-win for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The dairy of Molly Mackenzine Flaherty","review":"This, was a great book! You feel like its your brother over in Veitnam, not hers. It's not very discriptive, it leaves a lot open for your imagination. Some people's opinions about women at the time were ludicris!

This is great for leaving something attached, but not so great for quick changes because of the size of the large flower.Also, the snap does not attach securely to our stroller. We have a Maclaren Techno, and usually I attach clips to the rolled edging and they stay put, but this one does not open wide enough to attach to the edging. That being said, it does clip to clothing more securely than most of the other clips we own.

Both guns have depth-of-drive wheels which are simple and accurate. And the fastener range (5/8 to 1-1/4 inch for the BN125, 3/4 to 2-1/2 inches for the FN250) should handle almost any job you have.

I highly recommend this combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"I bought this kit since it seemed to be a good deal on all the air tools I needed for finish nailing (except a pin nailer). No complaints about the guns, but the compressor didn't work from day one, even though I followed PC's \\"break-in\\" instructions; there seemed to be a leak somewhere internally, as it never got past about 50 psi. I called PC's customer service number repeatedly over a three day period and spent hours upon hours on hold with the call never being picked up. In the end, I trashed the compressor and bought another brand, figuring that I still got a pretty decent deal on the guns.Given that experience I will never buy another Porter Cable product again and recommend looking into customer service on any brand of tool you buy - a tool that doesn't work and won't get fixed/replaced is never a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this kit for what I do","review":"This is the second compressor I have owned. I love the portability, and love the feel of the grips on the nailers. The guns so far have not jammed or missed fired, and I have been useing them to nail the trim work I am replacing in my home.

Even the finish nailer with 2 1/2\\" nails counter sink with no problem when nailing the window sills in, and I am installing 1 1/4\\" sills made of white ash that I made in my shop!For the money, I have no complaints.

I bought these same tools several years ago and have used them extensively. They are great and have lasted through hundreds of hours of work. When you get yours look in the literature for the nearest repair center and order some replacement rubber noses for the guns. I've worn out lots of them. When they get scarred, and they will, replace it and you won't mar your finish work. They cost $2 - $3 apiece I believe and are worth not marring a piece of $100+ Oak or Walnut. Always predrive a finish nail in scrap to make sure you are setting the nail properly. Especially in hardwood. Buy this combo if you do any finish work or detailed wood working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and performance!","review":"You can't go wrong with this combo. Inexpensive with great performance and the Porter-Cable name to boot. Works great with the included brad/finish-nailers and the compressor has plenty of power to work with other larger nailers (although not for continuous repetitive nailing). The compressor is also lighter and more portable than I thought that it would be. The brad and finish nailers are well worth the money (even not discounted in the combo).I do not hesitate to endorse this combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought it long ago!!","review":"WAY COOL!

Was satisfied with nailers performance but was confused because of compressor running nonstop then dumping air tank constantly. After inspection of compressor and review of parts schematic, I realized there was no pressure switch. Let me give you some background. A pressure switch is placed in air circuit to cut power to compressor when a predetermined air pressure is reached. If switch fails to perform this task the safety valve will release air in tank to prevent over-pressurization.Compressor can function with only a safety valve, but not very efficiently. According to manual there is a pressure switch kit that can be purchased at an additional cost but I have not been able to locate one anywhere.As I said previously, it can work and I do still use it.

In my time off I have used this little dynamo to jump in with our framers and trim carpenters to help construct our new addition. The carpenters have even said that this compressor seems to be outperforming their $700 DeWalt. I still haven't gotten the promised stapler via rebate (going on 2-1/2 months) but I haven't quite given up hope.All in all, I can't sing the praises of this combo enough.

Among many other things, my main problem was Richard Collier's characterization in the book: he comes across as a pathetic wimp--it is difficult to fathom why Elise would have been interested in him. Also, the screenplay certainly doesn't suffer from the omission of Richard's cancer as a plot element--there is a plausible explanation for his escape to Michigan (writer's block), and it makes his death all the more poignant because it is only of a broken heart, not a tumor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL STORY!","review":"I did not know until after I had read the book that this was the premise for the movie Somewhere in Time.

While wandering the halls of the hotel he sees a picture of a beautiful woman and his life is never the same.This book delves into the inner turmoils of love and the lengths one will go to find that love, a love that goes beyond space and time.This is a book that I will never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, read Finney instead!","review":"Okay, I haven't read Bid Time Return, so my rating means nothing.

In conclusion, if your a Dominique Swain fan, it's worth watching. I know that Keri Lynn Pratt has a little bit of a following. Busy Phillipps hasn't done to much (Dawson's Creek, Freaks and Geeks).

The expansion of the storyline is to me a collosal waste of time, it's about the audtion. Produstion numbers should have been lengthened not shortened and then the new numbers would have been ok.The only bright spot in this entire movie Allyson Reed in the role of Cassie.Since this is the only opportunity for most folks to see a least a pseudo-version of the musical, it's not really an option not to see it at least once.

Some people may think that a bunch of people trying out for a Chorus Line may not be such a great plot, but this movie pulls it off with such style and charm you immediately love it! The musical numbers are great! The dancing is ... undescribable! It is truly one of the best examples I've seen of transferring a musical to video.

I've never seen the Broadway show or any other staging of it, so I thought the movie might give me a sneak peek. Well, somewhat disappointed here. I can only assume that the stage version, with its long-running reputation, must be better than this film. It's not that the film is a total debacle, but it's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable.

The song \\"what I did for love\\" was not sung by Cassie but by one of the girls after one of the dancers is injured, and Zack asks them how they feel. The song is about love of dancing, not for the love of 2 people.

An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade.

It's terrible. The genre was on it's last leg, and this movie put the final nail in the coffin. After \\"A Chorus Line\\" the movie, the only musicals you saw on screen were made for television. The soundtrack replaced the musical. But this was the first musical I ever saw and it did introduce me musicals, so I have to give it credit for that. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to look back on it today and reflect on how terrible the movie is compared to the countless other movie and theatrical musicals I've seen. The music is wonderful but that had nothing to do with the filmmakers, so they can't get credit for that. Since the music is so great I would suggest you buy the original cast recording from Broadway, and wait until it comes to your city. If you feel the need see the movie, rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible Film Adaptation...","review":"I watched this in theater class years ago, and even without knowing how completely botched this film was from its original source, it grated on my nerves. Actually, the Cassie/Zach stuff grated. It should have been kept in the background like it was in the original production.The other numbers were okay, which is why I gave it two stars, but making this a romantic love story, as opposed to one about the love of art, really cheapens the film. Such a shame, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Forget the fact that it is so completely off base with the musical, it just sucks as a movie. If you're going to make a movie based on a musical, how about hiring people who can sing?

They have butched so many famous books, where would you begin to name them. With the Exception of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" which follows the book,at least the movie is GREAT.For instance take \\"Midnight In The Garden of Evil\\" A book, you can't put down. It actually put Savannah on the must see attraction of the 1990's.Clint Eastwood took the book and just absolutely destroyed the plot the characters, you name it and he killed them all.When I saw the movie I couldnt believe how far he had left the storyline some where on the out skirts of Savannah.Outside of Kevin Spacey no one character resemebled the books characters...To put a Jude Law as a male husler was laughable. He was too thin ....hell, he didnt even look Like Jude Law looks today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"Really enjoyed this film.

Loved this show on stage and love it on film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's No Chicago!","review":"If you've never seen A Chorus Line do yourself a favor and try to catch it when it invariably tours around the country. What you'll see is an innovative, (particularly for the time when it was conceived) edgy show. Unfortunately little to none of that \\"edge\\" or energy translates to this lackluster, useless film. Michael Douglas' role, which in the stage version could arguably be reduced to nothing more than a voice on the theater's sound system, is here nonsensically heightened, tragically altering the major thrust of the stage show. What is supposed to be a peek into the motivations, loves and fears of otherwise \\"faceless\\" Broadway talent is turned into a star vehicle for a woefully miscast star.Bottom line: find a touring company of the stage show to experience this story. What's featured in the film is a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I've seen A Chorus Line twice on stage. I bought a copy of this DVD at a budget price, watched it once and even going into it with low expectations, I was disppointed. Anyone who has only seen this movie version and not the stage version will probably wonder how this play could have won the Pulitzer prize and the Tony award. As others have mentioned, the rather weak sub-plot of Cassie and her past love affair with the director gets pushed to the forefront in the movie, while many of the great songs from the stage production are either cut entirely or presented in truncated fragments. I think this movie is one of the worst stage to screen adaptations ever put to film. Just listening to the original cast album will give you a better idea of what this play is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a stage production","review":"I was fortunate enough to perform in the stage production of \\"A Chorus Line\\" back in the day, and we were all really excited when the Movie was finally coming out...until we saw it.This film misses on virtually every count, not capturing anything that made the musical special and unique. Has-been choreographer of the moment Hornaday practically destroyed any style this film could've had, and the casting of talentless \\"names\\" like Judy the Bimbo from \\"Dallas\\" only made things even more hideous.Michael Bennett, the original creator of \\"Chorus Line\\" felt that there was no way it could adequately be made into a film...it looks like he was right.

The dancing is terrific and it also has a tender love story that unfolds through out the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"One of the most spectacular shows in Broadway history makes a total bomb as a movie. Part of it is that this musical wasn't really meant for the movie, but part of it is band directing and bad acting. There is too much focus on Michael Douglas as Zach (in the original show Zach is heard speaking from a microphone, usually from the theatre's sound booth, and is only seen a few times) which takes the glory away from the dancers. Among the dancers, the focus is further taken away from the group as a whole and the spotlight thrown on Cassie, especially when she sings \\"What I did for love\\", a song more meaningfully done by Diana on stage. In addition, the omission of the songs \\"The Music and the Mirror\\" and \\"Montage\\" are incredibly disappointing, most especially since the songs they are replaced with are just horrible. Do not buy this video, wait until a local theater does it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"Extremely uninspired film adaptation of the entertaining but largely plotless stage success about dancers auditioning for a place in the chorus line. Music is much the same, but the energy is zero and the show doesn't really translate well to film. Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some decent moments, but...","review":"If you genuinely enjoyed the original show and the real meaning behind the story, do NOT buy or rent this movie.The choreography was decent at times, and of course the score is great, but the meaning of what I consider the centerpiece number of the show, \\"What I Did for Love\\", is totally changed to a love song. This is NOT meant to be a \\"love song\\" in the traditional sense, but a song about the love of theatre and dance. And the romance between Cassie and Zach is not suppose to be the focal point of the show.They would have been far better off to have simply video taped the show on stage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT movie for all theatre fans!","review":"This movie is as good as they get! The dancing and the singing are outrageous, although I wish they would have stuck to the original script more, I still love this movie. I performed in this show a year ago, and it really is my life.

The movie has pleasant and beautiful animation (bright colors, soft lines). The characters (and their offscreen personalities) all are present and make for a fine children's film that both children will enjoy and parents can endure (I had to sit through Pokemon movies - most of them too, yuck!). For me, the best part of the film was the soundtrack. Jack Johnson's tuneful songs with catchy lyrics made the film very special. The soundtrack quickly became one of my favorite CDs. A must see film for small children.

My youngest daughter (2) loves watching Curious George that shows on PBS and it looked like a good film for both kids to enjoy (my other daugher is 4). It keeps their attention pretty well, but the voices are a bit different than the PBS version since it is an actual feature film which they don't seem to mind too much. The action and sequences keep moving and it has a cute storyline. As an adult, it is a decent film, where you will catch yourself watching it periodically but not engrossing to the point that you cannot turn away.Overall, it keeps my kids happy and entertained while portraying one of their favorite characters. Well worth the low price point and a cute movie for kids and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids movie","review":"I watch this film with my four-year-old and two-year-old daughters.

So I thought I would get this movie for him on a sick day.The story hinges on a plot that makes little sense to a preschooler, and George's antics alone are not enough to hold his attention. My son didn't even follow the most interesting aspect, which is that this was showing us how the Man With The Yellow Hat meets George in the first place. For an adult, the jokes are lame and the plot insipid. After about 30 minutes my son asked me to turn it off and we went back to watching episodes on YouTube.I really regret purchasing this. My son might be able to understand it in a few years, but the movie won't be any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"I really enjoyed this lighthearted, family-oriented film. The story doesn't really hold up much if you really think about it, but who cares! This movie made me feel good and relaxed and that's what matters!George, the monkey, is absolutely adorable. Will Ferrel, Drew Barrymore and cast are great as well. But my favorite part of the movie, besides George, is the music by Jack Johnson. He's definitely my new favorite chill-out artist!

Lifetime Curious George readers will recognize many of the story lines brought directly to life from the page. Good clean fun, and Jack Johnson's lullabies were a wonderful addition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie to watch with a little one","review":"I thought this movie was adorable! The Man in the Yellow Hat works at a museum and finds George when he went searching for an ancient treasure. We find out why the Man gets the Yellow Hat, and we follow George on his adventures in a new city. Overall, you might have a good idea of where the plot is going, but it is interesting along the way. The song from this movie (\\"Upside Down\\") is also very good, and suitable for all ages. The movie itself made me laugh and smile when I watched it in theaters...and I was a high school student who wasn't into cartoon movies anymore.I rarely watch any movie more than once, but this one I went to see twice, in theaters too.

She would ask again and again to \\"watch Georges! watch Georges!\\", but the few short clips available online weren't ultimately satisfying to her. Seeing the full-length movie for just 1.99 was justifiably irresistible, considering.Unfortunately, the film doesn't have the same feel that make the books and programs so perfect. The \\"Man in the Yellow Hat\\" is a complete grouch who encourages no real curiosity. The stupidly contrived bit to explain why he wears all yellow was grating and had zero amusement value for the little one.It just seems like so much of the feel of what makes Curious George worth the decades of devotion was thrown out to keep people of a specific demographic engaged...and not the ones the character is ostensibly intended for.At least it was cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like the TV show.","review":"Tells the origional story nicely but I thought it would be a little more like the TV show.

The Man is very negative and somewhat mean in the movie, while in the show he is super kind and doesn't get upset. In the show he cares for George and in the movie about 3/4ths of the movie is about how much he doesn't like George and doesn't want him around.

George is darling -- and if you've ever parented an especially busy \\"curious\\" toddler, this movie will pull at your heartstrings and remind you of the divine beauty in children. I especially enjoyed the use of \\"lighting effects\\" in the animation design -- they were appropriate and beautiful. The music was wonderful. Will Farrel was really good as the voice of the Man in the Yellow Hat. For me, Dick Van Dyke's warm, rich voice conjures childhoods past (with Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang).

I was able to brew two good pots of coffee but the rest were bitter and awful. Also, the burnt smell at the end of the brew really bothered me after a while (even though it's not a part of the taste).I searched online for tips, tried various grind sizes, tried double filters (on top and bottom), tried single filters, weighed my beans, weighed my ground coffee, tried three-day fresh roasted beans, measured the water amount: nothing but bitter coffee. Yuk!In the end, I sent it back. I decided there were far too many variables involved in brewing a great pot of coffee with this machine.

They cost $5 for 100, plus shipping and handling. If you use double filters as Krups suggest, that's over ten cents in filters for every pot. I called Krups customer service and even the service manager says, \\"I don't see the problem. It's not up to us to ensure the retailers carry the filters.\\" He even denied that they were unavailable, but even the Krups order dept confirmed this. Krups doesn't know how to spell customer service as far as I'm concerned.Also, water stays in the bottom with the heating element after every brew and the only way to get it out is to take a towel or napkin and wipe it out. Quite a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible purchase","review":"I'm an avid coffee drinker and after doing much research I decided to up my budget and purchase a 'top' machine. Well if this is the top of the line coffee I'd hate to think of low end coffee. The coffee doesn't taste good no matter what type I have tried...in addition the coffee maker itself is really difficult to use and a mess to clean. Do yourself a favor there is a reason most makers are not making machines that brew this way. I wish common sense would have played into my purchasing decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a great cup of coffee.......but","review":"Love the coffee. Hate the waiting time; at least 10 minutes once it gets up to temperature. What is the absolute worst: I broke the carafe. Treat your glass carafe like gold.

The manufacturer gives you some line about each carafe being specifically made for each lid. I don't believe it, and even if I did, I will not replace the carafe again if it breaks. Good coffee; not worth $100 + $43 + another $43 and so on. Rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups keeps on brewing","review":"This is an unusual coffeemaker. I have never seen another one like it.

A customer relations person at Krups, who happened to use the same coffee maker and so understood, gave us the leads to be successful. It sounded then as if Krups discontinued the Moka Brew because they are a bit more expensive than most 8 cup makers. HOWEVER, THEY REALLY DO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE; THIS IS THE BEST BREW IF YOU LIKE A ROBUST TASTE. We are so pleased that Krups has decided to bring this unit back. Yes, you can buy cheaper coffee makers, but this really is a \\"you-get-what-you-pay-for\\" situation. Great!

We begin with some silly music followed by a low quality answering machine message. The final track is about 60 seconds of buzzing (supposedly a vibrator).The sound effects are also disappointing. We are supposed to believe that the sound of scrambling eggs is actually someone gently putting lotion on someone else.The music is another flaw. Often jarring and discordant (like the clanging cow bell) the music will more likely derail a mood than it will enhance one.I am sure some people will like a track or two (I only really liked on track) but it is hardly something to be listened to straight through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty enjoyable for a laugh.","review":"Hey, it's as good as any standard ... flick.

The disc also contained a blue Cyborgasm condom and some cardboard glasses that you were supposed to wear (called \\"Eco-Glasses\\") to keep out the light while listening. It became a novelty item quickly, and I used to mix parts of it into various club tunes when I used to DJ.

Not supplied with the Kit I was told but got 30 back from Amazon who said these were not available through them. I looked on the Amazon site & bought 100 of these very necessary screws in Stainless for 11.

I had always shyed away before because of there high prices mainly. This router is a total POC for doing anything that requires any degree of precision. The run out in the collet was 0.058 with a 6\\" drill rod installed. That is 0.010 at a typical 1\\" bit height. Try to get those dovetails tight with that, next to impossible. I did find if you loosen the collet and rotate to just the right spot I could get the runout down to 0.015. AHA, the collet must be bad so I got another one and low and behold it was worse than the first. I'M done with PC forever. I'm going back to my makita routers which have 0.006 runout at 8\\" height!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Router Out There","review":"Just got my new router. I contemplated between Dewalt and Bosch at first, but then saw this porter cable router. Since porter cable has a good reputation i decided to go with it. It has many features the others didn't. Like a Spindle lock that engages when you push the base all the way down. The above the table height adjuster works great! Router was simple to mount in table. Overall this is a very heavy duty router that I would recommend for anyone. The only downside was the manual. It didnt explain things as well as some may like. But that didnt affect me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I own several routers (5) and this kit is very disappointing!What were the engineers thinking when they designed the placement and design of the On/Off switch?

Biscuit Jointer, Belt Sander, Nail Guns, etc. I wish I could say the same for this router kit!After many years of satisfied use of Porter Cable products, both professionally and as a hobbiest, it pains me to write a poor review of a Porter Cable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I expected more when I shelled out the extra dollars for the 895pk. There is a lot of backlash in the fixed base. The above table height adjustment lock is very poor. It consists of a 3/16\\" hex shaft going through a cast aluminum locking lever to operate it. The small shaft easily breaks the locking lever. When I get my new locking lever, I will not use the above table adjustments (a prime selling point as I use my 895pk in a router table 95% of the time). Also when in a table, the motor jams in the base and is very hard to unjam. When I bought my 895pk, the spindle lock actuator on one of the bases was missing. I called PC and they said they no longer use or support this feature, and no longer even sells it as a repair part. When I was ordering the replacement locking lever, guess what I found in the replacement parts listing, the spindle lock actuator. Someone was either misinformed or lied.

I tried adjusting it and got it a little better but it still has way to much play for accurate work. I can get to lock still after the plunge but on the way down its all over the place.

The unit has yet to bog down in material. The instructor and the class as a whole were impressed with the unit. When compared to other routers from DeWalt, Bosch, and (older) Porter Cable, the 890 pulled ahead in bit change, adjustment, and power. I am glad I did my research as I could not be happier with this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad product for a good name","review":"I have had the PC 893 Router for over a year. the plunge mechanism is awful, it slips, and its not reliable. The depth control in fixed base mode is awful, it binds, then releases, moving a lot more han what you want. The last straw is that the speed control has suddenly started to go from 16,500 RPM to like 5000 RPM in the middle of a cut, or it starts at 5000 RPM, and doesnt get to speed. Turn it off, and on, then it works, until it decides to slow down. Reliability isnt visible here. I am in the market for a new router, and it will NOT BE a PC brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product from a company that had a great reputation","review":"I bought this combo primarily on the strength of the PC reputation in routers. I should have listened to the people in the store where I bought it, who were trying to talk me into getting the Bosch combo instead.As others have reported, excessive lateral deflection in the plunge base, even when locked, make it essentially useless for the vast majority of woodworking applications. The plunge base is nothing less than garbage. Even my old, cheapo Royobi plunge router worked better.And yes, the amount of backlash in the fixed-base makes the fine adjustment capability unusable.Maybe those who use it for router table use mught think it is OK. But something like my Milwaukee 5625 3.5HP fixed-base router is a much better choice for table use.Avoid this model of PC router. Get the Bosch or the Dewalt instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor construction from a good company","review":"The motor clamp handle has broken twice in one year on my 895 router. The part costs $1.00. There is to much play in the height adjustment.

In short, he's everything in a man your mother ever warned you about, but worse, because he lives in an age in which there are no effective police or protective orders available.This was the first of Susan Wiggs usually excellent books I've ever encountered in which I appreciated the sentiments of Dorothy Parker in her review of Benito Mussolini's The Cardinal's Mistress, \\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly.

Thinking it's some kind of new drug the teens pass it around without a second thought. It does'nt take long before evryone begins to turn on each other. This movie gets is ridiculous at times. For one, the dogs talk in this movie. Yes they talk. They have no real purpose but to try and be funny nothing else. To make things worse the action does not pick up until the last 25 minutes or so in this film. Until then we only see shadows of killings.

It smelled terrible, just terrible. It most certainly WAS NOT what it was reported to be.I've read numerous product reviews on Amazon with claims that the perfumes were fake. I always dismissed these, assuming that people did not know what they were talking about. However, I can assure you that Amazon is selling either fake perfumes or bad perfumes, and this is not the first time that I received a bad item from Amazon. Clearly, something is wrong with the suppliers that they use.My strong advice is to refuse to accept any open box item or any item that does not smell as it should from Amazon. If necessary, order a $1-$3 sample from one of the perfume vendors to compare. For me, moving forward any beauty item that I receive is under the microscope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Realm","review":"I have worn it for years.

I was an officer in a parachute infantry battalion, and I always looked forward to the latest installment of Warrior Murphy. In those days, almost all the strips had Murphy serving in an airborne unit. Mark Baker's humorous swipes at airborne operations always had me chuckling and saying, \\"How true, how true!\\" I never saw a situation in a Murphy cartoon strip that I had not encountered myself somewhere at one time or another! Granted, some situations weren't funny at the moment, but with all military humor, they are hilarious in retrospect, as depicted by Mark. I honestly don't think that a civilian can truly get the greatest appreciation for Mark Baker's wonderful humor; like the old saying goes, \\"Ya had to have been there!\\" Note the number of five-star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this isn't their best","review":"I picked this album up after hearing about this band from a friend. He described it as a viking themed death metal band. Well, that's the last time I listen to his recommendations. This is an average at best death metal release. \\"The One Insane\\" and \\"Execute Them All\\" are fun songs, but the album as a whole isn't worth your money. It's not really brutal or interesting in any way, and the vocals are some of the worst death vocals out there. The band's cover of \\"Breaking the Law\\" is a joke at best. I gave it two stars because it's at least tolerable to listen to.

Since the \\"Monster\\" version of this cable is over $90.00 I guess this is another case of getting what you pay for.

I purchased this book in hopes of finding answers to the most common questions thay may arise when you visit the Mullica - i.e. What is the history with the abandoned house at the end of the river? or Who designed the Cuts? I didn't find these answers, rendering the book almost useless to me. It was full of chatter about people that really had very little to do with the Mullica River at all! There were a few useful sections about the British running the river ages ago, but still found the book to be difficult reading. The book was copyrighted originally in 1945, so don't plan on seeing recent history in the book (or propper grammer for that matter). It was REVISED (one page to be exact) in 1963.Worth the money? Not for me. It now sits on a bookshelf collecting dust. Perhaps at my tag sale next year.Rob Blanda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Collection ?","review":"Yes, another Pogues collection. But this one includes their live set from their 2001 reunion. The first disc is a collection of most of their most well knows tunes, no real lost gems or anything. Still makes for a great listen, coincidentally this was released just a few weeks before St. Paddy's day. And also to capitalize on their recent reunion in Dec. 04. As of today they're apparently regrouping to play soem shows in Japan too, so this could the first of a few new release from the awesome band.The second disc is a great live show from 2001. Great energy and excellent sound make this a must for anybody. Shane Macgowans voice isn't a soulful as it once was, but he still puts out 100%, even though any between song banter is a little hard to decipher. The band are in great form though, and I think/hope they will be putting out soem new material in the next few months. 4 starts just because there's nothing new here.So, crack open a Guinness and turn this mofo up.Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darger legacy treated shamefully.","review":"This version of the story of Darger omits or skims over some crucial details, eg; his fascination with whirlwinds, his conviction that he had been transported by one as a child. The unnecessary animations of the paintings is cheap and annoying as are the silly deep voices. His landlords were money grubbing exploiters of his legacy, selling 1/3, keeping a 1/3 and giving only a third to the American Folk art museum.

The combination of interviews with those who knew Darger, the narration by actress Dakota Fanning as the Vivian girls and the animations of Darger's drawings/collages provided insight into Henry Darger's mind and creative motivations.Most videos about artists bore me because they are too reverent and put the artist on a pedestal unattainable by us mere mortals. Almost invariably some art historian or curator will attempt a too facile linear connection between the artist's inner creative life and the outward events/experiences of that life.This is one of the best films about an artist I've ever seen.

I expected this CD to be like other live techno CDs I own, that is to say I expected to hear the crowd and really be able to feel as if I were at the concert. This is not the case, which is unfortunate. Live in Ibiza is a recording of the songs played, and then mixed together into a seamless progression. It is seriously hard to tell where one song begins and one ends, the mixing is without flaw. The two CDs have songs from such artists as Orbital, Sander Kleinenberg, BT, Bluefish, Junkie XL and more. For sheer listening value this box set is fantastic, but do not expect to feel as if you are at a concert when listening to it.

My son gets very frustrated trying to get him in (the space is a little small for such a long person and requires more dexterity than most 3 year olds would have) and then once he is in he doesn't stay put.- The durability is generally ok (the vehicle has stood up to some tosses when my son got frustrated (see above)) but the workmanship was not what I would have expected from plan toys (or from the price).

The problem with both units of the 505A-12 was that they were not even close to being true with their own calibration marks. I believe that 2 degrees or more are definitely out of spec for any measuring device, especially one that carries the Starrett brand name. I almost think that this type of accuracy would even be out of line for items coming from Harbor Freight!

Total garbage that will be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scale Is Off","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. I purchased this tool because of the Starett name and was deeply disappointed. The scale was definitely off. When you completely fold up the tool it is blatantly obvious. I e-mailed Starett and they said to return it to them for a replacement. I was not too confident that the new one would be any better. Starrett also stated they were changing the name of the tool to remove the word \\"protractor\\" because they had received so many complaints. In my case, I simply printed a \\"red\\" arrow on some sticky label paper and then cut it out and overlayed the decal on the tool. It's not pretty but the scale now reads accurately. I would not recommend buying this until this defect is corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Concept Requires Accurate Execution","review":"The protractor I recieved was out at least 1/2 a degree, closer to a full degree. I went as far as to send it back to Starrett for repair. I got it back unchanged with no explanation, needless to say I was shocked! In reading other reviews I'm glad to see that some folks have recieved protractors with the decal placed correctly on the tool. It would appear Starrett feels that a degree here or there is acceptable for woodworkers. Maybe it is just the price, I don't intend to spend $300.00 + for their 24\\" builder's square to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poor execution","review":"As a professional carpenter I thought ProSite Protractor would help me quickly determine exact single and miter cut angles. While the concept of this tool is right on I found the one I received unusable as the scale was off. A straight cut reading from the protractor of 90 degrees for example, would also show a reading of 46 or 47 degrees for the miter cuts. What? A miter for 90 degrees is 45. So this is unusable as duh...a miter cut even a degree off is unacceptable even in the worst of times.Needless to say, I returned this item and at least for now will return to my bevel gauge and trial and error but I hold out hope, that somewhere out there, in some distant enchanted land, a tool of this sort will shine in perfection and allow me the opportunity to make my job easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Starret I Am Used To","review":"Just got my new 505A Protractor. With a name like Starrett, and the $50 advertised price, I figured I could not go wrong. Well I did. This is a great tool but not too well built. Oh it is heavy enough, but for the money 90 degrees should be just that, not 89.5 or 90.5 and yes, all the other angles are off by a half degree too. I have cheap plastic protractors that are dead on. There is no excuse for shipping these things if they are not dead on correct. I paid for a quality protractor and got an expensive T-bevel. Shame on you Starrett!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Protractor","review":"The protractor is good for some things. The scale is way too small for much of any type work!

I will be looking at a digital protractor next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough for Woodworking","review":"Starrett's legendary name speaks for itself and the design is rugged and novel, but this unit is not accurate enough for woodworking or setup of shop tools -- especially miter saws. The protractor's primary and miter indicators show up to a degree of difference even at square (half of 90 is not 46), and if set to 90, it will not be close to the accuracy of a framing square. It's fast for reading framing and finish carpentry angles on jobsites, but not accurate enough for tool setup tasks or precise woodworking cuts- good within it's lane, but stick to squares for critical setups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is disappointing that Starrett, the icon of precision, put it's name on such a poorly made unit.The glue-on decals intended for angle measurement are both mis-aligned and mis-printed, making the tool unusable. If a pointer is aligned to a particular degree marking, the rest of the markings around the compass do not line up with their mates, and miss by as much as 1 degree. Note that 1 degree of measurement error will result in a 1/32\\" gap in 2\\" wide moulding.Consumers who buy based on the Starrett reputation are deserving of more. It is interesting to note that while the device proudly displays a US Patent number, \\"Made in USA\\" is nowhere to be found.I bought protractors made by both Bosch & Grizzly and will give this Starrett unit to my grandchild to use as a toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starrett 505A-ProSite 12-Inch Dial Protractor , Returned.","review":"This Starrett tool was not accurate.

This unit is not accurate. I have been through two, and have checked two more from guys on my crew. The dial is off by anywhere between 1/2 to 1 degree on all 4 (with their own calibration marks!).

Here's an alternative.","review":"[...], I found this plane to be just dandy for occasional surface planing, but a bit small for my big mitts.For comparison, I have also used the similar, but larger, Veritas Razor Blade Block Plane # 19P1600 ($21). It is a little bigger (2\\"W x 5\\"L x 2\\"H) than the Stanley (1\\"W x 3.25\\"L x 1\\"H), uses replaceable Rc60 razor blades ($2/pkg.), and, with three different blade positions, is a bit more versatile. Personally, I prefer the larger size & versatility of the Veritas model, but it is not as easy to tuck in your pocket as the Stanley.FYI the razor blade in the Veritas plane can be installed in one of three different positions: (1) at mid-body for surface planing, like the Stanley; (2) at the toe for flush trimming or for use as a knife; and (3) at the heel for smoothing/scraping concave surfaces in thin material.Unfortunately the Razor Blade Plane isn't available at Amazon, but can be seen at Lee Valley Veritas:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but works well","review":"This is great for shaving off a bit of wood.

Because I did not want to have to rehang the door, I worked on a ladder. It took awhile to get the height where I wanted it (took off almost 1/4\\"), but it did the job and the blade stayed sharp. I would recommend it for smaller jobs, though. It would be great for small woodworking projects and crafts. It is surprisingly small--you can close your hand around it. It may be difficult to keep a grip on if you have large hands. It does seem slightly overpriced, considering the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone's saying the low reviews aren't helpful, but after getting this I don't get the high ones either...","review":"Everyone's saying the low reviews for this item aren't helpful, but after receiving it I also have no idea what good this item could be for.I have yet to find one thing you can actually \\"plane\\" with this item. It's basically just a firm razor set at a pretty aggressive angle. On a hard surface, how can you possibly get enough force behind something this small to get any sort of functionality you'd expect out of a plane? Is this designed for balsa wood or something?Have tried both MDF and solid wood with this and in every case the plane either was totally unable to move forward or marred what I was working on with blade marks. I have tried a variety of adjustments on the blade with not additional success.Hate to say it but unless I am just missing some key on how to use this item, I fail to see any usefulness for it whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, doesn't work.","review":"This trimming plane is tiny, and it doesn't work at all.

I was fairly satistified with it, but my minor dental problems were not getting much better. About six months ago this toothbrush finally failed and I decided to try a Sonicare Elite - 5 times more expensive. Wow! What a difference. I just got back from the dentist and, in every measurable way, the Sonicare did a better job. This ain't a bad toothbrush, but it's not substantially better than a manual jobber.

On my last dental check-up and cleaning, the hygenist inquired as to what I'd been doing differently as my gums were in such good shape. The difference was the toothbrush. The three minute timer is a great feature and keeps me \\"honest\\". Another good feature is the comparatively low price of replacement heads. I would have given the product 5 stars if I was able to buy replacement brushes locally. There is no store in my local area which carries them, so I have to plan ahead a bit, but the toothbrush is worth the small extra effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultrasonex SB300U Rechargeable Toothbrush","review":"The Ultrasonex SB300U Rechargeable Toothbrush is the best I ever had.Unlike most reviewers, I had it for over 3 years AND I own bothSoniCare and Braun toothbrushes, each in almost all versions[I have been using electric toothbrushes for about 30 years].Nothing beats the Ultrasonex SB300U Rechargeable Toothbrush.I use it together with the Braun mouth irrigator [I own at least 5 of thosetoo but the Braun is the best]. BTW, I found that most dentistsknow nothing about electric tooth brushes and irrigators except whattheir salespeople tell them. So it is pretty stupid when a reviewer refersto a dentist. BTW, this is the 1st review I ever wrote for Amazon.Paul Nevai [I am just a tremendously satisfied customer]N.B. For the best effectiveness, just brush with it as if it were a regular toothbrush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliability only problem, but Amazon replaces free!","review":"These are great toothbrushes, especially for the massage they provide the gums. Staying on for 3 minutes (unless manually turned off) to \\"keep you honest\\" is a nice touch; 3 minutes seems like forever to me when I'm brushing my teeth.The only problem I had was that of the two I bought, my girlfriend's started malfunctioning after only a few uses. It still charges but the switch only turns it on intermittently. Fortunately it failed early, so Amazon's already arranged to replace it.Note to the Nov. 26th reviewer: if you got this at Amazon recently, return it!

We (my wife and I) never dropped it nor did we treat it in any way differently than we treated the other one. Occasionally it will work for a couple of seconds but is normally unresponsive and has become a $20 run of the mill toothbrush. The other one works great and is a pleasure to have and to use even though we now have to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget all the goopy teeth whiteners and get this!!!!","review":"This is GREAT! After two weeks of use I noticed a dramatic difference in the whiteness of my smile. I see my dentist every 6 months for a cleaning and she even asked me I'd just had a cleaning as my teeth were really clean and the normal placque she would see wasnt there. I've also noticed that my mouth feels fresher longer. I absolutly love the base recharger for this too. Its really small and is tucked away on the corner of my sink. The actual bottom of the tooth brush has no visible connectors to charge it...i guess it charges through the case! My mom also started using this product. She said her gums were really sensitive to it at first but that her gums got used to it after a week or two and they are even healthier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This toothbrush has stopped working within 8 months of my purchase. It was good while it worked, but with a life this short, its not worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as Sonicare for a fraction of the cost","review":"Vibrating toothbrushes are essentially very simple products. It's amazing that advertisers have figured out a way to get people to pay so much for the Sonicare (and to a lesser extent the Braun). I've used the Sonicare Advance (haven't tried the Elite). The Ultrasonex seems just as good, and battery life seemes even better. (Be sure to charge the unit according to instructions for maximum battery life). Also, the replacement heads are very affordably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Yes I did notice a difference in my gums. However after about 2 months it died.

Also, it vibrates so much that it makes me a little dizzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I am very happy with this, have had no problems since I bought it almost a year ago. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't just go buy replacement brushes at the store and they cost almost as much as the toothbrush itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price good but psuedo sonic care.","review":"I've gotten this and I've got a sonic care. The sonic care head actually moves so the bristles are actually moving. Putting your tongue on the bristles, you will feel the brush head moving along with whatever sonic pulse is moving down at you.What is not clear is that these Ultrasonex the handle vibrates. Yes.. you feel a vibration but for cleaning you must brush like a regular brush rather than gliding it along like the sonic care.For the price it is a low end sonic toothbrush but in comparison to a lot of toothbrushes, ironically a rotating brush head without sonic beat them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toothbrush, be careful with the battery","review":"The $20 Ultrasonex is perfect and it's easy to fix that \\"reliability\\" problem (the sole complaint). The toothbrush uses non-replaceable NiCad batteries which are prone to memory issues. To significantly boost the life of the battery only charge the toothbrush every 3-4 days (something I learned from another Amazon user review), and discharge the battery completely every two weeks (keep turning it on until it dies) - you'll get at least a year out of it which is fine for $20. If you want it to last forever, discharge it before every recharge.AND if you're ordering replacement brushes get the \\"Ultrasonex BH03A 3-Pack Compact Brush Heads\\", those are the ones it came with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price, but it packs a punch","review":"This is a great brush for someone who likes to really feel it when brushing they're teeth. It has a pretty strong vibrating action that may be too much for some, but I have to say that after using it for a week, I saw a noticeable reduction in the staining that was on my teeth. That in itself impressed me enough to write this review. Auto shutoff is a nice feature and it seems pretty sturdy to me, the only caveat I have is that you need to be careful when moving the brush around in your mouth. Because the brush is so strong, if you hit your teeth the wrong way when moving the brush, you can get a pretty good jolt.Overall though, this brush can't be beat at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a try","review":"I bought this product because of its price and the reviews I read on Amazon.com (thanks for sharing). I had been looking for similar products for some time before I made this purchase, and this one is the most economical, so I gave it a try. The first time I used it; it's kind of shocking because I was not used to such a powerful toothbrush. I was brushing my teeth while the toothbrush was doing the same thing. It actually hurt a little bit because I was \\"working too hard.\\" I later on realized that I just need to move the toothbrush lightly and let the toothbrush does the work. After that, I can't complain any about this product except for the traveling case which is not very \\"attractive,\\" but it does serve the function. This toothbrush is definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...","review":"This was a nice cheap toothbrush.

I thought it was very well written and I'll look forward to more writings by this new, talented author. The way she took us into the lives of the destruction of mental illness and a family's inability to deal with it made you feel as if you were there - part of everything that happened.Without giving anything away, I also thought the story was sad because the character who suffered from mental illness was at most times unreachable by those who loved her and she didn't know how to let them help - so it was like sitting and watching your house burn down without being able to do anything about it.I recommend this book to everyone who loves to read.

It is my first time working with such a tool, but it has helped enormously. The blade depth is easy to adjust, and replacing the blade seems fairly simple.However, the blade that came with the plane tends to snag on the wood I am working with. Because this is the first time I have used a plane I cannot tell if this problem is due to my lack of experience, which it may be, or a problem with the product. Also, it would help if the plane had a rubberized heel so that when you use the tool it's a little softer on the palm of your hand. I feel like I have bruises on both of my palms due to the blade snagging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as it should","review":"Nothing out of the ordinary with this but it gets 4 stars as the blade can be a somewhat tedious to get straight.

It does this fantastically...And much more than it was ever made to do.I recently found a sawmill that sells rough white oak for $2 a boardfoot. Nifty price, big pain, as I have no large hand plane or electric planer. I picked up 50 bdft in widths of around 24\\".I planed all 50 feet using this little plane. Took some time (about 30 hours with tons of sweat and some very sore hands), but with the proper edge on the blade, I didn't even need to sand the wood after building. It was all done. ;)To get the perfect edge to make this tiny plane a perfect finishing machine (throw away your power sanders!), visit http://www.shavings.net/SCARY.HTM.As for construction of this plane...It's solid.

The album is overall very consistent and doesn't deviate much from begining to end and I like that kind of tempo in an album. As far as the production goes don't blame the producers/mixers for your lack of adjusting the equalizer or controls on your own stereo. Just lacks a bit of bass but the drumming is outstanding with catchy solo bursts on guitar and drums.I would not consider this group hardcore since I've listened to hardcore and it is in the likes of the company Renegade Hardware. Hardcore to me is hard crush techno."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot Can Be Said.","review":"If you ask anyone about \\"Lookinglasself\\" by Snapcase, chances are you will get 1 of 2 possible answers. Either someone will say, \\"It was a dissapointment, not up to Snapcases later standards\\" or they will say, \\"This is the real Snapcase, what they are all about\\". Truthfully, I say a little of each answer can be used. While it is not as fast and fueled as later albums, \\"Lookinglasself\\" does have songs with great lyrics, and don't for a second think that the songs arent heavy or hardcore. The quality is bad, but most reviews exaggerate, because the only real downpoint is that somtimes you can't hear the vocalist voice. But you must remember somthing about \\"Lookinglasself\\", it was Snapcase first. Within the period of 7 years that Snapcase has been around, they are going to change. All bands have to find their sound and come into their own, and Snapcase was still young when this came out. But the first tracks, \\"Filter\\" and \\"Deceived\\" really rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"This is a great album snapcase is one of the best hardcore bands out there, but the recording isn't that great.

So I'm joining the chorus of your very disappointed customers.It's a good job books are still available in print form--I can go back to enjoying them as I have for many years.But I do feel a bit \\"had\\" by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have a spare battery for my Kindle","review":"I was having problems with short battery life on my Kindle, so I ordered a spare.

I tried to charge it but it still would not function. Having had it only a couple of months, I couldn't understand what was wrong. Then I realized from reading the comments from other users that it was the battery. I hurried to order a new one but got a message that they were out of stock. This is really a let down. Surely they will not allow poor battery performance to undermine an otherwise very good product. I have no idea when I will receive the new battery they said they would send an e-mail when it is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon should provide a $200.00 credit to owners if they can no longer supply the battery","review":"If Amazon cannot provide customer service by supporting the products they sell(kindle 1's original battery) then they should at least offer a newer replacement Kindle to the customer(with batteries that are still available or selfcontained). \\"don't know when the replacement battery will be available or if it will be ever available again\\" what kind of nonsense is this? OK, Amazon!! I paid $300.00 for the Kindle 1 and I expected you to supply the original batteries(not by some fly-by-night outfit with batteries that don't last 3 months) for the lifetime of the Kindle. Would you please make your original batteries available or send all your owners of the Kindle 1 a new Kindle HD with the selfcontained batteries for the trouble you're putting us through.

But something is wrong with the replacement battery. The original battery lasted just shy of 2 years. That was fair, and so I didn't hesitate to order a replacement one that is supposed to be exactly the same. Unfortunately, it lasted less than 4 months. What gives Amazon? That's not even close to the original. And, while I love e-books, there's got to be nothing worse than a dead battery on vacation.

Charge time: 3 hours.Note: 1) I don't leave my Kindle on all the time, 2) I don't leave the wireless on, unless I'm using it or expecting a download.The original battery was fair to great too. I sometimes use the Kindle until the battery is very low, then forget to recharge it for a few days. The battery would appear to be dead. I found that charging the battery until fully charged, twice over 2 days brought the old battery back to life. But now it's on to a new battery...

If the second was shipped, I don't know where it was shipped to, but it didn't get to me. What use is a Kindle without a battery? And Amazon is lying in its teeth about how long the battery lasts.

I can only use my Kindle now by using the AC adapter. That means I need to be 5 feet from an electrical outlet or start buying a bunch of extension cords. I've been trying since the beginning of Dec 2008 (it is now mid Feb 2009) to get a replacement battery but they have been on backorder with no signs of when they will be back in stock.

Boy, do I wish that I researched this further before buying my kindle only 4 months ago. My battery is now on backorder as is all the others. I have been singing the praises of my Kindle since I received it. I use it every day. Well, Amazon, I will no longer have good things to say about my kindle if you don't do something for your Kindle 1 customers. I have never had a battery on an electronic item die so quickly. You would think that Amazon could come up with another longer lasting battery. At least kieep the darn batteries in stock. Kindle 2 will not be on my shopping list.

The Kindle would not turn on. A couple of times, after hitting different buttons, and turning off/on, the Kindle came alive, but I noticed I was charging the battery quite often as the battery croaked in short order. The last time I used it, the Kindle seemed to have a psychotic break, blowing its gasket-mind and leaving a dead Kindle shell.Therefore, I looked up the replacement battery online and thought $20 wouldn't be so bad, until I read the reviews here declaring the battery life was very short. So, I thank all of you who wrote your reviews, as I found them informative and have decided not to buy a new battery.What a waste of a great product, though. Like buying a fine working machine (the Kindle), propelled by a tin metal heart (the battery).I think the Kindle needs to take a walk down the yellow-brick road and ask the wizard for a new heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery lasted three years!","review":"Well, the original lasted through three years of alternating intense use and month long idle periods. It's time to get a new one as I am getting just a few days of life. The charger is a little quirky and has to be \\"just so\\" for the light to stay lit. I forgive it.

An art-house film in every sense of the word, Tetstuo certainly isn't for everyone, and I don't think it's meant to seen alone. Truthfully, I find this film entertaining, I give it a 1 simply because it really isn't a good film, it tries too hard to be prolific and throws out anything that resembles a plot.This is supposedly a black comedy, and except for some sexual-inuendo, there's not much in there (could be a trans. problem though).Incidentally, the short, 'Drum Struck' is equally (if no more-so) weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew My Mind For Sure \\"we will rot the world with our love\\"","review":"ok so i'm asking this to everyone after they saw the film, did this make you want to die, it was just so weird. while watching it i was just mezmorized on how messed up it was. when the guy runs out in front of the car and gets it and that music just starts planning i think my eyes rolled to hte back on my head, the story line was really hard to follow.

It's a short film, only a little over an hour, but by the time it was over, I felt like I had just gotten through watching Gone With the Wind.For the gorehounds out there, there's very little gore in this movie (with the exception of one or 2 scenes), but there is much to compensate.

There is a plot, of sorts - the film would make less sense if it ran backwards - but it's not really very important. Instead, the high-contrast, starkly grey-and-black imagery passes at different speeds, with occasional pauses for single words of dialogue (mainly 'OOF!' and 'USSS!'). There's a really nasty sex scene too, one that will make you wince and laugh out loud at the same time.Despite being inexplicable, furious, and one of a kind, there was a sequel - in colour, and with a polished look, it had a plot that trod a fine line between being evocatively minimalist, and standard Anime cliche (our hero has an evil brother, you can guess the rest)."},{"rating":"1","title":"treading a fine line","review":"reading reviews of this film and looking at the back of the box i was expecting a completely over the top, mind blowing film. i must admit i was kind of let down. narratively the film is all over the place with little or no story to speak of but the big problem was this film came across as being really cheesey and stupid at times. i think the true test of a director is to make a low budget film that doesn't seem cheap. some perfect examples being lynch's eraserhead or aronofsky's pi. also this film wasn't really that 'disturbing' or 'crazy' at all. there are a few really incredible images but they're not enough to save this film. i'm going to give tetsuo II: body hammer a chance in the hopes that the bigger budget solves the abovementioned problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy metal death, but with class","review":"This film is certainly one of the most creative and fast-paced of the genre (whichever that is!).

For variety's sake I use it in combination with free weights for chest, back, and shoulders: by using the bench for various inclines while sitting on the footrest. When training heavy I prefer to use the cables for safety reasons. I personally prefer barbell squats, but do use this feature as well on my TT-DLX, as I like the variety and the different angles I can get with the machine. It's easier and safer with the machine if I want to go heavy on squats. I use it as a leg press/ toe raise by sitting on the bench. I use the inclines for ab-work as well.

WOW! My Total Gym is now on Craig's list. The workout from the Bayou Total Trainer is way more intense, and offers a much greater variety of leg exercises. Haven't hit max resistance on legs, but when I do, I can add free weights with the power bar. Look around, Bayou is offering a system with a power bar and a foot board at a fraction of what the competition is charging. Instead of cables, the Bayou uses nylon cord, making the system adjustable. I just opened the handles with a phillip's screw driver, shortened the draw cord, and screwed it back in seconds. Now, when I do upper body, the rollers don't hit the seam. I also like the way the draw cord just loops under the glide board, making it much easier to go from upper to lower body exercises.

This volume also contains the associated haftorah verses for each Torah portion.One thing not appreciated by those who enjoin \\"The bible says...\\" is that a great many Hebrew words were used only once in the entire Tanach (\\"old testament\\").

While the first book centered heavily on Conway's emotional development and the second book dealt mainly with her intellectual development, in the third book she describes her changing world and academic perspectives. In A Woman's Education, Conway really challenges her readers to think critically about how women should be educated, the role of a private women's college, and ultimately what it means to be successful as a female.A previous reviewer mentioned that they felt like they were reading a textbook while reading A Woman's Education. While this book definitely has a more academic tone, it does not resemble a textbook in any other way.

In fact, although he was respectful on a personal level towards religious believers, he was an atheist throughout his adult life and always insisted his opposition to abortion was on scientific grounds rather than religious grounds. This was very important to him, and I think if he were alive he would be very disappointed at any suggestion that his views were motivated by belief in a supernatural being.Liley's widow and children are all still alive and any one of them could have given the author the facts of Liley's religion, or rather lack thereof, but clearly she didn't bother to check her allegations with those who knew him best.

I'm a boxing and ultimate fighting fan and also like martial arts movies. The fighting in this movie is a total disappointment as well as everything else. The boxing is awful, which is the main reason I rented it. There may have been one somewhat entertaining fight but all I can really remember is seeing men basically slapping each other. The choreographer, director, or whatever didn't seem know what boxing is actually like nor put much effort into the fights. It looked like they just picked guys of the street and had them pretend to box. Fighting doesn't have to be realistic to be entertaining and too much realism will look sloppy and can be boring (I've seen many boring boxing matches). This is just sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no Hollywood in this movie.","review":"This DVD was discribed to me as \\"the most requested DVD in the Maine prison system.\\" Had to buy it.

The movie teaches you humility, and sets you back to take a look at your own life and realize how important the little things are. I watch this movie every Sunday, it's kind of my church.

It seems to be richer and have a much higher fat content than the other brands, and rescued animals usually need all the fats they can get. Mixing small amounts of KMR can be frustrating at first because the fat content makes it difficult to dissolve. I've tried whisks, but they don't work. Finally, I figured it out: measure the amount of KMR needed into a measuring cup, then add small amounts of warm water and stir until you create a paste (usually, I add water equal to 1/2 the amount of powder to create a paste.) Stir the paste until it is smooth, then add small amounts of the rest of the water, stirring well after each addition(1 part KMR to 2 parts water). It isn't perfect, but it works better than dumping everything together, stirring like crazy, and still having a lumpy mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for tiny kittens","review":"We use this to supplement feedings for underweight kittens or kittens that don't have a nursing mother available.

For example, the Attributes Inspector has a key menu that allows the detailed placement of graphics - this menu is never mentioned nor is an illustration of it shown anywhere in the book (I only stumbled across it accidentally). Also, several files are not on the accompanying CD. Finally, it is very hard to concentrate when reading such rubbish as, \\"...do you recall seeing a funny looking bull's- eye... Surprise!

I find myself continually marking up my copy with questions that I hope are answered later in the book. Some are, others aren't.

Not many gang members have guns so they resort to clubs and baseball bats (guns make fighting too simple, apparaently-real men fight man to man). The end result is tragic but if it is possible for a movie like this to have a happy ending, this manages to pull it off.

They stand above most of the other metal bands as orignal in their own way. From the beginning song A Cold kiss to the almost 9 minute metal orgasm of The Last Dance Massacre, this band amazes me with their hard rock guitar and their chilling and deep vocalists screams. The only way this album flaws is in it's repetativeness. The bands last album is very much like this one, so to the untrained ear this is a copy, but being a HUGE fan, I love it all.

Luckily, we bought 2 of these and had enough (barely) to assemble 1 full unit.

My only disappointment is I thought it was brown with tan... But turns out it's gray with black. Not my choice of color but I put it together and it is now out on my front porch which is what I purchased it for. It definitely holds all my stuff and can even hold a milk crate full of stuff. So my suggestion is if it's black and gray is to put a picture of the right color cabinet or in BIG letters state that this cabinet is black and gray because it does not look black and gray in the picture. This might be a stock picture supplied by and if so they should correct it. Sorry to be picky... Other than that I got it delivered quickly, I got it set up and I'm good to go... thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"It looks great but it does not close properly.

They are very affordable and are surprisingly sturdy. We had been forewarned (in an earlier review) that the shelves may start to sag if too much weight is placed on them, so we put all of the heavier items (such as 10 gal. paint cans) on the bottom shelf. Compared with the much-higher cost of stainless steel cabinets, these cabinets very adequately met our storage needs. Assembly is remarkably easy - if my extremly \\"unhandy\\" husband could do it in 15 minutes or less, anyone can! One note of caution regarding the doors: the plastic on the side where they affix to the cabinet does need to be trimmed, otherwise the doors will bind. This must be due to a slight manufacturing defect. They can be easily trimmed with an Exacto knife so it's no big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best quality control","review":"the base cabinet had some deformed side walls that didn't align and make a good seal. they had a angle and should have been flat"},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced, overlaid instructions, left the plugs in the doors.","review":"1.

The assembly instructions were on the outside of the box - nice idea except that the packaging people glued the Bill of Materials right over the top of the instructions (so the glue would pull the top layer off the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical Knitting","review":"I wish I hadn't bought this book. Fibermom \\"chomposy\\"'s excellent review said it all. Except for the cute cat motif pullover for little girls, I can't imagine anyone actually wearing any of the garments in this book. Even then, make sure to consult the little girl first. That said, the photography is gorgeous. When I was young and dumb I sometimes fell for stuff like this. I love to knit for the sensuous feel of the yarn. Furthermore, if I have some knitting on hand I can talk as long as she wishes with my darling mother who, at 88, is suffering some cognitive impairment. However, I prefer to knit things that I know will be worn, and I've become fairly good at picking such projects. If you want to immerse yourself in a complex, far-out knitting project which you will probably only wear once at most then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to Backyard Productions!","review":"I like instructionals that mock the class setting, so you can see more than just the instructor perform a movement- helps you to figure out whether or not you are doing it correctly sometimes. She is a little cheesy in her introduction and starts moving off beat towards the end of her performance, plus the other girls are off sync probably due to that... that is distracting. But it is still fun to dance along. Let's face it- most bellydance videos are fun. So try to see past the cheesiness of the plastered on smiles and try not to peek into the window of the neighbor's bedroom window visible over the backyard fence behind the dancers, don't pay too much attention to the plaster Grecian statues that litter the pool deck, or the algae accumulating on the plaster of the pool... just dance and have fun- that is the only way to enjoy this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic choreography","review":"I love this video, and the choreography is enjoyable. Amira Mor teaches at a pace fast enough to keep you on your toes , but slow enough to remember the choreography. The music, \\"Habibi\\", is catchy and energetic. Amira Mor teaches moves such as the \\"Sphinx\\", which is similar to fast zar head movements, and the pelvic shimmy. She also has a little bit of shimmy layering in the choreography. I would not recommend this video to someone with no knowledge of belly dance, or someone just beginning to learn the basics because of these movements. It is great for someone who has had some belly dance experience. Amira Mor's techniques are flawless, and I liked the way the choreography changed pace. The scenery is not so much the issue as the moves, and the way Amira Mor breaks them down. I believe she does a great job of doing this. Personally, I plan to always refer back to this video for practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY! TERRIBLE TAPE!","review":"Amira Mor does not use any choreography and has no technique. She only trys to seduce the camera in a very tasteless way, this is not art and she is not an artist. Her videos are are some of the worst on the market. Do yourself and favor and buy something else instead. She has no feel for the music, her timing is off and is in desperate need of lessons from a professionl to teach her. This is a bad circus side show and is pure garbage. Amira Mor should leave belly dancing to the real professionals, instead of purpetuating such a terrible image for a gentle, ancient art.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing and Horrible","review":"Amira Mor is a terrible belly dancer and presents the dance in a very classless and tasteless way. It very sad to see the beautiful art of belly dancing reach such a low point. Belly dancers work very hard at preserving and embellishing their art, not turn it into a bad day at the local Go-Go bar! Amira Mor dances likes a stripper not an Oriental Belly Dancer. Glad I got these DVD's for free and didnt buy them...do yourself a favor and go the real belly dancers."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"Amira Mor is a terrible bellydancer. Her videos are very basic, simple, boring, trashy, in bad taste as well as uninspiring. The bottom line is that she stinks. Amira Mor and her DVD's are like a bad stripper trying to belly dance for a sleazy bachelor party. Belly dancing is supposed to be an art that is classy, elegant, timeless, tasteful, beautiful and technical. This DVD is so bad, it is embarrassing. All of Amira Mor's DVD's are awful, each video is worse than the other! Learn to strip with Amira Mor is more appropriate titles to this DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAMELESS","review":"AMIRA MOR IS NOT AN AUTHENTIC BELLYDANCER. ANYONE CAN PERFORM A STRIPTEASE.

More of an engineering viewpoint and completely editorial. Probably an interesting read, but I was looking more for a memorial of the towers so as never to forget their majesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I couldn't believe how thorough this book was. This book doesn't only speak of how the towers were built, but also of how the people of New York opposed the buildings, and once they were built how they thought of them as ugly.This is a must read for anyone interested in architecture, but also anyone who wants to know about our beloved towers that are no longer with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center","review":"I, too, was very disappointed in the lack of pictures.

Really Awful Paper quality. No photos, cheap illustrations. A 99 cent book that found good fortune because it was there at the right time. I feel truly ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and duller","review":"This has to be one of the dullest and least insightful titles addressing the World Trade Center -- and just because it was written before the attack is no excuse! Clearly a kind of thesis that somehow got published, this badly written and unevenly researched book also adds to its misdeeds by purporting to be a story of the trade center's construction, yet offering no pictorial material to bring its desert-dry text to life. I was very sad to have wasted money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twin Towers: the life of NY World Trade Center by Gillespie","review":"Book is totally MISREPRESENTED (...) It is not an oversized photo book of the World Trade Center (as shown) but a truly boring history (copy only) of the WTC with a disgustingly few, black and white mini-illustrations. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I expected a wonderfully illustrated book with great photography, but was very disappointed when the book arrived. Not only was it dull, the paper quality was poor. The amateurish illustrations were a joke. This is really not something to buy if you want some sort of visual reminder of the Towers or to commerate the horrific events on September 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the photos","review":"Having worked at One World Trade from 1985-1987 and being a native New Yorker, I ordered this book thinking I would at least get a better understanding on the construction of the towers with photos to document the history. Unfortunately those photos do not exist in this book. There a few diagrams, but no photos worth while in the book. So if you're looking for a basic understanding and would like to see the building of the towers(via photos)and to see the \\"city within a city\\" that it was, this isn't the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Fluff Piece, Serious Stuff","review":"This is a serious history of the conception and creation of not only the building, but the idea behind the building, the politics behind it, and the actual intellectual processes involved.A very enganging read. Probably does not bode well for a rebuilding of the towers however, as many thought the buildings should not have been built in the first place.The chapter on the actual working of the building was far too short for me, perhaps the author will go back to his notes, which he states are extensive, and give us a posthumous account of all the great stories people told about the building (of which only two or three are included).Don't buy the book if you're looking for pictures, just a few diagrams and such are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed some photos to make it Complete","review":"I don't know what the authors were thinking, but to write a book like this, which will no doubt be in HUGE demand now, and not put photographs inside, is clearly not wise. If it were not for the awesome cover shot of these steel phantoms, we would not have even a glimpse inside of the beauty that once was before September 11, 2001. Having lived in New York City all my life, I witnessed these towers crumble, and I can't get my hands on enough stuff even remotely related to them, this is why I ordered this book. However, this is wonderful to read -- not to look through. Informative and well written, it certainly includes thorough coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Dustcover","review":"With nothing to go on but the cover picture (the reviews have all been published since I ordered the book) I was expecting a photo record of how the WTC was built and images at various stages. This is not the case and although the book contains a lot of well-written and interesting information, there is not a single photograph at any stage of construction. I was therefore very disappointed. A picture really is worth a thousand words and the few sketches that there are, simply do not begin to portray the majesty that was the WTC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Nabokov novella","review":"Written in 1930, this was the last of his Russian novels that I read. It is short, lucid and imaginative and gives hints of later novels featuring his unique doppelgangers. Did the main character succeed in killing himself? Is he having a funny dream after death which he is able to control, or is he deceiving himself? These questions are central to The Eye, which is one of Nabokov's simplest plots, but still intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"more fun than his previous three novels, overly cute","review":"I get the impression that Nabakov began shifting directions with this brief novel, a wild farce about disillusion and indifference to the world and one's protective ability to seperate yourself from reality. Certainly there is more of a plot than in Mary, King, Queen, Knave or The Defense, and it is just as gorgeously written. It's really quite entertaining and filled with what (I suspect) grew to become Vlad's unique voice. The only criticism I could give The Eye is the clear swagger of an extraordinarily arrogant author who is basically showing off his talent with the wrong story. Hey, yeah, we know (knew) he could write well, but such a minor work is not the best showcase for the unrestrained pretentiousness I'm beginning to fear as I continue along my path of reading each one of Nabakov's novels. Basically this is a pleasent chuckle followed by a disconcerted 'uh-oh'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surreal So-and-so","review":"Let me preface this by saying I have never read Nabokov, and am only familiar with him thru second-hand knowledge of his works: that is, until reading 'The Eye'. He has quite a following of pretentious college students, and now I can see why. This book is not that great, but supposedly this is not his best work, so it's to be expected. I found that it was empty and devoid of meaning, but written in such a way as to make you think there was some sort of meaning behind it. Nabokov just threw together some very 'deep' thoughts and had the protagonist use irony to appeal to the sardonic in all of his readers. I've seen this done much better in REAL detective novels such as Chandler's, for crying out loud! This is literary? Literary my eye! (pun intended)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Nabokov","review":"THough hardly his best novel, The Eye is an essential read for any amateur Nabokovian. Originally titled in Russian \\"The Spy\\", The Eye is the story of a young man hell bent on destroying his own life, the only p roblem is, that may have already happened. With elements of Gogol's \\"Lost Souls\\" and the beginnings of Nabokov's characteristic style, \\"The Eye\\" is an intriguing two or three hour read. I finished it in an afternoon, but that was two years ago, and I'm still pondering this novel. For the key to the mystery, see Stacy Schiff's \\"Vera (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)\\", also an intriguing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HULK of a scripting book","review":"I have been reading internet articles for like 2 months on scripting and none of them are any good. I thought that I could save money and just read articles, but it was a HUGE waste of time then I found Game Scripting Mastery mentioned on Gamedev.net, and I sucked it up and threw down my money, and I have been VERY happy with this book. It's the only book on the subject that actually starts with nothing and ends with an actual scripting system pluged into a C++ game and it all works.

I was surprised and pleased to discover a third book that fell between the two. Unfortunately, The Barsoom Project was a huge let-down.It reads as if Niven and Barnes wrote an OK outline for a novel but never bothered to put any effort into the actual writing. For example, some information that is very important to the plot is revealed in a monolog by a character that is supposedly so drunk, he can't control what he's saying. Yet he manages to express it all in complete, neatly constructed, coherent paragraphs.The characters are poorly constructed, uninteresting and unbelievable. The dialog is unnatural.

Well its been a while and so far I love it...its very responsive and feels good in my hand. I dont even use force feedback, I really just wanted a cordless pad and this one, for the price I paid, was well worth it.

I haven't had a single problem when I used a single device in my computer.I would easy give it 5 stars if there wasn't a very important downside:I bought a second one to play PES2011. About 85% of the time they work flawlessly. BUT in some cases in the middle of the game one of the receivers switches and starts receiving signal from the other gamepad. This is not a PES problem because it shows also in the windows control panel.In the Logitech support forums the problem was addressed as \\"unresolvable\\" because the device uses DirectInput versus X-Input... That was somewhat confusing and was accepted as an indication that they simply refuse to resolve the issue so the customers are moved to buy newer \\"X-Input\\" controllers.The fact that you're not really supposed to use two of these controllers at the same time seems like something they should have mentioned in their sales literature, but they did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Quality","review":"The controller feels and performs like the Sony PS2 controller.

Looking at the Mac website, similar reviews for the cord version of Rumblepad. This is for PC. Total disappointment. Lots of hassle now to return it. Don't buy it if you are going with MAC.

Also tried it on a few other games that I can't recall the names of.

I've tried Logitech's tech service on-line help but to no avail. I haven't had time yet to call their telephone tech service, which they suggested I do, to find out what the issues are.

First I installed the driver and software as instructed by the manual. Everything was fine. Then a week later, I removed the batteries. When I replaced the batteries, the calibration of the analog sticks were off. And there's no way to re-calibrate using the driver installed. So, I decided to uninstall the driver and software. Then, I used Windows XP's control panel to calibrate the gamepad. It works fine after that. So, if you get this gamepad, you don't need to install the drivers and software if you're using Windows XP. As for other Windows versions, you'l have to try to find out. The software is just an interface for you to assign buttons for various games that you have. Some games already allow you to reconfigure the buttons in the game's options.Overall, great gamepad and range is pretty good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Freedom","review":"Amazed how this works so well.

This make the analog completely unusable when your playing sports games that require an exact location of the analog to make a pass or shot. Absolute failure on Logitech's part.The raised buttons aren't the greatest either but you can get by. It's a bit heavy and a rechargeable version would be more ideal that batteries but even that is ok.The controller would receive a 4-5 star if not for the square analog housing.Returned.PS2 controller plugged back in to PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great controller, but no feedback with EA.","review":"This is a great controller.

The rumble works for EA Sports Need for Speed but not for Madden 2003 or 2005.The only conclusion I can come to is this thing is still experimental and not ready for release.I've sought help from Logitech, EA Sports, Microsoft, on-line forums, updated drivers, tried clean boots, reinstallations galore.Hours and hours later, still not working right.

In Windows XP there is no need to install the included software - it will function perfectly without them. If you don't need fancy custom programming don't bother installing the software, you can usually customize the buttons, etc. from within a game anyway. No noticeable lag. The only quirk I noticed is that I also have a Logitech Freedom 2.4 wireless joystick, and in order to play Lego Star Wars with my son I had to unplug the joystick receiver from the computer.

The D-pad is not as good as the Logitech Precision Gamepad (which I consider the best PC D-pad) but it works better than most. You also can't always set the buttons to be comfortable for every N64 game, but that is because for some games you want to use the stick (Goldeneye or Perfect Dark) and some buttons (Killer Instinct Gold).For adult hands it is not the most comfortable for extended play time (due to bulk caused by battery compartment) but is fine for easy get-in and get-out gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfectly","review":"I've used it many times for several hours and I'm still on the original batteries.

Easy installation, comfortable, and responsive. It's still a PC gamepad though, so the buttons suffer from a bit of \\"clickiness\\" as I call it, whereas a PS3 controller would have softer buttons. But that's knitpicking. Overall, much better than the wired USB Dualshock version which tends to break down on you for no reason every 6 months to a year. Probably the best PC gamepad you can get besides the Xbox360 controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"We purchsed two of these units.

A month and a half later I'm still going around and around with them. They consistenly avoid my requests for a replacement unit.

Fantastic!There are two downfalls to this product. First is the bulkiness of the controller. It's pretty big and heavy. Second, if you want this for a PS3, then fine, but it won't support games which require motion control like LittleBigPlanet or Heavy Rain. Otherwise, this is a great investment if you like to swap from your PC to console game every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn it and you would like it!","review":"Just like many reviewers, vibration doesn't work for me, but who cares, that does nothing except burning the battery faster.

User guide are always confusing, I haven't read it, no exception in this case. Range is good with no lack experience so for. The minus 1 start was because it is hard to get all the keys to function correctly. It took me a long time configuring it again and again to get keys rights(that's for 1 game only), but the latest driver fix my problem because it can map \\"key strokes\\" to the programmable keys on the control, but it take some time to figure that out.

Appearances from Xzibit, GZA, Kurupt, & Goodie Mob are really good and certainly won't hurt album sales. There are a lot of pretty tight tracks and the hidden/bonus GZA track at the end of the last track is reall cool. This compilation exposed me to a few cool rappers I hadn't heard.Negatives: The production of \\"You Better Believe It\\" by Xzibit & King Tee is terrible. I can't stand the rock aspect of the song. Xzibit is arguably the most talented rapper on the album but the song is bad. The sixth track with the usually tight Kurupt has the same flaw.

Both the Kurupt songs are dope with his raw lyrics. The production from Muggs and the Alchemist is consistent throughout the album.In my opinion, the first two tracks are the worst, Everlast's lyrics aren't up to much but his flow is nice and the Self Scientific is a good song to end with, not counting the bonus tracks. The Cypress Hill song is better than the ones I've heard off their album, its more like one off Temples Of Boom or IV.The most outstanding songs from the album are Gza's When The Fat Lady Sings, Kurupt and Roscoe's When The Pain Inflict, Dilated People's Suckers Are Hidin', and Cypress Hill's Don't Trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"DJ MUGGS IS THE 1 OF THE GREATEST","review":"I love DJ Muggs' beats.

It refuses the happy end : the arabian guy dies because of the jealousy of the boyfriend of the girl he flirted with. Lots of french critics have criticized the final redemption. But this end is reminiscent of the redemption of the bad lieutenant and Bresson's Pickpocket : how horrible and disgusting your sins might be, you may have god's pardon if you suffer enough to get it.

However, if you have the album, are the two Shape of My Heart remixes worth it? The first one is a short remix, great beat, and it's the basically (with slight differences) the normal song. The Club Mix has a few parts in the middle where it's just beats and no BSB singing. But it's not one of those remixes where you hear BSB for a minute, and the other 6 minutes are all bass beats and stuff. You get a good amount of the guys singing for a Club Mix. Personally, i think it was worth it. If you absolutely detest Shape of My Heart though, it may not be for you.If you're a BSB fanatic, why would you even read a review to decide to buy it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap smell","review":"Certainly not in the Hugo Boss, Armani, CK perfume class.

There is a lot of unnecessary and sarcastic humour which just wastes time and paper and is annoying to read.

The examples given are mostly incomplete and the explanations are poor at best. The authors have a tendency to repeat themselves several times per paragraph making it very difficult to grasp many of the concepts. I can't help but feel that they do this to pad the pages in attempt to make it seem like a serious VB book. Don't even open the COM chapters, they are so poorly written they defy understanding, (I have already ordered a second book on COM) I can't help but feel that the authors don't actually know VB 6.0 that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by it's size!","review":"I think Amazon should filter on-line reviews. The reader from San Diego, Ca, January 26 is either the author or has some financial interest in the book. Although very large in size, 750+ pages, it was poorly written. The exam questions were ambiguous and sometimes incorrect altogether. In addition, the testing software contains bugs which caused the application to crash periodically. I have not taken the exam yet, so I don't know if some of the book's material will be helpful. I am very disappointed with this purchase. The only saving grace is that I didn't pay full price.

Finally the questions at the end of the advanced chapters ask for answers not even covered in the chapter.I can not recommend this book. but it is the first so what can you do if you want to stay ahead of the certification curve?Are there no publishers that can beta test their books before releasing them? And shame on Microsoft for certifying that \\"the course contains accurate product information\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought the questions were fine and the book was excellent","review":"The questions in this book are what you'd expect them to be.

I took the certification test today and didnt even come close to passing. 75% of what was in the book was never even mentioned on the cert test.

Many topics are explained in mind-boggling ways that make them seem impossibly difficult, when a little diagram would have made them seem easy. Even for someone inexperienced with VB, it is obvious to me that there are stupid errors in examples and in self tests. The whole thing has been thrown together in a hurry to make a buck.

The exam tends to focus on COM a lot, which the book fails to address really well. At the same time, the exam has a lot of installation and distribution questions that the book was good preparation for.

I've never, ever read a exam guide with such an incredibly poor set of exam test questions. The first chapter's exam questions were so incredibly poorly worded and, well, incorrect, that I had to put the book down and scream. For example, question 13 asks \\"you have not specified a help file for a command button...What will occur if you press F1?\\" The \\"correct\\" answer is \\"A. No help will be displayed. The standard Help topic for command buttons will be displayed.\\" Okay, so the first half of that answer is correct, but the second half DIRECTLY contradicts it. Also, it doesn't specify whether you are in design mode or run mode, which makes a BIG difference. Of the 20 in this section, I'd say 10 had problems like this. I skimmed through the content of the rest of the book and can only say that it is hardly worth the paper that it is written on.

Microsoft states one of the exam objectives is loading controls at runtime, and I'm sure they would like to see control.add as an option since they added it in VB6.

So basiclaly I paid more money to get the professional version of the Virus software but I can't use it because it didn't mention anything in the pruchase section about this sever limitation.I don't recommend this software at all! I will uninstall it and revert back to Black Ice. It's much faster, effective, and less intrusive. It's unfortunate I can't return this software anymore and wasted my money.

Whether it is their Clockwork Orange inspired lyrics, or their Misfits-like singalongs,something was different about LCB, and in my opinion, this is their best cd. From \\"Airwave Raid\\" to \\"Rather Be Hated\\" there is not a single bad note or song on this album. Songs like \\"Sex and Violence\\" or \\"Psycho\\" will be stuck in your head for weeks.

I do not take issue with the notion that Hitchcock was suffering and struggling in his final days, but I do take issue in this largely disrespectful account. There is enough of historical value here to make the book worth reading, but barely. The first hand accounts make for some interesting reading, but it seems as if the author is stretching to increase his page count. As a result, he pads with uninspired analysis of Hitchcock's previous films including sections on such commonplace information as Hitchcock's cameo appearances. The bulk of the book is the script for \\"The Short Night\\" which is underdeveloped, having been cancelled as a project before a final draft was completed.

I found what I was looking for in Lee Strobel's fine apologetic treatment of the subject of faith. I thoroughly enjoyed the structure and flow of this book as Lee introduces the reader to various scholars and experts who have spent decades and staked their careers on such difficult topics as the existence and purpose of hell, why bad things are aloud to happen, Jesus as the only way to eternal life, a tainted Church history (Inquisition, Salem Witch Trials), etc. Each chapter ends with discussion topics and additional resources for further study.

The Seeds were REALLY trippin' if they ever thought they could compete with '60s L.A. bands like the Byrds, Doors, Buffalo Springfield, Love, or even the Leaves (at least the Leaves sounded sincere). Clear Light were pretty bad, and these guys were worse. They sound like a Zappa joke. Black Oak Arkansas could play circle around these guys.

There does not appear to have been any significant effort at true research in the production of this book. It reminds me of the instructions given to grammar school children in the 1950's for a Thanksgiving play. The Indian Craft books written by W. Ben Hunt and Bernard S.

But I am disappointed.The book starts from the basics and trying to transfer the ideas to you in a as roughly way as possible. Defines sin, cos stuff but never *fully* explains what they really are.

The only thing that I would suggest adding is a set of powerpoint slides for training (maybe next time guys?).Is this book an in-depth book on every subject? No. This is not the be-all-to-end-all SAN backup book. Or RAID book. Or the \\"best of breed\\" for anything that it covers. But I don't think that the authors meant it to be a drill-down-to-the-bottom type of book. It covers what it needs to cover to suggest the right solution.

If you look at it compared to what else is out there on this subject, its 4 stars. However, if you rate it as to whether it achieved the goals it set for itself, I would rate it a 2 star book. The essential problem is the book can not figure out where to place its emphasis. I complete agree with R Earl \\"unixnut\\"'s review on this point. No one can expect to cover the breadth of this book's table of contents effectively. This is because no one author can know it all. That being said, professionals interested in backup should buy it in any case, just because there are so few titles in this area.

However I planned on using it for Street Fighter 2 and other classic fighting games and the D-pad is one of the worst I have ever used. The joysticks have a button click, just like many of the consoles controllers, and someone thought it would be good idea to make the D-pad a button as well. Unfortunately that was a really bad idea. When attempting moves that involve complex actions on the D-pad, the pad depresses and twists making it very difficult or near impossible. There are certain moves that I can only pull off a fraction of the time with this controller, and other moves that I can barely pull off at all (ex: Shoryuken) but I can pull off nearly 100% of the time with the Xbox 360 controller. I bought the same controller for my nephew and it has the same problem so it isn't a defect, just a serious design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've at least warned me.","review":"The product specifications were good and said they were compatable with a Mac. when the controller arrived it said on the box \\"This controller offers no vibration feedback for Macintosh.\\" on top of the no vibration, i was sent a faulty one. the down and right directions on the right analog stick didnt work. a huge letdown. if the gamepad doesnt offer certain features on a specific type of computer, it should be mentioned in the overview."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FOR MAC","review":"Some apparently got it to work with debilitating errors.

I decided to purchase it to play emulated PSX game on PC, because this gamepad resembled(well, most gamepad nowadays as well) Sony's dualshock.My first impression was, that the gamepad is heavier, and has worse grip than the dualshock. But these are just tolerable. Fact which bothered me the most was, that tension of analog stick is a bit too loose. I also didn't like the location of center switches.Of course, the reason I felt such was that I was too familiar with dualshock, so other people's impression may be different.Otherwise, the gamepad was instantly recognized by winxp service pack 2 with no driver installation, and worked perfectly with PSX emulator. While I stick with digital directional buttons, I have no problem. The problem is, as I wrote above, the analog stick..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This gamepad is great!","review":"The gamepad itself is perfectly fine, and is designed for people comfortable with the PlayStation design.

USE THE PLUG-AND-PLAY DRIVERS!!! The Logitech driver has given me a lot of problems, and the Windows XP Plug-and-Play drivers work fine.

At least it was only $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"At first, this seemed like a great controller. It was easy to set up, and it's ability to run several sets of game profiles simultaneously was impressive. I didn't think I'd experience any of the problems that were always associated with the original Dual Action gamepad from logitech.

If the controls work standard with the game, 9 times out of 10 the rumble feature will not be supported. I wasted my money on this product because I loved the playstation style controllers and hated the xbox style. If I could go back and change my choice I would get the xbox controller without thinking twice about it. Do yourself a favor and pass on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for whatever you need a controller for","review":"There's not much to tell; what you see is what you get. It fits in your hand well enough. My only real beef with the thing is that the joypad has a square outside instead of round. It can make moving a serious pain. And if you're going to get this, try the version without rumble. Not many PC games, even console ports, support vibration."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent gamepad","review":"This is close to the perfect gamepad. Neither too light nor too heavy (I find some Saitek too light for instance), sturdy, good vibration, holds extremely well in my hands (I have big hands, PS2 controllers are almost too small for me and I can't hold Gamecube). I have not used the force feedback yet so I can't judge that. The joysticks work really well though, and never get stuck or loose (yet, at least). All buttons answer well, the d-pad is confortable (unlike some Saitek, again)... Yep I can't find a flaw... except one minor thing : the 9 and 10 buttons shoud be in the place of the mode and vibration buttons and vice versa. But that's VERY minor. An excellent controller indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is really good gamepad. It feels really comfortable in your hands and it fits nicely.

Assembly is easy... and when I accidentally striped the screws by using a drill w/a screw bit to assemble it, Radio Flyer quickly sent me some replacement screws free of charge, no questions asked.

Some beautiful tunes, some angry and crude rockers. Shades of Todd Rundgren, Joe Jackson, George Gershwin (!), but very much Ben's own sound.

I listened to the first song on the CD that day and I've been hooked on not only Jackson Cannery, but the rest of the album. A day hasn't gone by that I don't listen to at least 5 Ben Folds Five songs.

Fantastic pop tunes, some solidly pleasant introspective songs (now a Ben Folds trademark, fully realized in his current solo release \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\"). The production is a little rough in parts, but that's to be expected in a debut. At least five standout tracks, and the others aren't too bad either.I can't figure out why these guys didn't hit in 1996. I guess their instrument choices and sincere style didn't mix with the mopey-sarcastic-GenX radio scene five years ago. I suppose they still don't mix well today, since I've hardly heard anything but \\"Brick\\" on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instantly enjoyable music with an actual shelf life. Really.","review":"My introduction to Ben Folds Five was a surprising one, to say the least. I was napping on the sofa one afternoon in late 1996 and someone decided it'd be funny to wake me by blasting the opening strains of \\"Julianne\\" on the stereo. Imagine being jolted out of sleep by a loud, nerdy twang bellowing \\"I met this girl, she looked like Axl Rose...\\" Half a decade after the fact, the delightful weirdness of Ben Folds Five is no less refreshing, and this album is the most dynamic, colourful example of the now-defunct trio. Folds shared with Robert Sledge and Darren Jessee a chemistry unmatched in the grossly-underappreciated genre of \\"absurdist jazz that calls itself punk\\".

This is some of the very best music of the mid 90's. It's fun, witty and energetic. \\"NO DOY!\\" is their best CD but this is a great intro as 6 of these songs reappear rerecorded on \\"NO DOY!\\" anyway.

This issomething else again -- a story of an implacably determined European immigrant with a dream of re-making himself in the Sand Hills of western Nebraska.The strength of Jules' dream is affecting, and so is the story of its collision with the bleak reality of midwestern frontier life. One branch of my family were ranchers in Wyoming, and their descendants remain a tough lot. Tough doesn't begin to describe Old Jules, and like most very tough people, he was more memorable and even admirable than likeable.When it comes to the lives of women on the frontier, Willa Cather covered similar ground, but Sandoz is absolutely unsparing and is an extraordinarily talented writer. This is one of those books that you'll think about for years. I've bought and given away half a dozen copies over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic account of the settling of northern Nebraska","review":"Mari Sandoz was the daughter of Old Jules about whom she wrote as an historian rather than as his daughter. Her success is astonishing, as is the respect she retained for a father who on one occasion nearly killed her. It is not a book for the faint of heart. Mother would have been 100 in 1998, and was raised in IA and MN under similar circumstances. She was 'down' for several days after reading it because she related so closely to Mari's life. Old Jules was a man of determination and a dream he would not let die. His story is of individuals needed to settle the midwest which was wrested from weather and cattle barrons. You may become emotionally involved with childhood memories, but you will admire Mari's honesty and the success of Jule's life. So real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Jules, pioneer from Switzerland","review":"As a Swiss it was great reading form me. Old Jules came from Neuchtel, Switzerland, to Nebraska when the country was quite unsetteled exept for a few friendly Indians. Today it is hard to imagine, what the poeple the went through. The book gave me an idea of this, especially since I know the land from my stay and travel in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharks for everyone","review":"I am a chiropractor and carry this book in my waiting room.

Rodney hits the shark with his fist. Then Rodney hits the shark in it's eye and the shark lets go. In the end Rodney got a bunch of stitches which saved life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shabby Publishing","review":"This book contains excellent text but desperately needs a better publisher. The maps and reproductions of paintings are in dingy, blurry black and white. They look as if they are 1970's-era photocopies of 1960's-era photocopies. On page 124 there are illustrations of a grenadier and a drummer with the descriptions exactly reversed. In short, this edition of \\"Decisive Day\\" is not a book that you will be proud to have on your shelf. Do yourself a favor and borrow a copy from a library -- perhaps earlier editions had quality control worthy of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tremendously Good Read by a Skilled Historian!","review":"In this tremendously good read, author Richard Ketchum skillfully describes the Battle of Bunker Hill, in detail, from both the American and British perspectives.Having committed some 2,300 troops to the battle, the British suffered more than a thousand casualties, including many officers, prompting the British commander to comment that another few such victories would destroy King George III's Army in America.Ketchum's fine writing is accompanied by a series of excellent maps of Boston in 1775 and the troop dispositions of both armies on the day of the battle in June 1775 making the action he describes easy to follow.I enjoy well written history and I look forward to reading Ketchum's other books on the American Revolutionary War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous writing","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a book, written from the viewpoint of a child, which I felt was actually realistic. I take issue with those that thought it was otherwise. The way we are taken through thoughts, stories, and experiences in what seems like a fairly random order...and are also privy to what are the lies that pop through her head...was outstanding. I was less \\"impressed\\" with Clara's vocabulary than with her imagination. The reader of this book is promised a trip through a plethora of emotions that is diminished in a review.

I found the book to be utterly boring, and extremely repetitive.

The only positive thing I could say is that I did enjoy the author's writing style. But her storytelling abilities left left something to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"The only reason I made it through this book is because it was our book club choice for the month.

Problem is her Mom's not telling, so Clara is left to imagine the various scenarios about who her father may be and how she came into the world. Clara meets up with Georg, an elderly immigrant man and the two form an odd but touching friendship. Shadow Baby touches on the need we all have to know our personal history, good, bad or otherwise. Clara is a charming, witty, albeit odd little girl who is not easily forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The eleven-year-old narrator was fascinating and very endearing. And though the story itself was quite sad, the manner in which it is told was surprisingly fresh and full of beauty. I really enjoyed Clara's relationship with books, as well as her relationship with the truth. It was a sweet, sad story and one that makes me want to read another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Baby - excellent","review":"One of the makings of a really good novel, for me, involve children narrators. Shadow Baby's narrator, 11-year-old Clara winter (lowercase \\"w\\" on purpose), lover of books and words, despiser of winter, is an endearing, sweet character, and made this book truly wonderful.Shadow Baby tells the story of Clara and her friendship with the elderly Georg Kominsky. After given an assignment at school to do an oral history project, Clara seeks out Georg (or \\"old man\\" as she affectionately calls him) as her subject. Throughout their time together, Clara and Georg form a bond. Georg shows Clara about metalworking, and Clara talks to Georg about her missing grandfather and father.Clara makes it her quest to find out about the missing people in her life, but her mother, Tamar, is tight-lipped about it all. Georg becomes somewhat of a grandfather-figure for Clara, and this relationship is what makes this novel a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging short novel","review":"This book centers around Clara, a precocious 11 year old, and her friendship with Georg, an immigrant seven times her age. Clara is an odd child who is obsessed with words--she loves some words for the arrangement of their consonants, like martyr, and hates other words, like winter. Winter also happens to be Clara's last name, but in her own mind, she always spells it with a lowercase \\"w,\\" as she sees winter as dangerous and blames it for the death of her twin sister at birth. Clara feels lost without her twin, and she can't get any answers from her mother about who her father is, what really happened on the night of her birth, and why she's never met her grandfather. She asks questions of George too--initially, she sets out to interview him as part of a class project--and when his own answers are elusive, Clara makes up stories to fill in the blanks. This is an engaging tale of a girl trying to make sense of her world through questions, words, and stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadow Novel","review":"First time reading this story, I only thought Clara as a normal child,well, except a little odd, with loads of imaginations. As I continued to read this book, I found out that she is a special eleven years old girl, who has her own thought and her own shadowy past. On the way to met with the old man, Georg, she has learned to become more mature dealing with her feelings, has learned the possibility of art, and has found out her own past of the death of her baby sister and her missing father. You will find the story unfolds itself beautifully and meticulously through all of the enigmas as the story continus on. At the end, tragidy had exploded as if it was waiting until an appropriate time to come. This is a well written story and one of the you-must-read book in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange book","review":"I am not sure how to rate this book. It was very bizzare.

Is he guilty or not? I thought so, but by law we know nothing! What was the point of this book? To write a bunch of questions about a possible killer's motives?

It's almost like using a power tool. It cuts very fast and doesn't lift the grain to badly, instead cutting smooth miniature chisel grooves about 1/32\\" deep. I used it to sculpt some cypress for a tool handle recently, and it worked very well for that task (although, admittedly, cypress is a softer wood). I'm not sure I wood attempt to use it for stripping paint or finish off of a window sill as is shown on the cardbord insert that comes with the tool due to the fact that the blade is a curved plate and is therefore rather difficult to make a flat or flush cut with. For sculpting or heavy surface wood removal however, I can think of few finer tools for the job especially if you enjoy the feeling of working wood with your hands and not nessesarily a power tool. On a level surface though, I would just use a hand plane or cabinet scraper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little tool","review":"I've used the standard Surform tool for years for taking a little wood off of sticking doors before painting and mostly for plaster work.

So if you buy this, keep a stash of AAAs in your car!2. Poor reception - as another reviewer said, \\"I am the antenna\\". You really have to hold onto the transmitter to get acceptable reception in many cases.3. LCD display goes black in a hot car (minor quibble, it still works).4. Loose transmitter connection to audio source - typically I can now only hear audio on one speaker unless I hold it ju-u-u-ust right.I presume these aren't made anymore, and for good reason!

It's like they only wrote half of it and the other half still needs to be written.I wish they had a compass page. But I guess we can use the Mariner's Eye View and get something similar. I guess it just takes getting used to.I also wish that the split screen view could can be set for the track to be split separately for the two screens. I would like the bottom screen to be zoomed out with the tracking pointing north (like reading a map).

All military documentaries use representative footage to illustrate events since not all battles were fought with cameras running at just the right spots (even today's high-tech news casts often use file footage to fill gaps). \\"Victory at Sea\\" displays the massive effort the U.S. made to win WW II on a global scale. Nothing like this had ever been done before. It was truly \\"the greatest generation\\" both at the battlefront and the homefront. We should ask ourselves if we could muster the same courage and spirit if needed?

The fantastic music, naration and filming brings back not only the events but the feeling and mood that goes along with the times.

I don't want to waste my time reading about the whole language vs. phonics debate anymore, I just wanted the research and background provided by linguistic study. This book just seemed to be a rehashing of whole language theories; and why they are correct and the phonics approach is wrong with little classroom strategies (which is what I wanted from the book).

Even the 4 year old boy next door falls down on this. It's so tippy that the neighbors won't let any of their kids ride it! Not only that, but the grippers on the handles come right off.

Assembly is not problematic whatsoever under sane conditions. (Go slink away from the kids to do this & you'll be fine.)

It is a great value, and a classic tricycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware peeling handlebars!","review":"My 2 1/2 year-old received this bike for Christmas. We all loved its retro look and it seemed pretty sturdy. He had only had it for a couple of days when we noticed he was peeling off the shiny metallic coating from the handlebars. His grandmother tried to brush away the loose flakes and received several substantial cuts on her fingers and hand. We got rid of the bike immediately! Also, while it says it is appropriate for ages 2 and up, his older brother was barely big enough to pedal it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great named bike but a little dissapointed on the durability","review":"When purchasing this product, I thought that the brand Radio Flyer was a brand that I could depend on for durability since I was using this item in my preschool. I found that the bicycle that I purchased was not as sturdy as other bicycles that I have purchased in the past and the handle bars could not be tightened enough to keep them from moving, which prevents my 2-4 year olds from riding and turning the bike properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bike","review":"My daughter is 31 months and does great on this bike. She has never been able to pedal other bikes or big wheel-type of bikes but this one is easy for her. She learned how to ride it within an hour. She is 36 inches tall and I agree most 2 year olds would be too small for this bike. I think they need to be at least 2 1/2 to even try it. Someone mentioned the bike tipping over and she has tipped it over twice. In watching her I would say the reason it tips at times is only when they turn the wheel too sharply. I was surprised though to see her tip it over because you dont expect that with a tricycle! But after the first couple of days she has not tipped it again. Overall, we really like it and it is a heavy, sturdy bike that I'm sure will be passed on to her baby brother someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS","review":"I bought model #33 tricycle and it looks beautiful and is veryeasy to ride - my 2 year old son loves it. Unfortunately after1 hour of riding on it he fell of 3 times - so did my friendskids 3 and 2 year old boys. There is something completelywrong with its weight. When the front wheel is turned even alittle bit in one direction and the child bends forward inanother there are down on their faces.It looks so nice but this model is very dangerous andpractically unusable... Try model #36 - it looks safer with thechain drive.Anna (Mother of 27 month old and 7 month old)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and poorly made","review":"I purchased this tricycle for my 2 year old son-he is 4 now. What a mistake! The bike tips over very easily when turning and it's very hard to tell a 2 year old to slow down when he's trying to have fun. Even in slow speed turns you can see the inside back tire start to lift.With a 2 year old, riding the tricycle occasionally, all the tread wore off the front tire in 6 months and I have not found anyone who sells replacement tires.Although I grew up with Radio Flyer's back in the 60's, and they were made very well back then, I have to say I would never buy a Radio Flyer product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!!!","review":"We purchased this bike for our two and a half year old son, since it's age reccomendation was for 24 months through 5 years. He could not reach the pedals, let alone the ground (and he is in the 75% for his height) and he was constantly falling over on it. Also, the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire, so it was always turned sideways to make the bike go straight. My neighbor also has this bike and hers does the same thing. Finally, after about five months of my four year old riding it, the front tire has just completely broke off of the frame!! We are very disappointed in the stability and quality of this bike. It looks cute, but don't be fooled. It is very top/front heavy and is always falling over when you make a turn. Don't buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the specs for proper fit","review":"If you go to the Radio Flyer website, it says that this trike is for children aged 2.5 - 5 years old, whereas the 10\\" trike is for children aged 2 - 4.

He could not come close to touching the pedals, but we will find the blocks that attach to the pedals to make them thicker. That should work. He fell in love with it right away, and wouldn't get off. The bell would not stay together no matter what, so it will have to be replaced with another one. All-in-all, it is completely sturdy, and he is going to get tons of play time out of it.

So we took it to the park to a very flat section and he kept falling over. Even a 3 year old friend kept falling over and getting hurt. I took the bike back the next day. Yes the bike is as cute as can be but be careful.. wear a helmet and pads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't make them like they used to!","review":"We were so excited to buy this bike for our 2 year old. We figured Radioflyer is a well known brand which has been around for over 70 years; however, now the bike is not made with quality American standards. It's made in China. The bike has a noxious odor which is so strong that I fear it may be carcinogenic to our kids' precious lungs and bodies. The bike is not very constructed and tips over easily. Now it will be a cumbersome task to return this product that we tediously assembled. More disappointing, this toy purchase was a \\"tease\\" to our child who was so excited have his first \\"real\\" bike.I guess, the search will go on. :( Buyers beware when buying ANY products for your kids. Nowadays, company profit supersedes children's well-being."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bike is great, but too big!!!","review":"We bought these bikes for our 2 y/o son and 3 y/o daughter for Christmas. While they look great and are very sturdy, they are just too darned big for a little toddler. Even now 9 months later they still cannot sit on the seat and reach the pedals. By the time they will be able to reach teh pedals they will be ready for a two wheeler. My kids are not tiny either, my daughter is 50 percentile and my son is 90 percentile. Get a smaller tricycle so your kids can ride it. We have a Planet Kiddo hand me down (made in Germany) that is much smaller and my daughter rides that around.Edited to add: Now, when my kids are 4 and 3, they still cannot reach the pedals. I am going to get coaster bikes for them that can have pedals added later. What a waste of money these tricycles were. It only gets ons start b/c I could not put zero stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts Easily--Watch Out","review":"My husband bought this for our two year old son... and it was just too big for him to use. So, we thought we'd wait. We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust. Once it started, the rust couldn't stop. So basically, a big waste of money.Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flips over EVERY time my son rides it!","review":"My little guy received this trike from his Grandparents when he was two. He could just reach the peddles and was very excited about it. It took a few months before he could really reach the peddles and get moving on it. Every time and I mean EVERY time he rides the trike it tips over on him and he ends up hurt. As one of the other reviews states, I thought maybe he was turning to sharp but even when I hold on and help him turn slowly I feel it start to tip. It's now hanging in the garage and he will not be riding it again. We will be buying him a more stable/safe trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"the handle bar could not be aligned with the front tire,","review":"I bought this tricycle as christmas gift for my 3 year old son in December 2010. We could not use it till now because the handle bar could not be tightened enough to stay in proper alignment with the front tire.The design is very bad. The handle bar is connected to the front tire completely by friction. No matter how much I tightened the clap which make the friction between handle bar and front tire, the handle bar still turns away from the from tire easily. So the handle bar and front tire cannot be aligned. This tricycle is completely useless.I saw someone just drilled a hole and put a pin bwteen handle bar and front tire connection. Maybe that is the only solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Classic","review":"Ordered this bike on Amazon and it arrived 24 hours later. Love the classic styling and the durable build and it was fairly simple to assemble. The seat is solid metal so perhaps a cushioned seat would be better. My son is 26-months-old and he loves it already. Only problem is that he can't reach the pedals (and he's tall for his age). Other reviewers have had the same problem so when my son is taller I'm sure he'll love it even more. Also agree with other reviewers about the bike being top-heavy and prone to tipping over but that's typical for an old-style tricycle. In the meantime I'll have to buy him a bike that he can actually use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable but don't turn!","review":"My son received this bike for his 3rd birthday from his grandparents. We loved it's looks. When the weather broke we took it outside and we were ready for some fun. Well everytime my son turned the bike fell over. When you turn it cuts too sharp and the bike tips over. After three times of getting hurt that was it and he will not ride the bike now. We thought maybe he was too young so we let our neighbors son ride, he is four he also fell twice and will not ride. Last but not least we let a 5 year old try she also fell twice and that was it for her. They look at the bike as if to say, \\"I'm not riding that bike.\\" So now it sits in our garage. I will say though it is a beautiful bike just not made to turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heed the warnings--don't buy this trike","review":"I didn't heed the warnings, because some people gave this trike 5 stars and some gave it 1, with little middle ground. I loved the looks of the tricycle so much I decided to listen to the 5-star people. I wish I hadn't. My son is almost 3, and he's 40 inches tall and weighs 39 pounds, so he's not a tiny guy. He's learned he'd better not turn the handlebar very fast or he'll tip over. He's learned he'd better not pedal very fast or he'll tip over. I've learned I'd better be ready to grab him at any moment or he'll be tangled up on the ground with a tricycle on top of him. The center of gravity in this trike is WAY too high and is dangerous. I suppose it must work better for bigger kids (i.e. 5 and up), but definitely not for its intended users, ages 3 and 4. His little Roadmaster tricycle we bought at a garage sale is way better, because it won't tip over no matter what he does.Trikes should be made to go fast and be stable, and this one does not fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bike should be recalled","review":"My daughter received this tricylcle for her second birthday. She is very tall for her age and already knew how to pedal a trike. She was so excited to get her first bike, but that excitement turned to frustration very quickly. She tipped over every time, even when she was not moving--just leaning over to look at the pedals. The center of gravity on this tricycle is much too high and the back wheel base is too narrow. We went to ToysRUs and let my daughter try out several other trikes and she loves the Kiddi-O Supertrike 4. A great bike that isn't a health hazard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remix by The Bug, nice sounds all round","review":"A nice little package as the first Nicolette release this year. Four tracks with three I haven't hear before. The 1st song is a bit different fromthe one onnthe album, so it's good for collecters, a great song anyway with nice lyrics abnd drum nbass influence. The second one is my favourite, the Bug Remix. I know the Bug's work and this a departure even for him, dancefloor friendly, space-age sounding, bass booming treasure. The third song is the album version with all the shouty people, and the last song is a rare version of an older Nicolette song, No govermnent. I don't think this version was released before, it's sounds very space-age and deep and a bit dubby, a bit like 'ghost town\\". Like this a lot too.

Luke Haines's disturbing and riveting vocals, complimented by some of the most menacing guitar ever put down on tape, as well as a truly unnerving and atmospheric production, are so far above most other pop music produced at the time as to make its comparative anonymity extremely puzzling. Like the first two Auteurs records, as well as one or two of their singles (notably the title cut of the EP \\"Kid's Issue\\"), this is a record of such forcefulness and melodic and lyrical ingenuity as to be indispensible to every serious contemporary pop music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole story","review":"i certainly cannot improve on the review done by the man from Camp Lejeune, so be sure to read that review. I have not read Stanley Karnow's book on Vietnam although I found his Pulitzer-Prize-winning book In Our Image, on the Phillipines exceptionally good. My only complaint about this book is that it is hard to read straight through since the sidebars don't end on the same page and so sometimes one is reading a sidebar and when finishing it has to go back and find out where one left on in the main text. But if one wants a balanced view of the conflict--probably more critical of the war than some enthusiasts for it--this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Kindle Edition","review":"This book should be judged for what it is; a seventy year old high school text with an over-emphasis on economic determinism. The Kindle Edition is done nicely; the illustrations are surprisingly clear and attractive, and the maps are usable. The index functions. The topical structure at the end is very nice; if you are a teacher looking for a new approach this is interesting and gives many possibilities. If you can get the free \\"public domain\\" edition of the book it makes an excellent supplementary work for your students; just add on a few questions! If you want to know why today's students read and write so poorly just compare this text with a modern unreadable \\"committee written\\" text.

I disagree their bag is all that functional. The straps are way too long. If you carry it in your hand not on your shoulder it touches the ground. And I'm tall. The rubbery straps on the stroller clips were a great idea because they grip to the stroller frame but one rubber strap snapped and broke already after light use for only 4 months. The bag is tall but not wide at the bottom so I can't fit as much as I'd like in it. All in all I'm glad I got this as a gift instead of purchasing it myself. I wouldn't recommend it to others.

I said I didn't want to pay postage I just wanted to purchase them in some store, convenient to me, and she went off so I hung up. Went on line and found Amazon.com carries them. Tried to order them from Amazon.com and they no longer carry them! So, I spent money on this gadget for additional stress which God knows there's plenty of without this.

This book is an amazing story for anyone who has been touched by the 9/11 tragedy and how life is too precious to waste. Ian and Lisel's story draws you in while the sub-plot with Rick and Faith makes you believe in both love and second chances.

Most of the music here was rather unknown, except to diehard fans. But, it clearly is one of the best CDs by Morrison that I have. There are so many musical instruments playing.Much is from his spiritually inspired, meditations and mystic phrases in his career. The song \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" is a traditional gospel song from the days of slavery when children were sold from mothers.What really stands out for me are two songs not written by Morrison, the very beautiful \\"Don't Look Back\\", written by John Lee Hooker. I haven't really heard his version, but after this version, I'm not sure anyone can match. The other standout is Bob Dylan's \\"It's all Over Now Baby Blue\\".Every song is amazing; some serene, some Irish folksy, like \\"I'll Tell Ma\\". But mostly, the CD is with Morrison style, jazzy, bluesy, folksy, inspirational.

The portrait photos are strangely lit and poorly posed, with an emphasis on presenting the subjects as ugly as possible. Maybe Karsh was attempting to make them seem more realistic and down-to-earth, but I felt this was more of an insult to those who time would soon forget.I received this book by accident when I ordered a different title entirely, so after looking this one over, I decided that it wasn't worth keeping or reselling (the going price for this oversized, overweight, coffee-table crowder is only $4.95 used). I tossed it in the trash, even though I dislike throwing any book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"Packed with features this camera could have been much,much better. Unfortunately the autofocus is often terribly slow and inaccurate. Low light focus is downright poor. I have cheaper and older digital cameras that perform better in focusing.

Decided to purchase the G3 over the G5 because they were so similar and the savings was substantial. The pictures are magnificent! The camera is very easy to use...even for a novice. The only negative thing about the camera is what most other people have found with the lens cap and the viewfinder. The viewfinder doesn't bother me because I always use the LCD screen. Canon should consider putting a better lens cap on!! I guess if that is the only thing you can find wrong with a camera then it must be an excellent piece of equipment. Would not hesitate to suggest the purchase of the Canon G3 to anyone.

Fabio does make love to the camera throughout the workout, and he does remind viewers of just how sexy they'll look if they stick to his workout, and the tape is peppered with shots of Fabio working out shirtless on a rooftop, but that's as far as it goes.Fabio is a very likeable host.

Sarah Brightman's Everything's Alright (from Jesus Christ Superstar) is easily my favorite recording of that song and one of the highlights of this compilation, as is her Anything But Lonely (from Aspects of Love).

The selection of songs and performers like Sarah Brighman, Michael Ball and Barbara Streisand were great (although I would have preferred the original cast performing them). However, the quality of the sound was terrible. Most of the songs sounded as though they were sung through a tunnel and/or had a tin-like quality. This is a shame and not acceptable in this day of technical and digital advance. The quality of the sound does not do justice to the quality of the works nor the talented singers performing them.If you are an ALW fan or just want to hear some great soundtracks, I would not recommend getting this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BU..........","review":"IF you wanna watch Judas Priest in their \\"hair metal\\" days, this is the right video for you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Priest Fans, don't bother.

Second trip was the same result - not a single no-see-um bite on me using Cactus Juice, while others, who used other sprays/repellants either had some bites or were covered. I make sure I put Cactus Juice on before going out in the morning and especially after scuba diving, as they seem to love salty skin.

His playing is exquisite and full of true love for the music. He has a very good sense of the requirements for playing these pieces with the delicacy and drama inherent in the music. His dynamic range is superb and any small flaws in the recording the softest passages are to be attributed to the recording process by Bridge Records rather than to his performance. Mr.Bartanan is a vigorous young artist who has a prodigious record already and a great future as far as we can predict. This early recording by him is a gem!

His fling is a blackmailing psychopath who wants a valuable set of imported diamonds from South Africa. Sounds OK on paper. However, the script progresses from humorously predictable to wildly unbelievable - down to the final showdown between the dealer, his wife, and the murderous siren.Eric McCormack (Will & Grace) works too hard as the dealer (especially in the latter part of the film where you can feel him sweating to be intense) and he lacks the charm that he displays on his TV show. Sean Young has little to do as the wife. And \\"Sex & The City's\\" Kim Cattral does her standard seductive woman bit until she becomes comically evil as she starts bumping off those who get in her way. What ultimately brings this down are the same things that can wreck any film - bad script and direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCormack is the only \\"Exception\\" to this \\"Rule\\"","review":"In a nutshell, McCormack does a splendid job considering what, and whom, he has to work with. It's hard to tell if Young is acting or merely reading her lines. Cattrall is absolutely hateful as the evil Carla. The plot is largely predictable, the charaters (as written) are shallow, and everyone involved with McCormack's character (his business partner, his shrink, the evil Carla) are suspect from the get-go. McCormack's acting skills are the only \\"Exception\\" that holds this mess of a \\"Rule\\" together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsurpassed since 1885","review":"For any serious student of Sanskrit Perry's Sanskrit Primer is indispensable. Admittedly, the language is a bit dated, and you have to be willing to learn the argot of classical philology, but the effort is well worth it. Perry dissects the language and reveals all its glorious complexity. Moreover, it was written to accompany Whitney's grammar and is an excellent preparation for Lanman's reader. More \\"modern\\" approaches to Sanskrit (e.g. Teach Yourself Sanskrit) miss there mark by dumbing down the grammar of the language, something you'll regret as you go along. Perry's is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and archaic","review":"While it is true that there is a shortage of introductory Sanskrit textbooks, one could possibly do better than Perry's book. The language is archaic and the explanations often unclear. Frequently, his attempts to help the student become instead a handicap. The exercises are useful, though, and sometimes amusing (as when, in one lesson, you learn words such as kill, poison, beat, hit, maim....). My suggestion would be to use the first few chapters of the Teach Yourself Sanskrit book and then to go straight into Nala (the Lanman Sanskrit Reader is useful) with Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar as aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and interesting almanac.","review":"I work in a public library and I've found this to be a very useful reference source.

Best of all it does not require batteries and is not constantly making beeps and whistles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pound for Pound","review":"My 17 month-old grandson immediately fell in love with the Pound A Ball when he opened the present and after a short lesson in holding the hammer went right to performing as the toy said he would. He had no trouble pounding the balls through and after some iterations, even put the colored balls in the right holes before incessantly pounding on them. Needless to say, it was his favorite toy much to the chagrin of my daughter and son-in-law. I would highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory","review":"I sent this to my daughter for my grandson's first birthday.

You couldn't do it unless you had the strength of an adult.

But I thought it looked interesting, so we tried it anyway. Yes, the balls are too hard for a 1 year old to pound through. My solution was to use a utility knife to carve down the small bumps in the ball holes so it was easy for him to pound them in with the palm of his hand. Mind you, this took me all of 2 minutes to do. He loved it then and he loves it still. He plays with this toy several times a week even after 9 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, lots of fun!","review":"My 3 year old got this toy at 18mo. and loves it. Kids can pick up the ball and place them into the matching color opening (helps them learn colors) and pound to push them through. The ball travels down a track and is dumped into the tray. The hammer has a soft end and a hard end. It's very durable and I love that it's not electronic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Toy!","review":"Our daughter received this toy as a gift, and her arm got stuck in one of the holes at the top while reaching for a ball as it went down. She nearly broke her arm trying to get it out (luckily we were supervising and stepped in). Also, the balls are hard to pound through the holes and since the base is not attached to the main piece, the two separate constantly. This toy was a huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work","review":"Once the balls traveled down the internal slide, they would get stuck at the bottom.

Unfortunately, we have this problem because so many passed away that day. It might have been better to do a one-page tribute to each life, even if meant publishing more than one book. I do give credit for the enourmous task the reporters did in assembling such a mass of information when emotions were raw.

The early 60's stuff has an old-timey R&B; big band feel, and the arrangements sound like a cigarette break (a monster funky cigarette break) for the featured performer. In the later 60's tunes, maybe because of Pee Wee Ellis's arranging, the band takes on its own musical identity and they sound less like a back-up band. Also, while the earlier tunes are attention-getters, later on JB knew everyone was paying attention and the arrangements become laid back.It's all smokin' regardless. Lots of cool pictures, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"90s rock","review":"I didnt really like this album the first couple of times I heard it on my walkman.

It's one of those rare masterpieces where EVERY track rocks. A must for any collector of heavy, edgy, early 90's post-hair-band metal. Truly, every song is awesome.

Throughout the duration, it's hard to turn away from the visceral approach given off by each song. With grooves that attach from the loud punch provided by both the guitar and the bass, it only gets better as Walter Schreifels gives off his emotion driven vocals.This album has no separate standouts, but it doesn't need them, as every song shows off Schreifels' creative songwriting that gives off volatile and dynamic brilliance. The production is also worth noting, as it carries a trademark sound that may have been reflective of its time, but doesn't sound dated at all. There are no dull moments on Slip, just pure inspiration and passion throughout its 40 minute duration."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This is no Slip of greatness\\"","review":"All I have to say is, this is one of my All-Time favorite albums ever.

NO! IT'S FRICKIN QUICKSAND! Yup. It is a shame that this band never hit it big because they could become a household name just like Tool is now.

It took me a while to connect w/ that cd, but I love it now. I was reluctant to pick up her newest cd \\"Educated Guess\\" after hearing her newest sounds (jazzier, softer, and more polished). I read the reviews on here and decided I should get it, since most people said it was the for die-hard Ani fans (which I am), and that she had gone back to her \\"raw\\" sounds. I was really disappointed. I've tried listening to it over and over, and I have yet to attatch myself to any of it. I find it sounds punchy- disconnected, almost off-key. This is the first album of hers which I haven't liked AT ALL. I should have picked up the \\"SO much Laughter...\\" cd pkg instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not the best","review":"i've been a fan of Ani since the first albums and have every album. i love her solo stuff and have enjoyed a lot of her music with a band. i listened to this album closely and can't believe how bad it is. there isn't a single song on here that i want to listen to again. her live version of 'swim' is good, but the album version doesn't capture the song. some songs are downright horrible - dissonance in a bad way. the harmonies aren't there either. i saw her perform live solo and was blown away that she still had it. it's unfortunate to hear that she didn't translate that power to a studio album. it's even worse than 'up, up, up, up, up, up ...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I've been a huge fan of Ani's music over the years, so much so that my wife thinks I'm nuts.

As someone else said, if it didn't have the name Ani DiFranco on the cover and you'd heard it beforehand, you'd never have bought it. I understand all the inward reflection on divorce and all that, but where in God's name is the MUSIC?!? Holy moly, this album sucked! If you want to listen to someone sing about pain and the human condition, go buy a Patty Griffin album. Any Patty Griffin album. Patty is very painful to listen to, but in my opinion, it's also fun to listen to because the MUSIC is so incredible. And that is what is so sorely lacking here -- MUSIC. You want to vent your rants, fine. But don't put in on disc and expect us to pay our money to hear your dreck. Wow, I'm angry at this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"My educated Guess","review":"I think Ani is in an artistic doldrum. I was so excited that she was going to release a solo album, but after hearing it I'm quite disappointed. Who cares if she did it all herself if it sounds this bad. She got carried away on the mixing. Her voice sounds bad. This is coming from a fervent Ani fan. Worst of all her lyrics aren't the beautifully perfect poetry they once were. Every artist of every medium has their less than inspiring moments. This is hers. I recommend Laura Love to all you Ani fans. When in a similar position as Ani Laura simply said \\"I'd like to write a song that would just rock your world but I've fallen and I can't get up so I'll just stay down right here on the ground.\\" (happy little song) ---and that right on satire makes her less than wonderous work ART.

Even if the CD isn't a hit (R/R for example.) So, I cringed and kept listening through this one. Not only is there there nothing, the CD is actually difficult to listen to. For those with a musical ear, I'm sure you will find it takes its unusual melodies and harmonies too far and leaves you with a headache. As for the lyrics, I found them pretentious, especially in some of the spoken word. I'll give it a few more listens to see if I acclimatize to it... but for now, I don't recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"listen for yourself!!!","review":"Many reviews of Ani's Educated Guess saddens me.What matters most is whether the music, or song (even, part or a song), hold some significance to the listener.\\"Career\\" and comparisons are ultimately unimportant, unless you are a, so called, music-historian, or worse, critic.If money is THE ISSUE listen before you buy - preferably on a system which does music reproduction justice. For example, my uncle's system (Marantz SA14ver2 player & Marantz PM14mk2KI amp) Ani's albums sound very close to the bliss of her concerts.Please, borrow the album from a friend or a library, and judge for yourself whether to purchase.Personally, I am very fond of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALRIGHT","review":"So, this album is good, dont get me wrong, but she has put out better. I've listened to this album 8 times and i still think it has an original sound...it was compared to her earlier stuff just cuz she did it all herself, but it's not like ANY of that at all (even though there is a bunch of spoken poetry on it) but it's nothing like her latest (i.e. Evolve) either...it's good all in it's own.

However, this CD just doesn't have the spark that many of her other releases do. Although there are a few good songs on this album, it is seriously lacking in the lyrics department. Also, the instrumental sequences are not up to par. Many would argue that to be an unjust statement, because Ani did all the vocals, instruments, and mixing for this CD. But what good did all that work do? This album is dismal and lacks the spark that many of Ani's other releases capture. Hopefully she'll bounce back with her next one.If you are looking to buy an Ani album, I would not recommend this one. Try: Not A Pretty Girl, Dilate, Little Plastic Castle, or To the Teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wrong Guess","review":"Clearly, this album was very healing for Ani to record. For me, the listener, however, his album was anything but healing. I saw Ani in '02 (I think) at Beacon Theatre and one of the songs she did, solo, was Educated Guess. I absolutely loved the song and found a live radio mp3 of her performing it which was beyond words. I was very, very excited for the album. When I listened to the album version, my heart sank. I found the vocals in the background to be nothing short of nauseating. I gave some other songs a listen but was unable to make it past 3 or 4 songs. Even some of the other songs which she had previously done live were absolutely wrecked on their studio versions.I guess there are some people who appreciate this style of music that Ani does with this album. I would definitely listen to some clips before I spend any money on an album that could potentially be hated.The packaging is well-done, but I bought the album for the quality of the music, not the casing for a plastic disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another mystery song(or the same one)...","review":"What is the song playing(the techno, not sitar) on the underground part of the rich guys party?

Every aspect of this album is a work of art. From the slick, well illustrated booklet and packaging to the music itself. Scathing vocal fury reminiscent of an angry Rollins, meshed perfectly with a metallic, noise-damaged twin guitar attack and flailing drums.

Technically accomplished & giving deep insight into the romantic heart of the music, these are performances that bear repeated listenings. No doubt the romantic image is enhaced by Ms Clein being a very photogenic young lady.The one little complaint pertains to the audio quality of the CD, what I perceive to be an unnatural boost of the dynamic range, particularly the lower bass which booms at times, not as annoying as a turbo-charged subwoofer in a small car but enough to require correction. These boosts may actually be to some folks liking, but not to this old codger.John Spivey"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like stinky, cold coffee, this is the model/brand for you!","review":"Thankfully I got this coffee maker as a gift...Horrible!

It beeps to notify you it is done brewing, but it does not finish brewing. I pour 12 cups of water in and get 8 cups back. If I tap the side of it and leave it for over an hour it will eventually come near to finish brewing - say about 10 cups - but leaving it on the hot plate for over an hour does not make for good tasting coffee. The first time this happened I didn't notice it hadn't made the whole 12 cups until I had already shut it off. The next morning when I poured 12 cups in it leaked all over the counter because the reservoir was full; this was my first indication that it hadn't been done brewing. It is an interesting design, particularly for a retro kitchen, but I recommend buying something else that won't cause problems in a year. I won't purchase Mr. Coffee products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for about a year, then watch out...","review":"We've had this coffee maker for about two years now and we need a new one (NOT this one).

Even with cleaning, the coffee maker brews slowly and inconsistently (i.e. put in 12 cups, get 10 cups of usually burnt coffee).

So I pulled it apart, only to find that there was a glued gasket holding the two halves together. So now it is in somewhat fragile in its state, as I pushed the two parts together loosely. And the display glass in the middle still moves about.Temperature-wise, it seems plenty accurate from 0F up to 72 F. The time constant is long. It settles over 10's of minutes.Not robust enough, but it looks cute, and is accurate. The suction cup is a wishful artifice. The case would have been more useful if it had a hanging hook somewhere.

I noticed that when I took a small piece of meat out of the freezer to defrost overnight in the fridge, the meat was still frozen solid the next day. So I set the refrigerator to a warmer setting. This thermometer now reads 50 degrees. If that reading were accurate, my food should be spoiling, my milk should go sour quickly, etc. That is not happening.

If you can't find the album you might want to try and email Jellybean records and tell them to re-release it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable Kitchen Helper","review":"Since I am the type of cook that likes to cook on a whim, I frequently start without the proper ingredients. This little book helps me to prevent flops in the kitchen. I like the way the substitutions are listed in descending order of preference. Also, some substitutions require an adjustment of other ingredients and this is mentioned also. I have taped this poem into the inside cover of my well-worn copy:I didn't have potatoes, so I substituted rice;I didn't have paprika so I used another spice.I didn't have tomato sauce: I used tomato paste(A whole can, not a half can - I don't believe in waste!)A friend gave me the recipe; she said you couldn't beat it.There must be something wrong with her: I couldn't even eat it!(Author unknown)There are also useful recipes interspersed throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"I bought this book when we lived in the \\"sticks\\" and some ingredients just weren't available. The book allowed me to make a variety of ethnic dishes by substituting local ingredients. My seventeen year old granddaughter threatens to take the book to college so I am getting her a copy.

Randles takes the thinking so common to these movements and draws the line to logical conclusions--something folks in the movements do not do. How wonderful it sounds to tell people that we are too caught up in doctrine and need to get out of our heads and let God move--but if one works that out, step by step, the conclusion is that doctrine is unnecessary, God hates intellect and thoughtful study, and we are so powerful that we could actually stand in the way of God.This book is painfully poorly written but, bless his heart, Randles is a good thinker. He needs some major proofreading and editing help but this book is excellent in presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"China JUNK!!!","review":"Seller said it was made and machined in the USA and it came and it's made in CHINA and I cant get my shipping and price paid back NEVER AGAIN will I buy from AMAZON NEVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the bass?","review":"I have gone to see the Moody's three times in the last ten years, the first time with the full blown orchestra ala Red Rocks. I've always enjoyed their music and was excited to see the concert come out on CD. Then I listened to the CD and scratched my head, granted they never were a \\"heavy\\" group but John Lodge's bass lines were a foundation for their songs and it is missing in action. I tried cranking up the bass control but there's nothing there! What a disappointment! Did I just get a bad copy or is everybody else reviewing this album listening on a 2 inch speaker. I didn't think it would bother me too much at first, but I don't listen to it anymore because I find such pansy sonic quality irritating.

Try to imagine Justin Hayward madly strumming the opening chords of \\"Question\\" on electric guitar, for example. Well, unfortunately, you don't get that kind of rowdiness and spontanaeity on this album. All the tracks somewhat weakly mirror the better studio versions. Also, their voices are not ageing well. Justin Hayward is so laughably Briish on \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and Ray Thomas' awful warbling on \\"For My Lady\\" made my 4-year-old daughter cry when she first heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in a long time","review":"Ever since Jonah (it was good but fell a little flat) I have been a little dissapointed with VeggieTales.

In Minnesota Cuke, Minnesota (Larry) has to stop the Canadians from taking over both sides of Niagara Falls. So, he needs to find Samson's Hairbrush, a hairbrush with powers.No matter how old you are (considering I'm 11), Minnesota Cuke is a great Veggietales adventure with lots of action.

I know that most ordinary citizens would probably choose a root canal over the prospect of having to ask someone for a big ($500 to $5000) donation, even for a cause they really care about. But with the help of this book, you'll feel confident that you could really do the things that the author, Andy Robinson, is suggesting. Why? Because Andy de-mystifies the process of fundraising by breaking it down into easily conceivable steps. And, you feel like you can trust him because he seems like a regular guy, not a superhero. If he's done it, then you can too. I like that he shares what's worked for him. An added benefit -- you can read this enjoyable book in less than an hour.

I thought the two ladies on the other hand were amazing watching life change and being two Females and African American.Being a person of disability I can relate to the two ladies in society that has flaws when it comes to people who are not the standered but stand out. The book should have had a little more dialogue, somtimes the book would just leave me dangling in mid air.

I have never been so bored by a book in my entire life. the stories of their lives cannot be extraplated to stand for larger ideas in the world, and the author fails in trying to do so. The book does not seem to end. I had to put it down barely half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Boring","review":"This book was absolutely the most boring book I've ever read! The sisters take up about 20 pages just explaining who's who in their family, which was just about the most unbelievably dull experience I've ever had reading. Also, they always manage to sound like they were and are perfect people. It's a great premise for a book, but the story is lost when Bessie and Sadie only speak of what great things they did, and not of what the blacks of that time period did. I love Black History, but this book was an extreme disappointment to me. I'd rather read a school textbook than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my opinion","review":"I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who would like to learn more about America's history over the past 100 years. Or, you can read it just to be entertained from the point of view of two old ladies sharing their humorous biography. This book keeps the reader in tune with both of the sisters' feelings, who led very interesting lives. I must say that both sisters tend to be opiniated; but, they have a right to be, and they are just sharing with the world these insightful views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isadora Duncan: Movement From the Soul [VHS]","review":"Isadora Duncan: Movement From the SoulExcellent documentary of the Artistic contribution of an American Pioneer Dancer who emerged from the isolation and restrictions of the 19th Century through her own vision and perservation to inspire fellow artists and audiences in the Western world.

Althought I understand that the footage is old, I had no idea that it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography!It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly, and due to the absence of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breathing cannot be heard.The video is blurry, dark and visually \\"noisy\\".

Psychotic and confused, Crystal is all too familiar with an unstable home life. Her mother's boyfriend impregnates her and Crystal, barely out of elementary school becomes a casualty of the system. She makes the rounds of hospitals, treatment centers and schools. At each stop she wonders what place exists for her and her child.This author provides a calming voice of reason to Crystal's plight. To her credit, she does not villify or condemn even the harshest of people and conditions. She writes in a tone of respect and even acceptance. If nothing else, this book is a reminder of each person's duty to care about the needs of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking look at a modern teenage mom's life.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was REAL. It covers the lives of three generations in the foster care system. The main character is a teenage mom who puts her baby son in foster care while she herself is a client of the foster care system. It was gritty and authentic. I felt I was living beside the characters. I really understood how it feels to grow up in the ghetto. Susan Sheehan is an excellent writer. She has pointed out some of the faults in our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was a book assigned for a social work class and the author known to my professor.

If there was ever a book desperately in need of a good editor, it is this one. I can only assume that this book must be of the \\"self-published\\" variety. By the end of the second page, I had an overwhelming urge to whip out my red pen so I could correct the grammar and restructure sentences. I do a lot of writing and editing in my job, so perhaps I'm more sensitive to these things, but after 4 chapters I couldn't take it anymore and I put the book in my \\"donate to the library\\" pile.Obviously, because this book has received some 5 star reviews, some people aren't bothered by the technical shortcomings of this publication.

I called the Terra Nova company (which should be called the Terrible Nova company) to return the perfume and I was told that I could only have a store credit and not a refund.

MacArthur aids by first examinining the essentials to motivate one to find the true confession, then be a person of discernment, which is the true way to live without compromise.Great advice throughout this work, e.g. \\"Growing in deeper knowledge of Christ is a lifelong process that will not be complete until we see our Lord face to face,\\" and \\"Unity of faith is impossible unless it is built on the foundation of commonly held truth.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Integrity: Building a Life Without Compromise","review":"This falls in line with a teaching received at our church recently.

Story: Barely interesting, and then the terrible effects kills it. Most of the acting is horrible (which is somewhat entertaining).

After inspecting the ingredients, trying to figure out the problem, I discovered it's full of fillers, and more importantly lake colors. A lake color will only disperse in oil, sucrose, or alcohol. It's also the same stuff you find in your makeup. What do you think that does to a poor fish's digestive system? I will never buy this again.

It gives you reliable infomation about what will grow and what is wishful thinking. It is also great for what it doesn't waste time on, e.g., it does not use up space telling you how to winterize your roses or the best varieties of lilacs or how to make cold frames. It does, however, go into great detail about that things that matter to us Southerners, such as azaelas, and it has a wonderful section on \\"Southern Heritage\\" plants.

It's a pale imitation of other better films; yes, certainly, I can't argue that. All the characters are \`types' needed to move the story along and good for little else (except shark food). The story is basic, very similar to others. Not a lot of imagination went into it, that's obvious. But, I still like it. I've always been a fan of Robert Davi and Kristy Swanson (I even liked D.B. Sweeney in this case). Having a fondness for certain actors helps elevate what might otherwise prove tedious. Also, being a killer shark flick gives it an immediate pass (even when the shark is rarely seen except for its fin). It's dopey, it's dumb, it's a visual feast of junk food proportions; I just had to have it for my shark movie collection. I refuse to apologize for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbed with this book","review":"This book was a complete waste of money for me. Not only that, but I didn't even feel right about reselling it, so I threw it away. The author picked apart the Old Testament, saying the gospels are the only part of the bible to believe. He also talked about \\"Hell\\" as being a \\"realm\\" where the spirits of people who died were full of hate. He did not mention the fact that there is a real hell with fire, anguish and complete separation from God awaiting those who do not accept Jesus as their savior. He also said many other things that were way off. I have heard so many stories of after death experiences that all agreed, making them believable.

Some of the Lord's children are addicted, but I believe they are freed after they return to Him, just as are the ones who might have been in great suffering from cancer or other things before their death.

Yes, some people who are conservative or traditional may balk at some of the doctor's experiences, however the Bible itself is full of amazing and other world experiences at times. Are we so jaded and so sure as a world now that we aren't worthy of those amazing and other world experiences that we cannot accept them, even if they can transform lives for only the better?

He includes many of these concepts in his practice as a doctor.

Admittedly, there has always been a hardline element in SE, but these clowns go way overboard. What's the difference between Earth Crisis' \\"philosophy\\" and that of evangelical zealots who bomb abortion clinics?

If you are vegan and support the fight for animal liberation - then this album will rev you up and make you want to go out do some direct action. Check out lyrics to the song, 'Wrath of Sanity', \\"Night of justice, knight of justice.Liberation's crusade's begun. Your laws will have no meaning past the setting of the sun. Demons feeding off of the innocents' pain. Generations of oppression - one generation will break this chain. Emancipation from the hands of the deranged. ... I refuse to shut my eyes. Steadfast against the deluge of evil of man's devise. The quest for their freedom won't cease until it's won.\\"All the billions of animals enslaved in farm factories, and all the millions of animals tortured in labs are hoping you will listen to this album - and then go out and do something to help them.It's time to make a difference. It's time for total animal liberation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not metal, PUNK!","review":"For one thing if you think this band is any kind of metal you're wrong. It's HARDCORE straight-edge PUNK! , and they're not Neo-Nazi punks either, you can tell by the lyrics, they're lyrics simply state (especially in this album)that they are fed-up with the ignorrant wrongs of modern day society and there needs to be changes.Although \\"Destroy the Machines\\" is an increadibly powerful album (lyrically),I find the music and melody to be somewhat slow and boring on a few tracks, butthey are heavy, and the lyrics have a lot of thought put into them. Good album, but in my opinion it's not as good as their 1996 release \\"Gommorrah's Season Ends,\\" which is, in my mind, a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Lith Ion","review":"Save your $$$$$ and but the 3 bay Lith Ion charger instead!!

THANKS FOR NOTHING MILWAUKEE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi-Bay Charger has some problems","review":"The concept and design of the Milwaukee Multi-Bay charger is fantastic. If they work out the bugs it should win an award. The problem is that the device (at least the one I bought in December 2003) doesn't do what it is supposed to do. By design the device should charge your batteries, then keep them in \\"trickle charge\\" mode to top them off. This is supposed to maintain battery life, and ensure maximum power. If I leave my batteries on the charger longer than about an hour they are completely dead when I take them off. So far Milwaukee has failed to admit to this problem (go to the message board in the \\"Heavy Duty Club\\" on their website.) If you buy one, make sure you keep your receipt and understand the return policy. If they have worked out the bugs on newer chargers you'll love it. If not, get back to the store ASAP to get your money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite product for installations","review":"I'm shocked and dismayed that the other reviewer had so many problems with their charger.

It's one of the primary reasons that we chose to stay with the Milwaukee line of cordless products and haven't had any problems with them (using 18V and 14.4V batteries).

Assembly instructions were poor. I do not reccommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"This is the shoddiest piece of plastic you'll spend $200 on. The holes for the poles to slide through were poorly punched, and there were punched out plastic discs lodged inside the panels that will slide and rattle unless you fiddle with them and pry them out. Due to poor craftsmanship and poor packaging on Rubbermaid's part, most of my edges where the holes are were all crushed, beaten up, deformed etc. causing the fit and finish of the product to be horrible. The doors are sloppy and don't close all the way. You have to repeatedly open and close them while banging the plastic parts to get everything to set in and it still looks like crap. Doors feel like they catch on certain parts where the plastic was damaged during packaging/shipping. However, it is quite large and roomy, 3 shelves, the storage shelves themselves are slotted to reduce debris build up on the shelves. In the end it does its job as a cabinet but just is poor quality and looks like crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubbermaid Up-Right","review":"The product went together quickly and for the most part well, my real complaint would be the quality of craftsmanship in the machined product, a lot of waste still either in the item or in the box, some manufacturing was sloppy but over-all the piece is doing exactly what it was purchased to do, its not our first Rubbermaid storage unit product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Every box was damaged and when opened were used and broken by someone before and just retapped in the box.

Assembly was easy--like several other reviewers, I too found that using a heavy rubber mallet was more essential than optional to fit the pieces together. Be prepared to clean out lots of disk-shaped pieces of plastic from the hollow of the panels (normal by-products of the manufacturing process), unless you're content to let those waste pieces rattle inside the panels. Of course, once you have the cabinet assembled and filled with whatever you fill it with, it's not going to be moving--so you won't hear any rattles (except possibly in the door panels). If you can live with junk pieces inside the panels, that will save you several minutes during the assembly process.All in all, I'm happy with my purchase; I'm using the cabinet in my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not the build-quality you would expect from Rubbermaid; definitely spend your money on something else. UPS delivered this package with their usual finesse - smashed, dented, and broken in a couple places. It is easy to build - no tools needed; and no screws, etc. But the doors do not line up, and the unit really does not 'finish' well. The tubes used to hold the unit together have no cover on top - so I suspect it will fill up with garage gook over time. Costco sells a similar-type unit for a third less of the price and the build seems superior. My two cents here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbermaid storage cabinet","review":"The item I purchased as new was not new. Its shipping package was totally destroyed.

Suits my needs perfectly.

As we began the assembly, it became clear that some pieces still had small, loose pieces rattling around inside them or still attached. Fortunately, we had a rubber mallet because assembly would have been impossible without the use of that tool. There were no printed instructions, only the pictures on the box where no parts were identified by letter. The 15 minute assembly time was not accurate. It took two adults about 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in Rubbermaid storage cabinet","review":"Very sloppily made kit and over priced.

It is very sturdy and will hold oh so many items. The doors are stiff opening and closing but I imagine they will wear in in time and not be so stiff.The only think wrong with this is that their quallity control missed that one of the doors had no holes made in it for the hinge type insertion of the pole. We muddled through and was able to make the holes ourselves but that should not have been missed and made the assembly take so much longer than it should have. There also were no instructions in the box, I had to search online for assembly instructions to print out. Other than that I am ver pleased with this.I want to mention too that the shelving is not solid except for the bottom shelf. The shelving has a grid like in it, maybe for ventilation among the shelves??"},{"rating":"1","title":"smashed sides and backs in the box, poor, thin, areas","review":"I was quite shocked at the cheapness of the manufacturing.

Too late to return it. It is together and I have recycled the box. I will caulk every area I can and hope that it stays together.very disappointed. $260.00 is not the amount I would have paid for that lack of quality!I ordered another rubbermaid tool shed the same day and that one was perfect and much more protected in shipping.

The review of a particular pseudo-academe should have warned me of the shallowness and ingrained \`cultural' single-vision of the author - but I went ahead and entered a feast of illiteracy and generalizations the like of which exists only in medieval travelogues. If one believes that an Arab barely makes it as a human being, this book is a gem. It eases the suggested pains' of encountering an Arab and the implied \`torment' of visiting an Arab country.On the other hand, if one considers the Arabs as a group of peoples with differing cultures, habits and customs, some of which do accord with Western (even Orientalist) perception of culture, other do not, then the book is offending, insensitive and is a caricature of an anthropological sketch."},{"rating":"1","title":"mistaken for the textbook","review":"I purchased this in the belief that it was the textbook.It wasnt.It has nice pictures but are kind of useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth Portrait of a Planet","review":"As I never received the book it would be impossible to review it.

I checked both batteries with a mete and one battery was +1.66V (instead of 3V) and the other was -0.91 volts. I checked the accuracy of this gauge and it's pretty much right on with three other gauges, one of which has been calibrated recently. I'm still considering returning this one too, I should not have to buy new batteries for a brand new gauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of admission.","review":"I like the fit & finish of this tire pressure gauge, and the large backlit display is excellent. The small built-in LED light is nearly useless unless you plan to air up your tires in the pitch black night. If there is a streetlight or a flashlight within 50 yards of your vehicle, the LED light is rendered useless.The rubber cover over the measuring end slides forward every time you press the gauge onto the valvestem, which is about 3 to 4 times per tire because the gauge does not contact the valve stem very well. I tried holding it several different ways and only 1 in 4 pressure checks were successful. The remainder of the time I either got 00.0 psi or about 20 psi, which is 15 to 20 psi below what I know the tires to have.I would not buy this product again. The sheath it came in is fantastic, though, and probably where about 45% of the purchase price went. Oh well.

It is a sweeping melancholic ballad featuring an achingly yearning vocal performance from lead singer Joel Pott, surging orchestration, and filled with static effects and distorted sounding guitars against a piano/string backdrop. Reportedly recorded for his sick infant. Definitely one of my top songs of this year!The uptempo \`Half light' incorporates electronic bleeps and a catchy Britpop sound. There's the melodic \`Tourist', and the stirring, string drenched ballad \`Chances' with pensive lyrics about seizing chances while you can.\`If I found out' is a sweeping epic and an almost gospel feel from the lyrics, and the backing choir.

One really bad girl, and four of her wantabe bad girl friends, who are held over during Easter week at their Catholic girls school, discover a book of spells in a church renovation and decide to give them a try. Of course, the have to enlist the help of the only good girl to translate it from latin (makes a good case for doing your homework doesn't it?). It's good girl against the baddies as they try to open the gates of hell.After a few sexy scences in the first half, the film mostly lacks action until the last twenty minutes or so. A taught score during the climax (so to speak) and some moments of rather inspired acting/directing are not enough to save it however. Too bad - this could have been a much better film, and the viewer is left wondering at the end just what the heck happened.B"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's beyond words...","review":"The movie pushes the envelope of bad directing and bad acting and don't even get me started on the writing... Me and my buddies checked the movie out because we saw the box and thought it was going to be a cool cheesy horror movie... but it wasn't cool at all. The \\"good\\" lead character was whiney, the \\"bad\\" lead character was lame-acting and dances so badly in her nude Striptease scene that she's an affront to all white people. The best-looking and interesting girls hardly talked or didn't speak at all. I'm talking about the hot black girl who hardly had any lines and was obviously given all the bad joke lines and the sexy blonde who didn't get to say a thing. Oye,they were the only reason me and my friends sat through the movie and we felt cheated. The plot made no sense and the editing was horrific... but I guess that's why you don't see Jane Simpson's name on any other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie shouldnt have been made","review":"really stupid because it was so cheesy.and the worst acting ive ever seen.on the back of the movie, i thought the movie looked good but then i saw it on TV and hated it.dont waste your time on this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing rip off of The Craft","review":"I got out this film, hoping it would be really good! Oh dear - what a huge disappointment! The film just seemed to re-work the whole storyline of The Craft - good versus evil, except it was well-done in The Craft. The lead girl, in Little Witches seemed to be a carbon copy of Nancy from The Craft. The rest of the girls weren't any better. This movie sucked badly - my advice? Rent/buy The Craft instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bimbos in the Basement","review":"Cheap sets and Papist-mocking are not the appeal of this weak-scripted travesty. Voyeurs may find comfort in \\"star\\" Sheeri Rappoport, whose face could freeze water but otherwise is a knockout, and some associate witches. The legendary Z. Rubenstein is strangely cast as a nun who gets poisoned by Sheeri. One odd thing is reference to the Illuminati, who supposedly became brides of Satan a century ago, but paid the price. That may shock people who know the true identity of the group. It is worth viewing for the flesh alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!","review":"If you are looking for a stupid, cheesy movie... you found it! Therrible acting, plot, and overall movie. There is no one you will recognize except maybe for Clea Duvall ( She was in THE FACULTY and GIRL, INTERRUPTED). There are some scenes taht will make you want to throw up with pity for whover has seen and whoever made this god awful movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED THIS MOVIE!","review":"This movie was the cheesiest, stupidest film ever to be created. It was terrible acting, a weak plot, and scenes that made you want to throw up, not from gore but from pity. The only person you might recognize in the movie is Clea Duvall, who was in THE FACULTY and GIRL, INTERRUPTED. But other than that, not one single person in the movie is worth metioning. Don't waist your time on this stupid movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GIRL COULDN'T DANCE","review":"Well, I must say that this is a terrible film. I only saw it because a friend of mine gave it to me (along with Kids which is actually quite good) as a gag gift for Christmas. He told me that the acting was horrible (and it is), that in a pointless stripping scene the girl couldn't dance (and she can't), but there's a lot of pointless nudity and the bad acting is funny (which is also true). Me and my friend are movie addicts and we don't plan on ever sobering up. I find that this movie is just sorta fun to watch in-between serious movies. And I found something intriguing about an overweight girl in a nude scene...you dont really get to see that much. A cheap rip-off of the Craft and an insult to viewers....but it could be fun to make fun of with some friends in a Mystery Science Theatre vein...this would be MST3K after dark though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth seeing for Clea DuVall's debut.................","review":"This movie was incredibly bad. I cannot believe that the director was female - there was too much pointless and gratuitous nudity within the film. I mean, did we really want to see Sheeri Rapaport completely naked? Especially if this film was supposed to be a 'chick flick' - an amateur porn film more like! I remember watching this, and thinking that DuVall was the only actress worth watching, and that hopefully she would go on to bigger and better things. Believe me, she has. Check her out in The Faculty, and the upcoming Girl, Interrupted and The Astronaut's Wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, unentertaining","review":"The Craft was sexy because of their clothes and personality, not because they didn't wear any. This movie just bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming features","review":"The idea of a movie much like \\"The Craft,\\" but replacing all of what was good about that not-particularly-great movie with nudity instead doesn't sound like a horrible idea -- not a great movie, perhaps, but a dumb fun one at least.Nope. \\"Little Witches\\" is staggeringly stupid, poorly acted and the nudity ... ahem. Not to be cruel, but if nudity is all that you've really got to sell your movie, shouldn't the cast look really good naked?This isn't a \\"good\\" bad movie. It's just plain bad.Watch it on cable for free, if you must, although I can't imagine you'll enjoy it on any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Nudity","review":"This movie wasbad. i mean bad.

Who coreographed this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth was this?","review":"The beginning was quite sexy and so was the lead girl. I believe her name was Jamie. It was such a silly plot and a really bad, unrealistic story line. And there was this one blonde girl in the group and she wasn't in some scenes but she was always there and she never said anything. That really bothered me Overall, the movie was entertaining in most scenes but some of them you have to fast forward out of pure boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"I just recently bought this movie and now want to warn anyone against it. I bought it because I like the movie \\"The Craft\\" (the one with Neve Campbell) and was hoping to find another movie like it since I find that subject interesting. I was so disappointed in Little Witches. It is TERRIBLE. There's hardly any magic spells (beyond cheesey ritual and bringing about one sad looking demon) and it has the worst ending. It answers NO questions. One minute it's at its \\"climax\\" (if you can call it that) and then suddenly, without transition, it's done. Some scenes are semi-pornographic and it all is just incredibly stupid. It's a horrible waste of money. I feel sorry for anyone who reads these reviews and still takes a chance on the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it a negative 5 if there was one......","review":"I dont even have to see this movie to know it is totally fake..just like the craft. I am a witch and very affended by this movie and many others that portray Witches as being evil. The Best movie I saw one The Craft is Practical Magic. But if u do see this movie and the craft dont think it is real...please dont."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast forward review","review":"Sleaze fans expect certain things from satan in girl's school films, some shower or getting ready for bed nudity, maybe a little girl-girl playing around in the dorm at night when the matron's not looking, and then of course the usual cult dancing around nekkid or in robes scene, an altar scene with the fount of all evil himself or maybe a stand-in wearing goat horns about to get the virgin before the hero shows up (these cults always have lousy security), and if you're really lucky, some tied-up babes being abused or maybe a flashback witch burning.Well, sorry, this doesn't deliver, with the sole exception of the dancing scene, which is acceptable, disrobing to full nudity and no cute stuff with the camera. So, one star, but that's mainly because I like plumpers and the blonde dancing around the well, or whatever it is, is kinda cute for a fatty. Hey, no accounting for taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it real?","review":"Escada for Men is one of the best colognes I have ever used. And while this one smells very good, I am very suspect as to whether it is real or fake. I have been told that the correct logo for Escada is the back-to-back uppercase \\"Es\\" on the bottle, and that the smaller curved \\"e's\\" facing each other on the bottle would indicate the product is not really Escada. That's what I got. I thought perhaps I was wrong, so I called the retail distributor directly just to hear what they had to say. Instead of an explanation, I got a very nasty, curt \\"customer service\\" rep, who said they sell what their supplier provides to them--but that I could return it for a refund. When I explained that I really didn't want to do that, but did want some reassurance that the product was, indeed, Escada, the customer rep got even nastier and refused to talk anymore. So, what would anyone think by this response?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"It took me 3hrs to finally decide on this scent.

Decided against going to same retailer to save some $$ and ordered one from Amazon.When the package arrived - the bottle and packaging all seemed original, but was I disappointed when I opened the bottle...The cologne had a vague scent of the one I had previously owned, but greatly overpowered by some cheap additive. The difference in smell was evident from very first time when you open the bottle. And the cheap smell doesn't go away.Lesson learned - if you want a quality product - buy from reputable dealer.Edit: Amazon CS was great and refunded me the money.

Then told me that only half a bottle was returned & I held it more than 30 days.My husband has been using Escada for 15 years, probably only half an inch to an inch had been used because he couldn't believe it.I see they are still selling it for a much higher price now.There biggest concern is that I don't give them a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escada Pour Homme","review":"This fragrance has been my husband's favorite for a few years and is hard to find, but not on Amazon!!

It is hard to find in our area. that is why I purchase online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploration In Sound","review":"Pink Floyd has never failed to amaze me. Their mix of audio and visual elements in \\"Live at Pompeii\\" creates a near-to-perfect Floyd experience. The songs are from the \\"transitional\\" Floyd era...post Syd/pre \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". Set in the ruins of an ancient coliseum, Floyd plays to an invisible audience. Mix in stunning visual photography of ancient murals and lava pits, with Floyd's droning music as a soundtrack, and you have an excellent psychedelic experience. Might be boring to a sober mind, but endless entertainment to Floyd fans or those who like to let their mind wander. Turn out the lights, hook up the stereo, and enjoy \\"Echoes\\", \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\", \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\", \\"One Of These Days\\", and more. New releases of the video have behind-the-scenes of the making of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", interviews, and lunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd jamming it out with great older classics.","review":"I borrowed this video from my History teacher, He used to play in a band. I was impressed start to finish with David Gilmour's guitar and singing skills. Roger Waters as usual is high on talent. I have never seen Nick Mason play with such enthusiasm on drums. Rick Wright was right on key in everything. It was what you would expect from Floyd and more. It included Waters' scream from Carefull with that axe, Eugene (Ummagumma version) to One of these days in which Gilmour plays like there is no tomorrow. The one drawback was that it had to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Pink Floyd","review":"Oh yeah!! Now this is Pink Floyd the hippy looking rock group of the early seventies!! With one major difference; the sound is Raw, Loud, and it jams!! The Bass saturation is very heavy, as was the case with rock music at the time. The drumming is very intense and energetic, as it should be! Gilmour's guitar work is the backbone of this awesome music! The sounds he makes are so deep and moving it's unbelievable. The second half of Saucerful of Secrets is indescribable, I don't know whether to cry or jam out with them?!. It's absolutely beautiful, the slide guitar work, the bass rhythm, the flowing organs, the kick butt drum breaks, the wordless vocals.. I don't know but it rocks! Or how about Gilmour's Dark Side of the Moon take where he get's feedback and they tell him, \\"hey, feedback\\". And Gilmour says, \\"Well, what would rock and roll be without feedback?\\" Cool stuff you have to see this !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...","review":"Any true Pink Floyd fan would love this video. Best viewed with close friend(s), fine wine, large screen TV, high quality sound system or headphones. Don't rush...relax and enjoy.

Great off-stage interview and insiders view of the guys who started at \\"bread line and less\\" (according to David)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Early Floyd Movie","review":"This is by far the best Pink Floyd movie... the only weak part is the seem to only show Nick Mason most of the time... biggest strength is the version of Echoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd - Real artists at work","review":"Pink Floyd - 1973 - Darkside of the Moon is released - immortality is assured. BUT... In 1972, while working on Darkside they put together the \\"Live\\" movie. The ampitheatre in Pompeii is the scene for some of their best pre-darkside music. No crowds, just the technicians. This is real Pink Floyd head music, Good Stuff! with casual interview comments by the band and even a scene at breakfast spliced in. Pink Floyd made a lot of records and did a lot of living before Darkside, and who knows who these guys really are? Well this movie just gives a glimpse. But it's better than nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great","review":"Back before the slick sound and before the disagreements, Pink Floyd puts on what is really a filmed concert without an audience in the ruins of Pompeii. I've seen this film many times in the past and I was thrilled to be able to purchase it from Amazon. Those who can appreciate the early music of PF will enjoy this and newer fans will be amazed. There is also interview footage and footage of the making of Dark Side of the Moon in the studio. The studio process shows us the cold side of putting together an album. Nice photographic effects too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy New Tape - Not Used","review":"This is a review of the tape quality. The film itself is great! I have the DVD. I bought the VHS tape for my VHS hook-up to my stereo system. Unfortunately, I bought the cheap used tape, and the quality of the tape and recording is bad, especially the audio part - the most important! My suggestion is to spend the extra bucks for the brand new, never used tape. I learned the hard way never to buy a cheap used tape. You might luck out and get a good one, but don't count on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be enjoyable if you're high","review":"I love Pink Floyd's music, and love the \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" video. So I bought this one. YUCK! It's one of those depressing 1970's art films that somehow manage to accrue a cult following. There's too much pre-concert \\"behind the scenes\\" footage, the picture quality is poor, the cinematography is horrible, and - well, I have only watched it once. It almost ruined my love for the band. It portrays them as real lowlife scuzzballs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Skatalites Rock","review":"Sweet instrumental reggae with fierce horn and guitar solos throughout. This music speaks volumes despite lacking vocals. The sound quality is awesome, jams are all over, and whether you are new to the Skatalites or not, this album is a must have.

THE SKATALITES ARE SKA, my man - look it up in the books - check out the history of the music - Bob Marley's earliest recordings were ska recordings - than they progressed to rock steady and finally to reggae - ska has been around since the 50s - so don't try and say it was born in the 90s....Skatalites are at the forefront of the music. 4 stars for being originators."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real T'ing","review":"I have no use for ska as it is currently packaged and played, but this album rocks!

The editor of this book must of not been doing enough research because there's a smorgasbord of comic book adaptations missing such as Popeye, Flash Gordon, Blondie, Fritz The Cat, Barbarella (!!!), Footrot Flats... Besides that the essays written for each movie is very detailed and contains a lot of general information concerning the production and critical aspect of each film. But, you never quite feel satisfied over the incompleteness of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Fast paced, informative and highly readable account of the American Eagle taking on the Russian Bear (and winning, as always)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Overveiw of the Conflict","review":"I rate this book 3 stars because it portrays the true conflict of the Korean War, but it doesn't really give a lot of detail. When I read a book it should \\"paint\\" a vivid image but all I see is a blank canvas."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like your prose purple...","review":"I found this book to be polemic as all get out. The monograph was a black and white portrayal of history told in a Cowboys and Indians style that was frustrating to read if the reader is looking for depth and ambiguity in the subject.In the interests of keeping it positive: if you like your prose purple, if you like your journalism yellow, if you love reading the The Sun, and are glued to Fox News, then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Again!","review":"This love story, initially called Aimez-vous Brahms (Do You Like Brahms?) contains all of the themes necessary to make it a continuous classic.Three major performances given by three tremendous actors. Ingrid Bergman in one of her later roles is heart-breakingly beautiful, and Anthony Perkins gives a performance so joyful, vulnerable and nuanced, I find something different in it every time I see it.Add to it a time in Paris that is magical and a score by Brahms that is unforgettable.When will this be available in DVD?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"luv ingrid","review":"ingrid bergman gives such a wonderful performance, grace, class, and style. she is in luv and her lover is a playboy but a younger man wants her attentions"},{"rating":"2","title":"All about a man and a woman.","review":"It is romantic and sentimental -yes. But it is also about many shades of love - young and passionate, older and reluctant, desperate, devoted.... I found it to be true, wonderfully performed, with a great adaptation of Symphony No.3 by Brahms, set in the glorious city of Paris. That deserves from my point of view as many stars as I can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no there there...","review":"Part way through I found myself wondering why I was still watching themovie. It was nice to see Ingrid Bergman 20 years after makingCasablanca, but I just couldn't care that much about her dilemma inthis film.One major detraction is Anthony Perkins. He has no business being inthis movie. I know he belongs in 'Psycho', but I don't think he's a fit as Bergman's younger lover.What's great though is the many outdoor shots of Paris in the 60's unrolled early in the film. Theautomobiles. Wow! Really great street scenes, night shots of Paris, andagain, those goofy looking cars.And then there's that knockout Jocelyn Lane. She's doesn't last theduration of the film however, and that's really too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Again","review":"Any fan of Ingrid Bergman and Brahms must own this video. This movie, set in Paris in the early \`60s, was made solely to give Bergman a chance to let out all the stops and flaunt her incredible range. The depth of her vulnerability and strength will astonish you. Anthony Perkins is charming. Not only is the acting superb, the soundtrack (based on variations of a Brahms march) compliments the story perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Impressive","review":"This is without a doubt one of the strongest albums I have ever heard. It's brave and experimental, yet never losing the music as a result. Strong, cohesive drum and bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guide on what to paint","review":"\\"A Passion for Watercolor: Painting the Inner Experience\\" is written by a psychologist who is a watercolor artist. The focus of this book is to encourage the reader to broaden their horizons on the topic of what to paint. Guidance on technique is very thin -- almost nonexistent -- and this is fine, as there are many other books out there on this topic. Rather, the author focuses on the process of creative interpretation: discover what you like to paint, what that means to you, how to express your feelings visually, and so forth. There is a lot in this book on using introspection to develop topics for art. Each chapter begins (about 1/2 content) with the author's thoughts on the topic -- say, what fruit means to her, and how she brings that out in art -- and then suggests approaches & loosely worded projects you might use.If you enjoy self examination, you will probably adore this watercolor book's fresh aproach. For myself, I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introspection, not watercolor","review":"The title of this book has put it in the art books category, but it is much more an autobiographical account of using painting for introspection. I bought it because I thought, with the author's qualifications, it would be inspirational both personally and artistically. I was very disappointed - the artwork is far from inspirational and the text seems mostly the author's own artistic journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"So your not a REAL d.j. but you do like techno ?","review":"Well,here you go.They have plenty of already made cool techno songs that you listen to forever and then once you get used of making your own music thats even funner.Im not a d.j. either but I can use this.Its easy...and im only 14.

I still don't have the book I wanted and NEED. hms1936@gmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is excellent!","review":"I never knew much about Rand's personal life, or that there was so much footage of her. This film uses several filmed interviews she did at various points, and pulls together her whole life story and discussion of her philosophy, books, movies, etc. Really fascinating. I think the only voice you hear is Ayn Rand herself. Pretty much that's all anyway. You come away really understanding how she thought and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to go directly to the source","review":"If one really wants to get a handle on what sort of person Ayn Rand was, this is the most direct way to do this in documentary form. Occasionally we see journalists Mike Wallace, Phil Donahue, and Tom Snyder come in to ask her questions, but it's her talking for 98 percent of the experience. A lot of this is anecdotes about what happened in her life and why, but occasional glimpses into her philosophical thinking come through. The visual element of stills, stock footage, and interview clips keeps the story vivid. Just as reading her novels, particularly \\"The Fountainhead\\" and \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" are the best introductions to her thinking, so this from-the-writer's-mouth documentary gives you the text and subtext of what sort of woman she was."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Ayn Rand lived an amazing life. This film fails to explain how incredible she was, and why she influenced so many people"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayn Rand Was WRONG!!!!","review":"This last Great Recession has proven Ayn Rand was totally wrong with her philosophy of government and finance. Her ideas that the financial world should be totally independent from the government, which Alan Greenspan worshiped her btw, was completely WRONG!!! She's a spacecat who lives in another world!! I gave this thing a chance but it is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"She sure does love herself!","review":"Not much about Rand's life to know really. She was rich and thought that she was a genius. She never developed past 13 and was probably a satanist. And somehow, the religious right, and the fiscal conservatives come together to throw Jesus from the train in order to masticate Rand's magical journey through the wretched loathsomeness of wealthiness and atheism. I'm sure there's a Southern Baptist preacher with all her books next to every version of the bible in their study and no clue to the massive hypocrisy of having two masters. All in all, this was overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Every Christian!","review":"Dr. Chafer in this brief book exposes the reality of being spiritual. From solid Biblical exposition he affirms that being spiritual or in fellowship with the Lord is an absolute state. While Dr. Chafer's archaic prose is sometimes difficult to navigate through, the book is a diamond in a dung heap. It is one of the best books available for sound spiritual growth and well worth overcoming Dr. Chafer's old prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"first Hagin book","review":"I haven't really ever seen myself as being \\"in the faith movement\\". Though I have been a christian for a long time, I have never read a book by K. Hagin. This was my first and I was pleasantly suprised. I found it much more balanced then I thought I would have. He takes care to distinguish between what he sees as valid christian suffering and other forms of pain and suffering that we should outwardly reject as Christians. In one place he says: \\"Suffering will make you grow up spirtually in a hurry.\\" and, \\"It is well to remeber that some of our hardest tests are God's way of leading us into a deeper place in Him\\". Yet he insists that we are not to \\"magnify the suffering\\" in such a way as to overshadow the blessing and the good that God wants to bring in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a good book for learning how to treat with you kids. I learned a lot of skills from it. it is worth reading it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Common sense and experience","review":"When some friends recommend me the first book, baby whisperer, I thought \\"ok, just another miracle book for parents which finally would turn out into another bunch of useless recommendations\\" but time proved I was definitively wrong. It is indeed a miracle of common sense and experience and the second one, baby whisperer for toddlers, is another helpful and sometimes miraculous guide through the first years of parenthood. I strongly recommend this two books to every new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reference","review":"This book is worth every penny. They did an exceptional job of organization, presentation and, yes, marketing. It has the test for your child's 'type' and your parenting style. The chapter on Ritual and Routine is fabulous with so many good, practical little bits to enhance your toddler's day. It also has THE BEST solid food introduction/weaning plan I've EVER seen. There is also so much good stuff in the chapters on life skills and emotional development to read & re-read & re-read again to stay mindful of. In summation, this book gives you a plethora of tools to help us be the best parent we can be. There is great stuff applicable from the time you start contemplating feeding your baby solids until their pre-school years. I've read A LOT of books on parenting and babies and, yes, if you don't buy any other book on toddlerhood, buy this one. It IS the ESSENTIAL guide for parents of babies and toddlers. I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Whispering As Your Baby Grows Up.....","review":"Hogg and Blau use a very workable, applicable style to deal with parenting a toddler: as I am on my fourth toddler, I can attest that the techniques are valuable and easily used in parenting.I especially appreciate the step by step approach and belief in \\"conscious\\" parenting instead of parenting-by-the-numbers. The suggestions and notes from \\"real\\" people via email interspersed further give the book a personalized, realistic flavor.The ending chapters about having another baby and valuing relationships are very much a part of parenting the toddler. My only wish is there was a touch more in regards to collaborative-parenting with both parents being consistent Baby Whisperers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent author","review":"I loved \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" - exceptionally good, practical, but not predictable advice for first time moms. This follow up book was a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Baby Whisperer!!!","review":"I can not say enough positive things about this book. I read it when my daughter was 6 weeks old and within days she was sleeping 6-8 hours at night. It was life changing! This book is all about what is best for baby. My daughter was happier and more well rested, which meant I was too! A few weeks after reading it, I bought Tracy's other book, which is even more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"help found here","review":"this isn't as good as the baby whisperer, or maybe it's just not as insightful, but that's likely due to the fact that i don't need as much guidance now as the parent of a toddler as i did when i had a newborn and read the baby whisperer. i like that she has a quiz in the beginning of this book, as she did in \\"baby.\\" it really helped me get in touch with some issues & forced me to concentrate- which can sometimes be difficult when you have a frazzled day parenting a toddler. as i did in the baby whisperer book, i'll take the quiz again later and see how my child has changed and what i need help with then. ms. hogg is very nurturing and calming. i'm so sad to hear that she died. i was heartbroken, because i was really looking forward to her help in a few years when my toddler becomes a teenager!"},{"rating":"2","title":"common sense...but couldn't we use a little more of that?","review":"I like Tracy Hogg...and after reading her first book I was compelled to try this one as well. Although a lot of her wisdom is really common sense, it's always good to get a refresher. It's easy to get caught up in being tired and emotional as the mom of a toddler, so this book made me take a deep breath and re-evaluate my actions. I recommend it to all new moms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sence","review":"I thought this book was a lot of basic information about toddlers that most parents already know. It gave no strategies to try or routines to set up to make life easier. It basically says that to be able to manage your toddler's behavior you need to know what kind of a toddler they are. Ok? So I know my child is a \\"textbook\\" toddler, now what? I feel like the book doesn't go any further than that! It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had my money back","review":"This is an example of a writer having one seller then putting a useless sequel out.I really would like to get the money I wasted back on this book.She seems too much like an old fashioned English Nanny or nurse and not someone that familiar with children.Not enough activites to stimulate the childs development and games suggestions.Only good suggestion she had was that Moms needed to not interfere with Dads being with their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers","review":"What a bunch of nonsense! It sets back child-rearing to the era of the \\"fifties\\" and \\"sixties\\" - Ms. Hogg & Ms. Blau actually instruct \\"good, caring parents\\" to ask permission of the toddler before putting socks on, shoes on. The entire book is a farce and only trains toddlers to become VERY disappointed young adults when (in the REAL world) their teachers, friends, bosses will not cater to their every whim or wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book in The Whisper Genre","review":"I bought this book because it's title reminded me of \\"The Child Whisperer\\" by Matt Pasquinilli. One of the best books on parenting I have ever read, \\"The Child Whisperer\\" taught me how to effectively communicate with my overactive son and highly distractible daughter.\\"The Horse Whisperer\\" as a movie was ok, but the real man behind the story, Monty Roberts, is a common sense genius. The fact is, Monty Roberts not only whispered to horses, but he raised over forty foster kids.(Rent \\"Story of a Real Horse Whisperer\\" by the BBC at your local video store - or buy Monty Roberts book here at amazon.com.)\\"Secrets of The Baby Whisperer for Toddlers\\" is not exactly the same concept, but it is very helpful for younger children. If you are a \\"Whisperer\\" fan like me, then you will want this on your shelf next to \\"The Child Whisperer\\" and \\"The Horse Whisperer.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending","review":"If you're into schedules, this book is for you. I found it useless. Her attitudes towards toddler nursing is deplorable. What are her credentials? A \\"baby whisperer\\"? I guess I just don't get it. I didn't read the first book and I'm glad. I read a more attachment parenting friendly book and found its contents much more my style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went against everything I believe","review":"This book really made my skin crawl.It is so far from the idea of attachment parenting. It focused on the parents needs more then the baby's. They are only little for such a short time. Why not love them , hold them and cuddle as much as they want? what is more important, sleep or having your child feel safe and loved? After I read the book I gave it to my 9 month old baby and let him do what babies do to books. A much better use then keeping it in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Plan","review":"I'm smack in the middle of reading this book, but I've done so much scanning of it, I've checked out what the book has to offer. I really feel like this book gives solid plans for many toddlers' routines. It's true that much of what she says is \\"common sense\\", but also a lot of it is stuff I wasn't thinking at the time I read it, so it gave me great ideas. I esp. liked her plans for bathing, eating, and diapering. I wish now that I had payed more attention when I read her baby edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it worked for ya","review":"I am an avid reader of baby/toddler rearing books and this one is the worst so far. This seemed to be the gist, \\"This is what I did with my children and I am right, so you should do it this way too.\\" Okay, this is not to say that there weren't a few tidbits of good information. You just have to weed/read through a lot of junk to get to it. Not enough fact/scientific facts to back up opinions and suggestions. Sorry, but overall, THUMBS DOWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best recording of Joseph out there!","review":"Having just recently preformed with a touring cast of Joseph as a multicolored kid, (yes, you read right, multicolored kid) at 12 years old, this is the recording we used at rehearsels, the recording we sang with in the car. None of those other so-called Joseph recordings can match this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior cast recording","review":"\\"Joseph\\" is a great musical comedy. I have directed it twice now and really appreciate its simplicity and childlike innocence. That is why I feel this Canadian cast recording is overblown, with hit-you-over-the-head orchestrations and wall of sound production. The Narrator is especially ingratiating with a lackluster interpretation and weak vocals. I haven't heard either New York cast albums. I would hope they are better and purer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the music but not a great","review":"I love this musical.I saw it live and it was absolutely wonderful,however ,I am seriously dissappointed after listening to this version.Originally I bought the LA cast version with Micheal Damion and returned it because I was not happy with the vocal performances and got this one instead.Donny Osmond is definetly better than Damion,but the rest of the singers really leave something to be desired.The Pharaoh is horrible at his Elvis impression especially compared to the LA cast version,Benjamin Calypso is also terrible, I am not really impressed with the narrator either.I cannot believe they did so bad with the rest of the cast.I am seriously disappointed with all the versions I have heard.They definetely could have done much better.I just saw Monica Patton and Jon Secada in the national tour and they did much better especially Monica Patton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastisc!!!!","review":"what a great cd! i like osmand's voice the best.

I listen to it constantly, and it is like a bedtime story, for the whole musical is on the cd. Donny is the perfect Joseph. THis role was made for him. I lvoe the video, but this cd is better because everyone sings, instead of talk-singing (which is my biggest pet-peeve). I abosolutely LVOE this musical!!! I want to do this musical at my high school next year, because it is the best musical ever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is an almost factual reenactment of what supposedly went on in the Bible. A boy named Joseph and his brothers have a fight and the whole story is all singing, so if you haven't seen the movie, you don't miss anything. It has all different types of music including Jamaican and French, and it is suitible for children of all ages. I also recommend the DVD that has all the songs in it. In my humble opinion, I'd say this is one of the best broadway shows of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SSOOO CCOOLLLL!!!!!","review":"It's the most fun show I have ever heard. I've only seen an ammature play of it done by 12 year old but they were great! I love this show! I think this version with Donny Osmond was very good. My favroite song was \\"Potiphar\\" Especially the fast parts. My second favroite and a favrote of my friends is \\"Close every door\\" it's sad but preety. I also like \\"Who's the thief.\\" In this telling of the story they had Joseph older in the begining and Benjimen already born and married which I thought was strange. For Joseph only saw benjimen when he was brought to Egypt. I also really like the song \\"Stone the Crows\\" \\"Pharoh said, 'well stone the crows this Joseph is a clever kid,...'\\" And \\"What does this crazy, crazy, dream mean? OOHH YYEAAHHHH!!!!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet Metz - two thumbs down","review":"I'm only 14, but I've been around the block of broadway a few times, and I have to say I threw away this CD (well, not <i>literally</i>) after hearing just five seconds of Janet Metz's awful high, squeaky voice. I am also a lead vocalist, and I must say that Metz's babyish, gravelly tone is unattractive and extremely difficult to listen to.My favorite narrator is Maria Freidman, who did the film version of \\"Joseph.\\" Her voice is richer, deeper - definitely better overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donny Osmondan as Joseph","review":"fun Musical- great costuming- I should know I did this musical in Children's Theatre when I was in the sixth grade-Believe me Donny Osmondan has great vocal range- he's excellent as joseph, However when we did it (with my now elederly mother as the stage manger!!) the guy who played Jospeh Adam ( sixteen at the time) well, let's just say at the point I had a huge embrassing cursh on him that I still to this day never told anyone about (except my mom on one ocssain) what A hunk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEFORE it was a musical...","review":"BEFORE it was a musical it was a cantata with orchestra and children's choir. Slicked, glossed, and cheesy, the broadway versions all fall short of the original, concise masterpiece recorded on the ONE AND ONLY ORIGINAL version alas, out of print and available only on vinyl. As overblown broadway versions go, this 1992 version may be the best. But, for those of us who grew up listening to the original, the broadway versions do nothing but disappoint.

In closing I would just like to let you know that if you write any more of your insulting totally stupid reviews just remember that I will be hear to comment right back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Music!","review":"It goes without saying that the music is fabulous, as ever. It's a timeless story and Donny Osmond still has a great voice. I bought the sound track after watching the movie over and over, so my point of view is biased toward the movie sound track. I found the narrator's voice on this CD to be a little too high-pitched for me, but I eventually got used to it. The French accent in \\"Those Canaan Days\\" was deliberately overdone and spoiled an otherwise interesting song. Other than that, the CD music was close enough to the movie sound track to be satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Waste Your Time With the Other Joseph Recordings!","review":"This is the ultimate Joseph cast recording! Donny Osmond has a fabulous voice, which he doesn't get nearly enough credit for! He was the perfect choice to portray Joseph. The rest of the cast is wonderful from Janet Metz to Johnny Seton. They all display a wide range of talent including great singing and comedic timing. If you love musicals, get this CD. You will not be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show, good soundtrack","review":"I normally do not like any of the Osmonds, but Donny Osmond is wonderful in this show. He has an amazing voice.

I do not know if all these CD's are like this, but I would not recommend it due to poor quality of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"If you have seen the Broadway play you will not be disappointed with this soundtrack.

It is not the audio recording of the dvd production starring Maria Friedman, Sir Richard Attenborough and Donny Osmond as advertised.Donny Osmond shows the amazing vocal skill and talent he possesses as a performer in this audio production. The production is well done, however the only criticism I have is that I do not care for Janet Metz as the Narrator. Her voice is to high and does not blend well with Osmond's.I would like to see the dvd movie version of the \\"Joseph\\" soundtrack released on cd. With the vocal talents, musical arrangements and full orchestra it would be a cd well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donny Osmond vs. Sam Harris","review":"When Donny Osmond injured his vocal chords in 1996. Sam Harris \\"Star Search, Motown\\" replaced him in Detroit. Sam Harris was 5 star. This CD is the closest thing to that perfomance, with a 4 star rating. The Los Angeles performance CD would be a 3 star.

While the orchestra and some of the signers are great (Christie's direction is usually spot on), the choreography is irritating and stupid, and most of the other visual gimmicks (for example, the video projections of animals and speeding trains) are pointless and distracting. In fact, I became so irritated by the constant visual clutter on stage and the silly acrobatic dancing that I ended up turning off the TV and just listening to the sound track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait...isn't this a BAROQUE opera?","review":"Luckily for this production, Rameau is long dead and therefore unable to sue them for visually destroying such fine music.

However when you get to the nitty gritty of writing an application, this book is mostly useless. Yes, there are lots of examples on how to do very basic things like display a menu on your phone. However, as another reviewer pointed out, there are no detailed examples of how to do anything advanced.One example, I want to get information about the device hitting my service. There are 2 paragraphs explaining why I might want this information, but on how to get it, this book only says \\"You can use the Cisco URL Proxy to gather additional information...\\". No where in the book does it give any more details on how this is used. One more sentence - like 'your service should read these xml pages to get the device info' - would have been infinitely helpful. I found that the Cisco SDK documentation has everything that is in this book and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The added tools on the CD sweeten the deal!","review":"This is THE must have book for developing services for the Cisco IP phones. Just getting the CallManager Simulator on the included CD makes this book worth the money. The simulator makes it possible to develop and test services without needing to purchase thousands of dollars of Cisco hardware and software.There's also an advanced techniques chapter that describes how to do a lot of the cool features for more complex applications. With the basic-to-advanced information in the book and the free code samples and programs on the CD, this book is a great bargain for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Developing Cisco IP Phone Services very useful","review":"I needed to get an in depth understanding of the way services for the IP Phone were developed so as to develop security policies to help protect network assets.

Very dissapointing for a CiscoPress book","review":"I purchased this book with the intention of writing services for CM ver 5 and ver 6 (soon). This book was a total waste of my money and my time to read it. The focus on Windows programming and reference to CM ver 3.1 shows how old it is.Most of the information I already knew (from the Cisco site and SDK doco) however the nitty gritty information I was looking for was absent.I also think it is poorly written; far from the technical excellence I have experienced in other CiscoPress books.If I had known this, I wouldn't have bothered buying the book.

Yes, he's good at getting people to hate him, but why is that considered a skill these days?GSP is likeable but other than his \\"bully\\" story on the bonus footage, he doesn't have a lot of interesting things to say either.Most of the house antics we've seen before in previous seasons (smashing stuff, lame \\"pranks\\"). Most of the conflicts amongst the fighters were the drunken \\"I'd squash you\\" stuff which became stale many seasons ago.In my opinion the highlights of the show were GSP's Thai boxing coach showing up drunk before sparring sessions and Cody's deadly skills with the guillotine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Fighter 12","review":"Great season just like most of them in this boxset.

His experience in Vietnam and after, on the Senate Foreign Relations Committe and background running a District Attorney's office combined with his deap knowedge of history make him the foremost expert on terrorism in America.America truly needs John Kerry to lead us out of the Iraq abyss and to renew the hunt for bin Laden.

The fact that Kerry's 1997 book manages to avoid even a reference to Bin Laden, after his years on a Senate committee specializing in the subject of terrorism suggests a \\"guardian of American security\\" asleep at his post.\\"Reporting for duty!\\" indeed.

I can't say enough about the performances. They are relaxed, charming, and full-bodied. The London Symphony plays beautifully, and Chandos's sound is up to the high standards of the label.

Visually beautiful, somewhat interesting but poorly scripted, the film was better than I had expected given its negative internet reviews. Actually Iceland seems to be stunningly attractive and superb cinematographer turned first time director Michael Chapman does a good job in showing it and keeping the action moving. But the plot is too convoluted, the narration stultifyingly dull. There are moments that almost work like when a Viking's family wait stoicly for death in a burning hut. Thank goodness for the gore and nudity which makes it bearable, but only just. Musclebound Ralf Moeller (TV's Conan) is not that bad, a low rent Schwarzenegger but he doesn't embarrass himself.

And hey, you can't really go wrong with this one: I Can't Stand It doesn't do much for me, but this is one of the funkiest albums EVER outside of that: the nine-minute Hot Pants is a classic, and justly so: it SMOKES. Escape-ism is pretty much JB getting acquainted with his new band, with occasional anti-alcohol lyrics, but to quote the Godfather himself, Ain't That a Groove?

I found that she was more pre-disposed to talking about his clothes and lack of sexual prowess. Do not waste your money buying this, there were no insights into the mind of Knowles, and as a \\"investigative journalist\\" Fawkes failed at securing an interview with Knowles before his death.

You know what to expect. Hardcore vocal delivery, metal/core crossover music. Right?To an extent. Bloodlet transcend the usual hardcore stylings by doing such things as recording songs that actually last more than five minutes, incorporating jazz and classical influences, and playing with the mixing board (listen to \\"Something Wicked\\" in headphones). Rather than the usual wall of sound, the band breaks every once in a while for a more obviously jazz-influenced bridge (and the lead vocalist's voice sounds oddly comparable to Maynard James Keenan's, during Tool's live renditions of \\"Bottom\\").Bottom line is, if you don't mind the hardcore vocal style, you're probably going to get something out of this one.

First the positives- this comes with a bunch of extra toys, people and blocks that fit other Chicco toys, and can be used as a shape sorter. I also found it lots cheaper on another web site. The negatives- The seat is not fit tightly in its hinges, so it falls off easly, but my son is not able to put it back on, so I have to, *every time*. Also, the play station on the handle only has one volume, LOUD, so loud in fact that it scares him and he wont play with it.

I am an experienced knitter who will only spend the time knitting a sweater to produce something beautiful and exceptional, usually with set in sleeves. I found the patterns in the book uninspiring, unflattering, and dated so I would not have any desire to knit any of the sweaters in the book, and therefore no desire to benefit from the techniques.

The fact is, this book is not meant to be a book of patterns to follow, it is a book that teaches you the skills to make whatever darn sweater your heart desires. The point is to learn to make a seamless sweater embellished as you please, in the shape you desire.As is mentioned in most of the reviews, there is a sampler to be done which is well worth the time, for countless reasons.

Will Downing is wonderful. I own all of his CDs and I love them all, espeically this one and Moods. He is such a talented artist. The songs Nothing Has Ever Felt featuring Rachelle Ferrell, Love's The Place To Be, Lover's Paradise, Break Up To Make Up and especially Hey Girl are my favorites on this CD. Buy It, it's definitely worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Song Stylist Extraordinaire.....","review":"I, like the other reviewers have all of Will Downing's cd's. This one and Invitation Only are a tie for my all time favorite Will Downing cd's. There is not one throw away cut on this entire cd. There's No Living Without You sets the stage for the entire project. The title, \\"Love's The Place to Be\\" with Bob Baldwin on piano is indeed a treat. My all time favorite duet, Rachelle Ferrell and Will Downing on \\"Nothing Has Ever..\\" is indeed a classic as far as love songs go. His remake of \\"Break Up To Make Up\\" breathes new life into a song that I have always loved. Equally as impressive are \\"Hey Girl\\" and \\"That's All.\\" The promises he sings about are heartfelt and it is a shame that he does not get the recognition he so richly deserves. This cd is on my top 10 list of all time favorite cd/albums. Include this project and you will be more than pleasantly surprised. He is one of the most romantic singers of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover's Paradise","review":"Another great CD from Mr. Downing. This is a well done compilation of songs about the joy of finding love -- \\"Lovers Paradise\\" \\"One Moment\\" \\"Sailing on A Dream.\\"His duet with the fabulous Rachelle Ferrell is phenomenal. This song was a staple on the playlist of every quiet storm show for much of '93 and '94. Will is well matched with Ms. Ferrell whose multioctave range probably would have overshadowed and intimidated a lesser vocalist.Will offers a great cover of \\"Break Up to Make Up\\" and ends with \\"That's All,\\" a really sweet ballad featuring Mr. Stevie Wonder's musical stylings. This CD is classic Will Downing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I have had this album for a while now and I just love it. I listen to it all the time.

Tonight, I finally began switching out beds..2 y/o gets toddler bed, 5 y/o gets crib converted to full sized bed...and the bolts are an inch too short! Hopefully, I can get the same diameter bolt in an inch longer at Lowe's tomorrow. If not, the conversion kit will be useless to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll need additional items to use this product.","review":"The rails work with my existing bed, the problem is they don't tell you that you have to have additional cross boards to support the mattress. In addition, once you place the cross boards on the rails, the mattress no longer is held in place, so I had to lower the supports on the rails to keep the mattress from sliding off the bed. Its a poor design. A lot of work had to be done to make these functional rails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Transformation!","review":"One of the bolts was just a touch difficult to get in place, but once that was done, the transformation of the crib into a beautiful bed was complete. Honestly, our son's bed is now nicer than our own bed, no joke. The only reason I did not give 5 starts was the difficulty of putting the one bolt in place, which I read that some other people had similar difficulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"how exactly are rails helpful without THE SLATS?","review":"Is it really too much to ask for the company to include the horizontal slats?I read the reviews, but somehow didn't understand why people were talking about the box spring. The answer is: there are no slats. You just end up with the bed frame. As some posters point out a box spring may not cut it. OR you may not want to buy a box spring.

Go outside and jump...and tell God thanks for YOUR special spring mechanism!\\" About 'far-flung,' \\"...you could say that you have one far-flung friend who is always near - your friend God!\\" A great book for hard-core Christians, perhaps, but not recommended for anyone with a different view."},{"rating":"2","title":"warzone's swan song!","review":"Great final effort by one of NYHC greatest.

Main thing was a roll up hood. I wear boonie hats or watch caps so I wont be using the hood unless I lose my hat. Rolling up the hood makes the jacket look like crap, and it feels like crap on your neck. I have water proof jackets without roll up hoods, so this was a waste of money for me. I got it cheap enough so I might as well keep it, but it was very disappointing. This was a feature that I thought would be fairly straight forward, but I will probably stay away from Marmot jackets in the future unless I see it first. The only thing keeping me from giving this a 1 star rating is I have not actually used it in the rain yet, so it may be great in that regard. This is mainly a condemnation of the roll up hood design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable high performace rain gear!","review":"The new 2011 PreCip rain shell by Marmot is an excellent all-around piece of gear.

The PreCip jacket features a billed hood that can be cinched down tight as well as a velcro strap to store the hood when not in use. The interior of the jacket is lined for extra protection against the elements. Two pit zips come in handy for releasing moisture if it gets too warm. The PreCip also features velcro adjustable cuffs as well as an elastic drawstring to cinch down the waist. The material is light and durable.

Also, considering the growing popularity of vegetarianism, some may find her \\"homesteading recipes\\" slightly offensive (anything with four legs, fur, or feather's, is fair game in the name of survival).

I doubt it!Perhaps one could buy cheap land and put one or more trailers on it, but even at today's depressed land values unimproved lots are still far more expensive and would require years trapped in the rat race.

However, things get a bit shaky on disc two, which has material of lesser quality, but a few gems, \\"She Works Hard for Her Money,\\" and Stock Aitken Waterman's \\"This Time I Know it's for Real\\" stand out. Since Summer's popularity began in the clubs, it would have been nice to have these singles in their extended twelve-inch format, but you can't have it all, can you?

He wrote :\\" McGowan's book demonstrates an impressive ability to misinterpret and misreport facts. But McGowan, who seems to have begun this project with an ideological axe to grind, fails to even map the forest correctly.

I thought, that even though the bread and butter of this successful series would soon be gone, there were enough hilarious supporting characters throughout to keep this show watchable, even if it could never be absolutely fantastic again.

The stand-outs are the EXCELLENT Filia Brazilia version, which stays close to the original Orb version, and Kris Need's Up for a Fortnight which is a fantastic dance mix.The cds are also worth the purchase price for the remix of Delta MKII and a really nice ambient piece called Rose Tinted, which is sort of a quiet mix of Toxygene and Asylum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Bridges book Pictures","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful.Great photography and short quips re: each subject.A beautiful work of art.Arrived in perfect condition, and in a very timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winning Medium for a Great Artist","review":"I'm a huge Jeff Bridges fan.

The title track is an instant classic. \\"what If I Came Knocking\\", \\"When Jesus Left Birmingham\\", \\"Junior\\" and \\"Suzanne & The Jewels\\" are all first rate John Mellencamp songs. Human Wheels finds John Mellencamp realizing that he is no longer a kid, but an adult and the songs are the most mature of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding as \\"John Wesley Harding\\" & \\"Nashville Skyline\\"","review":"Mellencamp tells the real story of American ruralism in modern times and he tells it from both the white AND the black perspective--which his band and his music have always been about.

A script writer is dying of cancer. His double, a producer and second husband of the writer's ex-wife, offers him a project -- a gift to keep his mind on things other than dying. The book narrates the film script he is writing - a film on Greta Garbo centered on the event that turned her from another good actress to the film goddess. As he researches and writes the script, the writer comes to terms with his own elusive (illusive) love for a half-sister, to terms with living as a passive canvas versus living with self-understanding.The book is exquisite - well researched and perceptive of people and their idols, the effect of time on changing idols. If you read for action, this is probably not to your liking. If you read to expand your understanding of humanity, this belongs on your \\"must read\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"This I know","review":"Books like this are great for learning new things about computers some which are seen in your daily computer use but often just ignored such as various keys.

Santa and Pete is written by a different Christopher Moore. I feel very mislead by ..... as this book was suggested along with all of the above mentioned books by Christopher Moore (I do own all of the previous books by Christopher and truly believed I was getting a Christmas story he was involved in writing).

Not since \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" have I been so moved. \\"Santa & Pete\\" is the perfect book for anyone raising children and also anyone wanting to get the Christmas spirit back. It teaches and inspires us to transcend race, cultural issues, religion, age and any other prejudice we may knowingly or unknowingly harbor. It teaches us to value our family and friends. It teaches giving and charity. And it does it all in the very very entertaining story format involving a grandfather and grandson. This book could be the start of a better world! It should be required reading. Thank you Christopher Moore and Pamela Johnson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Holiday Story for Everyone","review":"Santa & Pete is actually three stories in one; the authors move between the present day, the fifties, and the early days of New York. I was especially moved by the present day story detail of the family using \\"grancestor\\" ornaments for their Christmas tree. So much so, in fact, that I have adopted this as a new Christmas tradition for my own family next year. It will be a wonderful way for my child to learn about and remember his ancestors, as the family in Santa & Pete do every year. I found the fifties story of the grandfather and grandson touching, and the story of the original Santa & Pete a hopeful one. I would highly recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Christmas Tradition","review":"Moore and Johnson have crafted a new holiday tradition in this little book. An extremely engaging tale, Santa & Pete enables the reader to see and feel the story. Christmas in New York is a magical time.

Santa & Pete should be required reading for historians, theologians, and, perhaps most of all, parents who read to their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but inaccurate","review":"The author has taken the traditional Dutch and written a heart-warmng but revisionist version of it. Pete is actually a younbg boy named Pieter Baas, whom St. Nicholas, in his traditional bishop's garb, used to scare bad little children in Holland. Moore has used poetic licensure of his last name to put some of \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" into this story which portrays the good saint as a bumbling old man and an americanized Pete as the hero.

Presley's boredom and disgust with the ludicrous material is evident throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis Presley's perfomance So Close But Yet So Far.","review":"This is the wrost Elvis Presley film I saw. In fact, I don't know why it was even made. In fact, this movie needs zero stars. But ... won't go that far.You have to wonder why Elvis Presley stars in this hoo-hum movie. Johnny Tyronne (Elvis Presley) is a American actor who gets kidnapped.When the movie begins, we see Johnny watching a movie (with him in it.) While his missing, he meets a princess (Mary Ann Mobley). Andybody who likes this movie, he/she needs to get thier eyes checked.Johnny is hired to kill the king (Philip Reed). Which he ends up behind bars, singing So Close But Yet So Far. Is this how Colonel Tom Parker wanted people to remember Elvis Presley like this after he is dead.I guess so. Why would anybody want to see a movie with an American actor-singer star gets kiddnapped?Elvis should have said \\"NO\\" when he was asked to be in this movie.Songs include, Golden Coins, Harem Holiday, Shake That Tamborine, and So Close But Yet So Far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Colonel Parker Didn't Like It!","review":"...and when the Colonel doesn't like it, you know it's gotta be bad! Absolute trash from the most talented entertainer of the twentieth century! It doesn't even work as a spoof, because spoofs are funny, and this one isn't. If negative stars could be awarded, this would rank about a minus 10! No wonder Elvis said of Hollywood, \\"I know this town's laughing at me.\\" He was right! After this turkey they were. Don't waste ninety minutes of your life watching this.

According to Peter Guralnick's \\"Careless Love\\" (the best bio of Elvis yet written), even the Colonel was flabbergasted at how badly this one turned out. The film makes no sense, the acting and songs are worse than usual, and when its all over, you just feel depressed and ashamed. Though not as technically flawed as an Ed Wood movie, its at about the same artistic level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokum","review":"An unfunny, and flat, effort to style Elvis as a Valentino-Errol Flynn romantic hero, badly written and looking shoddy with sterile backlots filling in for Arabian-type scenery. Features only one worthwhile song, \\"So Close Yet So Far\\", while the best track, \\"Animal Instinct\\" was left out (although appearing as a 'bonus song' on the soundtrack album).After inane material such as this, John Lennon's quip that Elvis \\"died in the Army\\" is hauntingly accurate, in a figurative sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harum Scarum Fun","review":"While this movie isn't an Oscar winner, it stayed in my mind for 40 years as one of the most fun Elvis movies ever.I eagerly awaited it everytime it was shown on TV; I'd never seen it without commercials, and was so happy to be able to! Performances were well done, Billy Barty was a joy.And Michael Ansara...deliciously bad. Men's costumes were pretty well researched, and actually fit in with the \\"two thousand years in the past\\" period.Womens...we won't go there. *chuckle* All in all a fun romp, even if Elvis' karate moves were obviously pulled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent and boring","review":"This picture is real hard to sit through.Elvis plays an American film star (ironic, indeed) that gets kidnapped by Arabians. Of course he falls in love with one of the ladies, but a conflict occurs when he is ordered to kill her father. Huh?Anyway, both the plot and the accompanying songs are weak. The only song that comes close to being good is \\"So Close, Yet So Far\\". The others range from the average Elvis movie song (\\"Mirage\\", \\"Hey, Little Girl\\") to the ridiculous (\\"Shake That Tambourine\\").This is a picture that should have never seen the light of day, and is not good for those who already have a negative image of Elvis Presley. For die-hards only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Entertaining Mess...a Real Howler","review":"Words fail to describe how awful this film is...and yet, I have not enjoyed watching a movie this much in a long, long time. It is screamingly funny, albeit in mostly unintentional ways. The dialog is somewhere south of stupid; the sets look as fake and cheap as the backyard of \\"The Brady Bunch\\"; the costumes seem to be from someone's attic; and the music is vapid and cheesier than a vat of Velveeta. There is one very creepy sequence where Elvis' character encourages an overly precocious young girl to dance \\"seductively\\" for him, and of course, racist stereotyping abounds throughout. Elvis gamely tries to make his character credible, but at times, I think he deserves an Oscar simply for not rolling his eyes. By all means, see this movie with someone you love, and be prepared to hoot like a tree full of owls.

Yet the conclusion is so powerful that I quickly changed my mind. Read these one at a time, not in one gulp, because the same themes do recur. These will appeal to readers of Barbara Pym and J.B.

A few of the stories are scary, but most of them are just plain mysteries which have the reader waiting for the surprise - or shock - twist at the end of each. Some of the short stories's twists are based on physics - such as in The Face of Helen - while others are more like plays with a dramatic twist. This is a difficult book to visualize. If you read books by visualizing the plot and the characters as if you're making a movie, you will have a hard time reading this because this book is almost like an engineering textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Every transformer and power strip is different.

It contains chapter questions that stimulate class discussion. It also covers more than psychometrics - it discusses the social, philosophical and historical context in which testing takes place. Students' reactions are generally positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not indicative of his style at all","review":"After listening to his 2nd and 3rd albums, I decided to pick this up.

I've directed a production of one of his plays, and also studied his work rigorously during an undergraduate research fellowship in the Humanities at Wake Forest University.

The Dover Thrift Edition version is translated by Edwin Bjorkman. A brief introductory note states that the play first appeared as a printed text in 1888, a year before its first staging.The play's title character is bold and flirtatious; her behavior, unsurprisingly, leads to controversy. \\"Miss Julie\\" is a fascinating glimpse at a society that is rigidly ordered around class stratification, gender roles, and sexual conduct; the play looks at the consequences when people resist this rigid order. The play has some really startling, thought-provoking dialogue.Recommended companion texts: \\"Hands Around,\\" by Arthur Schnitzler; \\"Daisy Miler,\\" by Henry James; and \\"Cuckoos,\\" by Giuseppe Manfridi. Each of these three literary works shares at least one significant theme or motif in common with \\"Miss Julie.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia Gulia","review":"This play was pretty entertaining all the way through. There's a bit of anti-woman propaganda in there, but everyone knows August Strindberg wasn't a big fan of women. Looking past that, the dialogue is great and the story is pretty interesting. These characters are actually three-dimensional and have a depth of feelings that would be great to see on stage. A good actor could really create an awesome piece with this play. Definitely recommend it as a quick read and there's a few monologues in there. A 20-25 year old woman could do a Miss Julie monologue, and a 25-35 year old man could do a Jean monologue. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic romance","review":"The first time read this play was in summer school when I had to play a part of Julies role. After I got home read the whole play and in school I got the chance to participate a cource that followed the paractices of Miss Julie. August Strindberg was a weird or very unlucky man. Whole his life he looked for the woman of his life and everytime ended up with strong women that he end up hating. Strindberg was also a woman hater in allmost every meaning of the word. I think that he had fun while playing whith Julies life. The play is based on a true story. Jean is Strindberg, Julie is his 16 yrs old lover from his summer place and Kristen is Strindbergs wife Harriet. I like the play, but I can't help that Strindbergs life and ideas offected me very much. This play made me sick and charmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classism and sexism combined","review":"How can this be a great \\"modern\\" playwright whenthe views and themes of this major play have a better partfor the 17th century than the 20th?I thought about it and if it was produced in San Franciscoeven with it's respect for the arts, on meritsthe play would be jeered.Woody Allen thought that Strindberg hated women,but I think he just lacked any understanding of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book I've memorized","review":"My only complaint about this book is that it needs to be republished as a board book. We have already read two copies of this book to shreds, and taped it together numerous times.This is one of those sweet little books that I don't mind reading over and over. Even as the pages fall apart, I can still keep reading it, because I have it memorized. The last copy was well worth the special order required since it was out of print. The shipping cost more than the book. I am not a specialist in early childhood education (except that I have four young children) but this book just seems to have the elements that make for a good young children's story -- a train, a tunnel, dancing animals, a monkey band (\\"drummity drum went the drum\\"), mild suspense, an \\"all's well\\" ending -- not to mention the melodic phrasing and adorable cherubic illustrations.Just writing about it makes me want to go read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"For me, it's definitely a page turner. I chose this book for the subject of my master's thesis in French lit. Diderot truly brings to life the sufferings of his heroine, Suzanne. The idea of forcing young women to take vows had already fallen out of favor at the time Diderot wrote this novel, so it was not as revolutionary as it may seem. All the same, Suzanne arouses the reader's sympathy and we follow her in anguish from convent to convent and long for her escape.One caveat: You may find it disturbing that the author depicts female communities, above all religious communities, as inherently sick. This is not necessarily an accurate picture of convent life in 18th-century France, even though Diderot includes many factual details about ceremonies and daily life in religious orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Books","review":"Animorphs is one of the coolest series ever.

The metal is very flexible and easily bends around the insides of the slides. The brushes on each end are durable and last FOR YEARS!

This is definitely a wise investment for maintaining a trumpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots to think about","review":"This is a really good BRITISH made-for-TV movie.

In this instance, a couple of special effects scenes that convince the world the second messiah has come, combined with a bit of dialogue about mankind's need to clean up our act lest the end come, adds up to nothing memorable except frustration and disappointed expectations. Those behind this item may have had something to say, but it got lost along the way and left only a highly idiosyncratic story line and dialogue which is likely better understood by the writer than by anyone else. I know many different kinds of critical thinking people, but can think of few of them who wouldn't be well advised to avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointed","review":"I absolutely loved the other Margaret George novels; this however is sadly disappointing. I agree with the reviewer who said is is uninspired. It reads like a young adult Sunday School lesson. Mary's dialogue is so unbelievable; the setting is so \\"clean\\" and brings to mind 1950's Hollywood Bible stories. I forced myself to read over half way through thinking it would get better, but it doesn't. Margaret - you can do much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I was swept away by Margaret George's soulful and sensitive portrayal of this great saint. With her vivid descriptions, thoughtful characterizations, and elegant prose, George proves, once again, to be the grand mistress of historical fiction. I loved this book. I loved the way the author breathed life into this mysterious woman and showed us how her life might have unfolded. I found Mary's story to be achingly poignant and incredibly realistic, and I commend the author for framing her story within the structure of the Bible rather than conjuring up some New Age theory. Margaret George writes meticulous, well-researched, well-documented fiction that explodes with human drama. I was therefore deeply offended by the prideful review from the reader who questioned the author's faith. The reviewer might think this personal attack showcases her own superior religious scholarship, but all it showcases is her stunning ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 600+ pages","review":"I've read all of George's other novels, so I was extremely excited to see this one on the new release shelf at my local bookstore. In all of George's other novels she has revealed additional viewpoints, and helped me to critically think about characters that history has villainized. However, Mary is the exception. This book sticks pretty closely with the Biblical standard and doesn't really fictionalize anything to keep the reader guessing or excited. This book would be good for a Christian youth camp or a Christian book club, but if you are not Christian this book is extremely trite. I'm not sure I would have stuck with this novel except for the fact that I needed to rationalize the hardcover price to myself. If you would like a good historical fiction book, try Henry VIII, or Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, Called Magdalene is by far George's worst effort, and I'm not sure I'll run out and buy her next novel as this is SO disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 pages too long","review":"I started this book because it was selected for our book club and that is why I finished it. The most exciting part was when Jesus went to Jeruselum. The rest was fairly tedious. Our group really had a problem with the Mary Mother of Jesus character. She was visited by an angel before Jesus' birth, people worshiped her baby after his birth - yet she is surprised and doesn't initially believe in Jesus' mission! This book could have told the same story and have been a much more interesting read in 300 pages instead of 600."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Mary Magdalene recognized","review":"Having read Margaret George's Cleopatra, I was pleased to see that this book wasn't going to send me to the optometrist for stronger glasses. Cleo was tiny print and a whole lot of it. Mary, Called Magdalene was compelling & as a Catholic, I found it rewarding that the woman that I always felt got a bum rap from my church was fleshed out in such a glorious fashion. She was there when all the male disciples weren't. She played a very important role in Jesus' ministry. Combining fact & fiction, George makes Mary Magdalene come to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I love Margaret George books. Having said that, \\"Mary Called Magdalene\\" was the most disappointing of the lot. Give me Henry, with his robust character and Will his Fool. Give me Mary Queen of Scotts...was there ever a more ill-fated woman. But spare me this Mary of Magdalene. I couldn't relate to her on any level....not biblical, not emotionally, not even as a \\"good read\\". A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry beats Mary Again!","review":"Trained by the wonderful Autobiography of Henry VIII, I expected a lively attack or an imaginative twist in MG's treatment of the mysterious saint.

This book is a slightly boring, but also exceedingly interesting overall with detailed information on how Mary from Magda may had lived in a fictionalized biography. She is a Jew with very strong Jewish traditions, and it is interesting how so much of the ancient culture seemed accurately; food, locations, traditions, etc.,. and how Mary, her family, and the other Jewish tribes interact in their very convincing setting. And you get a perspective from a women in her own time and people. If you read it, do it on your spare time so that you can savor and appreciate the well contrusted setting and life of Magda. This isn't a book to be very excited about, but a nice one to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain boring","review":"I almost never give up on a book, but after forcing myself onward for about 200 pages, I finally quit on this one. I like historical fiction, and I'm familiar with the Bible, and with the history of the period, so that's not the problem--or, rather, that is the problem, because I was looking for something new, interesting, creative, surprising, and compelling. Instead, this book is just plain boring. The characters, dialogue, and plotting are too often flat (which is to say, either predictable or unpersuasive). Put in the fancier terminology of literary theorists, there is a total lack of \\"de-familiarization,\\" i.e., taking something familiar (e.g., the biblical story, and biblical history), and somehow treating it in a new, different way (as via metaphor or allegory) to give the reader a new experience, and a new level of insight. If you want a good literary treatment of a pivotal biblical figure, read Frederick Buechner's The Son of Laughter (about Jacob)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL, FLAT, BORING SORRY MARGRET G.","review":"I loved Cleopatra and 3 other books I read of George's...but this one I had to put down even though I read 2/3's of it.
