However, I must say that it isn't as good as the original, albeit well worth buying in its own right. Oh, and Track 5 is the best (shameless plug)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just great CCM but great MUSIC!","review":"As a long term reformed Christian, I had pretty much gotten to where I felt virtually all CCM music was just second rate bands that couldn't get a contract without trading on the \\"religious\\" label. My favorite modern religious song had always been Eric Clapton's \\"Presence of the Lord\\". But then I read an article about the resurgance of Calvinism amoungst Christian youth and a few CCM rock bands and decided to try Caedmon's Call. I was pleasantly shocked. Derek Webb and company have managed to pull off the difficult task of bringing reformed theology into a modern context. I can't thank you guys enough. So far everything I've heard is first rate. Along with Jars of Clay, Derek Webb and Caedmon's Call are the best of what will hopefully be a coming flood of Christian alternative rock. I love it. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No easy answers","review":"What I like about Caedmon's Call and 40 Acres is their wonderful, lyrical honesty. With the rise in popularity of contemparary Christian music, we are swamped with airbrushed groups singing about a Christianity where nothing is difficult anymore. This is hardly the truth. It's hard to be a Christian in this world, and Caedmon's Call taps into that with their deep lyrics that showcase the educated and inspired minds that wrote them. Whether it's the difficulty of maintaining faith (Shifting Sand), struggling with materialism (Faith My Eyes), growing jaded (Pertified Heart), or fearing for the future (Table for Two - my theme song), Caedmon's Call shines. In the midst of the struggle is peace (Thankful), heartbreak (Somewhere North) and redemptation (40 Acres)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Once again I think that they have gotten away from melodies and other elements that would make this a good album. The lyrics are strong and they follow Jesus, but the music is lacking. I personally wouldn't purchase this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's 50-50. I like some, not the rest.","review":"Caedmon's Call is very interesting. Half of their songs are written by a non-performing friend of theirs, and the rest by one of the musicians. The problem is, their writing styles are completely different. I really like the Derek Webb-penned stuff (especially Somewhere North - it is by far the best Caedmon's song yet). But the Aaron Tate stuff is just mainstream pop that not only sounds very undistinctive (ie. like many other comtemporary Christian bands), but sounds exactly like the Aaron Tate songs on the last albums. My verdict: The Derek songs are keepers, the others are throwaways. Nothing against the performers, it's the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Thankful\\" I'm not Hyper Calvinist","review":"Yes, words do have meaning.....whether you like Caedmon's style of music or not, biblical evangelicals should find \\"Thankful\\" very disturbing. Caedmon's Call's Calvinistic roots and their veneration of Reformed traditions really come to the forefront in this tune and a closer look at the lyrics reveals the hyper-Calvinistic doctrine of deterministic predestination and reprobation: \\"I can't refuse,....Because I have no choice....Through faith that's not my own\\". I love CCM, but please go beyond the surface of the music and look at the substance of everything out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This cd was my introduction to an awesome, profound, beautiful music group that knows its stuff. I was bowled over by the depth and beauty of 'Shifting Sand', and 'Daring Daylight Escape' gets stuck in my head every time I hear it, it is so catchy! If you are even considering purchasing it-- go for it! My favorite track is 'Faith my Eyes' because it makes me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work","review":"This is one of the best Christian albums I have ever heard. This band really seems to be coming together and their lyrics are thought provoking and real. It's refreshing to see their walk with the Lord out there so open and honest. I look forward to hopefully many more albums to come. I saw them live in March of 99 and if you get a chance to see them, go - it is a great concert. Get this CD - you will really enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely not the end for you Sailor Moon Fans..","review":"As all of you Sailor Moon Fans know, this is not the end to the Sailor Moon story..

It begins that Chibi-Moon has been kidnapped by Queen Nehelania and her dream mirror is stolen so Nehelania can finally have Pegasus! The extras on this DVD aren't impressive, but you can watch the episodes in both English and Japanese with subtitles. I prefer Japanese version, but the only flaw is that some of teh lines aren't as funny as they are in English. It's interesting to see how the scripts differ, though. sometimes teh English version put in lines where the Japanese version had no dialogue. Overall, an awesome DVD that is sure to make you sensitive ones cry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Karaoke CD","review":"This is a really good Karaoke CD but there are not enough songs on it.

Considering my ferrets do everything possible to make them dirty I like the fact that the ceramic is a bit heavier (unfortunately not enough to deter my ferrets though) & is very easy to clean whether you only need disinfectant wipes or you need to disinfect & soak. Great little bowls. I would buy these again, & I recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"so much fun","review":"I have no idea if this is a good lunch box. We owned ours for 6 years and never once packed a lunch in it. But it has successfully carried the following: matchbox cars, trains, videos, stuffed animals, bugs (live and dead), legos, building blocks, raisins, underwear, binoculars, expired credit cards, pokemon cards, plastic animals and, of course, more trains.3 year olds will love this because it comes with different pieces and has different compartments and so it's fun to take apart and put together.The only flaw is that the outer compartment can be hard for little kids to open and close. And the straw bottle cleaning problem others have mentioned.But still, if you have a Thomas fanatic, get this for him or her even if there will never be a lunch in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I love this 3 piece lunch box set. All three pieces are made very tough and durable. The thermos has a great seal and does not leak. The button on top of thermos is strong enough not to pop open on its own, yet easy enough for my 5 year old to open on his own. The sandwich holder is great, I love the 2 levels, sandwich on the bottom and extra stuff in upper compartment. The lunchbox itself is heavy duty with easy open slide, it is roomy and fits plenty of food for my son at school all day. The little compartment on the front is great for storing utensils or extra items. I love this product and would highly recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but small","review":"The lunch box is very nice, my son love it. But it is small for the quantity of staff that he needs to carry every day to the daycare: lunch plus two snacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro cool","review":"I gave this 5 stars for fun, because my son loved it from day one, and would not leave the store without it. He played with it for days while we waited for school to reopen after Christmas.I rated it 5 stars for educational value, because it made him want to go to school, which is a significant educational achievement indeed.Unfortunately, I had to mark it down, because the water bottle is already broken at the point where the button to press it open meets the cap. Also, the straw is hard to clean, especially after a young child eats a cheesy snack and nibbles on the straw.Lastly, the front compartment is very difficult to open, especially for a young child, so you end up not using that section at all.Other than these, it's tough, it's cute, and it's a retro look that parents remember all too well. Substitute another bottle, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer Please Recall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The lunch box broke without me dropping it. I am extremely disappointed in the product. I need now to get another lunch box for my son, I wasted my money by purchasing this one. He did not even take it to school, the same day i received it the same day it broke. Extremely disappointed. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean and durable - needs more space!","review":"I bought this to replace an insulated Crocodile Creek lunchbox that just ended up smelling bad despite diligent washing/disinfecting - it developed mildew inside the lining. I wanted a solid plastic lunchbox that was easy to clean. Added bonus that my son is obsessed with Thomas... So, as expected, this is durable and easy to clean. Issues: I wish the sandwich box was microwaveable. I give my son hot lunches alot and cannot use this container for them. And I wish the box was bigger. I have a hard time fitting everything in (but to be fair, he's getting multiple snacks and lunch packed in there), and we do not use the thermos (if we did, we REALLY wouldn't be able to fit anything). And I do miss having an insulated lunchbox! His freezer pack is totally liquid and warm by the end of the day - I'm a little worried about how we're going to make it through the summer months with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small & Flimsy","review":"Bought this is in January for my son to use for his daily lunch box. It is May and I already have to buy a new lunch box. It was smaller in size than I originally expected. The latch to keep it closed is loose and doesn't stay too secure. My son being 3 dropped it on the floor once and the plastic cracked. Not very good quality for a kids lunchbox. I am buying an soft sided insulated bag this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice and impresses the kids - but it is NOT durable","review":"Our son loves loves loves his lunch box. Is very excited to take it to school everyday. But, everytime, it takes even the tiniest of tumbles, it cracks. The thermos is also the same way....broke WAY too easily. We still use both because we haven't had the time to replace....but we will have to replace it very soon...it is only a month old. Needless to say, we'll be looking for a vinyl or tin lunch box this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Quick to Break","review":"This lunch box broke within one week of buying it. The stand on the bottom cracked (can't be fixed) and the thermos broke a week later (totally destroyed). Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be made better","review":"We like the lunchbox because of the cute designs,but were a little disappointed in it's durability. The first time I dropped it on the ground,it scratched off parts of the design. So,mom did some creative thinking and did some touch up paint and sealed the design with \\"self laminating sheets\\". That did the trick. We also wished the thermos and lunchbox were insulated. Other than that, it's o.k."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas The Tank Engine Sidekick- 3-piece Lunch Box Set","review":"I had a hard time finding a plastic lunch box, but AMAZON.com had it.

I feel the plastic lunch boxes are easier to clean and safer for children.Thank you for having this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No durability","review":"Used this ten times before a slight fall to the floor cracked the latch off, popped everything out, thereby cracking the sandwich container latch and breaking it, as well. I'm now rubber banding the sandwich container and taping shut the lunch box until something better comes. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes for poor quality","review":"This appeared to be the perfect lunch box for my little Thomas the Tank engine fan. It has a box for his sandwich with another attachment inside of the box for chips, carrots, etc. It also includes a cute little thermos with a straw attachment inside of it that you push a little button and the straw pops out with the thomas insignia on both. AND THEN, on top of all that wounderfulness is a little door on the outside of the lunch box. First day of school my baby was \\"the man\\" with his Thomas lunchbox. Second day of school, he dropped it on the way to school and the latch broke AND a hole busted out of the bottom of it. Talk about kill a child's joy... I paid $25 dollars for this lunch box! How is it going to break that hard after the second use. It just shattered like it was glass! It dropped out of his hand, it wasn't thrown. The good thing is if it was not for the sandwich box and thermos he would have had no lunch. You know I want my money back, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not durable","review":"My son got the Thomas the Tank Lunch Box Set at the start of kindergarten. By the second day, the front compartment had broken off. We are very disappointed with the quality of this product as my son is not a rough and tumble young man. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst lunchbox ever","review":"My son is a Thomas fanatic. This lunchbox didn't last one week without one of the legs snapping off, so it wouldn't stand up. Then a few weeks later, he dropped it and the handle shattered. Total waste of money. It's a shame - it has a nice storage box in front, but the quality is below even what I'd expect from a Chinese sweatshop."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a TOTAL piece of garbage!!!","review":"I wanted to organize my finances, and friends have recommended using quicken. I have a degree in finance and work at a software company, and this has to be the most confusing program I have ever used. Entries are constantly being placed into the wrong categories, payments to credit cards are showing up as INCOME and EXPENSES at the same time. Transfers between checking and savings keep showing up as income on reports (by quicken's estimate, I am making 4x my salary in income just because I move money between accounts.)I think I am going to dump this program and use Excel instead ... I spend aboout 3 hours every week just trying to get everying to balance, and this program is taking a lot longer than it would do do things by hand.

It reserves huge amounts of screen real estate for Quicken advertisements and messages. Two examples of the steps backwards: (1) you can no longer work while downloading information and (2) you cannot suspend your computer while Quicken is running. It says \\"Quicken does not support standby mode.\\" They've changed to user interface for the worst. For example, reconciled items are now grayed out, with no way to change it back to normal. Also, the investment transaction register now doesn't show the comment lines.I have found no substantial improvement. I think Quicken has decided they're a monopology and don't have to try anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I've been using this program since way back when and loved it. But then I was forced to upgrade because they are no longer supporting Quicken 2000 (which I have used for ages without problems).I couldn't even register the program.

I just uninstalled Quicken 2004 after 5 frustrating days and went back to the 2003 version. I have been a loyal Quicken user for as long as I can remember and plop down the $$ to upgrade each year. Whoever was in charge of this release should lose their job. One Step Update flat out does not work in 2004. The product hangs the system for no reason all the time, and seems to be just slower than any previous release. Further, I was unable to find a single new feature of note to justify the $59 upgrade price. If they fix the bugs, especially One Step Update, then maybe I will give it another try, but so far this looks like an absolute waste of money.

The bugs keep popping up. For example, my security list can not remember the Vanguard S&P500 Index (VFINX). I have to enter it as a new security each time I want to use it. Do I sound frustrated?

No real new functionality has been added to the program in years, but now they only support the \\"current\\" version so once your version is more than a year old you're screwed - if you find a bug (and there are MANY!!!) either upgrade, pay a ridiculous fee for support that may or may not fix the problem, or you have to live with it.

My data converted just fine. Now, however, I cannot access any budget data. Anytime I try to look at my budget, I get a fatal error and the program shuts down. This goes for the \\"overview\\" information on all accounts as well. I was on the phone with Tech Support, who had me do a \\"safe\\" install...that didn't work.

The real problem is the handling of the data file.From Quicken 2.0 for DOS all the way though Quicken 2003, I've never lost data. Now, with Quicken 2004, Intuit has corrupted my data file 3 times in the last 2 months. I do not have time to re-enter and re-build my data file every month.Goodbye Intuit. I would revert back to Quicken 2003, but Intuit's support is sub-par also. Right now, their site is down.

No apologies!","review":"I can't understand the bad rap Quicken 2004 is getting here. I have used Quicken for almost 20 years and this upgrade was both smooth and easy. I really like the new look. More importantly, Quicken 2004 converted my 2001 information flawlessly, and I was up and running in just a few minutes. Sure, the opening screen is very different, but you have to expect that with an upgrade. It took a matter of minutes, not hours to become familiar with the new interface, and I really like many of the new one-click navigation features. I give it 4 stars; the fifth star would have to be earned by the VP in charge of Intuit's almost non-existent tech support staff. I said earlier I have been using Quicken for almost 20 years, but I gave up on its tech \\"support\\" more than 15 years ago. Too bad, the program itself deserves five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just adding to the list","review":"If I weren't so angry about the forced upgrade, I'd really feel sorry for Intuit. They've obviously got a dog of a product (I mean - have you ever seen so many 1 star reviews?), and they're forcing people to upgrade to it. I experienced more crashes in the first day than I had in 17 years of previous Quicken use (this was with the upgrade to R5!).I think the original Quicken was possibly the best piece of PC software ever written - high quality, fast, and easy to use.

Did this and had to re-enter all information from about three weeks. Data continues to become corrupted with faulty reporting. I have spent countless hours reloading and updating and finally gave up. Found an old 2002 file from first of January and I'm in the process of installing 2002 back on and updating all transactions (stock dividends & investments can't be done automatically). Don't buy this product. A company as large as Intuit has to fix this. It's a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is a setback, not an upgrade","review":"I have used some version of Quicken for many, many years. Each time I have upgraded, the product was just a little bit better. I was crazy to upgrade from Quicken 2002. This product is a mess. I have yet to work for more than 15 minutes without it freezing on me. You have to use brute force (the Task Manager) to get it to close so you can start again. The user interface is also a step in the wrong direction --- it is much less intuitive than Quicken 2002. There are many more (though less severe) bugs in the product, but you're better off not buying it and sticking to what you already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken has really blown it","review":"I just spent an hour looking at Quicken's Web site to find out why my version of Quicken Deluxe 99 no longer would connect with Quicken's servers to download current stock prices on my holdings only to find out they no longer support my version or Quicken 2000. Unbelievable. Like a gallon of milk, Quicken software should start carrying an expiration date. They offered a \\"deal\\" to upgrade for $39.95 that I considered but after reading these reviews (they are putting their ads on the user interface? Ugh!) I feel forced to switch to MS Money instead. The decision to no longer support versions of their software that are just four years old has definitely backfired. After 14 years of using Quicken software (started in the DOS days), it's seems time to say adios to Quicken. Thanks to everyone here for warning me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Improvements, Lots of New Problems","review":"I have used Quicken for over 10 years. This version is probably the worst yet. It reserves huge amounts of screen real estate for Quicken advertisements and messages. Two examples of the steps backwards: (1) you can no longer work while downloading information and (2) you cannot suspend your computer while Quicken is running. It says \\"Quicken does not support standby mode.\\" They've changed to user interface for the worst. For example, reconciled items are now grayed out, with no way to change it back to normal. Also, the investment transaction register now doesn't show the comment lines.I have found no substantial improvement. The business features, in particular seem the same or worse.I think Quicken has decided they're a monopology and don't have to try anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much SLOWER than Quicken 2000","review":"For some reason, typing into the payee or memo fields of the register is extremely slow. There is a very perceptible and annoying lag between pressing a key and seeing the character show up on the screen. This is on a 2.8GHz Pentium 4 with a gigabyte of memory.

I have LOST all files through file corruption 3 times. The last was tonight at 23:05! Quicken hasno support and has lost my business for good. On-line accounts never balance...

Hope the same programmers haven't been at work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe they how they changed it!","review":"What happend??? Quicken used to be so great and easy to use. The new 2004 is shockingly different! I would have never upgraded from 2002 if I new how bad the new interface was. I want my old account register back not that thing on the side this whole program should not have been released. I implore inuit to release 2004 in the old style or at least give us choices.

Was tempted to buy Quicken 2004 but after reading the reviews decided to stay with Quicken 2002. It has bugs but at least I know where they are.I recently ordered Quicken checks... What a pain... the on-line software did not work and the first guy that I talked to in India could not speak understandable english. However, the second person was able to help me spend my money.I will never buy another upgrade from Intuit again. I hope that by boycotting them they will get the message. If enough of customers refuse to buy maybe they will do something about their poor quality products and services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine by me","review":"Been a Quicken user since 1990, upgraded because of non support for Quicken 2000. I live overseas but still do the majority of my banking and investments in the US - so online capability is key. I was a bit afraid to upgrade but this seemed to be the better option than Money. So far everything is great. I downloaded the software - backed up my data (twice)- let the installer uninstall, install, and convert the data - and it works great. Even automatically went to the Fidelity site and set up all the details of my 401k. I have to get used to the new GUI, but it seems to be fine for me thus far.Time will tell, but 4 stars for me so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error 1311","review":"I got this software and installed it.

The Quicken software also syncs with PocketQuicken very nicely. I was surprised to see the bad ratings from other buyers about the 2004 version so I purchased it and it has worked very well, so far. I've never known Intuit to have satisfactory customer service so if you are lacking in PC experience, you might end up being somewhat frustrated with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the warnings!","review":"I actually have Quicken 2004 in my shopping cart and was ready to check out - until I read the testimonials.

No other problems yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"As a long time Quicken user who upgraded from 2001 to 2004, I cannot believe what has happened to the program and the support for Quicken. I must agree that there are many bugs and I have lost and have had corrupted all of my investment and personal financial information. I have been online with little success from people who don't really understand. They apparently are using scripted responses. My spouse is a CPA and we have used Quicken for many years. We have now tried using Microsoft Money 2003, but the reports are poor and it is challenging to use in some areas. I suggest using older versions of Quicken. If I could only easily reenter all of my information to Quicken 2001!!Intuit did similar tricks with Turbo Tax last year. I agree with previous reviewers about their \\"forced\\" use of online services. I would be interested to hear from knowledgeable software people to see if they add cookies etc. to our computers as they did with Turbo Tax 2002. Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible piece of software!","review":"This is one of the worst pieces of software I've ever purchased! New features have in recent versions have been minimal with even major bugs not being fixed.

I called tech support but they wanted to charge for support and they have no online support. I've since returned the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative star rating","review":"Like many reviewers here, I wish there were a NEGATIVErating star for total junk like this. Also like manyreviewers here, I am a longtime Quicken user, since the DOSdays. Please do NOT purchase Quicken 2004!!! Aside from theforced-upgrade thing, this new version has a klunky interface,numerous bugs (like wrong balances after data conversion),and all the \\"special offer\\" messages suggest Quicken 2004contains more spyware than a recent Outlook virus.

Don't upgrade; save yourself while you can!!","review":"What a huge mistake to upgrade...I've been using Quicken for 12 years, (just upgraded from Quicken '98) and this version is a shameless leap backward. Everything is less elegant, and there is Quicken marketing taking up screen space at every turn. All the bugs have made online stock price updates completely out of the question, and worse, Quicken has acted surprised that people are disappointed!! Now that I've had it for several weeks, I'm stuck because any entries made since the so-called upgrade can't be restored into an older version.Do yourself a favor and just stick with whatever version you're using. There is nothing here that you need, and take it from all of those of us writing...RUN WHILE YOU CAN!! IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU TO SAVE YOURSELF!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and getting worse","review":"Quicken 2004 Deluxe is a big disappointment. I have used Quicken for years now, and recently decided to upgrade from Quicken Deluxe 2002 to 2004. Unfortunately, I have found that the 2004 interface is less elegant, slower, harder to use, and much more confusing.Unless you like lots of screen flickering, windows minimizing and maximizing seemingly beyond your control, and Quicken's nonstandard way to manage the windows in which you're working, then stick with your older version of Quicken, or check out Microsoft Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken 2004, save your money","review":"Each new version of Quicken seems to arrive with a screen more cluttered than the last. This is the last version that I will be buying.I updated to Quicken 2004 hoping that it would finally become easier to use but it definitely is not. The screen is a cobbled up maze that is very difficult to follow and trying to do file operations is next to impossible. Some operations that I need to perform will have to wait because their \\"help\\" appears to have been written by someone from another planet. The instructions they give just do not work and in many cases, are wrong.I would love to go back to Quicken 2000 or Quicken 2001 but they fix it so the data cannot be read by their older versions.I am going to try an older version Microsoft Money soon if I can find one and if it will convert Quicken 2004 data."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Amazingly Buggy","review":"I have NEVER seen a commercial release of software this buggy before in my 20 years as a computer user. Almost every button does nothing, it hangs all the time, the online functionality is a complete failure (never even runs when you click the button), the download of the original software takes hours and locks your computer up (the download of msft money takes 7 minutes in contrast). DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE. I fiddled with it for 2 hours, and then promptly demanded (and got) a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"This is by far one of the worse computer programs that I have tried in recent history.Like other reviewers, I am a longtime Quicken user. The installation process was horrendously painful. The program does not interface well with Windows XP Professional, and it has serious problems operating over a network.\\"Tech\\" support is hardly supportive. Moreover, Intuit wants to charge $1.99/minute just to get its piece of junk installed on your computer. I spoke with an IT specialist at my office, and he confirmed the program was poorly designed.I would strongly recommend that you not purchase this program. Stick with your current program; find an old version of Quicken; balance your check book old school style; or use an abacus. Whatever you do, don't purchase this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next to Quicken 2003, the worst product I have ever used","review":"I have been using Quicken since '94, without incident. When I upgrade to Quicken 2003, my problems began. I can no longer, consistenly, reconcile online accounts with Quicken because, on occassion, it stops displaying to downloaded transactions. This problem can only be resolved by un-installing and then re-installing Quicken. Of course, it then only works for a little while before I have to repeat the un-install/re-install process. Upgrading to Quicken 2004 not only exhibits the same problem, it introduced a new one. On occasion, it fails to load my data. To get around this problem, I make it a habit of backing up my data after each use, so that updates I have made are available when I have to restore. Tech support? Forget about it, unless you have lots of bucks to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"one step forward, two steps back","review":"I was quite astonished when I upgraded to 2004 from 2002. I thought I was two releases behind, so it would be prudent to upgrade. While the user interface changes (I question if it was for the better: think fisher price toys), so much functionality is either now optional, forced, or not available in lieu of \\"neat\\" stuff which honestly is just dumbed down controls for a low-tech audience. For a list of this stuff, check out the other reviews as I have nothing new to add and several folks say it much better. In then end, I would question first why you think you need this upgrade? and if not an upgrade, but a first time purchase, save money and find an old version on ebay -- it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're forcing us to upgrade for online banking!","review":"Received an email from my bank stating that Intuit will soon be discontinuing online banking for Quicken 2000, and that I must upgrade to 2004 soon to continue to use online banking.Talk about forcing their hands in your pockets. I've not seen anyone mention this yet. I think it's abominable. I'm switching to Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! -10 stars","review":"This product is worthless. I have used Quicken for 20 years and had vertually no problems but I could not even get this version to install. The help desk was a joke so I threw the disk away. For now I am using Quicken 2002 but I am considering moving to Money. To be honest, I don't like Microsoft anymore than Intuit but at least their product works.Do Not Buy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the Exterminator","review":"I'd give a negative star if I could.I've used Quicken for many years, and this is a sorry, buggy excuse for a product. My 2002 Quicken did a better job and was easier to use. The 2004 Deluxe creates errors in data when it converts your old Quicken files, and this program can not add. The total of cash in reports does not match the total of cash in my portfolio. The helpful people at Quicken told me, \\"Quicken can add fine.\\" Some help -- NOT!!! Quicken 2004 Deluxe insists on creating a fractional share of stock when recording a split (4 for 3) and the fractional share of stock is calculated to more decimal places than the program will allow you to input as a sale. Thus, I have 0.0000137 shares of a stock that I can't get rid of. The new Quicken is just a buggy piece of junk that is designed to advertise the other Quicken services and products. Don't use this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult","review":"This buggy, terrible software is an insult to customers who have been loyal to Quicken all these years (beginning, in my case, in 1988). Once received, nag messages cannot be eliminated (there is a check-box titled \\"Do Not Ask This Question Again\\" on several features...this does not work, ever), Shortcuts return incorrect responses (e.g.: Ctrl/M - which is supposed to Memorize a Transaction, returns a Search screen), \\"Cannot Open Account\\" messages appear suddenly and without cause and data can be corrupted. The only improvement over the prior version is the ability to print Reports in color, which was inexplicably eliminated from several versions and which is now back. Tech Support is a bad (and expensive) joke. I used to recommend Quicken to friends...no more. They have failed to maintain any standards. This software is an insult, as I have said, to all of us who paid for it in good faith and tried to stay loyal to the product. The sad things is, they obviously do not care."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Good Software Goes BAD","review":"In my thirty-seven years of existence I have never been agitated enough about a product to write a complaint letter / review; however, Quicken 2004 is so horrible I just had to warn people. DON'T' BUT THIS PRODUCT.I have been a Quicken user for over 10 years, and I 'm just amazed at the poor quality of this release. The user interface is clunky and quite often flashes unnecessarily, on-line updates often fail, and one of my on-line accounts is de-activated because Quicken keeps sending the wrong password intermittently.And what genius decided to put the \\"accept all transactions\\" button so close to the \\"accept a single transaction\\" button. Twice now, I have accepted all transactions with invalid categories, because I mistook one button for the other.Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"General Quicken Comment","review":"I haven't upgraded to Quicken 2004 because it seems, from the reviews I've read here, to be even worse than Quicken 2003, a disappointing product. I had read last year's negative reviews, but upgraded again anyway, especially since I had been a satisfied Quicken user for years. Unfortunately, the negative reviews were right! Besides being sluggish, several standard and necessary functions of the application weren't even included anymore. Intuit basically shrugged. Sadly, the company seems to have lost it's way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing is an overstatement","review":"Do yourself a favor and save money by not buying this version of Quicken. Buy an older version instead if you are a loyal Quicken user. I have been upgrading my Quicken to newer versions every time there is a new release to Quicken since 1995. This is the first time that I truly can say I HATE IT. It put transactions into wrong accounts. I couldn't move the transactions to correct them. To say nothing of the awkward way to manually enter stock transactions. Heaven help you if you aren't doing an automatic download. After 2 months I had had enough and switched back to my older version of Quicken. I had to reload the transactions from those two months but it was worth it to avoid the continuing hassles. Granted my tax estimater is off but that is really the only drawback. And I won't even bother to address the spyware issues since everyone else reviewing that has gone on to great length about it. Buy this version at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicken Deluxe 2004","review":"This is probably the best program for personal banking management for those who don't necessarily want to use it to trigger interaction with the bank.

For the money, it's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY QUICKEN","review":"Poor programming. Importing feature make errors repeatedly.

The interface is very non-intuitive and clunky, for example the shortcuts make no sense - press \\"Alt G\\" for \\"Securities Bought,\\" or \\"Alt R\\" for Securities Sold. The hard to see cursor moves slowly through fields and gets stuck in awkward places making it difficult to enter data. Quicken 2004 is a huge step back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!!","review":"I just wanted to add my additional comments that this software is absolutely lousy. I've used Quicken since 2000 and the old version crashed occasionally and got used to working aroud it with lots of backups. But this is a new LOW in quality control. Not only does it crash regularly! But it also trashes my data file. I too have spent countless hours trying to resolve the issue constantly restoring my data file and re-entering my data!I actually read that it was full of bugs but Intuit decided to no longer support my older version and I was forced to upgrade.What a piece of junk and what a lousy vendor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I made the upgrade","review":"I've been a Quicken user since version 99. I have never upgraded, but was forced to do so to maintain my ability to download transactions.I had Quicken Basic 99, so went and bought Quicken Basic 2004. Well, I use Quicken to track my investments and Basic is really just a glorified checkbook. I returned the Basic for the Deluxe. I first backed up my 99 data to a CD(x2 just in case data became corrupted and needed to reinstall 99). Then uninstalled Quicken 99. I then installed Quicken Deluxe 2004 and restored data from the CD backup.Conversion took a while (maybe 20 minutes....I was getting nervous after all I had read).When I loaded it for the first time I was delighted. All accounts appear unharmed, my scheduled transactions remained, and everything is working as it should be.Getting my updates is also very easy.I am glad I made the upgrade (now that it is done and working well), but am still angry that I was forced to make the change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken 2004 Deluxe","review":"Buggy software.

I opted to use Quicken Deluxe a couple years ago when I needed to use it on a more consistant basis. I have always liked the flow of the software and have gotten used to the \\"upgrades\\" Intuit has put into it. I have to say, after using 2002 for awhile now, 2004 is a lot different. However, I think this version is fine and I will get used to the changes in it. There are no pop-ups for Intuit products and I haven't run into any bugs. I would like to point out, I didn't upgrade from a my previous version. I made backups of my files and uninstalled all of 2002(Windows Uninstaller and deleted directories). When I installed 2004 it transfered all the old information into the new program and has worked fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Year it's WORSE","review":"Intuit is slowing destroying Quicken. Every year the user interface gets more confusing, etc, the program gets more buggy and the customer service gets worse. Take my advice...if you just want a program to keep your checkbook on, or run a small business on, then try to find a old copy of Quicken for DOS ver8. I have run it with no problems in Win 95,98 and Xp. IT IS MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN THE WINDOW VERSIONS and it actually came with a USER's manual that was one of the best every written. You don't have all the fancy online bill paying, etc of the windows versions, but for basic stuff you will run rings around a Quicken for Windows user. The basic program has not been improved one bit since this version!!! and the manual itself will help you a tremendously if you decide to go with windows version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am on Windows 2000 (never any issues running ANY programs) I followed the simple instructions for installation.

I purchased a downloaded upgrade, and then my computer died [operating system issue], and I had to reinstall it. You have to call to get a new key, a very frustrating experience. It took several phone calls and being on hold for at least 20 minutes. At one point they wanted to charge me [$24] for getting a new key! Earlier this year, I purchased a copy for my accountant to use, I thought I was getting Quicken Basic but I ended up with New User--which does not allow you to import data--totally useless! I do not need the multiplicity of junk they've thrown in--most of which doesn't work well anyway, so if you have to buy it, buy the cheapest version you can get away with.This will be the last time I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you don't need support & you will!!!","review":"I just bought this program because I have been a Quicken user for several years and lost my old disk and just decided to buy the new version. First of all when you make a payment/ transfer from your Checking to a credit card it will count the payment as income on your income statement. Also the print option on this program doesn't work at all. It won't even let me into the setup or options or anything. I've tried & tried to get ahold of support and they charge $1.95 per min to help you fix a problem with they're program. I'm sorry but thats not how I do business.

Now that is IS 2004, Quicken will not work AT ALL! When I called the 'no support' number, and yes, in India, on Jan.1, the guy said they were getting alot of calls, and will fix it in 24 hours.

Couldn't even navigate around the program without windows app errors and crashes/reboots. Time after time. Put it on my XP system...and while it seems more stable...seems more cluttered and difficult to use than ever. They had something so good in the late 90s...and in the process of the last 3-4 years...have managed to ruin it. Terrible tech support...buggy software...complicated. I am so disappointed.

I can't believe a company like Intuit would really allow so many software bugs.Quicken has basically evolved into a bunch of layers on top of layers.

But when the program tries to start up, I get the same memory error other reviewers refer to. I can't speak to the program's new features because I can't even get it to run.Hoping for a patch or fix, I went to the Quicken Web site. There I found a page indicating Quicken has known of this problem since at least Aug. 28, and that it is \\"currently under investigation.\\"My solution is to reinstall the 2001 version, which has a few annoying bugs [also unfixed] but at least it works.

But this version has given me fits, problems with installation, converting, lack of customization, and poor, costly, and slow customer service to deal with these problems. PLUS backing up files are more complicated, and it leaves a little \\"gift\\" file on my desktop, something which Intuit says its aware of but can't do anything about right now. Capital Gains are impossible to track......so next move... MS MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Slow","review":"Maybe it's the fact that we are still running Windows 98 and have 256 MB RAM, but Quicken 2004 is running extremely slow, and has crashed our computer twice in the four times we have utilized the program. Supposedly it only needs 64 MB RAM and is compatible with Windows 98, but I am questioning that. Yesterday we got a message that we didn't have enough memory before our system crashed. The bugs that we dealt with a couple times a week with 2003 seem to be fixed, but at the rate we're going with 2004, I may be sending it back. I do like the new look which is why I am rating it 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy, Busy and Annoying","review":"I have been using Quicken for many years. I decided to upgrade the very stable and efficient Quicken 98 on a lark, but soon regretted it. The new user interface is very difficult to navigate, laden with Intuit advertising for other services, and impossible to customize.There are numerous bugs which Intuit seems in no hurry to fix.This software is not in a condition suitable for release. I wonder if the glowing reviews are from Intuit people. I am not certainly a Microsoft person. And I regret the direction that software is taking in this country: shoddy, flashy, and unstable. Intuit is making a big mistake here. They are trying to lock in a guaranteed market base much as Microsoft has done; but as Microsoft, they are releasing products that do not do the job properly. They will engender resentment and eventually lose this loyal customer base.I will not willingly purchase any more Intuit upgrades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most bugs ever from Intuit","review":"Don't bother buying Quicken 2004. There are significant bugs that Intuit has not fixed, even after two patch releases since the August release. I've used Quicken since the DOS days, basically about 13 years. If you have Quicken 2002 or 2003, DO NOT UPGRADE to 2004. If you don't have Quicken, check out MS Money first. I've always been a die-hard Quicken fan, but I'm disgusted with Intuit's poor quality in this release. Hopefully they'll keep releasing patches and get this dog fixed soon. If they ever do, I'll post an update. But for now, avoid Quicken 2004 at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Quicken 2004","review":"Quicken 2004 has a bug which will affect your computer's system and stop it from going into Standby or Hibernate power saving modes.This is a known bug and has been documented by Microsoft in their Knowledge Base Article. The worst thing is that Intuit knows about the problem from previous versions and has issued updates to fix the older versions but has not incorporated the fix into Quicken 2004.Intuit Tech Support stated that they will fix bugs after users report them. Apparently Intuit expects us to pay for their buggy product, test it, report the problems to them, and maybe they may fix it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken 2004 is BUGGY!","review":"I am a ten-year user of Quicken. I downloaded Quicken 2004, converted my data files, and began to use it. Issues I found thus far (I've reinstalled it a second time and the problems are the same):1) I keep getting application faults when I try to do a backup. I have to reenter the program and try again. Sometimes it takes 5-6 tries.2) Frequently, when I load the program, I get an application fault.3) On the investment overview page, there are several checkboxes that allow you to compare your investment returns against market indexes. The checkboxes are permanently disabled -- you cannot select them.4) On the financial overview page, the small version of the net worth graph is completely wrong. When you click the button to expand it, the information is correct.Overall, I am very disappointed in Quicken 2004. Thus far, there are no fixes to download. I never considered using Microsoft Money before, but I am now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid, be very afriad!","review":"I've been using Intuit products over 10 years, both at home and work.

I have lost hours, even days of my time working with customer support, I even spent $30 to pay for support for a \\"fix\\" that lasted all of 2 days.

This is the buggiest software I've ever encountered. I can't seem to use it without my system hanging up about 90% of the time. Their customer support is a joke too. Last year, Turbo Tax incorrectly included a deduction on my taxes twice, and after hours with their phone support folks and no help, I refused to pay for the software, and re-filed on another (practically free) site in less than 1 hour. Needless to say, I haven't even bothered to go that route with this product. I'm just going to find a replacement for it.This company doesn't have a clue. Stay away from their products. If you think Quicken 2004 is bad, 2005 will make you wish you were still on 2004. It has gotten worse with every upgrade -- I believe I've been using it since 1999.Makes me wonder about the VERY FEW users here that don't seem to be having problems.

I upgraded to 2004 in hopes of fixing some of the problems in Quicken 2003 and instead it got worse. About a month ago, I had to uninstall and reinstall just to get the product to work. Tonight I can't seem to customize reports. When I try, I hangs the program and I have to reboot. I have been fighting this for about three months. Too long, I thought to reenter a bunch of data, but I have rebooted one too many times. As soon as Money 2004 converts Quicken 2004 data, I'm going to give it a try. I know the reviews are bad, but it can't be any worse.

However, I had to reinstall it after a HD crash, and it cannot be re-registered, and therefore, it cannot be used. BE VERY CAREFUL.

Loved it in the early years, but as it became more complex, it developed quirks. This latest version immediately locks up my robust XP system if I open a browser and will lock it up after a while even when Quicken is the only program running. The only way to recover is a hard reboot! in XP!!! I used to enjoy tracking my finances, but since v2003 it has become a chore. What's worse, an upgrade still requires that you pay for support.

What a terrible user interface, retirement planner and report generater (as compared to Quicken 6). The main good thing about the program was the ability to download financial data.I came to this website to get opinions about the latest Quicken to see if my concerns have been addressed. I guess not. Forced upgrades, i.e. incomplete backwards compatibility. Sorry Intuit - no more money from me until you clean up your act. Clearly you do not currently care about your customers, other than to attempt to take money from their pockets.I think its time for open source financial planning software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely do not buy this product","review":"This product is pretty much despised by everyone who buys it -- just check all the other sites on the web for more scornful reviews. Intuit failed to do even basic tests for bugs.Biggest problem for me is that the \\"exclude internal transfers\\" setting does not work when you generate a report. So when you try to view your budget report, it's full of garbage lines that shouldn't be shown. Doesn't make it easy to manage your finances. Several months ago, Intuit told me that this is a known bug. But months go by, and they have no interest in fixing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow bug!! (User Interface)","review":"Funny things happen with the User Interface when you close one window. I am now wondering what kind of testing is Intuit performing?

I did.","review":"I switched to Microsoft Money 2 years ago, after a horrible experience with Intuit's tech support.At first I didn't like the interface as much as Quicken's, but I soon got used to it. In addition, every new version of Money has improved the interface and features to the point that I now prefer Money. Plus, you get a number of free offers with Money, including free bill pay for up to 2 years; that alone pays for more than the price of the software.And don't forget, Money has free tech support. You can download a free evaluation copy from Microsoft's web site.It's too bad, but Intuit seems to have stopped caring about its customers.

It was working just fine when I first got it, then problems started arising such as when I wanted to download bank and credit card information, it said that the servers could not be reached. Even stock information won't download. Quicken support is horrible as they only have chat support and after 2 hours on chat with their technical support folks, they had no idea and blamed the financial establishments I deal with. Why is that so when it's worked fine for 9 months, I haven't changed a thing in the configuration and both my credit union and my credit card issuer are BOTH experiencing problems? It's been going on for over 2 months now. A major headache. I whole do not recommend this buggy and poorly supported product.

This one from Quicken Deluxe 2003 to Quicken Deluxe 2004 is the first big disappointment with Quicken. Some basic functionality like Cash Flow report stopped working correctly. It worked 12 years ago perfectly. It now reports transfers between accounts as Inflow.Example if you pay a credit card bill from a checking ammount it would be considered as your Inflow. There is an option to Exclude Internal Transfers but it does not do anything.The support (I used online chat session) is a joke. They say that data file is corrupt first and that \\"the development team is aware of the problem and working on a fix\\" after.I am glad that I have a copy of my data file in 2003 format.Do not see any new functionality added since 2003 release.Save your money and skip this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently Intuit lost focus on quality","review":"This is sad. I have Quicken 1999 which is, as far as I know, completely bug free. Quicken informed me via a pop-up that I must upgrade to 2004 or some online features will no longer work. After reading the reviews, no way. Unfortunately this is becoming the new reality. American companies are shipping jobs overseas to save money. It is happening in more and more industries, especially including the software and service industries. I seriously doubt that Quicken is programmed in the USA anymore. Maybe someday Intuit will figure out that they relinquished control of their product and product quality when they shipped it overseas. Until then I will stick with the 1999 version and forego the online transactions. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's terrible","review":"So Intuit sent me friendly mail saying they were going to stop stock updates in the Quicken I use, Q2000. In a wildly self-serving manner they suggested I upgrade. I did.

GHOULS is one of the many sub-par books that left a bad taste in readers mouths and pushed them to other genres. (Pinnacle and Zebra were the absolute worst offenders.)Lee is like a 7th grade kid on the playground when he writes; full of tired yuk-yuk macho sexual innuendos, throwing gore for cheap thrills-- because he doesn't understand how to scare readers-- and generally insulting the genre and it's fans by polluting the market with garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pickup","review":"I bought this because I am a youth leader and though it would be something to pull ideas from.

The breaking was not due to rough play although it is reasonable to expect rough play due to the nature of the toy. I cannot recommend this toy due to the lack of durability.

The overall sound of this album isn't that far removed from 'Crisis' four years earlier.There is a heavy use of samplers which capture the various asian and oriental flavours that decorate this lavish production. For the serious muso's out there, side one is an instrumental based on the Balinese musical scale (yawn)called 'The Wind Chimes pt 1&2'. It's a journey through an impressionistic world music tapestry dotted here and there with Mike's trademark guitar antics.Side 2 contains a selection of radio friendly songs that paint various scenes from stories Mike has dreamed up. Guest artists include: Bonny Tyler, Kevin Ayers and main vocalist Anita Hegerland (who Mike subsequently married had 2 kids with and then divorced).

With a simple design modification this could have been easily overcome. In addition to it wasting an outlet, you also really need a 6\\" to 12\\" extension cord to really integrate this into systems for monitoring current consumption. Having to daisy chain extension cords or power strips though... this product just creates potential trip and fire hazards as well as clutter your space.On a plus side I guess.. the very poor form design may help you reduce power because you have only one outlet to use vs. two."},{"rating":"1","title":"This SUCKS","review":"This is a piece of junk, you can't view the data unless you have it plugged in, so for me, when I plug it into small or hard to get at places, or when I use bigger plugs (like the Air conditioner which the plug covers the display on the unit) I can't even read it, and if you unplug it, it loses all the data you were looking at.So even if you can manage to read it while plugged in, it doesn't really tell you anything useful, it just hasmeaningless stats.Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I found this to be a total waste of time and money.

All my outlets are close to the floor and the display is not backlit. It's really hard to read without good lighting. I've had to kneel down on the floor and use a flashlight a few times to read the display. Not a big deal, but an angled display would make it much easier to read without having to kneel down on the floor. Second, the prongs are not close enough to the bottom of the unit. Thus, it always takes up both outlets. If you plug it into the top outlet, the unit partially covers the lower outlet and renders it unusable.

I have an air purifier that stays on almost 24/7 so I was sure that it was hogging a lot of energy, however I was only using a mere 13 watts! Now I can feel comfortable about leaving it on without worrying about my energy bill.Now whenever I get a new gadget, I always test it with my kill-a-watt meter so I can set limits on how much I use that gadget. My energy bill has definitely went down since I have been using this, and I am even going to bring it to my mom's house to try to get her to change her energy-draining ways.My only complaint is that it covers both outlets.

The dark side of alien interaction was dealt with here, with the suggestion that humans are being exploited, not only for genetic material, but - and perhaps more importantly - for their emotions and psychic energy. This is an area that is under-researched but I think Eve Lorgen does a fair job of it in this concise presentation of what could be the real reason for alien abduction.And it's frightening.The only problem to the novice reader of this field is that one could be tempted to blame all their relationship failures \\"on the aliens\\" which may not be so, in fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive him","review":"Don't expect anything from this album, and you won't be dissapointed...there is nothing to remember from this one.

The Digital 8 format is fantastic, as it allows you to utilise existing Hi-8 tapes, and reduces the cost of tape purchases, given that the new Mini DV tapes are significantly more expensive. My only criticism of the product is that aside from not being the current model, it seems that the primary extra feature that this model offers over the lower models is that it has a larger sized LCD screen. Aside from that, this is an excellent product and quite possibly one of the best Digital camcorders on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick delivery, poor product","review":"Product comes with no instructions.

After one big drop exiting my dorm, it could never play again since the plasic hinge broke off, thus making the CD door harder to close. I couldn't play it anymore!

With the car kit's tape inserted in the cassette player of my car, the volume must be cranked to get a decent level and sometimes it distorts. Worse, it's really hard to open and insert CD's while driving. The mechanism to open it must be slid while keeping your hands from blocking the opening of the lid. A near impossibility to do with one hand while watching the road. It has a spindle inside to press the disc on (sopposedly to enhance the anti-skip function). Try doing this while driving! I'd rather prolong my life.

I have played both soundtracks almost constantly since I got them -- Star Wars is of course brilliant -- but as time goes on, I'm playing The Incredibles more. It's more big band than classical, it's bouncy, and it makes me a little happier each time I listen to it.Another reviewer said Michael Giacchino sounded like John Barry. For some reason, he reminds me more of Henry Mancini at the top of his game. Either way, I'm impatiently awaiting his next soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great score","review":"This soundtrack is an absolute joy to listen to. With music that uncannily evokes John Barry's early James Bond scores (especially Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice), Michael Giacchino has created a musical time tunnel capable of transporting listeners to the early nineteen sixties and the heyday of various action adventure series like Peter Gunn, Jonny Quest, the Man From Uncle and Secret Agent/Danger Man. The thought and craft behind each track is evident in the fact that you can remember exactly what part of the movie you were watching and the emotions you experienced when you first heard it. That kind of alchemy between screen action and score is a true rarity. A must have for fans of the wonderful Brad Bird movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a pastiche","review":"This CD has some wonderful music. Although the influence of John Barry predominates (not surprising, considering the look and feel of the film is set in a vaguely early 'sixties alternate reality), John Barry isn't the only influence. There are also hints of Leonard Bernstein, Henry Mancini, Count Baisie, and others from that period.Throw all these influences together with a sense of style and wit and you have one terric CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally unique experimentation","review":"I got this CD at a local outlet store, and i must tell you the content is a beautiful combination of dark, synth driven vocals and superb early 80s electronica. Unlike some of OMD's later albums, this one is much rougher and darker than any other i've heard. \\"Almost\\" is my favorite cut on the album, basically because of its fearful and cold driven synthline. \\"Bunker Soldiers\\" is one of those songs that really stick in your head for a while, as is \\"Red Frame/White Light\\". I also enjoy listening to \\"Dancing\\", which is kind of like a puzzle you keep trying to figure out but can't. \\"Mystereality\\" comes close to being too lighthearted for the album, though. But you can tell their experimentation pays off in the end with the very succesful \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Messages\\". Overall I was more than happy with the CD though. A wonderful debut album for OMD, I highly recommend it to anyone who are fans of McCluskey and Humphreys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut!","review":"Looking back now on OMD's history, is good knowing that this firtst release by Liverpool's electronic duo has aged very well.Back in the 80's \\"Messages\\" did so well, and still does. This new re-release that includes extra tracks is the best you can get, even better that the original back in 1980. If you are a true OMD fan, this is a must, even thought you may alredy have the b-sides from the \\"Navigation\\" CD, this is a good chance to get your hands on this CD and listen to this excellent extra version of \\"Almost\\" or \\"Messages\\" don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis","review":"Dumbed down \\"politically correct\\" post modernist bed-time stories. Not a hint of fairy tale delight, magic or wisdom exists in these stories. In one story, Little Polly (a/k/a Little Red Riding Hood)lives in the city yet even in this urban environment is being pursued by a wolf. Nonetheless she cleverly escapes by such tactics as taking the bus to her grandmother's house (No really.). In another story with a feminist subtext, a princess rescues a prince then decides he is a jerk (he is) and abandons him for the evil sorcerer. Then there is the tale of the knight that does not want to hunt dragons but prefers to read. Fortunately when pressed into service the dragon is friendly and harmless and actually helps the knight rescue a princess from a \\"Huff\\" by outwitting it. No violence please. If you are looking for bed-time stories worthty of your child's intelligence, try \\"Italian Folktales\\" by Italio Calvino."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fall in love with a Swedish girl...","review":"Lisa Ekdahl isn't quite Lisa Ekdahl without singing in Swedish, but this is just as superb just in a little different way. The jazz band Peter Nordahl Trio makes incredibly smooth music. I was a bit sceptic about them backing the fragile voice of Lisa, but only until I heard it. It really works great!Being Swedish, Lisa has a little of that extremely sexy Swedish accent. If you buy this CD, I guarantee you'll be lost in Lisa's girlish-but-great voice by the first \\"Now, baby, or never\\".This is a really great album and I recommend it to everybody despite the price. However, If you want the real Lisa Ekdahl experience, you should also buy one of her first three albums in Swedish. Even though you might not understand a word, Lisa's voice together with her own music is something best described as divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational, lush, and yet bare, proving less is truly more.","review":"This is the first album this year that has instantly blown me away. It features the classic sparse trio (piano, bass, and drums) and the thin-ish vocals of Lisa Ekdahl which were a common source of criticism about her previous album, When Did You Leave Heaven. Here her vocals remain thin but she's matured, the depth of her expression carries her through. Combined with the often eclectic variations of the Peter Nordahl Trio this album of mostly standards is familiar and suprising at the same time. A real listening treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mellow vocal jazz album","review":"Nice blend of coy humor and more introspective sounds, featuring the unique, big/little girl sound of Lisa Ekdahl. Also, don't miss the fabulous instrumental number by the accompanying Peter Nordahl trio, Plaintive Rumba.

Canon always had great optics, but with their facility in designing easy to use, intuitive controls for photo-copiers, they have also developed a knack for menu driven electronic devices. This was a huge shock for me after taking only analog photos since 1965 and suddenly using the PowerShot.

This is the third Canon digital that I've purchased (S40, SD20 previously). It works great right out the box--nice pics, syncs with Mac no problem at all.

Some of the pics under the sun came out overexposed (auto mode) which came as a surprise to me.The greatest dissappointment is the time it takes after a snap is taken to process the pic and store it (considering its a Digic III processor). Mind you, I use a standard Sandisk 1GB SD Card. It takes a while for the flash to get re-charged. Also, I found the battery performance dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"This runs on double A batteries.

The face focusing technology is cool (a little creepy how the box follows faces) and ensures that your focus is on the person and not an object. One minor dissapointment was the 16 MB MMC card - literaly only holds 9 photos - might as well not include it and knock a couple of bucks off of the camera or give a bigger SD card (512 MB or so) for a few more since it is WORTHLESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought As A Gift","review":"I purchased this camera a gift for my mother, it has the ease of use that she can pick up quickly while having advanced features that she can learn to use as she progresses with her comfort of the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon A560 - MAJOR battery issues","review":"The 560 worked great through the first set of batteries.

My first day of using it (after only owning it for 4 hours)the low battery sign came on - and that was only after taking maybe 15 pictures (and no - the camera was not on for 4 hours straight).

Batteries for this camera are a huge expense. Regular batteries only last about 15-20 minutes (also depending on how much you use it) and even if you use lithium batteries they do not last that long. Also the interval between taking pictures is very slow. Another part to thins camera breaking is that half of the settings on mine don't work or broke.

On show 26, she ends the show with \\"Here's To Us\\" by Cy Coleman, a song that is so well staged and performed that it makes you think that no one could ever sing it better.....indeed, she reigns supreme. In her career, Judy reached her apotheosis at Carnegie Hall, but the country as a whole did not see her perform there. In this series, captured magnificently by Pioneer Artists, it is evident that she knows just what to sing, perform, work the stage, and get the most out of a song, by singing from the heart.I definitely recommend that everyone buy this DVD set....you are in for quite a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trooper Garland's TV finale","review":"The trooper Judy Garland is fantastic in her final TV series performances.

I bought the black/black main 4 shelf unit and actually added 4 more 9\\" expansion shelves so the entire rack is around 6 foot tall. I also bought the rolling casters. The unit was easy to assemble and is very solidly built, mostly steel and heavy veneer. I've placed the heavier components on the bottom racks to keep it bottom heavy. I occasionally roll the entire unit in and out of a niche so that I can get back at the wiring behind it. Even though it is tall, I don't feel like the unit will fall over easily. The black backing of each shelf are two pieces of thin black veneer board with a cut out for wiring. They are easily removable and there is also a cut out in each shelf where cables/wires can be channeled from top to bottom.

Featuring Coleman Hawkins on sax, the album falls a little short of his \\"boss of the blues\\" triumph, possibly because of the abscence of Pete Johnson. Still, he lets loose with an extended version of Rebecca which gives you an idea what he must have sounded like back in the late 30's, early 40's when he would stretch songs out for quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collar","review":"I wanted a water resistant, highly visable collar, and I found it.

Looks really good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced socks","review":"I bought what I thought was 3 packages of gold toe socks from this website for $10. What I got was 3 pairs of socks-that's $10 per pair, when the retail price on the tag was $5!.When I complained to Amazon, I got an email back telling me that I was receiving a refund of $15, so now I was paying exactly the retail price on the socks-but only getting 3 pair when I needed 9 pair. I wrote back and never got any response.Be warned! Now I see that they are doing the same thing. $5 socks are being advertised at 3 for $7.50, but if you check carefully when you try to buy them, you are really agreeing to pay $7.50 per pair for $5 socks.Since Amazon is refusing to respond to my follow up complaint, I guess I will have to buy the other six pair of socks from a different website or go to my local store to buy them. Incredible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"vastly overpriced","review":"These socks came with a manufacturer tag showing the price as 3 for $12. The socks are fine (although a little thinner than I expected), but there are surely better values around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"As I have said before, I am an underwear and sock freak and cannot have enough of any. I have worn Gold Toe for years and in fact they are the only \\"everyday\\" type of crew sock I will wear. I have numerous pair in each of their colors and wish they made them in even more colors. These socks wear well, wash well and fit perfectly. There is no sagging. I run and bike a lot and when crew socks are required, you just cannot beat these things. These socks are always soft, right out of the bag and always fit like a glove. I wear jeans a lot along with chinos and these are perfect.The price here is certainly right and with my insatiable appetite for socks and the need to watch the dollars a bit closer, you just cannot go wrong here. I do find that buying them a dozen at a time is best. Nothing quite replaces the feel of a new pair of socks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I've gone through several portable players and this one turned out to be disappointing.

I think it is a dreadful and annoying collection except for one track. I think the duet (Crying) with Roy Orbison and k.d. lang is one of the best duos ever. It is the sole redemption for this sorry collection. Sadly, the CD version of this song lacks the warmth and magic of the vinyl version and is only mediocre by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to the concept of God","review":"This is a wonderful book that opens a child's imagination to what God might be like.

It has very poor light, and only one setting for brightness. Must be a new style. The enclosed pamphlet says there are two settings for brightness, but a sticker on the outside of the packaging says that it has a new one setting for brightness. Not a good idea, as that one setting is not bright enough, OR we had a defective light. Back it went to the store.

I ordered a LightWedge Original for each of us, as we like to read in bed, on airplanes, etc. They just arrived last week. We so wanted to love this product. However, it doesn't illuminate the whole page as described but just radiates one thin pale strip of light at the spine and around the edges, plus it throws a couple thin horizontal strips of light across the page. Talk about eye strain! I see some of the happy reviewers mentioned having two brightness settings. Our model has only an \\"on/off\\" switch. I expressed my disappointment & displeasure in an email to the manufacturer but got only a response suggesting we'd either used old, weak batteries or inserted them wrong. I replied that the batteries were fresh from the package, etc., but have had no further communication from them.This product is woefully overpriced for what you get. I'll be shipping them back to Amazon and asking for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive online","review":"My only complaint is the cost of this seasoning online.

After a few uses the line gets much much weaker, there is no protection the braid. I tried contacting the manufacture, and right away they tried to dodge the bullet saying I cut the braid on rocks, but where I fish there is no rocks, nice try. I am going to use the 50lb line I bought for catching fish under 10lbs in fear it may break on fish larger than that. There are other brands, Spiderline Tuff-Line XP, and Fireline.

The 2-disc format with the best collection of his greatest hits and overall songs, even if you already have some of his songs on other CDs. A few songs are missing from the collection, and I could have done without the Mega Mix at the end in exchange for 2-3 more songs, but this is still the best compilation of Frankie's fantastic music. This set comes with a great booklet chronicling his life and career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful of any special offers from this company","review":"I bought a TV from them that had a $300.00 rebate. Six months later I have not received my rebate. They claim I did not meet the terms of the rebate even though I have proof of filing on time. I have filed a complaint with the FTC about these guys. Despicable tactics. The rebate has a section called \\"Terms and conditions.\\" Beware: on another part of the form they have other terms which are not labeled as such. Luckily for me I complied with all the terms. This is just a tactic to hurt the consumer. I don't know if other vendors are doing the same but I certainly would be careful with these guys.Regarding, the LCD TV itself. It is okay. Certainly not the highest quality. I see all kinds of artifacts when there is motion (duh it is a TV) especially if the motion is a little fast paced ... as in a sport.

I finally was able to find an e-mail address- they don't make it easy- and sent a message complaining of all of the above. One week later I was fortunate enough to be home to answer a phone call from an Iomega rep who waived the $25 fee(what a company!)Based on my description of the problem,he said it needed to be replaced,gave an RMA#, I sent the thing in and got a replacement in a few weeks.The drive might end up OK, But I probably will not purchase another Iomega product after my experience with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another Brand","review":"This drive worked well for three months then died.

I loved it in the 80's and I love it today!GOOD QUALITY PROGRAM!I wish there were more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple movie with a profoundly moving message","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWUpfront, \\"Savannah Smiles\\" is a classic. It relies on a simple, humane story and gives a profound message emphasizing the need for compassion and love in life.Starring Bridgette Andersen, Mark Miller and Donovan Scott, it tells the story of a young runaway girl named Savannah Driscoll who unknowingly hides in the backseat of the stolen car of two escaped convicts. Alvie and Boots are very solidly played by Mark Miller and Donovan Scott as opposite sides of the same coin, with Miller's Alvie being the more hardened of the two. There is an entire family backstory for Alvie that heightens the realistic tone of the storytelling.Also starring Barbara Stanger and Chris Robinson as Savannah's politically connected parents, and featuring Pat Morita and Peter Graves, \\"Savannah Smiles\\" is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie","review":"This is such a cute movie.

Not that I'm in favor of gangs ruling neighborhoods, but let's face it - an army of crusty old white guys with bad prostates and bladder issues running around with guns in old 70's vehicles isn't the solution!

I'm still hoping he'll do a \\"retired Dirty Harry in an old folks home\\" movie. A predictable setup where Dirty Harry is now in an assisted living facility that gets robbed and harrassed by some neighborhood punks, so he rallies the old guys for some geriatric revenge using some of that unpredictable Dirty Harry style. That would be a RIOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I don't think I've ever heard so many racial slurs in a movie, but dang, that was good. I loved Eastwood's hard-nosed character and how he wouldn't take crap from anyone, and whipping Thao into shape and helping him down a better path. The ending was rather bittersweet but appropriate.If my own family was like that (talking about taking me to a retirement home on my birthday!!!) I'd be the same way towards them.

The subject matter is very provocative, as it pertains to a crusty old Korean war veteran who must learn to live with his Hmong neighbors in the deteriorating suburbs of a Michigan city. A young man is burned with a cigarette, and his sister is gang-raped. It ends up in a showdown between Eastwood and the dangerous and deadly gang.There is no easy way out of this mess and no clear-cut solution. This is why I call it fearless.

I have long been a fan of any movie with Clint in it from his early career, to Dirty Harry and his later works - thrillers, comedy and romance.

Too many bad words to dodge, if you mute out the potty-mouth, you don't get to hear the movie at all. Soooooo not worth the time to get to the impotent finish. No satisfaction of watching the bad guys get emasculated and see regret fade into pallid death... I rented it for a $1 and it wasn't worth the money! It's Hollywood; it should end the way I want it to. However unrealistic, \\"Dirty Harry\\" made us feel good. I hope this isn't indicative of Eastwood's final years on the screen... fade to black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinky Klint","review":"Another morbid downer from kinky Clint. Vain, bitter old man, disappointed in life and especially his family, sort of gets to know his foreign neighbors and uses their problems as reason to die. Are you cheered up yet? A movie about a man who's learned nothing made by a director who in my opinion has learned nothing, except how to stay weird enough to keep Hollywood interested. This movie is an absolute zero in my book. I got sucked in by the reviews that this was a really great Clint performance. Wrong. Just a lot of silly profanity.

I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie. Second the whole story is just corny as hell. This is pretty much it \\"Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace \\". The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass.

There is some language but unlike most films it is essential to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clint at his best.","review":"Clint has never been mellow and he exceeded my expectations on this one. The evolution of bitter and bigot to the finale is believable and with a startling conclusion. One has to imagine what the Hmong are saying but body language says it clearly enough. Clint's relationship with his own family was the balance the film needed, especially the brat grandaughter. Few if any of Clint's films are rated this high at my house, and I have seen them all over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Touched Movie","review":"Really a movie that sucks you in, as you feel for the old man played by Clint Eastwood, and the family that is his blood that doesn't seem to understand him, with the family next door that embraces him.

They were worse than what you might expect from a really bad junior high play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe so many poeple like this!","review":"Disappointing tale from Clint Eastwood. Clint plays an grumpy old racist who learns to love his next door immigrants. Yeah, it's just as bad as it sounds. I have to say, I thought the first half was absolutely HILARIOUS! Clint's character was just so over-the-top, I figure it had to be camp/caricature. The way he comes up with new way to insult everyone? And goes around growling like a dog? Too funny! (And here's hoping that it was supposed to be funny, otherwise the movie's worse than I feared.) The second half of the movie really goes downhill, and becomes a kind of 'Karate Kid' in reverse (this time, the adult is American and the kid is Asian). The lone bright spot of the movie is the teenage girl who lives next door - she's a firecracker, and the movie is better every time she is on the screen.

It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastwood is still making great movies","review":"This is a very good movie that everyone can enjoy. The acting and the characters are good. Even my ten year old thought this was one of the best movies we saw this summer. Not alot of action but a very deep character that Eastwood does a great job with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Walt Kowalski is a Korean war vet and a retired auto worker. He has lost his wife and has seen his neighborhood deteriorate. He lashes out with hatred and contempt at everyone around him. Underneath all of this though is a man with high morals and a real sense of what's right and wrong. This is easily the most powerful acting performance of Clint Eastwood's career. He was snubbed for the Oscars, but no matter. This is the performance of a lifetime, even outdistancing his role in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". Eastwood also produces and directs this drama that takes us deep inside Walt Kowalski's soul. The ending is an absolute shocker too. Rumor has it that this is Eastwood's final film as an actor. If this is so, then he has saved his best for last. It is the partial ending (hopefully he will continue to produce and direct) of the career of one of America's greatest film makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie! Timeless and Classic","review":"Clint Eastwood is brilliant. This is a movie you can watch over and over again... Tough but touching"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Drama!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Eastwood starts out as an old crusty bigoted, anti-Asian person. But he gradually becomes transformed by his Asian neighbors' kind, affectionate treatment into an understanding, appreciative, caring member of their family. A fascinating relationship develops between him and the neighbor teenagers--a young man and a young woman. Of all the roles I've seen Eastwood in, this by far is the best--his facial expressions say more than any words he says. His directing is simple, impactive, and straightforward--no hi-tech frills and stunts--and it serves the story quite well. The script also works well, and the ending offers a heartrending surprise, definitely against the grain for Eastwood, but thoroughly believable and exemplary. It exalts rather than degrades him, and enables him to obtain the justice required without sacrificing moral principles. Highly reccomended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"So,this is Clint Eastwood's last movie as an actor.He did a very good job in closing out a wonderful career.The movie made me angry about the street gang he takes on and it shows how our youth today are destroying their lives.His character is one person who is not afraid to back down from a threat.I did see some Dirty Harry in the movie.The trailer to the movie was great.Although this is his last movie as an actor and now he is going behind the camera I will always be a Clint Eastwood fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)","review":"Not at all what I expected, MUCH better.

I think Walt Kowolski is a typical, grumpy old man, but has a human and humorous side to him. I love the way he comes around to take the Hmong boy under his wing. I was sad at the end, but I found myself laughing very often in the movie overall, with Walt's comments and attitude.

But less heavy and with a nice cultural angle and what's right about America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastwood at his best","review":"Gran Torino is slated to be Clint Eastwood's final acting role, announcing plans on a career move seated behind the camera in directing films rather than staring in them. Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a far cry from his man with no name spagetti western and Dirty Harry days, while retaining the gruff razor's edge toughness the actor is noted for. Sitting on his porch like the last Dinasaur attempting to retain what little remains of his declining domain, Korean War vet Walt drinks Pabsts Blue Ribbon Beer and smokes Lucy Strikes disgusted by the changes which have taken place in his once blue collar inner city neighborhood. Eastwod winds up mentoring his young Korean neighbor after the boy's failed attempt at stealing Walt's vintage 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation. This film is the perfect curtain call for Eastwood's acting career and should go down as one of his best performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Well Made Movie","review":"I have to admit that the Thao character could be a bit better actor. Everyone else did very well--specially the young Asian character Sue. She should keep at it. Eastwood did not have to act more than what he already is as an actor--the rusty, caustic demeanor that is so typical Eastwood. Of course, it's just a movie, so it did take some artistic license; but the human element it tried to show, the story it tried to tell, was shown and told well. The finishing solo by Eastwood was also very good--possibly the most tender part of the movie. I am giving it five stars. For many, it may deserve less than five, but it certainly does not deserve one star like many gave. I suspect people do not want to get close to their soft side, so touching movies may annoy them.Good show. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.","review":"When Clint Eastwood deals with Church, ethnicity, justice issues, and stars in his own show the results are always awful.

Eastwood is brilliant when it comes to storyline and direction. He is a tough old man that is very prejudice.. it is his struggle to deal with his prejudice in the face of serious injustice.

Just finished watching it and felt compelled to write a review as a tribute.The acting is terrific. The fierce Hmong grandmother (Chee Thao) who traded steely glares with Clint Eastwood's character (Walt Kowalski); the selfish relatives; Walt's friends - everyone is wonderful. Not a false note amoung them.This film also serves to educate viewers about the role the Hmong people played during the Vietnam war and the consequences they endured. Something I was ignorant of but am glad to be aware of now.The many dimensions of this wonderful film have already been covered by other reviews so I'll end mine by saying ..... watch this movie.

He becomes endearing and the ending is a great twist on things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm no hero.","review":"Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't. Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted. The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one. Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone. She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it. The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy. The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off. Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not worth the time invested.","review":"Video was full screen and it was zoomed in too much.

I knew basically what it was about, but again, not enough action, and truthfully, half the time I was waiting for something to happen, but it didn't. There was far too much sitting around staring at the neighbors to suit me, and the film was much too long to say what it had to say. I might have liked the film better if the ending would have been a bit more upbeat, at least. But, I guess, I should have expected it after it became obvious that Eastwood's character had health problems and something had to be done to bring the bad guys to a closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gran Torino","review":"Despite a lifelong spent watching Clint Eastwood play many different parts, while I expected this film to be very good, in truth it's merely average and so it disappointed me.In my estimation, \\"Unforgiven\\" is Eastwood's best film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution","review":"Clashing cultural values, inner city troubles, and Clint Eastwood.

Too bad.Verdict: Watch the trailer, then skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fuss over nothing....","review":"This movie is about the importance of collecting valuable possessions over your lifetime and giving them to who you think is most deserving.

However, I agree with others that the film relies on contrivances and an unoriginal storyline. It seems that the writer felt that the film had two possible ways to go: One way could be the \\"Dirty Harry\\" route where Eastwood brilliantly gets violent revenge on the bad guys...Or, the other possible ending could be melodramatic with much hanky-wringing and a \\"message\\". Neither option is appealing given the age and health of the main character...and the values he was trying to teach the young man.

We love him because in all his movies through out his wonderful career he acts with dignity... something that we as a country are in great need of and even if we have to turn to film to get it we will and that's why we look to him!

The Boss TR-1 tremolo effect brings back those old style sounds perfectly. Not too many pickers use one these days so I like having that retro effect on my pedal board. The unit is simple and it does exactly what I want. It's quiet, rugged and easy to use.

It allows you to vary the rate and amount of tremolo, as well as the wave shape. Some prefer very staccato tremolo and others a more smooth warble. With this pedal you can blend between the two to find your own preference. Like all Boss pedals, it's built like a tank. The only thing this pedal lacks is a gain control to boost back the signal, as tremolo, by nature, causes some signal loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"QC for the product leaves much to be desired.","review":"Bought 18 of these as part of a large Dell order. Over half of the units are so sensitive to mechanical movement that they will shut themselves off with no warning. Just plugging in an unconnected power cord (i.e. - no load) or the USB cable will cause those particular units to shut off. (Not all of the 18 have this problem.) The USB connection to the WinXP based \\"power options\\" tab automatically gives you a \\"running on batteries\\" option for graceful shutdown (I suppose) before the batteries run out. Nice.I'm extremely disappointed with the quality control (or bad design) of this unit. We have called Tripp Lite warranty folks, and supposedly we'll get new (or replacement ) units with no questions asked (other than S/N of the unit and date of purchase). I hope the replacements don't have this problem too.We might have gotten a bad batch, but until they get their QC problems ironed out, I would stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works only so-so, good physical layout for my needs.","review":"It's inexpensive, hasn't caught fire, and has protected our equipment so far.

Thank you.Avoid this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Playing, Solid Interpretation, but Under-recorded","review":"The LA Philharmoic and Salonen have become one of my favorite choices when looking for CD's. The playing on this disc is absolutely superb, thanks to the LAPO's world-class musicians. Salonen's interpretation is both natural and captivating. However, there are many moments which lack the power they should have and I believe this is due to the recording quality. Salonen's recording of Mahler 3 with the LAPO was far more resonant and had more presence than on this disc. Here the whole orchestra seems distant for some reason. Nevertheless, this disc is certainly worth buying simply for the quality of playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Pavillion, nothing else...!","review":"Five stars were it for Salonen and the LA Phil alone, but still some \\"problems\\" remain.Bruckner DEMANDS space, a crisp, even bland approach, room to breathe, and I don't feel this recording can deliver that. As a benchmark here, compare to, say, a typical Bruckner-Karajan recording with the Berlin- or especially the Vienna Philharmonic!Having said that, the playing here is energetic, almost ferrocious sometimes, and the orchestra really catches fire in movements 3&4. But they are fighting against the awkward opaque acoustics of the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion. Most notably the strings suffer in this environment, and what still worked well for Mahler's horn-oriented 3rd, becomes a drag for the string-heavy Bruckner 4. Record it again, Esa-Pekka, at the new Walt Disney Hall.Overall, by no means a bad cd, but the acoustics of the Pavillion are less than helpful here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one--","review":"This recording is another example of why the LA Philharmonic has never established any kind of presence on recording. Technically, it simply isn't very good compared to the other offerings from the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, etc. etc. In the area of the standard repertoire, the recorded competition from Eastern and European orchestras is fierce and nothing less than a blemish-free digitally transparent recording will do. I would recommend the recording by Claudio Abaddo and the Vienna Philharmonic if you can still get it. Their performance is both effortless and ethereal. Otherwise, the older recording by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra still sounds great and as always Ormandy makes this serious music seem understandable and accessible to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other reviewer's right, there's no samech!","review":"Overall the blocks are great in terms of durability, appearance and content.

But for some reason I missed out on \\"Bump in the Night\\" when it was first released. Having both of those albums on one disc was too good a temptation to resist. There isn't a great deal of sonic difference between the two albums in terms of style or song quality. They are both packed with uptempo rockers that are both raunchy and funky. If you liked Ron Wood's \\"Gimme Some Neck\\" album, this collection will make you feel right at home. And it helps that Mr. Wood plays on both albums too, particularly on \\"Troublemaker.\\" In fact, Ian does a version of Wood's \\"Mystifies Me\\" that is very true to the original.

That being said, it is the only multimeter I have owned, so don't have a really good basis for comparison. One thing to remember is to definitely splash out for the alligator clip probes, trying to hold the straight probes on components can be a hassle, and the readings will be all over the place until you get a solid connection to whatever you are testing.

The lights no longer illuminate when testing a battery, and though the battery icon and a voltage value appear for the battery being tested, it obviously isn't drawing any load from the battery since the value is identical to the voltage displayed when switched over to DCV test mode. The few times I was able to test batteries before the test function went kaput, the voltage was always a little lower than the value when switched to DC test mode. I am very disappointed the multimeter malfunctioned so soon after I bought it. Though the other functions still seem to work, the very useful battery load test does not.

The numbers are large and easy to see. The leads are heavier weight and more durable than I would have expected. The case has bumpers on the four corners, which looks like it will protect the meter from occasional drops. For the price, this is a very good deal. However, there's no case, and you'll have to destroy the plastic clamshell it comes in to get at the thing, so there's no box that can double as a case. The photo shows the leads somehow fastened to the sides of the meter, but this doesn't seem to work very well in real life. So the meter and the leads are kind of a jumble in my junk drawer.

The main problem was a design issue:Every other multimeter I've used, no matter what brand, had the same convention - the fused inputs were only for use on DC and only for 10-15 seconds every five minutes. Had I read the manual to this multimeter, I would have noticed it's backwards. The fused input is for everything, the unfused input is only DC for so many seconds, etc. Things don't go well if you miss that point.So, after a couple of DC checks, I switch the multimeter over to AC and stick the probes into an electrical outlet. The test leads EXPLODED. Not kidding. 5\\" of copper wire actually shot out of the black lead, leaving the insulation intact except for a pinhole. Unit seems to be fine, but both leads are toast. Scared the heck out of me. Huge cloud of acrid smoke.Bottom line, I'll get another Craftsman..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed","review":"This really is a piece of garbage.

Same result.Digital display showing \\"numbers\\" when placed in any mode (even with leads disconnected).

Not a huge deal and probably not worth returning for that alone. At exactly 13 months (one month after expiration of the warranty), the display started dropping elements, which was annoying but the unit still basically functioned. Six months later and the display got worse. With nothing to lose, I opened it up and had a look. Turned out the screws securing the PCB to the chassis were loose (arthritic old ladies in Guangzhou whose best days of operating a screwdriver are well behind them). Got that sorted and back in business, but not expecting this thing to last much longer.Could also use a backlight on the display.There has to be a better $20 meter out there. Wish I knew what it was.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Open the box and wont turn on","review":"I bought this tester when I opened the brand new box and turned on nothing happened, I looked at the manualand tried changing the batteries and nothing happened, maybe the fuse but when i checked to see the fuse it seems ok, so i called customer service and they said that I had to send it back... but i live in Costa Rica and shipping it back will cost me more than buying it here... so be careful it might come defective!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"I bought this for multiple reasons, I am a beginner with electronics so I thought this would be a good meter to help me wire my cars turn signals, help me build electrical devices, and check resistance in small engine magnetos. Suffice to say this meter is absolutely terrible. I bought this meter TWICE, and both times right out of the package I got the same results. Continuity is very touchy, Ohms did not read zero when the tips touch. Any measurement taken varied an immense amount, and in the middle of trying to decipher a reading through all that drift I constantly see that annoying OL reading on the LCD. I knew twenty dollars was too good to be true. If you just want a multimeter for checking your outlets and the occasional battery, MAYBE this multimeter is for you. If you plan on doing any legitimate work or if you care about your readings in the least, steer very, very clear from this DMM.

The auto range is especially useful, and allows quick checking without having to know the exact voltage. The meter has a very detailed manual, easy to read, and step by step instructions for all the functions. The one draw back, and I believe it is a pretty big one, is; it is almost impossible to see the writing on the front of the meter itself, making it difficult to find the function you want. The letters and numbers are a dark green or red on a black background. I actually had to use the manual to find the correct setting, or a magnifying glass. The lack of legebility of the functions on the unit is why I rated it 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for my use","review":"This does exactly what it says it does. the stand it very nice, and the leads (while they could be a touch longer) work fine.this is a nice workbench multimeter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Nice big display, accurate as far as I can tell.

Here we have the classic Arabian taqsim and maqam in quite creditable performances from the 1950's and 60's. Regrettably, the first half of the disc is a sort of \\"introduction to Middle Eastern instruments\\" that tips more toward educational than entertaining.

It would take a man of Mr. Tome's individualistic ilk to swat a golf ball across Mongolia (with a three-iron, no less!!) and a storyteller of his nimbleness to entertainingly recount the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"A crash course into the heart of the ever developing music industry is something that every record producer, musician and publisher out there wants to read.

A great read to be recommended to all that are curious about making it big in the music industry, and a book to follow by all involved in this area. A 101 crash course that is heading for success ."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite animation from my childhood","review":"I am 41 years old and remember snow days and weekends at home waiting to see this animated tale. It was introduced with a narration by Art Linkletter talking to a child or children about the tale of the Snow Queen. As the story unfolds you are drawn to the colors and voices of this story as well as the characters. The journey that these children endure never seemed dull to me and I am looking forward to sharing this classic with my children. I can see it is the same animated version I knew as a child,only difference being the addition ofnew voices for the characters. It will be a surprise until opened at Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking the entire vocal world","review":"I also was disappointed, that the original russian language soundtrack was completely missing from this collection, though that could be made known before purchasing this item so it was not a surprise.But the thing they *DIDN'T* mention and which was the worst major disappointment, was that they have changed the music and songs of this animation ENTIRELY!! There was nothing left from the beauty of the original melodies of the songs. I was a child when I last saw this (now 26), but I noticed immediately that they had changed the entire soundworld of the animation. The only good thing in this was the animation itself.I really wonder why they did have to change the entire vocal world of this animation. Should it been at least the original music and song melodies...but there is pretty much nothing left of the memory I carry in my heart of this animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lost in Translation\\"","review":"\\"Alice and the Mystery of the Third Planet\\" was my favorite cartoon growing up. I've seen it so many times - I had it memorized down to minute details of character intonations. While the story itself if fairly basic, the wonderfully crafted dialog, sharpness of each line, as well as the outstanding voice acting, made \\"Mystery of the Third Planet\\" a true pop-culture icon of my generation.Unfortunately, all the acting talent involved in creating the English version of the sound-track wasn't enough to compensate for the quite sub par quality of the translated dialog. Not only did it fail to convey the beauty of the original, it made even the basic plot-line difficult to follow. And what's even more frustrating, the original Russian sound track is NOT EVEN INCLUDED on the DVD.I for one would not call this \\"Stories From MY Childhood\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movies bad audio...","review":"I grew up watching the snow queen and the wild swans. At first I was so excited to see both of these great shows together on DVD. Unfortunately they completely redid the voices on both. The crow/narrator of the wild swans now sounds like some kind of wise guy. I only listened to the snow queen long enough to see that again there is horrible new audio. Looks like I'm going to keep looking for the VHS version of the wild swans and hope it lasts through my 5 nephews and 1 niece. Amazon does actually have the snow queen on DVD with the old audio. I've never seen and still haven't seen Alice and the mystery of the third planet so I have no idea if they butchered the audio on that one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beth, where are you?","review":"I bought this cd about a year and a half ago from cd baby and have been playing it ever since.

The story of his conversion is fascinating and I look forward to his future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bible stories for kids","review":"Parents normally introduce their kids at a much earlier age to fairy tales books than to the Bible. Why? Because the text is just too complicated to explain to the young minds.Thanks to this 101 Favorite Stories, it is now a lot easier to introduce our kids to the wonderful bible stories. Each page contains one summarized story of an important bible event (including corresponding verse) & opposite its page is a colorful illustration that will captivate a young mind & hold its short-spanned attention. What's even greater is that, this book holds stories both from the Old & New Testament.Just be careful when you let your toddlers read/view this book as the pages are not cardboard material & can be torn by small excited fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tantra Lite","review":"One of the few titles on this subject I could find that included photographs, but very disappointing.

They were made of cheap plastic, and broke very easily. 2) The anti-skip feature is basically useless, since it still skipped when it was activated. 3) it's pretty bulky. 4)It doesn't play very long when you use 2 AA bateries instead of the AC adapter. 5) it doesn't play CD-R cd's. The only reason why I still gave this product 2 stars was because it was pretty good when it was new, and everything worked perfectly. However, this product is NOT worth it for the price. To be honest, a cheap CD player like this should be priced for $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Discman","review":"This Discman has given me many long hours of grief.

That was a experience as well.I tried other books on this subject but they fell short. This book not only is clear and cool but written by one of the masters of the sax. I heard him in New Orleans with Dr John, then later doing some jazz at his Coltrane Tribute. What a player and nice guy. I think Price deserves the press and image that guys like Branford or Sanborn have. He's more unique than they are, and can walk the walk and talk the talk.

Even the disk itself, created by Monoliths Graphics, is a work of art.The lovely voice of author Michelle Belanger is given full reign here, from powerful chants to amazing octave ranges, surpassing Nightwish and Evanescence's superb work. If you like love Nox Arcana and ambient music, Michelle's debut will leave you breathless. Fans of Phantom of the Opera will fall in love songs such as Bitter Ashes, one of my favorites. The title track however is a piece de resistance, with its layered vocals and emotional chorus.Highly recommended- Corvis Nocturnum"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a great CD for learning not only division, but it teaches the fundamentals of multiplication, and how it relates to division.

Alem's story takes you on a mind-stretching visit inside a culture that I have far less understand of than I wish. The story of Fatma fascinates, and evokes all kinds of questions. The strange world she lives in, as well as the relationship she develops with the snakes make for an adventure unlike any I have read before. Although significant sections of the book are about a mixture of mysterious and mystical events, it takes the reader into another way of seeing inside a life of one who wants the truth, and can follow where her experiences take her. She lives between two worlds; worlds unlike what most of us have experienced or can fathom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Intermediate and begginers.","review":"This books has good tutorials and explanations about topics like, methods of object creation/modeling, textures and lights.

I've had this for about 9 years and it as effective and sturdy as the day I bought it. It's simple, easy to read and the ability to mute is (I think) an underrated option (for switching guitars without that feedback and popping that comes with it). I always use this for live gigs because its discreet and easy to read in dark lighting. I have a Korg tuner and a couple built into my multi-effect processors but I always use this one. Yeah a hundred bucks is kind of pricy for a stomp box tuner but look at it as an investment. I'm going on a decade with this one pedal that's seen a lot of use and day to day wear and its still going strong. If this thing ever dies (which it refuses to do!)

I knew if they blocked those well, they would do well outside. They have. Unfortunately my first pair were lost when I handed my bag to someone (which will never happen again :) ) and so I had to re-purchase these again.

(It's unusual for a young writer of contemporary Christian literature to \\"register\\" with a sixty-something person still trying to get a handle on God and spirituality.) Consequently, my copy of BLJ has MANY pages that have been dog-eared for future reference.However, as to \\"Searching For God...\\" no explosions at all, at least not for me.

Normally it would take a few days to a week to finish a book this size but I have been really stuck on this one for some reason. I don't think it's the actual message that is a turn off for me but just the writing style. I questioned some of the book on whether it was true but I'm far from being able to tell it if it is or not. Sometimes I didn't know if he was agreeing or disagreeing with himself and I just felt a bit lost. I feel that as someone who is beginning a journey of studying the bible and doesn't know a lot about it that this was just over my head at the moment.

It's not for everyone. If you can't see past the title of the chapter \\"Santa Takes A Leak\\" to see the profound lesson in it, don't buy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful followup","review":"I felt like this was a wonderful continuation for Blue Like Jazz, but I felt like some of it was a little over my head at some points. I did, however, feel as if it went even further into the relational aspect of Christianity, which is so poinent and beautiful. Again, Donald Miller really hits home with his personal stories that reflect how he knows and loves God."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing read.","review":"This was my second book by Donald Miller and I was once again struck by his work. Very interesting ideas and experiences, conveyed with insight and humility. A pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but that' all.","review":"I'm a big fan of Donald Miller's book, Blue Like Jazz. So when I picked up his book, Searching For God Knows What, I expected a similar reading experience. BLJ was raw, honest, humorous, and just resounded with my soul. SFGKW came off as if Miller was trying too hard to be clever. There was just something missing. It wasn't awful. It just didn't strike the strong chord that Jazz did. So I guess this is a mixed review. I'm not saying it's not worth reading; but if you haven't read Jazz, read that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL DONE!","review":"I've often encountered throughout my own spiritual journey, Christians who are afraid. They're afraid to be bold, afraid to be honest and (at times) even afraid to display a sense of humor. Author Donald Miller apparently ain't afraid of any of that. I received a copy of \\"Searching for God Only Knows What\\" as a gift this past summer, shortly after my own (first) book arrived in stores. This was my first exposure to Mr. Miller's work and I found his story of life and faith to be compelling, insightful and often, laugh-out-loud funny. And I definitely connected with his unique and edgy perspective. Simply put, \\"Searching for God Only Knows What\\" is an entertaining read -- regardless of one's own personal spiritual point of view.Christopher Long-Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"made me ponder ... made me laugh ... made me cry ...","review":"... most of all it made me think. I was introduced to Donald Miller's work by first reading 'Through Painted Deserts', and while I loved the book (and subsequently passed it along to a friend with a strong recommendation 'must read!!'), I thought 'Searching for God Knows What' released more of what Donald was trying to say about his faith and about Christ. I am now reading Blue Like Jazz since I love his writing and message so much. He is my new favorite author ... he gets down to the bare bones of what Jesus really was about ... we just sometimes forget in our humanness and our attempts at religion ... Donald Miller's style (unlike a great many Christian writers), is honest, earthy, 'real' ... highly highly recommend all his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Enjoyed this book, it was not too difficult to read, it is an excellent copy. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"But I didn't think it was half as good as Blue Like Jazz. He seemed to lack some of the brutal honesty from his earlier work, which I really appreciated. This is still worth reading, one of the better Christian book reads, but I would push you not to compare"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do some research, man.","review":"This book insulted my intelligence. I just finished taking a semester survey course on the Old Testament, and it was painful to see how much scripture Miller took out of context. Also, like another reviewer, I was bothered by the fact that he kept referring to Moses as the author of Gen-Deut. If he would do some scholarly research instead of just thinking really hard about things, this book would have been a whole lot better. Also, \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" is ten times better and easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and convicting","review":"This book cuts deep to the heart of who we are. It's about how we are all searching for something that we can only get from God - love, acceptance, and self-worth. We're trying to find it in our relationships with people, whether by competing with them, coaxing them to join \\"our team,\\" or simply by asking them to love us before we love them. Jesus calls us to an entirely different mentality, that of being fully satisfied with who we are in Him, and therefore able to give to others freely. Yet so often we distort His gospel to fit our own agendas and to puff ourselves up. I was personally convicted in reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"some great stuff, but gets a little ranty in parts","review":"I love Donald Miller's style, and this book has plenty of excellent questions and ideas that challenge the way I think. I do believe though that he goes on too many bitter rants and sounds more like a ranting columnist rather than a thoughtful question-poser."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that made me cry","review":"Yes, sometimes the criteria for a good book for me is one that will elicit emotion. Which this one fit the bill. I am a big fan of Donald Miller, and this book at first I wasn't too thrilled with. It took a bit of time before I warmed up to this. However, after getting through the 1st three chapters, it really began to move. Sometimes funny, sometimes pulling at your heart strings. I would recommend this to any Christian who is still wondering, what exactly am I supposed to do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"This book was soooo slow starting out. It was definitely not what I was expecting from Donald Miller after having just finished Blue Like Jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Rambling Presentation of Christianity","review":"I found this to be a rather confused rambling presentation of Christianity where the author frequently wanders off into areas barely even tangent to his topic (like his strong personal opinions about the war in Iraq) and often engages in massive unwarranted speculation about the things we read in the Bible like his detailed description of how the people close to the Apostle John supposedly must have \\"felt\\" and reacted when he died (there is no Biblical or historical evidence to substantiate the detailed account he gives of this) or his speculative account of how long Adam spent naming the animals before Eve was created (the Bible is clear that this all happened on the sixth day of creation - no long period of time here). He seems to be pandering to the confused modern thinking so common in Christianity today and in my opinion ends up just adding to the confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, heartfelt book","review":"Miller wrote this book with complete Divine intervention. It spoke to my heart and was written in an easy to read fashion. I went on spring break with my family and I could not put it down! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching for God Knows What","review":"A unique look at Christian thought and actions. Discovering why we act as we do as humans and what to do about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest faith","review":"I recently finished reading Searching for God Knows What, by Donald Miller. I'd read his Blue Like Jazz a while back and loved it, so I'd been meaning to get back around to him.I really like this book. I really like Miller, actually. I like it that he seems to think about his faith himself, rather than letting others tell him what God wants for him. In this book, Miller dwells on the human relationship with God, and he draws some parallels and some conclusions that I'd never thought of before. He quite accurately paints ways in which our organized faith might have gone a bit wayward, but he appears to do it without malice. There are lots of historical references, tidbits of quotes and songs, and parables in here, and the book reads easily, as if one were talking these things over with a good friend.I recommend both this book and Blue Like Jazz if you are interested in thinking more about the nature of faith and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Night Room\\", not what i thought","review":"The novel \\"The Night Room\\" is a book about seven high school students that go into a computer program, called Argus, that simulate their high school reunion. Each of them goes into Argus and each one finds out something has happened to one of them, death. They try to figure who died and try to prevent her from dying. This book didn't appeal to me because even though it would seem interesting and exciting, it is very boring, with little action and a small amunt of mystery. I would only recommend this book to people who like stories that aren't very exciting and people who like to read anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind","review":"This book is one of a kind....brilliant, great, adventurous, a classic. Words do not describe it. Isherwood lays evertything on the table. He shows all his cards. This is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. I'm a college student and I skipped all of the ten thousand other books I have to read in order to read this one. It was not a waste of time. Once you get into this book it's a blast. The best part is following Isherwood across Europe. If you want the definitive feeling about the Modern Era read this book. You will get to know such characters as EM Forster, W.H. Auden, and Virginia Woolfe.....Gee, ever heard of them? This is the last great classic Isherwood wrote. I was so entranced by the words that I stayed up all night to finnish it. It's defintiely on my all time favorite list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Boring","review":"Was this book written by Christopher Isherwood ? His name appears on the cover, as if he were the author, yet the book reads as if someone else were writing about Isherwood. And, it's dreadfully tedious and boring.

Harnoncourt is one of the best Strauss conductors alive, and the Vienna Philharmonic can play this stuff in their sleep, though they're wide awake here.

Here, you get complete performances with only occasional extra-musical interruptions. No host, thank god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre experiment","review":"Harnoncourt music making is like a first class scientific experiment. A lot of tricks based on intellectual research and profound knowledge of historical performance traditions. It is like watching a documentary on Discovery channel. One keeps wondering at things never seen before. If you buy this DVD you will hear Strauss sounding in a way you haven't heard before. I don't find it particularly beautiful. It is odd, it is dry and the musicians try not to watch the conductor, since his gesture is always behind the sound. There is something rather creepy about the way he approaches this music. There is no joy, no excitement and no moments of spontaneous music making. It is the weakest, most bizarre Neujahrskonzert ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"very light weight blow dryer and doesnt damage your hair like other blow driers.

It seems to be well balanced and has lots of power. My thick hair is dry in 10 minutes. I am very satisfied with my purchase and no regrets. The product was delivered quickly. I was suprised that the dryer was in a box with no packing to secure it inside. I thought that was odd.

After using this hair dryer, I will never go back to a consumer level hair dryer. I have shoulder length hair, and it has a medium thickness. Before the Elchim, I spent 17-20 minutes drying my hair. When I was done, my hair would be frizzy and need further styling w/ a hot round brush and straight iron. With the Elchim, my dry time has literally been cut in half, and it's smooth when done. I take a couple minutes to run the straight iron through my ends, and I am done. It has revolutionized my \\"getting ready\\" routine.

No matter how MS treats you, life doesn't have to be like this! I'm glad these women found each other, but it's kind of like hanging out with Donna Reed if she had a serious disability.

The inspid cuteness may be as terrifying as the disbility!One thing that really bothers me is the suggestion here that people who want to understand women with MS should read this book. This is not the only face of MS. I'm glad the \\"froup\\" has helped these women. MS is a rough go, and it's good not to go it alone.

You need time to understand possible outcomes other than the chronic progressive cases. You need to go through the steps of grieving as well. When you first read a book such as this, you very well might think that all ms cases suffer as badly as these women. I am a fairly new diagnosed case and it took me a while to figure out that not all wind up unable to ambulate, control their bladder, have difficulty with thought processes, etc. I first read this book right after diagnosis and did nothing but sob, thinking I would wind up as badly as these women. Not so. It very well might be a good book to read cover to cover after you developed a \\"thickened skin\\" and come to grips with the illness, but not for us \\"you look so good\\" types.

It would have saved me a lot of the fear that came from reading some of the misinformation that is still, unfortunately, out there.It's not \\"gloom and doom\\", it's not \\"sweetness and light\\", it's factual, funny, sad, and presents life with MS in the matter of fact way that this \\"froup\\" deals with it all.Thank you Judy-Lynn and online sisters!

The women in the author's online circle are mostly 40-50 yrs. old, and while they have years of experiencing problems with MS, much of their info is outdated, as they were diagnosed, or not diagnosed with outdated methods, such as before the MRI came about, etc., whereas I got a diagnosis within a week or two after my first onset of an episode with the slew of testing at a wonderful clinic. Also, their experiences or episodes can be treated today, though they perhaps couldn't be treated 20 years ago. My problems are under control through the treatments available today, but reading these stories made it sound like I was in for an intolerable haul. I would not recommend this book to a younger (<30) MS patient because so much is outdated and actually lead me to a bout of depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a sad, funny, truthful, wonderful book!","review":"This book made me laugh and cry as well as helping me realize that I am not the only woman who suffers from MS.

I have long hair so I need a strong bristle to go through it. This brush has bristles a bit softer than I like so that I can really dig in and get good curls. However, I really love the feel when I am brushing my hair. It makes me feel pampered. I liked it enough that I ordered another one an inch or so smaller. It will have shorter bristles so I think maybe it will be my stern brush. Basically it is lovely and I am very happy with it.

Burden's writing style is clear and concise, yet never dry. Not only has she researched Mr. Lowe and his work, but one feels she has really gotten to know him as a person.

Its is badly written, most of the book is about other things rather than Nostradamus and it is not an objective view.The thing I really cant believe is when reading this book the author will spend most of a chapter discussing totally irrelevant things and then have 1 paragraph about Nostradamus.Why are people giving this book great reviews, what am I missing here! I think the high reviews are because people are just glad of reading a book that discounts Nostadamus's prophecies, but that doesn't mean the book is a good one.I dont believe in his prophecies either but the book could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book that debunks Nostradamus as a prophet.","review":"Think you know Nostradamus? Think again. A great deal of research went into writing this book, and it shows. Randi provides an exhaustive history of Nostradamus (and his time) as both a healer and a prophet. Randi informs readers how astrology and magic influenced royalty and peasants alike during Nostradamus' time. Randi provides his own interpretations of the 10 most famous quatrains, and see how other \\"expert\\" interpreters wildly alter the meaning to fit major events.

He finds some of the many flaws in Kennedy and examines them carefully. Here we have a president who has nothing BUT flaws and Kessler is admiring throughout.

I have read many of Kessler's book's and have learned to accept the slanted right take but, this was over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bizarre document","review":"This is a strange book, and it makes me wonder whether the author was paid off. If you have read anything about Bush, you will not find anything new here. The author, who I expected to be relatively objective, shows no skepticism at all. In addition, he loads the book with self-serving statements from Bush supporters, or worse yet, just uncredited assertions, but fails to provide any examples. His supposed \\"access\\" apparently provided him with nothing at all. A good non-fiction book gives the reader the facts as objectively as possible, and lets the reader draw the conclusions. This book simply presents conclusions--namely, that Bush is a great and principled leader--but offers no facts to back it up. Indeed, the book loses credibility because it absolutely refuses to address any facts that would contradict its thesis. Whether you like Bush or hate him, this book is worthless propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"I was interested in reading a fair sketch of President Bush. I did not want to read a book that painted him as a demon or as a saint, but as a real human being, with strengths and flaws. This book is pretty much a partisan \\"campaign book\\", where Bush is glorified and can do no wrong and his enemies are demonized. If you're a big Bush supporter and want to be told that Bush is perfect, this book will be right up your alley. If you are looking for something more complex, more real, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Bush haters.","review":"If you hate George Bush, don't bother with this book. It will only infuriate you.The best of the book was not about Bush.

It is indeed a pageturner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankly truthful","review":"I find this type of investigative report very worthwhile.

President Bush loves America, and would do anything to defend her people. He has brought back to the White House integrity, compassion and morals. I would also suggest the book \\"The Faith of George W. Bush\\" by Stephen Mansfield. President Bush has had to make some tough decisions, which history will prove were the right ones. Take a journey back to some other leaders of our country, who also had tough decisions to make....George Washington, Abraham Lincoln... God Bless George W. Bush and God Bless America."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book","review":"This book is rather one-sided, but it is definitely worth reading. With all the vitriol that the Left has spewed on the President, the perspectives of those who work closely with him deserve as much consideration.

Porter pretends to have written this book through thorough documentation (from interviews, tapes, etc...). Hilariously, not only is he privy to intimate conversations, he also claims to have the inside information on what people were thinking...and not in general terms. This book also contains some of the funniest (albeit filthiest) lines in the history of prose. It's zero stars for quality and 5 stars for enjoyability. Truly an anti-masterpiece that will live on for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited hogwash","review":"That this trash is a hideous pack of lies is a given. Did it ever occur to this Porter imbecile that all the dead people he delights in lewdly slandering have descendents? How does he think THEY feel? Such gutless, tasteless lying to sell a couple of books. His lies about the great Glenda Farrell border on criminal. THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"Ah, Darwin Porter. He waits until a performer is safely in his grave and writes pile of trash when he's nice and safe from a libel suit.The powers that be may want to take a look at the 'rave reviews' dated September 3/4 2003. They seem remarkably similar and I would find the fact that they're all posted within two days of each other to be just a wee bit suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not enough is it Porter","review":"If you believe the Darwinian theory, Bogart never had his clothes on long enough.Avoid this, as it was written by a man who's life must be like this book, confusing, inaccurate, out of date and contradictory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo For \\"Bogart\\"","review":"This book deserves a zero. I've rarely read a more obscene libel of the dead! The author seems to believe that 99% of the people in the entertainment world were gay males, lesbians, or bi-sexuals. I doubt that the book would ever have been published if the author hadn't done it himself. No reputable publishing house would issue such a work of unsubstantiated \\"facts.\\" Much of it reads like Porter made it up as he went along. How could he know the intimate details of sexual acts unless he was there? And he constantly quotes dialogue and conversations that he couldn't possibly have heard, attributing them to people who are conveniently dead and can't call him a liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsubstantiated quotes used to make a fast buck and smear","review":"I got to page 35 and threw it in the trash. At least every other page has something to say about someone's sex life. Don't waste your time. Much of the stuff meant to \\"wow\\" the reader was NOT substantiated. In the beginning of the book Porter mentions all the people he interviewed, but who knows what they told him. They're all dead now. Don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, didn't even bother to finish it","review":"This author certainly left nothing to the imagination, and I really wish he had. It was disgusting pretty much from page one. I didn't even bother to finish it, and haven't watched a Bogart movie since. Thought about donating to the library, but would feel bad if someone actually read it. This one is worthy of the trash can and not much else.Bogart may have been that much of a degenerate, but this book is really too much information. And I'm really disappointed that the TCM (Turner Classic Movies) web site even suggested it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bizarre attempt at biography","review":"I find myself having to agree with readers giving this book negative reviews.I say this not out of mere loyalty to Bogart. I say it because the narrative just doesn't seem credible. Time and again, long stretches of stilted, self-aware dialogue are attributed to people early in their lives who couldn't possibly have had their thoughts recorded in such involved detail. Give it a look, but within 50 pages this reader felt that the book's truths were being drowned in outrageous fabrications that quickly became tiresome and boring.Another indication that this bizarre diversion needed an author and editor worthy of their salt is the surprising number of amateurish misspellings, punctuation and grammatical errors.A real disappointment, because this is an actor about whom I'd like to learn more."},{"rating":"1","title":"cruel, cruel book","review":"I refuse to rate this book at all. This is one of the cruelest books I have ever read. I read it while sitting at the bookstore. It is filled with such ridiculous imaginary conversations and half-truths...the author knows enough about certain dates, etc., to manage to concoct lengthy conversations that never took place. If the families of everyone vilified in this terrible book don't file lawsuits for slander, character assasination, and libel, then there is no justice at all. I happen to love Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, and Barbara Stanwyck. If they were alive, they would be enraged and filing these lawsuits themselves.This \\"author\\" should be ashamed of himself. So should anyone who reads this book and feels \\"enlightened.\\" This is utter trash.Shame on anyone who writes such drivel and profits from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pack of slanderous lies","review":"This book is pure trash. It includes disgusting lies about just about ever actor and actress of the 1930s. Even if the trash in this book were true, it would be impossible for the author to have included it in such detail. He writes as if he knew every thought in the back of every actor or actress' head at any given time. As if he was there at every event big or small, that happened in the book. As if he memorized every word spoken. Not to mention that many of the things he has these people saying are so long and obviously written for the book that no person could have possibly spoken them in conversation. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A BIOGRAPHY","review":"Worst book I've ever come across. 0 stars for not even mentioning its fiction on the cover. NOT BASED ON FACTS!

On the bright side it's one less copy exposed to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Need A Shower When I Read Something From This","review":"Giving it one star was generous at best. I've read excerpts from it, and I will NOT buy this piece of trash. (Okay, I can't write what I'd really like to.) I am not believing this crap at all. Even if any of it is true, which I doubt, it's no one's business. And Bogie is not here to defend himself from it. Surely he would have gone after the author for it. Every time I've read an excerpt, I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. There are better bios of him. I know, because I've read them. Ann M. Sperber's book with Eric Lax is one of them.

Every page seems to contain a 'romantic interlude' and the author seems to have an amazing ability to know exactly what every person was thinking at any given time.Impossible!It was long, tedious and basically, pornographic.And yes, I kept reading it, hoping that at some point, it would conform to some acceptable standard of historical biography. Forget about it!Avoid this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The Best","review":"Ray Prouty's three classic three books on helicopter aerodynamics (helicopter Aerodynamics(HA), More HA and Even more HA)are brought together in a single, affordable tome.

However, if you actually take some time to practice and play the game, it's really fun.The main problem with the card game is that the controls are a little weird, however, once you get used to them, it flows pretty well, the AI provides a decent challenge, and the starter decks, while good, aren't so good that you can just breeze through the game.There really isn't much to say about the gameplay, it's a card game.

Perhaps he didn't have time to polish At the End of Day, perhaps it was pushed because he died. It's just not very good. The dialogue doesn't work, the Bulger/Flemmi theme is overplayed, and if it weren't by Higgins it would have sunk like a stone. And no matter what conventional {ab}usage allows, the old Higgins would never have used \\"gunsel\\" to describe a gunman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone, but good.","review":"I'm still working through this book. I loved the Friends of Eddy Coyle, but as a follow-up, this is less engaging, more of a slog. About halfway through it, I realized, as did another reviewer, that what this book is really about is the way the Boston FBI managed to justify (to itself) keeping the murderous multiple felon Whitey Bulger active, and allowing him to get away with whatever he wanted to do. That arrangement has never been described in detail that I'm aware of. So here is Higgins' take on how the twisted ambitions of the FBI agents and the twisted characters they needed to deal with could have yielded up a situation like Whitey Bulger. And it's worth noting that the book is almost entirely not only in dialogue, but in *dialect*. Page after page of characters either talking or thinking. Very little action, but when it happens, it's convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Characters, Slow Dialog","review":"At End Of Day takes far more effort to read than a traditional novel packed with action scenes, and/or tied together neatly through the perspective of a narrator. Chapters alternate with two mob informants reminiscing about their own careers and about the guys they're having to set on fire and maim to persuade them to pay their loans on time. These conversations ramble on and on, over and over. The heavy New England dialect is frustrating to interpret. Finally, these aimless conversations come together to reveal an alliance between the FBI and the mob--I guess this plot twist is supposed to surprise the reader? Poorly developed characters and the dialog technique employed here make this a difficult read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter on the farm- Little House series","review":"Great series of books.

The duet with Sammy Kershaw, \\"Maybe Not Tonight\\" is maudlin, hokey and the execution is lifeless. The Jon Randall (hubby) penned \\"In Bed\\" or \\"On the Bed\\", whichever, is songwriting at its most banal.

Finally Willy Lindwer took up the challenge of finding out what happend in the last 7 monthes of her life. I recomend this book to anyone and everyone, but I recomend reading her diary first. This book picks up where her diary left off and continues to the day that she died.This book is told by the women who knew Anne Frank and her family at the concentration camp and not only tell what they know happend to her, but their story as well.

Indeed he is interviewing women who knew Anne Frank in Westerbork, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Bergen-Belson, but as one reads, we discover that Anne Frank is only one piece in this story. Lindwer presents (full?) interviews of six remarkable women who not only knew Anne Frank, but also have significant stories to tell themselves. While it would be too much to say that Anne Frank becomes a bit player in their stories, it is not a stretch to claim that she becomes contextualized in a time and place and in the life of Dutch Jewish women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Not Worth the Money","review":"The image of this ring is very deceptive.

It was always protected in its case and never dropped.I thought it was lame, I read of a lot of other reviews where the hitachi drive died.

Not awesomely great, but definitely page-turningly good. What is interesting, though, is that it has yet to leave my mind after more than four years.

It is a provocative novel that has true staying power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is one wild story and I loved it - the idea she uses of who Moses was is just plain fun, in my opinion.

Well researched as this book may be, Judith Tarr simply cannot make this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't stand this book!!","review":"This book was terrible. Even if she did use Dr. Redford's book as one of her references, she obviously just picked what she wanted out of it and ignored the rest. Akhenaten was Moses????!!!! Yeah, right!!!!! Akhenaten detested the secrecy of the cult of Amen, and picked Aten as his diety because you could see it, and did not have to rely on faith. This doesn't sound very Judaistic to me! Like so many people who have written about Akhenaten, Tarr made the mistake of portraying him as being detached from his family, when all evidence indicates that Akhenaten was devoted to his family. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has to be kidding!!!!","review":"Well, unless you ignore the fact that the two men in this book lived centuries apart, this could be a good science fiction book.This book is stupid, insulting, and the worst she has ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection","review":"A versatile and engaging anthology of stories about gay relationships. Some author names included here will surprise you (Henry James? but his \\"Pupil\\" is one of the most amusing and engaging stories), others will delight you (W. Burroughs' \\"Wild Boys.\\"). Edmund White, a prominent gay writer, thankfully included his own short story, \\"Skinner Alive,\\" into this collection, and I fell in love with his lyrical style. He displays great taste in editing this collection, and provides an insightful foreword. Every story here brings an interesting nuance to the genre, and each one holds surprises for the reader.

The author used many dark examples of negative allergic reactions. What an eye opener to all of the things that can happen to your child! However, I felt much of the advice and guidance was lost when the extreme consequences were used for every case example.

None of the song were considered good enough to be released as singles. The one fairly good song is \\"So Close, Yet So Far (From Paradise)\\". The only other songs that are somewhat interesting are \\"Shake That Tambourine\\" and \\"Hey Little Girl\\", which aren't good songs, but at least they have some energy to them.Girl Happyis another bad soundtrack. \\"Do the Clam\\" was released as a single from this album, and was one of the worst songs ever released as an Elvis single. The only good song on the album is \\"Puppet on a String\\", which was later released as a single when it started to get radio airplay. A few other songs have a certain goofy charm, such as \\"Cross My Heart and Hope to Die\\" and \\"The Meanest Girl in Town\\", but they are by no means good songs.This CD will be of interest only to Elvis fans who have to have everything that the King ever recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tread Softly","review":"Truly, this is probaly not today's preteen's cup of tea.

She hates boys. And she also very chastely discovers them. Wow. I was bombarded with bad illustrations in my copy (a discard from the library) that looked as if they had been drawn by some well-meaning 5tb garder.

If you are scanning through the disc, you might think that the introductions of many songs have been cut off. What has happened is that [...] Arista placed most of the track markings AFTER songs have started (You have to back-up and listen to the end of a previous track in order to hear the beginning of the next one).Naturally, if you play the CD from start to finish, you'll never notice this problem.This is really sad because the quality of the sound is very good, and the CD is probably the best representation of Warwick's work. But I wouldn't recommend this disc because of the technical flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs...poor recording/digital transfer work","review":"This should be a fantastic music set...but once you listen...you will notice that there is something wrong with the cut-offs & beginnings of the songs when played in shuffle mode.This is simply unacceptable and does a tremendous disservice to Ms Warwick...a true icon whose work should never have been presented in such a sloppy fashion.It seems as if it was not edited at all.Definitely two thumbs down for the editing...thumbs up for the compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Diva \\"Dionne Warwick\\"!","review":"This is one of the best if not the best albums Dionne released.

Dreadful."},{"rating":"2","title":"slight dissapointment, but a good compilation","review":"Although the music could be better and there are quite a few weaker numbers, this is a great compilation of songs from Fosse shows.

This is a terrible disappointment, destined to be useful in dance classes, but not an especially fine addition to your collection of show music.The performances seem stilted and mediocre on CD.

If you haven't seen or heard anything by Mr. Fosse, this is a wonderful (5stars) cd. But if you're like me, and have seen All That Jazz, Pippin, Chicago, Damn Yankees, Cabaret, et., you'll notice the spark missing from some of the songs.

I must recommend this cd to any music and dance lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close your eyes and let it take you away","review":"As a stand alone recording, Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance would appear quite week without the visual aspect of the show. Unlike other Original Broadway Cast Recordings, the music selections here neither make the story progress - as there is none - nor translate the essence of the show.However, if you have seen the show, you will smile widely while listening to the recording. Jane Lanier, Michael Paternostro and Alex Sanchez (Steam Heat) transpose quite well on CD, and so does Big Spender and Mr. Bojangles. But nothing compares to the dazzling rendition of the \\"Big Deal\\" classic, Life's a Bowl of Cherries, performed by the stellar, beautiful, talented and gracious Valarie Pettiford, who, with this performance may have failed to snag a Tony, but solidified the strong hold she has on her fan's admiration and won the heart of a new generation of spectators who had yet to discover the wonder that is Ms. Pettiford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.

The introduction explaining what makes a movie bad should be a must read for anyone who thinks that only Ed Wood and Roger Corman can make a bad movie. The sections following each movie listed proved to be both entertaining and informative; giving a description of the film, how the movie was made, and what went wrong. I learned a few tidbits of information and Hollywood history that I had never heard before. Of course, Michael Sauter is biased in his views especially when it comes to the great Cecil B.

That album has somewhat of a cult reputation as a widely unheralded classic in prog circles. This one is American, released in 1973, and at a different level and pitch to the other, European Pan.This Pan is not a ground-shaker, the music is pretty and mellow, in the territory of the Byrds, Seals and Crofts, America or It's A Beautiful Day, that kind of style. There are odd instruments in the mix, harp on the second track (Lady Honey), along with pleasant driving acoustic guitar and strings. Steel guitar is featured quite a lot.One should comment on the superb presentation and production values of this package. Sony Music Japan have taken out all the stops with this one, complete with bilingual booklet with lyrics for all tracks, and b&w; photos of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Headset!

Occasionally their songs have an upbeat and rogueish soul quality, vocals drawled in a heavy Scottish brogue over a curious Glaswegian Motown beat, but it is the slower and more spacious songs on which Arab Strap truly shine.

This is a real tearjerker of a film, and Brosnan fans will also enjoy hearing James Bond sing a few times (he's actually pretty good!).

Although I'd hoped for a continuation of Mexican Moon's wide-open soundscapes, the mood of Group Therapy is a little less expansive and the music less sweeping. Actually, its sound is a little retrogressive--more on par with Bloodletting, and it's got that same seedy, Anne Rice sort of feel (especially \\"Fried\\"). But Napolitano's reflective lyrics--on everything from the brutal grind of media culture to getting wiser with age--make this album really worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops, should not have made this album","review":"I have been a Concrete Blonde fan since the very first album and have really enjoyed all of their albums.

This album lacks the emotion and the strentgth the band once had. The lyrics are so blah!

A girl I know played Still In Hollywood, the album, last year and I fell in love with it and its still one of my favorite albums. Then I bought their other albums and wasnt that impressed, mostly because it was a little dated when I heard it. It just didnt have that edge, that rough but precise feel of Still In Hollywood.

John Lund shows a deft comedy touch as the stuntman hired to impersonate the dead idiot heir but who falls in love with his supposed sister. Lund and Wanda Hendrix have some very good scenes together while Ilka Chase, Barry Fitzgerald and Monty Woolley give great support. Even Robert Stack gives a good performance. Only director Richard Haydn's small part as the lawyer is totally over the top (played under the name Richard Rancyd - enough said).It is a shame that this is only available as a very poor quality video.

This does not matter; of a band never progresses (this is where the musicians are seperated from the listeners) then it gets no where, and people turn away, uninterested; Deftones are simply exploring deeper into a genre, and a completely new one; Chino was headed in the Depeche Mode-ish style on the last: this....this is collaborative. Deftones can't be placed anywhere; and it's beatiful, buit they can be placed everywhere: Quicksand, Korn, Glassjaw, Morrissey, The Cure, Tool, Nirvana, Rage, VOD: it's great; tell me you get tired of this record and I'll laugh my ass off. There is no way. That's that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones - Deftones","review":"The Deftones are a timeless band that will always be different, no matter how many people try to shove them in the MTV radio-friendly nu-metal world. This latest Deftones cd just goes on to prove the Tones don't care about sucking up to radio-playlists or try to get a top-10 video on TRL. Sure, this effort isn't as classic as Around the Fur or White Pony, but it still has the brutal passion the Deftones always infuse in their music. It's an underrated album that will constantly grow on the listener. It's heavy, aggressive, and meant to be that way. Songs like \\"Hexagram\\", \\"When Girls Telephone Boys\\", and \\"Bloody Cape\\" crank up the volume past 10 to deliver heavy, yet beautiful music that no one seems to understand. The lyrics are deep, introspective, and always puzzling to the reader (that's the best kind in my opinion). So if you want timeless music that is art, buy all the Deftones' cds. If you want crap that will decompose in a year, buy Linkin Park. Your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album shows a band running out of ideas","review":"I don't understand why these ratings are so high.

I loved adrenaline and around the fur, and white pony will continue to be the best album ever created. The deftones are and will be my favorite band, but I am afraid this cd will not be in my collection. There is just something missing from it. I have listened to it twice with very little interest in listening to it again. Its not something that I can really put a finger on or describe. I am just warning you to listen to it before you buy it. I was worried when I saw that the title was simply \\"deftones\\", and I feel that they put just as much effort into the songs as they did to come up with a title.

Anyone need a used copy of this mess?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge leap...in the WRONG direction","review":"White Pony was a good, diverse, catchy record with creative rhythms. I had high expectations when I bought the new album; I was horribly disappointed. Too many of the songs sound just alike. Also, half of the cd isn't even music; it's just noise, and it gets boring very quickly. Why do so many rock bands in the mainstream these days feel a need to scream so much?

I have the tendency of listening a band's previews cd's when i get a new release and usually i try to see if, according to my taste, they progressed towards a right direction or not. Unfortunately i think the Deftones never really progressed, even in White Pony if you remove Delgado's textures and Morenos occasional guitar playing you still got a cd that sound like Adrenaline and Around The Fur. Not to say that any of those cds including this new one are bad, but honestly i'd like to see a solid change in they're formula since they are a great band and i'm sure they could pull it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odnbo paves the way for another wild ride!","review":"Everything you've seen from this group passes from one musical genius.Who is this Metal Maestro?

You've probably seen his face in every single Artvoice \\"What Has Happened.\\" This charismatic FolkRock god reinvented the Hallwalls artstudio. Now he's the man behind the man, behind the guy, to the left of the technician of the Deftones.What's next for this gutsy indie rock folk legend? It's a little unexpected, but some people are talking very seriously about an Indigo girls GOA Trance/PSY Trance crossover project. Can you smell a Grammy folks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally!","review":"I've been waiting a long time for this CD. In a time where bands (uhhmmm Staind....Disturbed)seem to be losing any interest in pushing the envelope....on the other end of the spectrum lies the Deftones. This CD isn't White Pony....there is no single career accomplishing song like Digital Bath or Be Quiet and Drive. There is however is 11 tunes that could be the backround for a documentary on the psychologically disturbed. They have always been a band to throw out some disturbing lyrics with powerful and perfectly timed music. This CD is not as heavy as the early CD's or not as mainstream as White Pony, but it is perhaps the darkest feeling CD they have put out. Even the slower tracks leave you feeling that if the band were anything other than musicians, they would be locked up somewhere. Go buy the best CD that has come out this year so far and quit waiting for your old hero's to find their backbone's.....this one is worth the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Followup.....not great","review":"First off....these guys are one of the best sounding bands ever. I was a little disappointed with this cd because it seems that rather than going forward, they seem to be reverting back to the sounds of Around the Fur. I do enjoy the fact that they stay true to their unique sound, but i grow tired of the same sound with every Deftones' disc (with the exception of White Pony). In my opinion, buy White Pony and Around the Fur and you have captured the true dynamic nature of the Deftones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on now.","review":"Let's be honest here. You're giving this radio-friendly garbage 5-star reviews because you worship Chino. Naturally, the band that made the fantastic Adrenaline has been murdered and recycled into a bland, fun-hating by-the-numbers new-metal band that regurgitates sh*t after sh*t. By far the best part is the song titles. No matter how terrible the Tones have become, we can always count on them having seriously cool song titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD","review":"Please do not read the review of CursiveMike, he has no idea what he is talking about. The Deftones slipped? Go ahead read his other reviews. He loves the Darkness and Modest Mouse. Guess what MIKE these are girl bands. They are no talent hacks whom the radio has made popular because of sellouts such as yourself. The self-titled Deftones album is great, from the first song to the last. Listen to When Girls Telephone Boys, Mike, it goes out to you. Don't speak, Don't say anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound like every other pop nu metal band","review":"I guess a person who would enjoy this album would either have to be an obsessed deftones fan, tone deaf (no pun intedended), or at an age range of about 12-16 yrs old with no clue of what good metal sounds like. Take a listen to old metallica, Black Sabbath, or I'll go out on a limb and say Godsmack to see what ballsy metal should be.Much like all nu metal these days, these songs have the typical mellow sad vocals that are accompanied by a thrashing sound which sounds more like processed studio mixes resembling what is heard at a NYC subway station. Of course I forgot to mention the offkey screaming and chanting also typical of Nu metal. This just shows how far in decline Rock/ metal is these days when sub standard music (if you can call it that) like this can get released."},{"rating":"1","title":"the deftones new album!","review":"this album is, to me the bigest disapoint ment ever the deftones are my favorate band and this albumis to be fair absoulutly pants.when i bought this album i was very excited and wanted to get straight home, i realised when i got home that it was not worth the 10 english pounds i payed.i think i will try to pertend that this album never existed.i took it back the next day and got a refund, this is the only deftones album i dont like. and the only reason i gave it one star is because i like the art work."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"dont buy this cd . ! buy adrenaline and around the fur!! its not anyone would expect. maybe its ok if your sleeping"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones","review":"I got to see these guys play, for free in a McDonalds parking lot in Minneapolis MN. before they were even known by anyone, they rocked then, and now with every major release, they continue to rock, as a quick listen of this CD(and all of their others) will tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deftones rocks.... with one exception","review":"I dont know what happened here, but they defintely screwed it up.

All the Songs have a very slow, but very heavy, full sound. Lyrics are awsome and i have to say, all of them make sense :D. Very matured sound, clean, solid and i love it when they roll up through my playlist. Defently a buyer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close but no cigar.","review":"This is defintialy a good album, but it not the Deftones best work. It's lacking the intensity of Around the Fur and Adrenaline, and the focus of White Pony. Actually if you take the time to read the lyrics, it's a very beautiful masterpiece. Chino is a lyrical genius. He pours his heart and soul out on this record, not that he didn't previously, but these lyrics are extremley emotional, and get you involved, to bad the actual music isn't. I just wish the album was more intresting from a musical standpoint. \\"When Girls Telephone Boys\\" just seems like a waste of energy, with such intresting lyrics involved. It's not a bad record, but has a few flaws, not as heavy as Arenaline, not as fun as Around the Fur, not as blanaced as White Pony, But if your a true Deftones fans you should keep this in your music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"LiViNg uP tO tHiEr NaMe","review":"The long awaited self-titled Deftones album. For any fan of Deftones, this CD is Deftones. The unique style of integrating the vocals, with some guitar riffs/chords, and a sick drumbeat makes every song so unique. The Deftones structure for their songs are very different. There are some bands that just wouldn't make it, if it wasn't for the way they play together. Deftones demonstrates that the best, that's why they get away very odd guitar riffs, the vocals and drums are integrated perfectly.As a true Deftones fan, I feel that this isn't their best album, but it's not anything less than any other album. But I do have to say this to Deftones, there better be more coming!!For anyone who has never listened to Deftones, look up the word Deftones, \\"Deft\\", and then \\"tones\\". Then go buy all their CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointed","review":"My brother recently bought this cd. I've listened to all the tracks, and many of them are, well, unlistenable. This cd is a lot less muscial than white pony, with Chino screaming most of the time. There are some great tracks on this cd, like Minerva and the final track. However, it just doesn't stand up to White Pony, and I definitly think the Deftones are more musical than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Being a Deftones fan from way back, and understanding that their musical style has been transforming into something more \\"melodic\\", I was nervous about buying this album. Turns out I was right. This album is a continuation of their attempt to develop Chino's voice into something melodic...which is not possible, it seems. The first two albums' vocals capitalized on their angst and energy, keys to their early success. White Pony began the downhill slide, with Chino's vocals beginning to become dragged out. The music on this album is great, as usual, but the vocals aren't working for me...your mileage may vary. Bring back the old style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Absolute worst....sorry?","review":"This is by far the worst Deftones album. I gave it several chances, 've listened to it about 5 times all the way through, expecting it to grow on me. Butsadly enough it hasn't. It lacks the rawness of adrenaline, it lacks the power of around the fur, and it lacks the quality of white pony. Imagine everything you love about each deftones album thrown into a blender. but then, tone everything down. thats what this cd is like. Chino delivers once again, with stellar vocal performances. but not een he can save the sub par music. Deathblow and Lucky You are both incredible songs but als fail at saving the cd. 3 stars maybe, if im in the mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I was extremely disapointed by this album. Aside from the three somewhat good songs on this CD it .... it is just constant noise, there is no depth to it. Chino needs to stop screaming once in a while and sing.If you are a new deftones fan go buy the other 3 albums they will make you much more happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of the better","review":"This CD was decent for Deftones. I feel White Pony was better, but it's still good all the same. I think it doesn't even quite compare to Adrenaline or Around The Fur, but it's still Deftones. That's why I give it 4 stars. Some serrenading vocals hit perfectly, yet his screaming/loud voice seems strained and not too much effort. I think he did a better job with vocals on the previous 3 CDs. On a more positive note, Abe is really shredding it up on drums on this album. Sweet poppy beats with strong bass kicking and cymbal smashing. All in all, a good CD in which I recommend to anyone who likes this genre of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones are #1","review":"Deftones is the best band out there. they have managed to stay completely original. they are not repetitive, every album is different. this newest release is probably their most mature release. they put their hearts and souls into this album, and it really shows. whats awesome about deftones is each cd can go with a different mood. check out this cd, and prpepare to be amazed.p.s. if you don't like it right away, give it a chance. the first time i heard it, i didn't know what to think, mostly because it was so different. listen to it a couple of times, and if you're a true Deftones fan, you will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the deftones worst album","review":"I have been a dedicated deftones fan for years and could not believe how washed up and tired this new album is. How the deftones could have done so much with their previous albums and then just dropped this bomb is beyond me.All the tracks are strict B material and have very little to offer in terms of engaging a listener. It just a barrage of menontenous trashing and wailing that is enough to make a fan who has treasured their unique and innovative spin on metal cry.But I will try not to get misty eyed and just say that some may be able to find some enjoyment in its purity of noise, but I find it pure crap. I've tried giving it an honest chance 7 times or so now and each time have to struggle to make myself keep listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"From \\"Around the fur\\" to \\"White Pony\\" was a major leap. \\"White Pony\\" is a masterpiece. From the first listen this album has timeless written all over it. Went and saw them live during that tour and it rawked. I have eagerly awaited this new album for so long, keeping up with all the news, etc.Then it finally came out and it is [bad]. If you say you like it, you are just jumping on the band wagon. Everything that made this band great is gone form this,,. They took out what made all their previous albums great and you are left with this mass of confusion. It doesn't sound like an album, the way the rest of their stuff does. It seems like a collection of songs, thrown together. That techno [stuff]...doesn't fit. A lot of it doesn't. The single [is bad].There are a couple of good songs on here, but as a whole, don't buy it...or of you do, buy it used, this album just came out and there are already 300 used on here...does that tell you something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"HOw can some one be at a watered down Linkin Park concert and at the sametime not like Deftones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing ive ever heard in my life.","review":"This is nothing like the deftones used to be. It just sounds like someone dying throughout the whole cd. Theres no melody. No catchy tunes. No good guitar riffs. You cant even hear what the hell is going on, it just sounds like a bunch of distortion with no melody. The drums suck. Everything sucks on this. Dont waste your money on this junk and buy there last cds like adrenaline or around the fur. That was actually music. This CD just sounds like a depressed singer with no more talent for music. Maybe chino will get back to normal one day. I give this cd -349 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but not great","review":"adrenaline was an awesome disc. There were a few points in it that were a little wierd, but all in all its a great CD. Around the Fur, I think, is their best and most defining CD. Full of great songs ie. be quite and drive, my all time favorite deftones song. White Pony was definitely a good job in terms of the experimentation involved. Not better than its predecessor, but still very good. This disc just didn't really grab me like around the fur, or even white pony for that matter. Deftones really didn't expand their horizons much. Bloody Cape seems very around the fur-esque, Minerva is a good song, also reminiscent of classic tones. I'd still buy this CD despite the lack of effort by the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deftones are done","review":"Wow. I was pretty excited to get the new deftones album. I had been reading in articles that it was going to be a heavier album than the White Pony. The White Pony was not a terrible album. It had it;s good songs (Korea, Pink Maggit, even Change), butit was obviously slower and more melodic than the previous two albums. The new album however is sooooo boring. I don't mind slow deftones songs. I love Drive from \\"around the fur\\". However, these slow songs are lame. Chino sounds like he got hit in the head too many times. They all seem to sound the same. Very boring! Even the token hard sond is boring. They need more ups and downs. This hurts because I loved the Deftones. If you were a deftones fan from the beginning it is hard to want to stay one. It is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"This album is a total drag ... ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME. I was willing to look over the crappiness of the Minerva song when i bought this album since White Pony was such a great album. Boy, i was not expecting what i got.

Production is monolithic and nicely crushing, but Chino's vox tend to hover and drift with occasional hooks...but mostly they just hover and drift. I liked White Pony better, and 'round the Fur sounded a little more fierce than this one. Maybe they're getting old, maybe I'm getting old...whatever the case, Shai Hulud's new album also came out on the same day and I have to give that one the May release trophy.I'm hoping this new Deftones will grow on me, but as it stands...I'm more moved to watch the acoustic stuff from the Deftones live in Hawaii DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't even like Rock music but....","review":"I am more of gangsta rap person Three 6 Mafia, Wu-tang clan,Nas,2Pac stuff like that but this album and white pony give me goose bumps everytime I listen to them.

Buying it my hopes were high but i knew it could never add up to \\"Around the fur\\" which is the best cd of all time. This album is defenitely not one of there best. Its not bad.. its good. but not good for a Deftones album. I think what killed it for me was \\"Lucky You\\" and \\"Minerva\\". I dont know why i just dont like those songs. The rest is good. But when the cd ended i thought there should've been more. But the best songs are: Needles and Pins,Battle Axe,Bloody Cape, and When girls telephone Boys.

White Pony was generally a mellow disc in comparison to their other albums, this one isn't neccessairily super heavy but its more driving and definitly more powerful. I'd call it music to listen to during the apocolypse just because that's the feeling I get when listening to this, the guitars can get downright spooky sometimes. The album is great from start to finish, I didn't like \\"When Girls Telephone Boys\\" that much as it sounds like a filler track without much originality. \\"Lucky You\\" might be a preview of what Chino's next project 'Team Sleep' could sound like with its electronic groves mixed with haunting guitars. This album just barely misses being their best yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"very lacking","review":"before i start id just like to say i have never felt the need to write a review fo anyalbum before, but this i felt did. this album well, so say it bluntly, lacks alot for deftones i feelthe songs are structued similiarly, or perhaps played like pony, but just seem to be all over the place. dont get me wrong, the lyrics and meanings behind the songs are still there, just the way they truend out wasnt the best. from being a big deftones fan, i would recomendto buy this album on the cheap.. or... get it by other means. white pony was the peak of them trying new stuff, i feel thats where it stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different doesnt mean good.....","review":"I consider myself a pretty hardcore deftones fan and i have to say that i dont like this album.

That is not at all what you are getting so save your money. CD is quite boring at times and it flat out just doesnt sound good. This is coming from a nu-metal fan so im not against the genre.

The music is still strong on this album, although the songs really seem to run together, as they have similar structures and tempos. But the music is good, continuing the Deftones tradition of either eerie or heavy songs. The main problem with this disc is the singing of Chino. Most of his lyrics are inaudible, and his voice simply gets annoying by the end of the album. Several songs passed by, and I could feel their greatness, if only he wasn't whining his way through it. I was hoping this album was going to be alot better than it is, but it is not bad enough to lose faith in this very good, and usually very original, band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"The Deftones really did try their best with this album, but there is one thing that sinks it and that is VOCALS. Chino has almost no voice left, and the result is a series of incoherent mumbles and screams. The lyrics are sub-par as well, but they could be mildly interesting if I could actually hear them. The rest of the band is giving 110%, I can really tell. But there are only a few standout songs on the album like Minerva and Battle-Axe, where Chino doesn't scream the whole thing. For example, listening to the first track 'Hexagram', Chino at one point seems to go 'pressure PLAY pressure PLAY pressure PLAY pressure PLAY' when he's actually saying 'worship PLAY'. Does it make sense? I don't know. Is it interesting? Not in the slightest. Perhaps what made White Pony so good was that Maynard from Tool did guest vocals. 'Deftones' is currently collecting dust on the shelf in my room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones Go back to the roots","review":"It's not that I was dissapointed with White Pony, however It just didn't grab me as around the fur or adrenaline did and take me for a complete ride. Iv'e been listening to Deftones since they released adrenaline, and I have to say that their latest release DOES NOT dissapoint.Everything about this album from the opening track, Hexagram, gets into your ears, mind, and soul. Stef's amazing guitar work does not dissapoint,Chino's Insane yet melodic vocals blend smoothly as usual, and Abes drumming is outstanding, Chi holds it down solid as usual.This album has some very brutal moments, as well as beautifully melodic moments as well. you can see a definite Depeche Mode-Cure influence in the songs \\"Lucky You\\", with traces of trip hop. \\"Deathblow\\" and \\"battle-Axe\\" Rock hard.This album is like a blend of \\"Around The Fur\\" and \\"White Pony\\". in a time of watered down rock, and candy punk, this Album crushes and outshines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trimuphant return of true heavy rock","review":"Deftones definately make a glorious return to the scene with this self titled album. Dark, poetic and wrapped in signature deftone riffs, the album will help any true hard rock fan escape from mainstream bandwaggoning hard rock wannabe sounds. While the album is not lyricaly the best ever, combination of dark, almost mazohistic sounds with deep dark lyrics definately makes for an amazing combination. tracks that are worth mentioning \\"battle axe\\" which is more of a new style deftones almost on a lighter note, but also on of the fastest and heaviest tracks, also \\"minerva\\" as the briliant single from the album, and completely original and again almost new \\"wave\\" deftones sound. \\"Deftones\\" is the album for sure worth owning, specialy if you are a hard core fan, while the outside crowd or those that are just now trying to catch on with the deftones might have some problems swallowing the darkness of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"truely amazing....brilliant!!!","review":"well first i'll say this... it is by far the best abum of the year.I was worried about this album because white pony was amazing and i really did'nt think it could be topped, but i was wrong.

I know you've heard other people remark on different vocalists who can switch between a scream and a croon, but I'm surprised Moreno didn't bust his vocal cords while recording this album.

The deftones have always been good at keeping a safe distance between themselves and 'nu-metal'. This disc, however, brings them a step too close for comfort.Perhaps my slight dissapointment is merely a byproduct of the fact that I believe White Pony was one of the top 10 albums ever recorded, and my expectations for a follow-up are simply too high. The fact remains that the musicianship, lyrics, vocals, and emotion put into this album are lightyears above almost every other current artist of the genre.

I even thought White Pony was a great transition and I hoped they would change in more unexpected ways. But this... What am I saposed to do with this... Most of the songs start off with the same melodic intro then go imediately into a wall of borring sound that even blocks out chinos vocals. And speaking of Chino, I really miss his old scream. Every time I listen to \\"elite\\" on White pony, I get the shivers and really feel him. But on this album he just wails like a creaking fence. This album was definately a huge dissapointment.

They continue to expand the genre of Nu Metal and continue to seperate themselves from the wannabes with solid guitar work, good beats, and of course Chino's patented yells. A must for any fan of true music. Give it a listen and i'm sure you will be pleased. DEFTONES ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does any one else feel like sleeping?!","review":"Crap. Pure Crap. If you like all of Deftones other CDs, and you thought \\"Around the Fur\\" was just OK, Then you will want to throw this in the garbage. The only reason i gave this CD 2 stars is because Deftones is one of my favorite rock bands, and i am willing to follow them through thick and thin.-Metal, AHHHHHHHH-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"Don't get me wrong; I love it when Chino gets all sentimental but a whole album? Come on, can I get something I can snowboard too? I don't hate the album it just wasn't what I was expecting after Adrenaline, White Pony and Around the Fur (three fantastic albums by the way). All those albums rocked my socks off but I'd suggest picking Saturday Night Wrist instead of buying this one if you don't have it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks @ss","review":"This is a very solid release for the 'tones. I have loved all of their albums, and think that they have progressed nicely since their debut. I loved White Pony, but as soon as Hexagram kicked in, i knew i was in for something refreshing. And that it is. There are some great tunes here. New comers may find Minerva the easiest to degest upon the first few listens, while veteran Deftones fans should find that and the rest of their album to their satisfaction. This is one that is still growing on me after repeated listens, which is a rare thing these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby-worth getting if you're a deftones fan","review":"If you're a true Deftones fan, then you allready know that EVERY song they create is good. But honestly, I have to say that I was expecting just a little bit more from these guys. On several Deftones websites, their new cd was hyped as going to be very heavy, like Adrenaline. This doesn't seem to be the case however. I was able to download some demos earlier this year that sounded very promising, especially the song Amnisty, which was somehow cut I guess from the album, which is a dam shame. The album really starts off strong with the first 4 tracks, especially Hexagram and Good Morning Beautiful. Later on though the cd starts to lose steam a little bit, but it's still Deftones, and it still kicks .... But right now after the first listen, you can tell that they've changed their sound from the Around the Fur days. But still, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELL YEAHH","review":"Hey ... FORGET About all you know in music...this is the best cd Deftones has ever released. The Heaviest, The most beautiful lyrics, I agree this is the hardest to get into for a novice, but once you get it... Listen to it over and over to fully understand. Thanks Deftones. Saturday night wrist is so good but this one is better. The press did not understand this one because they are too busy giving credit to emo stuff. BETTER THAN EZRA, BETTER THAN KORN, BETTER THAN EVERYTING YOU KNOW. Thanks Deftones. I discovered them with Adrenaline and Well/... they are still my favorite drug. That is emotion. you will never find it anywhere else. THIS IS EMOTION. THANKS THANKS THANKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring mess of sludge","review":"Sorry but i have to edit my last review. At first i gave this album the benefit of the doubt and rated it 4 stars but after multiple listens it has failed to grow on me, unlike the great White Pony did. The album is just boring and overly noisey. Who mixed this thing? You can barely hear the vocals at all, they're buried under all the sludge. Some songs brake away from the monotony such as the explosive opener \\"Hexagram\\" which is as melodic as it is brutal. \\"Bloody cape\\" would be a good track on Around the Fur. And contrary to most fans beleif, \\"Anniversary..\\" is a wonderful ballad which almost makes up for the horrible failure of \\"teenager\\" on White Pony. The rest of the album just sends me to sleep, including the My Bloody Valentine sounding \\"Minerva\\". Overall, Deftones is a dissapointing album. It lacks both the emotion of Around the fur and the growing vision of White Pony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I bought this album skeptical of not hearing the other Deftones albums. I can say after owning this album for only 3 days, I can't get enough of it. After listening to it for the first time, it may seem excessive or overly heavy with songs like \\"When girls telephone boys\\" but they are addicting and even hypnotic. There are only two or three songs I won't listen to including \\"Lucky you\\" and \\"The anniversery...\\" which are flat out terrible. Over all this album is an excellent find. Best tracks on the album are Hexagram, Needles and Pins, Minerva, and Bloody Cape."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIGHT LIKE A TIGER!!!","review":"So tight.....so coooollll.......totally deck.....go buy it...all songs are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated Stories From the Book of Mormon: Journey to the Promised Land","review":"My daughter gave me an almost complete set of the Animated Stories From the Book of Mormon.

I was being generous by rating this book at 4. The only reason the book captured a 4 is because the ending was not expected and one or two characters of the book were interesting but Pamela Thomas-Graham needs to go right back to the drawing boards. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"When I first heard about this book, I was really excited because of its African-American author and characters, but it soon became obvious that the reader has to have been at an ivy-league college to get into this book. Not being an ivy-grad, I found it very hard to relate to much of anything in it. The writing style seems like the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The characters seem either flat or cliche (and by cliche I mean REALLY cliche). Books about successful African-American characters should inspire to be like them, but this one sure doesn't. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"This book was horrible -- don't waste your money. If you really have to read it get it from a library. I wish I had. The plot is weak, the writing is stiff and the relationship between the lead characters silly.If you want a good thriller with an African American female, try Riding the Snake by Steven Cannell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bad...","review":"Simply put, this was one of the worst mystery books I've ever read. How simplistic could she be!! The book read like a list of the best-known cliches and I could barely get through it.

No, I don't go to Harvard, but I do go to Yale, and I think it's sad this woman needs resort to writing a super-market shelf novel using her alma mater as the selling point to make money. It's just a school, get over it! If you want to address race relations, or any other social situations at Harvard, don't do it through a mystery novel. I hope readers realize that this book does not fairly represent Harvard or any other Ivy League school."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be so much better...","review":"Well, why not exploit Harvard (or any other IVY League institution) if you went there? The problem with this book is it sounds like the energy must have gone into the pitch (obviously, the author made a few connections as a consultant to entertainment companies) rather than the content. Hopefully, sales will sustain Ms. Thomas' series long enough for her to grow into the craft. But this book is a clunker--the dialogue, structure, stereotyped characters, and narrative cliches all detract so much from the predictable plot, it was impossible to enjoy the book or ever forget you were reading an author who reminds you twice--on the back of the paperback and inside the cover--that she graduated Phi Beta Kappa etc, etc from Harvard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me !","review":"When I first happened upon this book by a recommendatiion, becaude I am a lover of mystery/interracial romance novels, so when I read this book I thought I would really enjoy the storyline as well as the romance between Nikki and DanteBig disapointed on both counts. Hard to follow and as far as a romance for the romance of any kind that was mentioned it could have been left out of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING, INSIGHTFUL AND FRESH","review":"Did the other amazon.com readers read the same book I did? Pamela Thomas-Graham's book was great, and I commend it to anyone who enjoys good writing and a good story.Updating the standard mystery to accomodate contemporary reality -- in this case, the existence of talented women of color in elite environments -- is bound to bring out the critics. As other reader comments on this site attest, when someone dares to tell a fresh story, offer a new perspective, and present characters that think and feel authentically, the arm-chair critics and frustrated commissars come out of the woodwork, armed as always with Capitalized Outrage. Take a chill pill, folks! I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery of A DARKER SHADE OF CRIMSON but enjoyed even more the heroine and her mind. Nikki Chase is smart, honest, ambitious and insecure -- kinda the way most of us see ourselves. Pamela Thomas- Graham is a witty, artful writer and I look forward to more books from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one of the best written mysteries I've read.","review":"This was one of the best written mysteries I've read in a long time. It kept me guessing and very interested from the beginning to the end. I couldn't put it down. It is obvious that she used her experiences as a student at Harvard as the basis for much of her information. Additionally, the protagonist's background was very similar to her personal educational background. There were no stereotypes and it was very realistic. For a first novel/mystery, it was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad in every way","review":"This book was so awful in so many ways that an attempt to fully review it would convey more of a suggestion that it should be read than I am willing to make. This was a real stinker. I made my way through not to find out the \\"surprise\\" ending but because I paid for the book. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"I *did* finish it -- otherwise it would be 1 star.","review":"I agree with several of the 1 star reviews. Full of mystery cliches, lots of padding, pretty poor writing, and a cast of thoroughly one-dimensional characters -- the love interest between Nikki and Dante is so thin as to be comical.If the book were re-cast as comical, and re-written in that style, it might be much better.The main reason I finished was the Harvard/Cambridge connection.Good luck if you buy this one, but check the used bookstore first -- my copy will be there soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another tedious tome by yet another wannabe","review":"This book is little more than a paean to the author's good fortune at having gotten into Harvard. I, too, am an alumnus of that august institution, but I got over it a long time ago. And this, in sum, would be my advice to Ms. Graham before she pens any more of these banal \\"Ivy League Mysteries\\" : It's wonderful that you were able to get an Ivy League degree or two, but this alone does not validate your existence. Get over it and get on with the more substantive aspects of living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable murder mystery","review":"I picked this book up at Barnes and Noble after reading a good reveiw. I enjoy mysteries and romances. I realy enjoyed the way Ms Thomas Graham writes and I will be securing the follow up to this novel. I hope she develops the story of Nikki and Dante and explains what happen in their past.This book was a good start to an new crime solver. Hopefully Ms Thomas Graham will continue to hone Nikki's skills in this area. It might help if she had som self defense training if she going to be in more dangerous scenes.Hopefully the next book will develop faster as the author will not have to go into the background of the lead character so much.I hope to have the new book befor the end of the weekend and I reveiw it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid book!","review":"This book is an intriguing story that combines history, mystery, and a grand tour of the tropical paradise (?) known as Easter Island. Through the use of dual time periods, the author takes the reader through the early days of \\"civilized\\" exploration of the island (just prior to World War I), and on to the early 1970's, using the experiences of a scientist sent to study the ancient pollen present on the island in an attempt to understand its current botanical topography.Well-researched and equally well-written, the author weaves together both sets of characters from the different eras to solve multiple mysteries involving the people native to the island, the British explorers, and the topography of the island, itself. I found this novel to be entertaining, informative, and, surprisingly, fun to read. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I found this book so engrossing, I just had to stay up way past my bedtime to finish it. I learned many new things about Easter Island while reading this book, and I very much enjoyed the dual stories of Elsa and Greer and their lives on Easter Island. I must admit I found the alternating chapters flipping back and forth between Elsa and Greer a bit disruptive. I found myself skipping ahead to read Elsa's story and then went back to read Greer's chapters. Overall, I think this is a haunting tale well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book about a fascinating place","review":"This is a well-written and thoroughly researched book about a fascinating place. I've always been interested in Easter Island, and reading this novel gave me a lot of insight into the history and culture of the island and its people. The book is constructed around the stories of two women from different eras who travel there to study the unique characteristics of the island. Very well-written and very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Squander Your Reading Time","review":"I borrowed this book from the library and I'm glad I didn't buy it in addition to wasting the time I spent reading it. It's rare when I feel I've been had by an author, and this is one of those times. I should have known better; when I see a cover like this one, red flags should pop up to keep looking for something with better content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"Easter Island by Jennifer VanderbesThe premise of the novel sounded wonderful, two women 60 years apart exploring Easter Island. Unfortunately, the book couldn't make up it's mind if it should be a novel or a botany textbook on pollen. The characters had potential, but basically you just read about these two women instead of getting to know them. The ending of the book was also disappointing and since the only reason I finished the book was to find out what happened at the end, I didn't like the open ending which left you guessing"},{"rating":"2","title":"pack this book with your carry-on luggage","review":"Browsing at the library, picked this book for it's cover, and was surprisingly carried away from the start. Really fun, smart, engaging novel. The story is imaginative, the characters interesting and likable, and the narrative absorbing. Definitely a vacation read especially if you're going somewhere new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully enchanting!","review":"I loved this book! It is thoughtful and intelligent, yet totally captivating. Beautifully written, it skillfully blends the perfect balance of history and science with intriguing stories of the two heroines. On finishing the book, I was driven to read more about Easter Island, the moai, rongorongo, Katherine Routledge and Vice Admiral Graf von Spee. I hope the author is planning to write a second novel -- I shall look forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it from start to finish","review":"I've read many well reviewed books of late, but few have been as riveting as this one. Remarkably well crafted, it should appeal to the scholar, romantic, scientist, historian...I just enjoyed it immensely. I do suspect that it will appeal more to the female reader than the male, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I have seen some critics find its ending more than an acceptable leap...I found, instead, that its ending was earned - and delightful. A lovely read - I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"a.s. byatt wannabe","review":"anyone who has actually read a.s. byatt or michael cunningham's the hours will see how verrry familiar this plot is. mostly ho-hum with only a dash of sparkle. a hopeful start, but it turns into predictable sitcommery by novel's end. I do like the unique island setting though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea - but not well executed","review":"There are some fine ideas in this novel. The parallel plots of an early-1900s expidition, a modern scientist looking for fossilized pollen, and the ill-fated mission of some German war-ships converge nicely at the end, and that is structurally a very effective ploy. But you arguably have to wait a long time for it, and in the meantime there is a lot of rather dull character development. The 'modern' (1970s) part of the novel revolves around a rather average American woman scientist. Why not make her flamboyant, strong, hotblooded, sexy, or at least SOMETHING to make her come alive? She is just not exciting, sorry. The Victorian part of the plot boasts Elsa, who is a much more interesting person, but again predominantly rather dull. The most interesting character is perhaps the mentally disabled sister Alice. At least there is something unusual about her. Should cut the novel down to half length and inject some excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle from start to finish","review":"I have just finished the book for our book club next month and I don't have anything good to say about it. It was far too much information on flora and fauna interspersed with Greek origins (gymnosperms - gymnos sperma - naked seeds). I felt as though I was in a botany class and it was too boring for me.After finally getting through the book -- it took me about a week of perseverance -- I came to the conclusion that the author had a disdain for the male population and it came through with her treatment of Thomas and Beazley. Maybe it was just a feminist leaning, I don't know.The one thing I got out of the book was an interest in Easter Island. I will read true accounts of the history of the island and hopefully get a better understanding of its geography and its stone statues (moai).It certainly wouldn't be a book I would put on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bore-filled trip to a fantastical island","review":"Could not get involved with any of the characters. Ultimately, I just didn't care about whether or not these people get off the island. A little to melodramatic and over-written for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"botany and boredom","review":"This is one of the novels that comes across as first having a terrific idea but ultimately fails short of delivering. The 2 lead women protagonists' stories shift way too abruptly to let the reader care about their so-called passions or their relentless tedious work on the island in the field of botany. i feel this took huge liberties with WWW I seamen's mental and emotional states and if I was in that war, i would be grossly insulted. Points for a one of a kind location for a book, but I hate having to cute through the pretense to SEE the island. Look elsewhere for an adventure with heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easter Island was disappointing.","review":"Some women in my book club found the story to be good. I was expecting more information on Easter Island itself and was let down. I was not captivated by the two main characters and did not finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Great first novel. Good interweaving of two plots. A most unexpected page turner. Looking forward to her second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I won't discuss the story line of this book or its principal charactes, many others have already done that. This would be an interesting book for someone who had a real interest in Easter Island and had some grasp of - or at least interest in - the scientific studies being conducted by several of the protagonists. I wasn't particularly interested in either and didn't care for the book. In fact it's fair to say I was very disappointed in the book after having first read the author's second book, \\"Strangers at the Feast,\\" which I had trouble putting down - just the opposite of \\"Easter Island,\\" which I had trouble picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just fell flat","review":"This story never drew me in. The characters never made me care about them. Easter Island sounds interesting, but even with a strong interest, the flora and fauna descriptions mired down the pace. It was slow. The book promised more than it delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"She left out all the good stuff","review":"Easter Island had potentially interesting parallel plot lines that are presented in an uneven and dull manner and in the end fizzle. The character development deserves a huge yawn and the main \\"modern\\" character, Greer, is clearly a run-of-the-mill scientist who is capable primarily of whining about her own self-inflicted lack of success. The author fails to develop what might have been the most interesting plot line - the commencement of World War I and the difficulties presented by the geographical isolation of the German Pacific fleet. The author has gathered some interesting facts and woven a couple of potentially interesting timelines into a weak but sometimes enjoyable ensemble, but in the end I am left imagining the author researching this book in a single strenuous weekend of Web searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to watch","review":"I haven't watched all of them yet, but of the ones I have watched, the quality of the videos takes away from the enjoyrment of watching them. They have poor sound and visual quality. No wonder they're cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill","review":"A disappointing followup to an absolutely fantastic album. Don't dare waste your money, as they've tried to go mainstream. Their debut was fresh and original...this one sounds liks a million other bands. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monotonous dragged out downer","review":"I loved the first album and was waiting for Utopia Parkway to come out. I gave this 2 stars because there are 3 good songs which come as Red Dragon Tattoo, Denise, and Laser Show which all have great sounds. I bought the album after hearing Denise because it had a sort of Rentals and Weezer (which have different sounds if you listen) feel to it and I hoped that the whole thing would have that great creativity which is seen in Red Dragon Tattoo, but all in all if you listen to the songs they are long and drawn out sleepers. I listened to the whole thing in a matter of maybe 10 minutes due to the lack of creativity which can be seen in the first album. Radiation Vibe, Leave the Biker, and Survival Car are all fantastic songs with a pop feel that pulls the album together, but the new album leaves me wanting lots more. Unless you are a die-hard fan of FoW or don't care about lyrics that drone on forever then please spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another rock band","review":"Fountains of Wayne are definitely independent thinkers. Life in a cover band, impressing girls with tattoos, going to the laser show, the most depressing prom theme imaginable ...these are not your average topics for any band. But not only do fountains of Wayne approach things in a different way, but they do it with melodies you can actually hum. This is a talented, intelligent band that will probably be stuck with that \\"critic's darling\\" label forever, (\\"Stacy's Mom\\" Not withstanding...and not on this CD!) but they deserve greater success. Sure there are a few misfires, like the repetitive \\"Hat and Feet,\\" and the dated lyrics of \\"Go Hippie.\\" But overall, you'll find yourself well-rewarded by this band's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall a good buy","review":"I asked for this album for x-mas and i am listening to it for about the 16th time since i got it. It is basically very good. It tends to keep the same beat each song, but its fun to listen to the lyrics. The best one so far is \\"Valley of Malls\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, very disappointing....","review":"Their first album was brilliant, full of fantastic pop gems... this one is a bit of a disappointment to me, apart from the great smart-ass lyrics (the reason why this album didn't get one star). This album misses the infectious harmonies, the ultra-catchy, anthemic melodies and simple guitar accompaniment, which made the first album so great. They think fewer hooks and fewer catchy melodies can be compensated with bombastic kitsch (like the syrupy Prom Theme or Fine Day For a Parade), which simply doesn't work. They just don't sound as fresh as on their debut album.."},{"rating":"2","title":"So close to being a masterpiece like the first album.","review":"When I was 12, my brother had the first Fountains of Wayne CD. I loved it when he played it in his car, and I got instantly addicted. Since then, I have been waiting a couple of years to buy their new CD, and now that I have it, I am not disappointed.The opener, \\"Utopia Parkway\\" is a good song to start with, and it sets the mood for the CD. My favorites are \\"Denise\\", \\"Troubled Times\\", and \\"The Valley of Malls\\". Some other good songs are \\"Lost in Space\\" and the catchy \\"Red Dragon Tattoo\\". Utopia Parkway is so close to being a 5 star album. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because its not as instantly catchy as the first album that put songs in your head for months. Still, this CD is great, and if you find it, buy it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this band","review":"I came across this band when a friend played \\"Please don't rock me tonight\\" for me, and I was completely hooked. I bought their debut album right away, and it was one of my greatest joys of the summer of '97. When UP came out I didn't buy it right away, but when I heard \\"Amity gardens\\" I knew I had to have this album too. Come on you guys, that is the song that stands out the most, even if Troubled times, A Fine day for a parade and Valley of malls also are great! And as a whole I think this album is better than their debut one. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can anyone say Shoes?","review":"What a pleasant surprise it was to hear this trip down memory lane. And I'm not talking the Beatles. I'm talking about Shoes, that premier power pop band from Zion, Illinois. Oh sure, they mine the same pop vein as Fountains of Wayne do, but man, FOW sounds an awful lot like Shoes.I don't think you can get Shoes stuff anymore except in cutout bins or through mail order outlets. So, don't miss out on this first rate album. They guys sing and play their hearts out.I especially liked \\"Hat and Feet\\", and was \\"Troubled Times\\" a perfect song to go on the Dawson's Creek soundtrack or what? Too bad they didn't have the foresight to choose it.Good stuff, just in time for summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"groovy pop gems, vol.2","review":"this album sports a meatier, more updated sound than their self-titled debut, but all the hooks are still there. \\"troubled times\\", \\"hat and feet\\", and \\"amity gardens\\" are ultra-tasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track # 2 is in the TV show \\"Kingdom Hospital\\"","review":"The Stephen King ABC miniseries \\"Kingdom Hospital\\" has a song playing when the van strikes the jogger on the side of the road.

For me, I hear first wave British Invasion tunes from the likes of Donovan, the Zombies, and even Herman's Hermits. Couple those musical roots with inspired lyrical turns of phrase and you have a very winsome combination. The music and lyrics are nostalgic and on a few occasions seem to veer a little too far into sentimentality. However, if that is the worst of its faults, you can call Utopia Parkway a very good recording indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed out....","review":"I've been waiting for another release from FoW since their prior release, and I must say that I am sadly disapointed.This album does not have a \\"Radiation Vibe\\" or \\"Leave the Biker\\" type of song anywhere near it. Instead, its boring, boring, boring.I would urge everyone to not purchase this album and donate the money to your favorite charity instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash (not in the good way)","review":"This album is just incredibly bad, and features some of the lamest \\"hooks\\" I've ever heard. Not to mention horrible radio production. From what I'd read I thought I was in for a real treat, but I was so wrong. Shame I wasted that 12 bucks. If you want some real pop music check out the Vaselines, Beat Happening, Smiths, or Buzzcocks but please, please, please pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Phenomenal Power Pop Masteriece!!","review":"If you were around in the late '70's (like me) and were blown away by Nick Lowe's \\"Pure Pop for Now People,\\" make room for \\"Utopia Parkway.\\" This is easily one of the best things I've heard in years. Sounds like the album Lowe would have made in the 70's if he had grown up in Long Island with the Ramones as his cousins. Listen once and you'll listen all day.

A great show by a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We've all driven down Utopia Parkway.","review":"Utopia Parkway sums up, in a similar fashion to the first album, the simple things of life today. Being in love (that type of teenage love that blisters before fading), having a crush, searching for purpose, and even alittle insight that shows a flash of maturity in the pan with Go, Hippie but that maturity soon disappears on the next track much to my liking. Fountains of Wayne's latest release is the antibiotic to all the depressing nonesense out there today. Red Dragon Tattoo is perhaps the best song they have ever wrote but all the tracks on this CD are quality. Put this album on along with the self-titled debut and you've got an afternoon well spent. This album is one you could listen to cover to cover. It isn't deep and you won't have to think, just cruise along Utopia Parkway. You definitely get your moneies worth. If you only pick-up 7 albums this summer this should be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early lack of dialogue halts momentum","review":"This book is important to Canada because it represents an authentic view of small-town life in the pre-WW1 era. The novel focuses on Canada's economic and political link with England and religious issues. It also features 2 romances, the highlight of the novel.Unfortunately, this novel is neither 'lively' (as one early review stated) nor engaging by today's standards. Duncan's contrived view of the Murchisons and their world is difficult because one is constatly reminded that one is reading a novel. Duncan's characters act and do, they do not feel, think, or emote. The characters, plot, and setting are all contrivances that convey a subtly ironic, political message.In sum, I doubt very many people would be will to read this book for enjoyment nowadays, although it is still of Canadian historical importance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible meter","review":"Get any other meter but the true Track if you can help it.

We often compared them to other meters and to the meter we have in the clinic. the True Track meters usually (but not always) read 10-20% higher than the other meters, and occasionally read 30-40% higher. Occasionally they agreed with the other meters, but not nearly often enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inaccurate results","review":"I have been using the TrueTrack meter for almost a month. I kept wondering why my home results were so different than those of my doctor. So, we double tested in the office. This meter was anywhere from 125 to 200 mg/dl off! And that was the range of deviation from the real reading with the same blood sample tested three times within two minutes. The bad results resulted in Somogyi rebounds.Also, I constantly received errors with the monitor, and their customer service was useless.The device also shuts off quickly; so if you have to re-stick, you're going to have to restart the device. I even had it shut down while the test strip was sucking up the blood, which they are slow to do.Overall, I would give this negative five stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor accuracy","review":"I have been testing for 15 years. I recently switched to the True Test becaue the strips are cheaper. The results I got were amazingly varied. Test results were 25 to 50 points different minutes apart and I am very careful to wash hands, and follow exact directions. I took it back, got a refund and went back to a name brand. My results are now consistent. This whole industry is ripping us off on test strip prices, in my opinion, but I need accuracy. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you in the house alone?","review":"This book was on the fifth grade reading list at my sons school. Thinking it was a mystery he would enjoy, I purchased it for him. I was shocked to discover that it was about the rape of a young girl by a rich boy in her community. Then, not only is she raped by this boy, but also by society who would not allow her to press charges and see justice done. Why? Because he came from wealth and people wouldn't believe that he would have done such a thing. I feel that this book gives the message that young girls should not even bother to try and get help if wrongs have been done to them. This is the opposite message that we are telling them everyday, tell, tell, tell! Some one will help you. I found this book very disturbing reading for 5th to 8th grade readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was bad.","review":"I admit that i am not big on reading but i love to get involved in a some what scary book. anyway,as an 8th grader i found this book very, very disturbing.

How could someone read a book about a girl that is being stalked and raped and find it interresting (not to mention she cant press charges because of money issues). It kind of makes me wonder about the socity i'm growing up in. i was very dissapointed in this book and would never read it again.

Tamarkin's book lays it all out -- the dirt (and some of the stories are really hilarious) as well as the genius of this seminal '60s band.Unlike a lot of tell-all \\"Behind the Music\\"-style exposes, this author clearly loves -- and understands -- the music. It's just that he also gets the people who made it, and often made a mess in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history lesson","review":"I've always loved the music of the early Airplane, but I didn't know much about the people in the group, their history and what they were about.

In normal mode it will play the songs you heard on shuffle and when done it will start playing the songs in alphabetical order. Nice arm band and button design. Bad design for installing battery and SD cards. Have to take the top off every time for both. Battery has a sliding lock bar which is a pain to get in position. Expected a lot more from Memorex.

Most phones with this feature have a light that eluminated so you don't have to get within 1 foot of the phone to see if you have a message.This phone didn't come with a short wall-mount cord.

I plan to get a different phone and put this phone in a spare room where I don't have to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great phone!","review":"We needed a CORDED phone because the kids keep leaving the cordless in the basement or under piles of clothes somewhere.

There aren't many out there. I respected the Panasonic name but what I got was awful. First, I hung it on the wall but I couldn't read the display while I was standing next to it. I had to stoop down to about 5 feet above the floor to read the display. To program the phone I had to get a chair and sit in it to perform the program. That's when the big problem was discovered.The LCD is about three lines tall. But only half of the middle line was \\"lighting\\" up. The LCD was busted! I waited a week for this? So far the Amazon return process has been friendly, but I dread looking for another phone.Other drawbacks: no short cable for wall mounting, no free AA batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponted","review":"I really like panasonic phones in general - I have 2 cordless phones & an answering machine which are panasonic. When I went looking for a corded phone with caller id, I was excited to find this one - the size and design were exactly what I was looking for. However, the display is difficult to read unless you're standing above it and the caller id feature is lacking. Specifically, I found that I cannot recognize cell phone numbers - it displays them as \\"out of area\\" with no number attached to them. By contrast, my other panasonic cordless phone displays \\"out of area\\" AND the phone number for cell phones. This is important because I like to distinguish between telemarkets and my friends with cell phones. With this phone, I can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and made to last","review":"I bought this and I am 6'5\\" 240 lbs and just went to Anza Borrego on a short getaway. I found this to be not only well made and easy to set up, it is also very comfortable and large enough to fit my large frame. There are some reviews commenting on the other smaller versions as flimsy or not supportive of weight - this one I can tell you that it supports me a larger human no problem. I heard in other reviews that their customer support is very good, I just got through resolving a problem with a spot light with Black & Decker....what a nightmare! Anyway, good product and well built, a little pricey but I think it should last a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've given more credence to the reviews...","review":"I read the reviews and they were fairly split. I read reviews on other sites and they seemed to be more in favor than opposed. I bought this for my boyfriend who is about 220lbs and 6' 4\\" for his birthday. We opened it in the dining room and it seemed to be an easy set up. He laid on it to \\"try it out\\" and we packed it up for him to take camping. He left for his camping weekend and upon first use, the bar supporting the hammock broke. It's unfortunate that it was poorly constructed because he was very excited to receive this and it was a good size for his larger frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment - Broke on 2nd Use","review":"I do NOT recommend buying this Hammock. I bought it for my son who weighs just 145lbs (it's suppose to hold up to 300lbs) and it broke the second time he used it. We are now past the 30-day return period, but I am hoping Amazon will come through and refund the entire amount of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I bought this item for my husband for Christmas. After carefully reading reviews I chose the larger hammock because it was reputed to be sturdier. Sadly, though my husband is well under the weight limit on this one, the hammock collapsed while he was on it. I admit the huge laugh we got out of that moment was priceless but still, we decided it wasn't a good purchase and sent it back. Good for a laugh but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hammock review","review":"This product was very disappointing. The rack construction is not very good.

I was so excited. It states if is for 300 lbs. Well I weigh 207 and it did not hold my weight. It was a piece of junk. I laid on it with no problem, I got off my 8 year old got on it(watching him the whole time). He got off and I got back on it and it broke.I am so sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy!","review":"So I bought this even though it just barely fit my criteria. The user reviews where almost 50/50 good/bad. I am glad I went with my gut. The hammock arrived and I had it set up after 10 minutes. Most of that was spent unwrapping it from packing material. I border on the 300 pound weight limit, but it held me just fine, even when my cocker spaniel jumped up with me.A couple of notes from things I read on earlier comments. They now include a extra couple of links of chain in the packing. This made is so much easier to string up the first time. The instructions clearly state these should only be used until the material was broken in. Honestly after laying in it twice I didn't need them anymore and could use the O rings.The stiching seems much improved. Other than the sounds of cracking on the first lay down nothing bad happened. Supported me just fine.I look forward to using this on many camping trips and on my deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I did some research on portable hammocks. I chose this one due to some good reviews and really did not pay too much attention on the bad ones. Big mistake! After reading the other bad reviews, I pretty much had the same experience. I was excited when it was delivered. I opened the box, followed the instructions, and seemed to work well the first time. I was able to lay on it and relaxed. A little difficult folding it back but got the hang of it after awhile. I was looking forward to using it again one sunny Saturday afternoon but the folding frame just collapsed right after I set it up and laid on it. I will try to call Swimways Customer Service to see if they would replace it. Otherwise, I will just have to go through the hassle of returning the product. I will continue to look for other more reliable products out there. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric Ripped After Slight Use","review":"This product was a gift that we gave. After three months of LIGHT use, we attended a party where this hammock was used. Someone laid in it and the fabric ripped and sent the user to the ground. After inspection it appears as though it was the fabric stitching pulling and then finally tearing. Very embarrassing as I thought I purchased a half-way decent hammock.This is a low quality hammock which I don't think anyone would find a use for as the quality is so too low. The life of the hammock after light use is about a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to set up; hammock did not fit support structure","review":"Was delighted to receive this hammock as a Christmas Gift. However, we were unable to set it up. We followed the directions (starting setup over several times in case we missed some small detail.) Went online and viewed Kelysus video on set up as well. Each time was the same result. The hammock could not connect between the two attachment points. Measured the hammock -- seemed to be appropriate for the description. Made the assumption that the manufacturer used wrong parts for the support structure that resulted in the support structure being too long.Return to Amazon was easy with a quick refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kelsyus XL hammock - trouble setting it up, not very comfy","review":"I bought at Costco due to attractive price. I am pretty handy but I could not stretch the hammock enough to connect to the hooks on either end. I then took the arc supports out of the hammock to see if then it would stretch but then not only did it not stretch enough from end to end but I could not get the arc support back in their pockets.I ended up cutting 1\\" off each arc support and am now quite satisfied...plus I used an extra S hook on hand to make the hammock more comfy.Not enough time on it yet to make an evaluation on comfort and durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"hammock","review":"The stand is great,but the hammock ? I damn near touch my chest with my knees.Luckily I have a friend with a sewing machine so I can fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the DISCO albums so far.....","review":"This album in the DISCO series of remix albums for PSB has to be one of their best. POSITIVE ROLE MODEL and the Blank and Jones remix of HOME AND DRY have to be the best ones on this disc. Yes, the album RELEASE was a bit of a let down, but Tennant and Lowe try to make up for it here. The only disappointing thing about this EP is that it was just too short. They should have gone on and made it into a full-length album of danceable hits. Oh well, we will take what we can get! I just hope that the new songs MIRACLES and FLAMBOYANT from the overseas release POPART will make their way Stateside on the next PSB US release. Until then, enjoy DISCO 3. It's a good dance compilation....sure to get those feet hoppin' in the clubs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Disco Release!","review":"Die hard fans and techno-pop enthusiasts should love this album. It's another new version of a Disco album. The first contained 6 extended mixes, the second was a DJ mix so this one tries to shoot a little towards the middle but turns out more like an album with some remixes and previously unreleased material on it. The remixes are good and so are new songs but they all carry the trademark Pet Shop Boys sound; if you're a fan (like I am) you'll love this CD. If you're not or you're new to the boys I would recommend checking out their Very album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awful, not wonderful","review":"A bit of a disappointment when compared with previous PSB albums. The album previous to this, \\"Release\\", took a while to grow on to me, and while some of its songs still don't work, most of the album is quite enjoyrable. This follow up to \\"Release\\" is more of a disappointment than a joy. PSB has more talent than this, and are losing touch with their trademark successful dance formula of the past.This is better than \\"Disco 2\\", which was a disaster. But the original \\"Disco\\" was amazing. PSB had the potential to surpass the brilliance of \\"Disco\\" with \\"Disco 3\\", but they failed to deliver.And to top off the disappointment, this is wrapped in one of those cheap cardboard covers that should only be used for singles, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Disco 3\\" Lacks Groove","review":"An album for die-hard fans only. Although the title is \\"Disco,\\" I find it difficult to believe any of these songs would pull someone to the dance floor. (I guess most of these tracks, recorded during the \\"Release\\" sessions, were omitted from that disc for a reason.) While the extended mix of \\"Here\\" is a solid addition, much of the album tries to pass off endless electronic bleeps and burps as groove-enducing. Instead, it's like listening to a parade of dub mixes; vocals are lacking on many of the songs. When did the Boys lose their sense of melody? Flacid is probably an apt album description. While the album is priced to sell, I recommend you save your money and pull out one of the old PSB discs instead. Two thumbs definitely down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Efforts","review":"If you have all their previous singles, like LONDON, HOME AND DRY or you own most of their albums, like I do as a great fan since 1986. However, this EP is rather disappointing.Get it ONLY if you REALLY have to. Otherwise, forget it. Get those singles. The special remixes for SEXY NORTHENER (Superchumbo Mix) and LONDON (Thee Radikal Blaklite Edit) are BIG disappointment. Don't be fool by these 2 remixes which we can get them else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Shop Boys Release a Bad Sequel","review":"Neil Tennant and \\"the boys\\" have really lost it. Their last two albums, \\"Nightlife\\" and \\"Release\\" have been a gradual downslide to this complete rock-bottom bad-sequel release \\"Disco 3.\\" From a group that has released dance tunes over the years with such great tracks as \\"Absolutely Fabulous,\\" \\"So Hard,\\" etc., this new album sounds void of melody, inspiration, and substance. They're no longer \\"boys\\" as their title suggests. There is only one gem on this release, the last track, a piano version of the song \\"London\\" from the \\"Release\\" album. But, the rest of the water is sterile, trancey and devoid of any of the character that PSB once displayed. As a long time fan, I'm extremely disappointed. \\"Disco 2\\" was great, but version three is just a bad sequel. I recommend PSB's album \\"Very\\" and especially the re-release version with a Disc 2 of remixes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dull night of club music...","review":"What a snore...where are the great catchy pop tunes I know these guys are capable of?

The Boys are brilliant, but you'd never know if from this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance Mix","review":"This is a pretty good dance mix, even though I'd prefer songs with more lyrics.

I give one star for this album due to the fact that I am a die hard fan of them.Buy it only if you NEED to collect all PSB ablums like I do.Other than that, this is a boring album. Best track will be HOME and DRY (Black&JonesMix), which can be found one its single and limited edition of RELEASE.Totally disappointed of this \\"DANCE\\" album.

The songs are upbeat and every one is dance-floor ready. But the big selling point is that they have released an album appropriately enough in the midst of the 80's electro-clash revival - but it's not new for them - this is the music they've always done until recently with ho-hum releases like \\"Bilingual\\", \\"Nightlife\\", and \\"Release\\". This is a fad that the Pet Shop Boys started themselves, and it sounds just as good now as it did in the 80's, if not better. In my opinion, the best track on the album is \\"Somebody Elses Business\\". It's nice to have \\"Positive Role Model\\" on a CD finally, as it has become something of a new cult favorite among a lot of dance clubs. Basically, this is THE DEFINITIVE Pet Shop Boys album and is a pure joy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only Some Albums Were As Long","review":"Clocking in at almost 60 minutes long, the new Pet Shop Boys' \\"e.p.\\" Disco 3, runs longer than most albums I've heard as of late. What's more, is that Disco 3 isn't just a release of remixes; the five of which are done very well. Disco 3 also contains five \\"new\\" songs, a couple of which are almost twenty years old...they have since evolved to what you hear on D3. Positive Role Model, which was available as an mp3 on the bands website in early 2001, brings the boys back to basics. Those of you who were disappointed with last years \\"Release\\" should find Disco 3 a welcome \\"return to form\\" though as The Pet Shop Boys would be the first to say, it can't be a come back if you never left."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unrelentless display of pure adrenaline","review":"Origin continue there technical death metal assault with echoes of decimation, there third release and arguably there best to date.

There are so many significant grammar errors, disorganized and under-developed paragraphs, confusing transitions, and badly-identified quotations that at times I simply could not follow the text.

Mclusky lead a thunderstorm of sound. The lead singer sounds like a mutation of Black Francis, John Lydon, and Bon Scott. Steve Albini tightens and filters the production into a punk-fueled frenzy as he has done with many others before. Mclusky offer what many hard-punk bands lack these days -- a sense of humour.

In the introduction, he made it certain to the readerwhat he wasn't going to do, which was the entire history of the Ottaman Empire. What he does is clear up some misconceptions about the old Turkish Empire, and how they related to developments in Western Europe. If you want a defininitive book on the Turkish Empire, you should read Lord Kinross's The Ottoman Centuries or Palmer's book. Wheatcroft relates the images of the Lustful Turk, and discards those images into the trash can. What emerges is a very conservative Islamic society trying to cope with the West and not being very successful at it. The Sick Man of Europe did indeed die, but for the after effects read David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I liked this book a lot. This vivid narrative really brings the Ottomans to life and paints a colorful pictures of their interesting and (to westerners) exotic culture.

This fits very nicely between the meditative trance that is \\"Rubycon\\" and the more urgent feeling of \\"Stratosfear.\\" The thing that amazes me most is that this almost feels like a jam session that is well orchestrated. The feelings of all three members come right to the surface, but it doesn't seem like a collection of noise at all. It took a few listens, and the right frame of mind to properly appreciate this album, but when it finally blooms, it hits you full force.

Td is trully ahead of their time and this early live concert is a living testament to that. Richocet stands out as one of TDs best live release.

I'm sure I have aided in more wealth for the author, but perhaps by writing about Mr. Stewart he has learned about the core of a true gentleman. The typos were numerous...bad writing and bad editing. But, I did receive tremendous pleasure in reading the remarks by Judy Stewart Harcourt. Her father must be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only one pleasure in this book","review":"This book was published just a few months after Jimmy Stewart's death. It seems to have been researched and written in a manner of weeks - so quickly that they didn't even catch all of the typos - and that quick work resulted in a badly written book. Jarring references to popular icons such as Kate Moss, Sylvester Stallone, and Aaron Spelling run throughout the book and detract from the reading experience. Sanello seems to be attempting to draw in a younger audience by using such references, but he merely suceeded in annoying me. Written like a freshman's first English essay, with slightly less attention paid to form, the only reason I would recommend this book is for the brief glimpse, although badly presented, it gives of a great man's life"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the copy-editor??","review":"This book was the pits!! Sanello was in such a rush to cash in on Mr. Stewart's death, that he did not even bother to proof-read the text. The story jumps from year to year, story to story in no reasonable order. His unsubstantiated views and opinions were intermingled between news clippings, and \\"reported\\" conversations. And to top it off, the same misguided passages are repeated throughout! My only regret: that I finished the book. But, unfortuantely, there were no books left on the shelf, and I am too big a fan of James Stewart. Next time I will know to stay away from an \\"instant book.\\" Mr. Stewart would be rolling in his grave if he knew of this trash bearing his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you buy this? Much better alternatives.","review":"I would avoid this 'mission control' headsets for a number of reasons, especially since there are a number of alternatives. First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap. If you want more comfort and really plan to use this device, go with the Plantronics M175 -- I think it is worth the price difference and have used multiple units over the past 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this!!","review":"I've spent a lot of time on the phone handling medical bills from my baby's heart surgery, while wrangling the 6,5,3 and 1 year olds around the house.

From the time I took these out of the package, they came apart in my hands. Every one of them. I can try snapping the different pieces together again, but they don't stay.

If your laptop is sitting in one place all the time, it will probably be fine, but if you plan on having your laptop move around while you are connected, then forget it.

Thank you Craig"},{"rating":"2","title":"New York City Draft Riots, 1863","review":"Anyone who saw the movie \\"Gangs of New York\\" will recall the scenes of the draft riots taking place. Of course, in the movie the riots were just a small part of the plot, and you really didn't get the full horror of them, or the human toll they took on the City's inhabitants. This excellent book gives the reader the \\"up close and personal\\" view of the Draft Roits, by focusing on the lives of several people caught up in them in one way or another. The writing is profoundly moving, and every scene is poignant, particularly the ones that occur in Ireland during the Great Famine. The characters are all finely drawn, and the research that went into this book is clearly evident on every page. It's a very good way to get your American history lesson about the Riots while absorbing a very human drama of strife and tragedy. This is a book I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"First of all, let me say that I would give this four and one half stars, if that were an option. In my opinion, this novel falls a bit short in historical fiction, not fully enlightening the reader on what New York City was like in the 1860's, and a bit short as to why the Civil War draft protests occurred, and their impact. That said, what this novel does provide, is an excellent plot, with a host of well developed and interesting characters. The writer's style goes from current events, and then throughout the novel, back in time, often character by character, to learn how these characters came to their current situation. The author does an outstanding job of this, which I found rather unique. What I found most entertaining is the various subplots the story delves into - overcoming poverty and adversity, racial and ethnic prejudice, love & sex, crime and violence, and some suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"top 20 worst novel","review":"It is really difficult to understand how such a poorly constructed book would receive critical acclaim. Improbable events occur on a regular basis...people are casually murdered just so the author does not to explain a box he has written himself into.Do not read this under any circumatances."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was no paradise.","review":"My favorite books contain historical settings and facts, and this book is a winner. It opened the door to a new understanding of the history of the irish in New York, and was a great read as a novel as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read on an obscure subject","review":"I was nervous picking up this book, since I thought the movie \\"Gangs of New York\\" was awful. Paradise Alley was exceptional. The text was a nice read, easy to understand, and a real page-turner. The characters are mostly simple folks, except for Robinson, who almost seems to be wishing he was a more simple man. The characters were not perfect, but they were all very believable. Johnny Dolan is a truly evil character. He was a gruesome person who did gruesome things. But he was believable, not in a Freddy or Jason slasher-movie way. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some knowledge, on a subject which has sliped from most history books, while still being entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise Alley - An excellent look at NYC during the 1860's","review":"I just finished Kevin Baker's \\"Paradise Alley\\". It's historical fiction about the New York Draft Riots during the Civil War. He cites as a reference the book \\"Gangs of New York\\" upon which the movie of the same name is based. Baker's goal was to portray an accurate account of the events. His goal definitely was not revisionism!The book is 600+ pages long and it tends to drag a little in spots but it is well worth the read. Baker uses the (sometimes maddening) device of each chapter being a viewpoint of one of the principle characters for some event. So when three folks witness a major event, you can bet you're going to read about the event three times.Be advised that the book is quite graphic in its descriptions of war and the riots...not for the faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum History","review":"How to dumb down an exciting period of New York City history into an indigestible overly bloated piece of tripe. Could not find empathy with any of the one-dimensional characters. The author played the race-card ad nauseum-boy, do I hate a non-stop sermon. Tried flipping pages in an attempt to find one portion of the book that would be entertaining-it doesn't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this novel (especially having paid the publisher's price for the hardcover edition). The plot is hackneyed, totally predictable and goes on and on, the author repeating himself. The characters are one-dimensional and unimaginative. The author needs to learn how to write dialogue. AND...what are all those italics about??? Save your money and your time. Read Gotham instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good selection.","review":"Paradise Alley is a book that should not be refered to by Kevin Bakers as a \\"Hisotrical Novel.\\" First of all, the book is dry and to long. The author does not get up to what the real meaning of the book, the 1863 New York Draft Riots, until page 350 and above. Before the pages to the riot, the author is developing the characters, which is nice to know the people at first hand, but in the end it was to drawn out. Then the riots begin. From this point, it does not get any better. By reading the last 300 or so pages, it was unclear what the author was trying to pass onto the reader. It felt like Baker was not getting down to what the riots was about and the major impact it had on New York City. He did not show the reader that this riots was the worest in the U.S. history. Baker just writes about the riots as if it was a small and insignificant riot. He could have done a better job. I would not recommend this book for a study or even a over view of the 1863 NY draft riot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much depravity for me","review":"I like a good romance with heroic characters, but this book had too much depravity for me. I'm not sure why the villains needed to be perverts, but I certainly don't want to read about their disgusting proclivities. The story would have been great without this foray into the world of S&M. There are some things that I would rather not know about let alone read graphic descriptions of!(I also objected to the character that ran an S&M brothel being portrayed in a positive light!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lead characters and imaginative story.","review":"Mary Jo Putney is better than any romance author I know at creating unique and exciting characters for each of her books. I particularly loved Lucien and Kit in this book. Lucien will be familiar to readers of the Fallen Angel series as the group's mysterious and aloof spymaster. While investigating the Hellfire Club he repeatedly runs into an elusive woman who appears in a variety of guises and to whom he is immediately attracted. Unlike many heros in romance novels, he is not a rake which makes his attraction to the mystery woman even more compelling. Lucien eventually discovers that the woman is \\"Kit\\" Travers and unravels her story - she is searching for her lost twin. The adventure that follows is very imaginative and unique, and the romance is particularly poignant.All of the Fallen Angels stand on their own very well - you can start with this one or with any one in the series. Be forewarned - once you start you'll want to have them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"summer","review":"I choose this book because I read the book One Fat Summer and it was a good book. Summer Rules is a sequel to One Fat Summer, so I thought it would be good too. However I really didn't like Summer Rules. It was confusing at some parts and I didn't like the word choice. There were a lot ofSwears.It's about a sixteen year old named Bobby Marks. He goes to Happy Valley Day Camp and hasa bratty ten year old kid to watch out for, but he can't be mean or strict because it's the camp owner'sson. Bobby meets a girl that he likes. It is confusing because there are so many characters, it is hard to keep track and it swears too much.If you like the way the book sounds, you can read it. But if you read it you might not like it becauseIt's too confusing or it swears too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"What can I say? I feel so humbled by this video.

And the Rage song here has to be one of, if not their best one. And the Deftones rock here, as well as Lunatic Calm, Manson,and the remix of Dragula horrible. Some of the techno here is OK, mostly because it's not meaningless acid techno with some crummy drum beats. Ministry rocks on this album, too.

The CD is great for those like me who won't necessarily buy a Marilyn Manson CD, but who enjoy mixes of interesting and not radio-played singles. (Is there a decent radio station in Los Angeles?

The original score is nothing next to, say, Bernard Hermann (composer for, among many others, \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Taxi Driver\\") or John Barry (the Bond theme, but also \\"The Ipcress File\\", \\"Out Of Africa\\", and other haunting stuff), in fact it's pretty close to a mindless Strauss ripoff, but it's still better than suffering through the techno/industrial/metal dross that pollutes this CD.Don't buy this album; they're already out there like toadstools, pop compilations that hope to cruise on a movie's success and make the conglomerate even richer.

Why in hell include a song by Annie Lennox with the score? Well, Hollywood decided that the solution was to make an album of mostly unrelated songs.The Matrix is another such case. Only about half the album is bearable, and of those six songs I can remember only three from the movie (plus the credits song by Rage Against The Machine). The pieces by Rob D and Prodigy almost make the album worth buying, but the rest of the dreck really drag it down.

Probably the most disappointing thing about the CD is the fact that they left out the song that Neo is listening to when Trinity first contacts him. It was a Technology flick and they didn't even add any goodies for the PC user. I am simply disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony Postmodernity","review":"Let me clarify up-front: \\"The Matrix\\" will become one of the first movies credited with bringing the philosophical construct of post-modernity well packaged to the ignorant masses; the soundtrack will not.The movie is highly post-modern; the music is not. The soundtrack simply does not match the creativity and contextual relativity best manifested in the true underground scene. Why the filmmakers selected (Manson) and his phony noise for the soundtrack music is beyond comprehension.The movie had much better fared with unpretentious, high energy hard trance and trance music from Detroit, Amsterdam, or Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"Hard Rock\\" to be a good CD","review":"If there were more music and less noise (like Manson), this could have been a winner.

Usually when you buy a soundtrack from a movie, there are one, or if you're lucky two songs on it that you like. But on this CD, I liked ALL of them. Possibly the best song is #4, \\"Clubbed to Death\\" by Rob D. It's a wonderful instrumental. The rest of the songs on the CD are quite good too, ranging from the best of Marilyn Manson to the best of Rage Against the Machine and Rob Zombie. This CD is one of the best ever, so if your taste in music goes for the darker, heavier side, this CD is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"There is good stuff on here. I actually love the instrumentals best of all. And, incidentally, I was listening the a classical station the other day, and the melody that goes in and out of \\"Clubbed to Death\\" came on! It was some old classical song, like Mozart or something. I wish I caught the composer. Anyway, the credit for this melody isn't given on the CD liner. So, anyway, you are listening to a classcial music riff when listening to that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANYONE CURIOUS ABOUT ROB D?","review":"Well, I'll make this my final review for this CD. I believe Ihave done my part in keeping The Matrix hype going. This Cd isfantastic, one of my favorites.

There is a series of Curious George books, but each is a stand-alone book. It's also nice to have children's books that aren't just empty stories used to push a toy line. The original 7 Curious George books seem to be more popular with most kids, so start with those (Curious George, Curious George Takes a Job, Curious George Rides a Bike, Curious George Gets A Medal, Curious George Flies a Kite, Curious George Learns the Alphabet, Curious George Goes to the Hospital).

I will admit though, they are quite clever for a typically base gerne, but with just one straight up form of expression I quickly become bored. I should have noticed the Relapse logo on the back.Having followed Relapse previously with bands like Neurosis and Halo, I know this record company will say just about anything to sell their little cds.

Better alternatives","review":"I would avoid this 'mission control' headsets for a number of reasons, especially since there are a number of alternatives. First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap. If you want more comfort and really plan to use this device, go with the Plantronics M175 -- I think it is worth the price difference and have used multiple units over the past 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Cheap price, funky color.

The cradle does. Well, I discovered that the earphone jack on the Clix doubles as an auxillary port, so the cradle is not needed for listening to music through the stereo speakers on my stereo. Then I thought maybe the speakers on the cradle might come in handy at some point. However, the sound from the cradle speakers is B-A-D. The only functionality I will get from the cradle is the snooze function. Bad deal! You can buy a really good alarm clock for much less. Save your money on this one.

Not only is it action packed (from beginning to end), comical at times and fantastic to watch (location wise); it is one of my favorite love stories. The connection between Elisabeth Shue's and Val Kilmer's character is amazingly stunning. Anyone in their right mind would appeal to their chemistry. However, I personally feel that one other thing should be mentioned; the movie score. Simply amazing! Graeme Revell (who has done the score to such movies as \\"The Crow\\" and \\"Strange Days\\" overwhelms with this score as it is enchantingly beautiful and definitely one of my favorites. In conclusion, this movies has everything that a movies should have and it is so underrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"I always enjoy Val Kilmer in a role like this.

His newest mission is to get the recipe for \\"Cold Fusion\\", energy, precisely. Along the way he meetsthe gorgeous Elizabeth Shue, a scientist who has invented the recipe.

Kilmer and Shue are good together, they act in sync with each other, which I really like because otherwise the plot may be good but you don't see a connection with the characters. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is so strong, and I do not see why the critics reviews did not like this movie. This movie is a keeper, I am going to put it in my collection of favorite movies.I really like the scenery and the neat gadgets that Kilmer's character, Simon Templar, had. The love story between the characters is what grabbed my attention from the beginning of the movie. The way that Kilmer's character could change his appearance, and his accents was interesting too. The dialogue was good, and there was also a good balance of suspense and romance in the movie. There was the right about of both to make this movie one of my favorites. In my opinion this movie has 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Romantic","review":"I enjoyed watching this spy thriller again after 13 years. What a great escape for an hour or two. Thoroughly enjoyed the various disguises and thought Val Kilmer did a fabulous job. Romance was sweet and exciting. Villans were corrupt and relentless.

Also because of the great actors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent spy flick","review":"A great spy movie. Great add to the shelf for relatively unknown releases. Easily Kilmer's best. Unpredicatable plot, good casting, and Kilmer's dusguises and language impersonations are second to none. Hey, it's not the Roger Moore Bond level movie, but definitely keeps you from looking at your watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saint","review":"Simon Templar has no real family, no real home and Simon Templar isn't even his real name. Yet Simon Templar , also known as the Saint for his use of creating false identities using the names of Catholic saints,is one of the world's most successful thieves. Slick, debonair and a master of disguise, Simon manages to outwit the police again and again. On his next job Simon is hired by the Russian Mafia to steal a cold fusion energy formula from scientist Emma Russel, however the mission backfires as he falls for the pretty, intelligent scientist. Simon and his new love must now manage to outwit the Russian Mafia and work out the energy formula before the worst happens and the US is affected forever. I liked this movie. Not as \\"The Saint\\" but as an elaborate action movie with a twist. Val Kilmer bears nothing in him that even gets close to Roger Moore's character, but if you look away from that and try to see it as an ordinary movie, it's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungodly, to say the least.","review":"To be fair, this film would have been quite nice if it hadn't claimed to be about Charteris' character Simon Templar (alias The Saint). For anyone who's ever read any Saint novels, Noyce's characterization of Mr. Templar leaves a lot to be desired. It's as if James Bond were portrayed as an unshaven hoodlum who drank cheap beer and didn't iron his Sea Island cotton shirts.The techno-gadgetry was nice, but the Saint would have eschewed such gauchery and walked in the front door and said \\"Give me the chip, Algernon.\\"The best part is the car horn, playing the motif from the old Saint TV series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the most saintly of professions","review":"Val Kilmer actually pulls off being an international man of mystery and soldier for hire. He has come a long way from playing Ice Man on Top Gun. Taking various aliases complete with international passports and identities ... the coy and colorful character falls for a scientist .... while dealing with the Russian mafia. My favorite scene is when Elisabeth Shue runs towards the American Embassy in Moscow and is pulled into the gates by the Marines guarding the entrance."},{"rating":"1","title":"By any other name","review":"I just wrote a scathing review of the \\"I Spy\\" movie, grouping it with the worst of the television-to-big-screen productions. Among those I included \\"The Saint\\" and realized that I hadn't warned the unwary about this movie. Tom Keogh's review describes the problem with this movie perfectly. It might be an OK espionage movie but it's a miserable treatment of Simon Templar, as anyone would know who is familiar with Leslie Charteris' knight errant. Where Val Kilmer uses goofy disguises to accomplish his task, Simon Templar would brazenly face the villian with the dare to thwart his imminent undoing. George Sanders and Roger Moore were superior as Simon Templar and enjoyed the benefit of superior writers if not Leslie Charteris, himself. Sadly, who ever sold the rights to this property was only seeing the dollar signs. Simon Templar should have paid them a visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another angry Saint fan","review":"Sad.

Practically James Bond without the gadgets. A couple of weeks ago I finally watched The Saint with Val Kilmer. The reason I wasnt too crazy about the movie was the fact that Kilmer's character resembled nothing of the Roger Moore character. Roger Moore was debanoir, suave and knew what he was doing. Kilmer was sometimes not believable and was also in different disguises. The Roger Moore character was never in disguise and to the best of my knowledge, the George Sanders character was not also. However, I give the movie credit for establishing a plot that gets a little outrageous. Fair movie, but watch the Roger Moore show if you like the Simon Templar character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saint it Aint","review":"Leslie Charteris, the Saint's creator, never lived to see this completed, which is probably a relief to him as it's not very good. Kilmer is about as English as a Cadillac and the Saint is very English, that's the hole point of him. You wouldn't like an Englishman playing Columbo now would you! Bring back Ian Ogilvy, or Roger Moore, and learn what the Saint is really about>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Val Kilmer is so smooth!","review":"I loved this movie. It is not complete fantasy though, Val Kilmer's character is not your average untouchable action hero. He does make mistakes. He is one of the world's top thieves and is also a master of disguise, but this causes trouble for him early in the movie. He steals a cold fusion formula from a scientist played by Elisabeth Shue and has to choose stealing the formula over his love for Shue. He has to steal the formula because she would be hunted down if a humane person like Kilmer didn't steal it. After he sells it to the Russians they find the formula incomplete and he has to give them the missing link before they kill him. He also has to save Elisabeth Shue since they are back after her. There is much more going on in the movie and it is one wild ride!4/5The DVD from Paramount has good picture and sound quality. There is a director's commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have never seen one of Val Kilmer's movie's before.But I sure have since then.He is an excellent actor and there seemed to be real chemistry between him and Elizabeth Shue.So far I have watched it 8 times and plan on watching it many more.The action keeps you on your toes wondering what will come next,and the romance is really sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

The plot is too easy to give away, and I don't want to be one of those people who wrecks the ending, so I'll just say one more thing. Give it a try, you probably won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant move, a thinking mans james bond","review":"awesome viewing, buy this if you like espionage, a bit of romance and a great story, a cool movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best- Something for all","review":"When i first saw the Saint I was astounded. This is by far my favorite movie. I thought it was awesome- Kilmer does an excellent job with all the charcter changes and I love Elisabeth Shue! After I saw it (again and again...) I read a few reviews on it about people saying it was \\"boring and hard to follow.\\" I didn't find it hard to follow at all and I'm only 16, I know it was compared to Mission impossible (people saying that was easier to follow) and I totallt still don't get Mission impossible. Maybe I liked The Saint so much because it was new. It had something for everyone, I like romance and my friends like action, so we we're all happy. My friends could sit there and say \\"Yeah! Blow that car up! \\" and I could say \\"Awwww! Look! Their in love! That is soo sweet!\\" and all was good. Excellent story, excellent acting, excellent film, miracle number 3... now if only there were a sequel..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good espionage movie","review":"The Saint is much better than most modern espionage movies. The Bourne Identity was empty headed and bland. The Saint has twists, wit, and charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE'S THE SEQUEL?","review":"I thought that this was one of the best romantic/action thrillers in a long time. Val Kilmer is sexy and mysterious. If they do make a sequel, they better hurry before he gets old and wrinkled like Sean Connery and Roger Moore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this movie!!","review":"This is such a great movie for Val Kilmer fans out there!! He surely knows how to act mutiple characters in this film!! It has a romantic theme as well as action-packed scenes!

Soundtrack has recently been purchased and is played almost continuously.As for Val Kilmer, well I'd change places with Elisabeth any day!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls, guns, Russians, what more do you want in a movie","review":"Movie reviewers called this movie sensational, so I went to see it, now I am calling it sensational. Val has allways being one of my favourite actors. This movie could have easily being scripted for a bond movie, but in my opinion it is better this way. Excellent plot, girls, guns, Russians what more could you ask for. It wasn't your average action movie. If you love the bond series because of his gadgets then youll love this. It made \\"Mission impossible\\" look easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiler","review":"I thought that this movie was wonderful. I loved the various disguises that Val Kilmer masked as; thought that his ability to change his face was incredible. I thought that the magic that occurred between him and E. Shue was terrific. They made me smile throughout the movie. The story line was also very intriquing. I wish he would do a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improbable... but very entertaining","review":"While the science is shaky, the movie is rock solid. Kilmer and Shue give fabulous performances. Kilmer's portrayal of the legendary Saint is beautifully close to the books. His talent for disguise and accent is a major benefit for the character, and makes the cat burglar extrodanair even more believable. Shue's earnestness and ability to express herself with her eyes are key to her character's success. A fantastically entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Film","review":"This is a nice Friday-night-wanna-watch-a-movie movie. Val Kilmer does a great job as a master of diguise in this spy thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste.","review":"The Saint was a massive disappointment. I mean, I was expecting him to be an out and out hero...you know, save cities and stuff. Turns out he's a thief who in the end turns nice. The plot for this film is therefore awful. I had to watch it twice before I understood all the cold fusion nonsense. The trouble is, the film doesn't know what it wants to be. It works kind of like this: \\"I'm gonna be about Simon Templar's past...No, I'll be a love story between Templar and the scientist...No, I'll be a spy film about the Russian Mafia...' and throughout the film, this happens - it changes from one to the other, and ends up as a mess. Val Kilmer is actually quite good as the Saint, and Elisabeth Shue is reasonably good too - but the film simply bored me to death. Had it been more simple, with more characters and a stronger plot, it could have been a classic....but let's face it, Val Kilmer doesn't exactly outshine Roger Moore. On the whole, as I said earlier, a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Entire Film Is Nothing more Than A Joke","review":"Val Kilmer the saint? what were the producers thinking casting him? this movie stinks nothing like the original, it places too much time on gimmicks than storyline big mistake.

I would recommend new learners look to another book to learn Precalculus.While I have found other Wiley Self Teaching Guides to be accurate and very helpful, Wiley Publishing didn't respond to my suggestion to add a correction paper to every copy of this edition (the minimum ethical response).I would also that any one considering a Wiley Publishing purchase to check with online reviews before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of mistakes","review":"I am only into Chapter 3 and have found numerous mistakes.

Mr. Giannakas calls himself a mathematician, I am not convinced he ever read the book.

It is hard to believe this book was ever published in the first place. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!-a mathematician"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors","review":"Although the authors have very clear ways of explaining mathematical processes and procedures, the book contains plenty of errors, some minor, some major.For example, when explaining the relationships between trig expressions (p. 153), it is stated that sin u = 1/cos u; in fact, a sine is the inverse of a cosecant, not a cosine. A simple but important typographical error.On page 131, it is clearly stated that 9pi/4 radians is a coterminal of 7pi/4 radians; they are at righta angles to each other. The authors arrived at this solution using incorrect math, which does not lead me to believe that they are checking their work very well.I have found many more such errors, and I am disappointed with the book. I didn't buy it from Amazon, and I'm taking it back to the store for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable as a self-teaching guide","review":"This book contains several errors. It is unsuitable as a refresher and COMPLETELY unsuitable as a self-teaching guide. I suggest \\"Trigonometry Refresher\\" by A. Albert Klaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"far too many errors to be truly useful","review":"If the purpose of instructional books is to build a foundation of knowledge in a subject, this one fails. The concepts are presented in a relatively straightforward fashion, but there really aren't enough problems to enable the reader to master those concepts. As many other reviewers have noted, the book is riddled with errors, including some arithmetic errors that are so painfully basic that the authors should be embarrassed to have their names attached to the finished product - and those are just the ones I noticed; I'm sure someone who really knows their precalculus could find dozens more. If I wasn't already fairly comfortable with math, the errors in this book would seriously undermine my confidence in my skills; as it is, they just undermine my confidence in the authors' skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Grows the CIty Beverly Nichols","review":"As far as I'm concerned Beverly Nichols is one of the most under-rated authors of his time.

Gacy was a despicable human being, but even he deserved a better biography than this. This book doesn't offer much more than a few good photos. If it's information you are seeking, then I recommend Buried Dreams by Tim Cahill w/ Russ Ewing. Gacy wasn't a very interesting man to begin with, you could see through him like cellophane. He was sadistic, childish, and ignorant. I corresponded with him for a while and I would not only suggest skipping this book, but I would also recommend finding a better subject to read about.

It's written almost on a gradeschool level, with poor annotation. Personally, I believe in the Bible, but Kent Hovind loses all scientific credibility with his religiously zealous remarks. He won't win any converts by calling readers to repentence in every chapter, either. A better, more scientific approach to cryptozoology can be found in \\"Mystery in Acambaro: Did Dinosaurs Survive Until Recently?\\" by David Hatcher Childress.

It is well written and nicely illustrated. Obviously, it brings not new facts about the topic itself. Most things were copied by books of Heuvelmans, Mackal, Spaeth etc.However, the minor things of the book are the pseudo-religious comments about the bible, the belief in God, and our sins and damnation in the foreword and at the end of each chapter. The real highlight was the statement of the authors that our world is not older than a few 1000's of years, declining every scientific proof about the true Earth's age. This medieval attitude of the authors ruins the nice rest of the book.

It has been called a diploma mill, lacking sufficient academic standards to award degrees.\\"(wikipedia) Buying a degree does not make a person learned it makes a person less than trustworthy.

For example, he touts an alleged \\"plesiosaur\\" carcass that was by all evidenec a decayed basking shark (see \\"Plesiosaur or Shark\\", http://paleo.cc/paluxy/plesios.htm).

I have heard Dr. Hovind's lectures on Creation, Evolution and Dinosaurs and they were superb. Although some of the other reviewers may not like him, I doubt they have heard him speak. He is charming and funny in his lectures and thuroughly spells out his opinions on the creation of the world and the age of the earth.

Among American Christians, the \\"Creation vs. Evolution\\" debate falls into this category, with many persons of good will -- AND strong, personal faith -- on both sides.Sadly, this does not come through in the work of Hovind. His work has been hammered -- even by other creationists -- for its lack of accuracy. Even more troubling is his theological insistance that it's \\"his way or the highway\\" -- EVEN with regard to other strong, Bible-believing Christians. It is this tendency to equate Hovind's interpretation with actual inspiration that I find very off-putting.A more reasoned, more irenic approach would facilite the discussion much more readily than what is presented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert came apart after first day","review":"Looked and felt fine out of the box.

It's not that it's outright terrible; it's just that it's a collection of formulaic workshop-style exercises. The prose is uniformly drab. The plots are mechanical.

This is essential AfroPop music. It is unfortunate that I Wanna Dance is the only song available for sampling.

It made me feel the way I did when I watched the original Planet of the Apes movies as a kid. It's good, but it's not \\"DEEP\\" as the original. It's fun and funny and naive. There's a sweetness and sense of wonder to it. There's no heavy message or pretentious fan club attached to this one. It's just fun. I've watched it several times and always enjoy it. I've collected all the Planet of the Apes movies and the televison series. This is another fun addition to my collection. It's a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Characters","review":"This version lacks one of the things that made the previous one a great film: character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a B Movie.","review":"This waste of film would make a great edition of Mystery Science Theater 3000.The plot was contrived and stupid. The best actor/actress in the movie was a monkey (not one of those \\"talking apes\\"; a real monkey). There was a truly twisted love triangle between the hero (a remarkably poorly acted textbook Milus Gloriosis [aka \\"Macho War Guy\\"]), the herione (a talking monkey, er, ape), and some random girl who really is not very important to the story. Not to say there is a story. The plot is nonsensical and far too convienient. There is none of the intelligence or \\"thought-provoking-ness\\" of the first Planet of the Apes...this movie is more of an advertisement of what Hollywood can do with make-up.I was also very insulted by the potrayel of Lincon as a monkey. That was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stupid!","review":"This was one this most stupid movies I have ever seen! the ending was so dumb. this movie was made because of the flow of cocaine/xtc/meth/whatever and money in hollywood.

Not even to see how bad it is, because there is nothing interesting to see unless you want to see michael jackson in drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkey Business","review":"A bland, generic, corporate-motivated PG-13 near-dud of a movie. I never saw the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, but it had to be infinitely better than this mess. The DVD, from what I understand, is a well-assembled package, but a mediocre movie is still a mediocre movie. Proceed with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Overall - the movie had potential. It has decent acting, a good story/material to work with and a good director. The results however are lacking. First of all, the plot lacks coherence and logic, especially the ending. Secondly, the music fails to live up to its potential. The makeup/costumes are the best in the film and probably some of the best I have seen.As for the DVD, while it has good features overall, the director's commentary is awful. He rambles and stumbles over his own sentences and it is hard to tell what he is saying. More fustrating, he does not want to share his vision of the film and its ending: all for the sake of not ruining a \\"possible sequel.\\" I must say, for a film that needed explanation, this one failed miserable. I would not recommend it to those who seek to find more answers because none will be given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Burton's Worst Film","review":"There was no justification to \\"reimagine\\" this 1968 sci-fi classic. From a box-office standpoint, the 2001 \\"Planet of the Apes\\" filled 20th Century Fox's coffers as a cynical, money-grubbing enterprise. Artistically, the film represents a low point in director Tim Burton's mostly impressive career, with an all-star cast hopelessly lost in space. A thoroughly unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible DVD","review":"This is an awesome DVD. There are so MANY choices of special effects. Plus this is a great movie with very good acting and makeup. Unfortunatly it did not win an Oscar. Well worth seeing and buying just for the hours of special features. Great movie worth the small cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looks but poor story","review":"Everything was lacking here.

Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jungle VIP (Vocal Ineloquence Preferable)","review":"Story re-working is terrific fun but the need to keep the certificate down has meant only the whimsy and not the menace has been retained from the original.Whalberg's sermon on the mount lacks the gravitas of Shakespeare's 'Henry V'. It's more like a little league baseball pep talk on helium.Estella Warren needs to lay off the burgers or the apes will end up swinging around her thighs rather than tree trunks.Thade didn't give up, you have to give him that. However, judging by the shape of Whalberg's spaceship it should have been Tesla sitting in the chair at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining sci-fi remake.","review":"Remake to the popular 1968 original stars Mark Wahlberg as a pilot who crashlands onto an alien planet where apes rule and humans are their slaves. This re-imagining obviously won't play well with fans of the original, but holds appeal to those looking for straight-out action/adventure. Fast-paced, pulse-pounding, funny, and even rousing, this is ideal summer-based entertainment. The ending is a bit silly, however (still enjoyably so)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good but watchable","review":"Sorry it did'nt live up to all the hype that it was given,yes it was watchable but only once,gave it 2 stars for the neat ending,looks like it was left again for a sequel,the space ship walberg was in was very poor espeically the end sequence where it landed near the statue,what a piece of luck landing there..anyway the sequel will be better because it can't be worse...."},{"rating":"1","title":"makeup guy needs to find new director, let's start again!!!!","review":"Well this really was a disappointment! Fans of the original, this will disappoint. On the other hand, if you appreciate mindless eye candy like \\"The Mummy\\", then, by all means, buy this.Burton's movie has no character development, little in the way of a plot, and an extremely improbable scenario. Were gorillas and orangutans on the spaceship? How do those species reproduce without any females?The chimp should have crash landed at the end so that way there could be no dreadful ending with that little pod just happening to crash on earth when there was no sign that the spaceship was anywhere near earth in the beginning.20th Century Fox -- give the makeup guy another job doing a real Planet of the Apes movie, with a decent director.And while you are at it, how about a director's cut DVD of 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' the way it should have been in the beginning!!!!!!!! Save us the bad endings!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This is the best movie I have ever seen.It doesn't get any better than this DVD.Just put on your ape mask and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not what it could have been","review":"The special effects and makeup are visually stunning, as is the picturesque world the artists who worked on it created. BUT as movies go.....not good. The characterizations were vague to the nth power and Mark W just wasn't dynamic enough in the lead role. The female lead.....Helena Bonham Carter as a gorilla....was the only character I actively cared about, but even her we don't really get to know all that well. By the time the movie is over you feel like something was missing, like this movie could have been great \\"if only\\". All in all, this DVD is worth renting but not buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Director + Poor Script = Bad Movie","review":"When it was announced that Tim Burton would be directing the new Planet of the Apes movie, I cringed. To me, Burton is goth (i.e. Beetlejuice, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands). Putting Burton at the helm of a classic sci-fi/adventure film was wrong. His directing style is painfully incongruent with what fans expected from a new Apes film. This dud of a movie is the byproduct of that terrible Fox decision.Tim Burton aside, the other major problem with this movie is its script. The story is confusing, rushed as well as predictable. With twenty-some years since the release of the final Planet of the Apes movie, you'd think someone could have written a great script. Instead, we get another \\"dumb down the audience\\" McMovie complete with a large breasted female character.Skip this one. It's only a renter. Instead, buy the 1968 classic of Planet of the Apes. A much better film which I have never tired of viewing over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste - stick with the original","review":"There is not one thing I liked about this movie. There is no reason to compare it with the original, because this film is nothing like it. Even on its own merit, however, it's no good. There was basically nothing to it. It is not even that interesting that the astronaut lands on a planet populated with intelligent apes, because in this version the humans are just the same, they are just inferior beings. It really doesn't make any sense. The movie is basically just a typical \\"good guy must escape from the bad guy\\" story. I guess if you're only looking for some action this movie is for you. It if you want even the slightest bit to think about this is definitely not the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst movies ever made. I would give this trash a zero rating if only I could! In the 1968 version We saw Taylor's anguish, in this movie its like I'm on a planet ruled by apes oh well. Just a really shallow story with really shallow character development. The only saving grace would have to be the in jokes but even those are only funny because of the power of the 1968 film. I'll stick with Taylor and Zira. It would be nice if some one would attempt to actually film the Novel Monkey Planet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this monkey flick get like this?","review":"An absolute mess. Burton seems unsure which Apes movie he's making, so he throws in bits of everything including the TV series and mixes it all up. It's bound to suffer comparisons with the original, but apart from the FX and ape makeup, it struggles against the other movies too. Even the studio sets, the forest, ape city all look a bit cheap, and the fast pacing only makes it seem rushed. I can excuse the ending on account that it's in the original novel, but in the context of this film it makes no sense whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"don\`t waste your time and money!!","review":"I wonder why Tim Burton made this movie. It is nowhere near the classic the planet of the apes by Franklin J. Schaffner. The old one has a very good story; the way it advances to the final point of the movie is just great. It even has very good makeup despite the fact that it is 30 years old. About the new one (Tim Burton version), it has nothing more than the help of better technology. The story is pretty ordinary. The way this movie proceeds, it fails to create any sense excitement or awe whatsoever. And it turns out to be neither a science fiction nor an action movie. So my opinion is this: donft waste your time and money to see this movie. I give the only star just to place this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster Flick","review":"Laughably bad remake of the 1968 classic.Everything is wrong in this big-budget shlock-fest.Worth renting once - it IS somewhat interesting -but contains one of the worst endings of all-time.Huh???"},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks","review":"It is an atrocity that this laughably bad movie, received the hype which it did. This is the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. The acting goes from wooden to over the top awful. Their is not even that much action, for a movie that is hyped up to be action-packed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trailer is the Movie!","review":"If you've seen the trailer, you saw the movie. The trailer doesn't miss a thing. The movie was the worst I've seen in years. Tim Burton, I'm sure, is ashamed with what came out of the cutting room. Regardless the amount of talent involved in this flick, it was abhorent - as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have seen the original, then this is simply bad","review":"I was expecting to see somthing new with this \\"revisiting\\" of planet of the apes movie. Instead, it is just an amatuer attempt to add some insight to the thought-provoking themes of the original movies. The first half of the movie was a complete waste, the slave/master issue was clearly dealt with in more detail in the original movie. So many movies these days focus so much on set design and makeup and not enough on plot or character development. The ending was surprising I thought, as I a couple of things could have happened in my opinion. Overall, just another modern action/sci-fi movie with no good plot, characters or action for that matter"},{"rating":"1","title":"The old movies are much better!","review":"First of all, the female apes look like Michael Jackson and Prince. I was expecting them to sing \\"Beat It\\" or \\"Purple Rain.\\" What's the point anyways? In order for the remake to work, they would've needed to totally make this spectacular. Instead, this is simply a rehash and doesn't live up to the original. At least with the Charlie's Angels remake, they added humor to it and made it fun. This one fails to impress. Maybe if Drew Barrymore or Cameron Diaz had been the astronaut it would have worked..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video/Audio quality is great; the movie is so-so","review":"In reviewing a Blu Ray version of a movie, you have to separate the audio/video quality of the version as well as the movie content itself (which is, generally, the same as the standard DVD version). Planet of the Apes has an excellent picture and sound and is a good demonstration of the quality possible with Blu Ray.The movie itself, however, has some flaws. It is difficult to review Planet of the Apes without referring to the older series of movies. The apes themselves look much more realistic in the newer version of the movie -- in fact the special effects are excellent. On the other hand, director Ridley Scott chose to change plot details, and especially the ending. Without giving \\"spoilers,\\" I liked the first half of the movie a great deal, but found the ending to be lacking -- especially the final scene, for which no logical explanation is given.So I rate it 5 stars on audio/video, but only 3 on content for an overall rating of 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ape Lincoln Denouement Is Ridiculous","review":"Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just average filmmaking.

It's like something a child would have come up with when they've run out of ideas) and an ending which is indescribably bad.This film was an insult to my intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Bad Ending","review":"I thought this movie wasn't bad, but I thought it could have been better.

Also, I hated the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch","review":"First off since this movie is not a remake of the original is should not bare the same name as the original so I have given it a new title \\"Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch\\" a more appropriate title for this modern picture. This movie had all the makings of something spectacular with a great producer and solid idea to go on with all the new technology to boast, however it fell flat on its face. The character development was horrible, and the soundsets they were filmed on looked about as fake as you could get with todays technology. It's just too bad that todays generation is going to be exposed to a whole series of Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch. Take my advice and stick with the classics and boy cott any future releases of Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch.

So the \\"hero\\" is attracted to her to show cross-species 'lurve' is possible.\\" Bleech!I hate it went a movie director lays it on that thick.I do not think the effects improved on the original apart from the running on all fours thing.The ending is contrived beyond belief.All in all, a complete turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Remakes Ever Made","review":"Whenever he's remaking or adapting something, Burton always makes the same mistake; putting his \\"vision\\" ahead of the original source material and sometimes even showing utter disdain for the source material (Planet of the Apes, Batman, etc.). This is not only hands-down the worst thing ever done with the Apes franchise, but also Burton's worst movie ever. In this film, he makes the ridiculous choice of having all of the human characters capable of speech... and that is just the beginning!

When this film was made, Charlton Heston, who gives an outstanding but unbilled performance as a dying simian patriach, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. In short, he was a man dying from a terrible, degenerative illness. To cast him as a dying man was both egregiously cruel and insensitive.

I thought this film was a waste of time, money and talent. ALl the makeup in the universe could not make it any better - the story was deeply flawed, the performances stale, and yes, even the monkey suits looked fake. Gee - you'd think the filmakers would have borrowed a page from the original and stuck to a formula that worked back then - a plot for one, suspense for another, and actors who transcended the species rather than offended it. Quite honestly, after seeing this flick (on an IMAX screen no less) I'm not sure what the point to remaking ANY classic story really is if there is no compelling plot to move the story forward. A DUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escellent! It does have a cliffhanger ending though.","review":"This movie is excellent! The special effects, the story, everything right down to the monkey suits is phenominal. This is one I definatly will find myself watching over and over.

New story, new characters. That said, this movie is a horrible, vomitous mass whose only saving graces are outstanding makeup effects and the best on-screen villain since Darth Maul.

Slice that as thin as you possibly can, because Americans are a lot dumber now and can only hold 1 major theme in their mind at any moment. Finally, end the thing with a lame time-paradox (which never even remotely gets explained, therefore it makes no sense by definition).The original film had an iconic ending....the Statue of Liberty buried.

Just a terrible, terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of my life I'll never get back.","review":"This is not a remake of the amazing 1968 \\"Planet of the Apes\\" but a tedious, boring and vapid new story.

Thankfully, the wonderful producers have given us 13 hours of dvd stuff, so thirteen hours of garbage are better then 2. Right? Right?Also, I did not like the shift from civil rights to animal rights. The first was a morality play regarding the races, and this one seemed to shy away from it, as if that understanding and acceptance between races has been achieved, and now we just need to set our sighs on another subject. Wrong. Oh well, if you like watching monkeys jump around, and watching the body double for Michael Jackson (helen Bonham Carter) talk, then it will be a good movie for you.

The ending was the only part I liked, really cool Sci-Fi moment there. But other than that, this is nothing like the 1968 version or it's sequels. It was also not a very fun Summer movie. For the Summer of 2001, I'd have to rank Jurassic Park 3 and The Mummy Returns hire. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous!","review":"The trailer for this film was excellent, thats why I wanted to see it. it looked intense, exciting, and even scary. Was it any of these things? NO! It actually started off very promising when Marc Wahlburg crashes down on the Planet of the Apes, and he and a bunch of natives are running from the apes. After that it goes down hill. It's all about Mark Wahlburg trying to get free from the planet. The Apes are rediculous. The make up is excellent and you can barely recognize Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, and Michael Clarke Duncan, but I couldn;t help but laugh at these fine actors as they said their horrendoues dialogue, and believe me the dialogue was not meant to be funny. It lacked any excitment or intensity and was filled with bad performances especially from Mark Wahlburg and Estella Warren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aperaham Lincoln","review":"What a hugh disappointment from one of my favorite directors, Tim Burton. No suspense, little action and a \\"surprise ending\\" that should have stayed a secret. The ending was totally comical and had none of the impact as the original flick.

This is not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRECK.","review":"This film is complete junk. I should know better, because hollywood (it gets a small \\"h\\" because that is all they deserve) always does this to us. There was only one possible option with a modern version of Apes, and that was to make an exact version of Pierre Boulle's (sp?) brilliant novel, and I mean exact. The original Apes film is a masterpiece, and with the obscene amount of money they had for the budget, they could have hit a home run with the film version of the book, but instead, dreck.

It doesn't replace the original nor did it add anything of value. Completely unnecessary. So many poor decisions were made. Casting Marky Mark was a mistake. The make-up is a joke. The acting was a flop. It won its Razzie awards for a reason; it was well deserving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"The most idiotic thing about this remake is that the humans were able to speak. In the original, humans had lost the ability to speak and were truly like less intelligent animals, unable to communicate in a spoken language. Needless to say, they couldn't read or write either. I guess the producers of the remake couldn't stomach the idea of a big-budget film featuring dozens of mute extras. One of the worst films of the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Pointless","review":"The point of the original Planet Of The Apes (1968) was lost to the makers of this 2001 remake.

It's just man vs. apes. Very dumb.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray Helps one of the more Realistic Apes Films","review":"I wanted to see this movie. I went to see this movie.

It did seem more realistic than the original Planet of the Apes movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"Absolute crap. Avoid it at all costs or be prepared to ask for your money back. What was Tim Burton thinking? Couldn't get Johnny Depp for this one? Marky Mark is about the worst substitute he could get for Chuck Heston's part (or anyone's part, really. Hope you can read this, M.M.). And the ending makes a nod at the original novel (that no one has read but me and T.B., apparently...) but makes not a damned bit of sense.

In the original it was the other way around. And why was Charlton Heston's name left off the credits in the movie. I didn't realize until the second time around that General Thade's father was played by Charlton Heston. I thought that was brillant and for him to repeat the same line he used in the original ape movie about damning them all to hell. What a great film...."},{"rating":"2","title":"New, but classic!","review":"I am not normally a Tim Burton fan, but he outdid himself here! The story follows closely to the original film, yet has enough new elements to keep it exciting and new. The make-up is fantastic, the characters interesting, the apes more realistic than ever. It was shot in the same location as the original. All I can say it needs is Charlton Heston, but alas, he's not available!

This movie really was a real dissapointment. The original was so much better on so many levels. The original was a tale of modern man, disguised by its science fiction elements. This turkey is just another mindless action movie. I can see why \\"the Arnold\\" was interested in making this movie first. The acting was bad, direction pedestrian, story illogical (HUGE plotholes),the ending looked like it was a band-aid attempt to fix what the movie makers knew was a bad movie. Marky Mark should go back to rapping if this is the best he can do. He has the personality of a piece of wood. The special effects were pretty good. If they had only spent as much time on the story and found an actor to replace Marky Mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Save yourself some time, and don't even bother watching this film.

It never did, and I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just plain bad","review":"Too Violent, Too depressing, Too ridiculous. What a mess. Why did they do this movie. I cannot imagine. The writers should never be allowed to make another movie. THey took a perfectly interesting tale of scifi/fantasy and made it a violent almost unwatchable mess. Shame on the populist director for making this drek. The worst part is, that is made a ton of money in the theaters which will cause them all to probably make another one. Maybe it will not be as grotuesque. I must admit though that the ape makeup was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and confusing","review":"I really didn't like this movie. For one when I movie was perfect the first time why try and go back and make it better? The characters where comical to the point of being unable to tell if the scence was supposed to be serious or not. I saw this movie in the theater and the acting confused the person next to me so much they asked me if it was supposed to be a comidy. My main point of consternation with the movie come from the ending. It absotutly made no sense. Up until that point i was ok with the movie as being something to watch and not really pay attention to but that ending ruined its status for me as just being a silly little flick. It was if they suddenly realized that the original was a serious movie and decided they should throw in something from deep thought. By all rights this movie should not be watched by someone who has seen the original, what they have done to the movie will just make you mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Serling when you really need him?","review":"Dead of course. Too bad all the good misanthropes are dead.The makeup effects are without a doubt jaw dropping.But I just didn't care.The original was a witty biting social satire. This is justan action movie. Big deal about very little.But I do admire the actors for putting up with the torment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well what else can you say?","review":"I wanted to see this movie.

It is just one big failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"aside from the ending it's almost unwatchable","review":"This is the remake of the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston (Heston's does a short cameo in this one). A space Air Force pilot training apes to fly space ships gets stranded in the future on a planet ruled by evolved apes. With the help of a few sympathetic apes, the pilot escapes capture and leads a rag-tag group of humans to freedom. If this terrible film has any redeeming qualities, they'd have to be the monkey costumes and the ending. The rest of the movie was [thin]: the dialogue, acting, and plot, while comparably stupid as that of the original film, fail completely to accomplish anything other than a ... rehash."},{"rating":"1","title":"instantly forgettable","review":"yet another film where for the first couple of minutes you think, hey this looks quite good, maybe its not as terrible as everyone says.And then the plot descends to complete nonsense, and digs itself deeper and deeper into its own badly written grave.theres almost nothing which redeems it, the fact it was up against a great classic orginal and fails in almost every department, or in fact all, says it all.there were a few germs of good ideas, but the script was tosh, and most of the movie was ininvolving and laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Stupid -- Actually Zeo stars","review":"Why was this ever made?

When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, Stinky movie","review":"Let me say this: based on supplemental features alone, this is probably a 4 star DVD. There are many documentaries and such, though I must say Tim Burton is very annoying on the commentary track. He seems to go on and on without really saying anything insightful.The movie is a mess. If you're familiar with the original film (it's hard not to compare the two), you know what an impact the ending has on the whole movie. By trying to match that shocker ending, this new version COMPLETELY NEGATES the ENTIRE film that built up to it. I defy anyone to actually make sense of it. Not even Tim Burton could! Sure, he said it made perfect sense to him-- but he didn't want to explain it for fear it would foul up Fox's plans for a sequel.This is a completely disposable blockbuster. Watch or re-watch the original, or even it's sequels, before wasting time and/or money with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Special Effects. Terible Acting.","review":"It is a joke to watch the extra DVD material on how \\"experts\\" came in to teach the actors how to act like apes. They should have been taught how to act first. They did a great job with the male ape costumes and make up butt the females look too much like humans. And ironically the absolute worst acting besides Marky Mark is Tim Roth, the Director of this mess. This could have been a really scarey film with some of the great effects in here. But they manage to ruin it with too much corny dialogue that apparently Tim Roth thought would be clever and amusing. Instead it comes across as being predictable and stupid. Noone is going to be scared by an orangatan slave catcher played by Paul Giamati. He isn't amusing either just annoying. And the final ending makes no discernable sense from the context of this film either. Someone revoke the use of the title from these clowns before they try and \\"retell\\" and ruin anymore Planet of the Apes\\" classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"get a life!","review":"The criticisms on here seem to have been written by steroetypical Trekies! Apes movies, comic books, cartoons, tv shows, toys, and various merchandise are all fun, but they are also extremely absurd. Monkey Planet is an absurd novel, as is the original Apes movie which bastardized the novel. Burton's ending is much closer to the original novel's, but he still get's slammed by folks who take things way too seriously. Burton's Planet has a lot going for it and I enjoy it and the original movie and it's various follow ups. It's all fun stuff, but some people are way too uptight to just enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie of the millenium","review":"This is the worst movie I've seen in a very very long time. Both the plot and the acting are very shallow. Marky Mark cannot act, and his acting is so bad as to be distracting. Estella Warren is barely in the movie, only a superficial role, really. The movie is nothing like the original.At first I thought it was pretty cool to see a cameo of Charlton Heston as an ape, until I realized he was just using the role to spew his NRA philosophy that guns are what make us the greatest. So, what if you forget the plot and the acting, what about action? The action plain and simple stinks as well. Two of the head apes fight each other for what I thought would be a good fight scene, and poof it's over. Boring. The two endings are just ridiculous, especially the last one. I would pay people not to see this movie and any sequels, for their own good. This movie gives a bad name to scifi, Hollywood, and the original planet of the apes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terriable nothing like the Original","review":"The movie with Charlton Heston, was ground breaking, and had a message.

Second, I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor (HILARIOUS in I Heart Huckabees). But, this movie required you to put all logical musings aside for 2 hours in order to even get through the movie. I do realize its science fiction, but this was WAY beyond the realm of letting it slide a little bit.So, I'm going to stop short of detailing everyting I felt was flawed about this movie. In conclusion, HIGHLY dissapointed with Tim Burton on this film and IF YOU MUST: rent it. However, under no circumstances should this film be purchased.....extras on the DVD are not very good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like an ape","review":"This movie will leave you scratching your head like a monkey.

I think it only makes sense to Tim Burton. I rented the DVD just to see if I missed something in the theater. Well it still didn't make sense on 2nd viewing. I decided to listen to Tim Burton's Commentary track on the DVD. To my surprise even he couldn't explain the ending other than to say that \\"It was logical to him\\" and a bunch of other nonsense. His explanation was as empty of explanation as the movie itself. Ok, so he doesn't have the same logic as most people (...) I was expecting some eye opening information but it wasn't to be found in his own commentary!

Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst science fiction films ever","review":"Don't get me wrong, the action and effects were great, but i bought the ticket (I've only seen the original theatrical release) to see a science fiction story, one that would make you think, like good science fiction does. Plot holes were constant, and I didn't really see a point to the story. I was extremely dissapointed. If you like action and great effects (though the effects appeared only periodicaly throughout the movie, and not constantly like many moviegoers enjoy), then this is the flick for you. But if, like myself, you are looking for good science fiction, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the WORST Planet of the Apes","review":"This is horrible. There are so many things wrong that this review would be 90 pages long. Apes having sex with another species (like Chimps) is just one of the horrors. Next comes the fact that humans already talk but are held as slaves.

This was just bad. A missed opportunity to re-imagine the original. I was further shocked by the director's commentary - Hey Mr. Burton, thanks for not pointing most of the homages to the original such as Linda Harrison's cameo! Also, some of the special features on the DVD were shocking - did none of the people in the film even know anything about the original film or even a little bit about the series itself? They all came across as self-absorbed idiots who didn't know or care about what they were working on.A very sad, missed opportunity. What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is little redeeming about this movie","review":"It's amazing how half-hearted this movie is. The scenes, costumes, and especially the dialogue are all worse than the original. If this wasn't a remake, the first whole hour you'd be asking yourself \\"why did they make this movie?\\". The whole movie is lazy and doesn't bother to explain itself or create any real drama, but just strolls thru a dull plot. The only interesting points are when the monkey comes back in the pod and of course the ending on earth. Otherwise, there are prosaic discussions, escapes, and battles that make up the rest of the movie. Pathetic effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"Except for the end, I liked this version of the movie much more that the C. Heston original. You can't top the ending to the original for shock value (that image was seared indelibly into my 16 year old brain), but there was plenty of other upgrades that could be (and were) made including a better script, better costumes, better scenery, better special effects and better acting.

Oh! and let's not forget that the humans didn't talk in the 1st movie!! what's the matter? lack of substance! Mr. Heston's performance was embarassing. this truly put a smudge in my mind against all his old greats. Our lead ape, no offense to Jacko, looked like Michael Jackson. the most disturbing scene was that threesome kiss scene...you know? man kisses ape. pauses for effect. man kisses woman who can't act....ah, the old days. the only two things worth giving this film 1 star is the forshadowing scene at the end, that thrilled me more than the entire movie! and Tim Roth's performance was great. Alas, I think Mr. Burton is riding on fumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"The trailers sold this as an action film. However, it is far from exciting. The escape from captivitiy scene is nothing more than some guys in ape make-up climbing walls while Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch run back and forth across the screen with No One In Pursuit.

Uhhh if there's no sequel planned then... well, that just makes the movie that much worse, doesn't it.This film has no ending. When the film stops rolling I was sitting there saying to my wife... Is there another cd?No Chaz. That's all there was... You picked it.All that aside, if you don't care about closure, if a complete story means nothing to you, and your whole movie-watching life revolves around action and good special effects, then yeah, this movie was a renter.

And Bring the NRA!","review":"Believe it or not, Charleton Heston does make an uncredited appearance in this 21st century updating of one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. In the original, he was the lead, an astronaut thrown forward in time to a planet ruled by Fascist apes; in this clunker, he appears AS AN APE!Truly the best example committed to film to denounce remaking classics, Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES stinks from every possible direction. The acting (with the sole exception of the lovely Helena Bonham Carter, disguised thankfully under ape makeup) is one-dimensional; the special effects we've truly seen far better elsewhere; the set production is relatively archaic; and I think you get the picture.The twist ending to POTA (the original's makes this one so laughable) almost promises a sequel, but let's hope apes do rule the planet by then and cinema is an art form long abandoned in favor of banana mashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Burton should be ashamed for letting this get released.","review":"This is a movie that relied solely on special effects and makeup for its success. Strip these away and what is left is a bad action movie with two dimensional characters (one woman in the movie is so poorly developed I would say she was one dimensional, I couldn't figure out why she was there other than to look good), horrendous dialogue, and an ending that just came out of left field for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too awful for words","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.

The astoundly ridiculous ending is just slightly below the level of the entire film to that point.If this film were just bad, maybe it could be enjoyed as a laughably bad movie, but it commits the most unpardonable sin of all: it's BORING. So very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkey don't see; monkey don't do.","review":"This movie was so bad that my wife left half way through and my friend and I looked at each other afterward with apish grins wondering why she was so much smarter than we were. We should have aped her and left before we spent any more time monkeying around.There was no character development and no character motivation. The makeup was great; the wire work was bad. The physics of the movie was absurd. I was particularly amused by how bad the crash landing on the Lincoln memorial was and how he just popped right out of the pod afterward, fresh as a daisy.If you were planning to see this, I don't mean to throw a monkey wrench into your plans, but skip it and read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"sickening","review":"i liked tim burton, i liked the original, but this made me sick. it was bad to the point that i thought at first it was a joke. how could tim burton, the guy who did batman, be doing this to me? it was not a joke. at least not intentionally. people were leaving the theatre. i had honestly never seen that before. overacted, way overacted, and in a very bad way. the story was ridiculous. i felt bad for the quality actors who were in it.

Mark Walhburg is merely competant and seems limited as an actor in this movie. Some of the other actors (i.e. Estella Warren) are little more than cardboard characters. (with the obvious exception of Tim Roth as Thade, who single handedly steals every scene he is in.) In all, the movie seems to lack passion and emotion, even though it is a pretty movie to look at. As a movie it does deserve a 3 star rating. But as a DVD, this things rocks. The extras are phenomenal! there is so much here that you can spend days sifting through it all. As far as the DVD movie quality, both sound and image are pristine and the DTS score is fantastic. It will give your surround system a workout. While I would hesitate to recommend this movie to someone going to see it in a theater, as a DVD it is a fantastic purchase. While you may not love the movie, the extras make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite a waste of time","review":"I was disappointed with the original movie, having previously read the book by Pierre Boulle. This version is even worse. Aside from straying even further from the book, I looked at the makeup on some of the actors and wondered what had happened to all of the advances in special effects and makeup from the last 30 years.I must say that the explanation for the origin of the ape society was a nice twist, but the ending left me with the question as to WHY things went as they did since Captain Davidson presumably went BACK in time, judging from the chronometer in the pod.There were isolated moments that were entertaining, but I doubt if I'll bother to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I thought this was one of the worst movies ever. I was really dissapointed. The Apes looked fake and the script was terrible. I was so bored with this movie that I fell asleep after the first half hour.

While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest.

This movie was supposed to be a tender love story between the ape, Ari, and the astronaut. In the original director's cut, shown to focus groups, the most important theme of the movie was the competition for his affection between the human female and the ape female. Apparently the test audiences were especially grossed out when the ape and human were passionately swapping spit. The studio forced Burton to cut out all of that interspecies sex stuff... and with it the motivation for most of Ari's actions. I'm not saying that the ending in the uncut version was any less inane than the version that was released. However, when Burton caved and the marketing managers prevailed, the audience was left with complete dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve any stars","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen this year.

This is one of the worst Segal films of all time. HIS VOICE WAS DUBBED in parts of the movie!!!! In one scene you hear his voice and in another it is the voice that sounds like a totally different person. I was so astounded that I called a friend and played it for him over the phone. The content is a combination of a bad horror film and his recent film, Mercenary. I loved the old Segal in Out For Justice in which he used a cue ball wrapped in a bar towel to knock the teeth out of some convict in a bar!

I was shocked to realize that it was actually a voice dub! I thought to myself, why would they voice over his original dialog, and why would they use another actor instead of having Segal do it. Then I looked up the movie on Wikipedia and found out that there were script changes made after the movie was shot and the voice overs were made to compensate! What a joke. This movie sucks ass. Steven, I think you need to go back to China or Japan or wherever you went to get your inspiration and meet up with your master again, or maybe go to a retreat in the Caribeaan and go on a macro-biotic diet for a few months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened","review":"I am now wondering why Steven Seagal is having to have his voice dubbed in the movie.

Like the other reviewers, i too have been a seagal fan since Above the Law. His movies have been going down hill recently - but there have at least been some saving qualities amongst them! Attack force is pure unadulterated insidious crap. If you haven't stuck cutlery (or any convenient household utensil) into your ears by the half way point, there's something wrong with you. The voice dubbing is pathetic. A female voice with an indian accent would sound closer to Mr Seagal's own voice than the gravelly whisp that emanated from his mouth for most of the dialogue.Maybe that's the movie's saving grace: you can't turn away - if you do, you won't know who's talking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY ALSO SERVE...","review":"I have nothing to add to the other one-star reviews of this bad movie, except perhaps to emphasize the incomplete and inadequate ending, but I found it interesting that, if you watch the credits to the end, you get some idea of the kind of help a wealthy man gets when making a movie. For in the credits (which seem to include most of the population of Bucharest), you can learn the names of (1) \\"Mr. Seagal's Stunt Double\\", (2) \\"Mr. Seagal's Photo Double\\", (3) the provider of the \\"Wardrobe for Mr. Seagal\\", (4) \\"Mr. Seagal's Make-Up Artist\\", (5) the \\"Executive Assistant to Mr. Seagal\\", and (6) the \\"Driver of Mr. Seagal's Trailer\\".Further, you can even learn the provider of \\"Mr. Seagal's Trailer\\" (Translux International Ltd.).The mystery is that, among all the members of Mr. Seagal's entourage, we are not told who is \\"Mr. Seagal's Voice\\".

First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections. There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts. In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about. I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Segal Commit Further Career Suicide","review":"I don't know what happened here. Some of Steven Seagal's dialogue is mysteriously (and poorly) voiced over by some third party. The plot is all but missing, and SO IS THE ACTION. Is this an attempt to move into Sci-Fi/Horror by Mr. Seagal? This movie is as poor as his early movies were fantastic.

All I could say about this one has been said already by the others. Only one little thing not being detected by the others: Bastia is NOT close to Bordeaux, it's in the north-eastern part of the island of Corsica.

He's fat with some kind of rat's nest growing out of the back of his head.This is Seagal at his embarrasing worst. The last 5 or 6 jokes he's produced were like bad car wrecks. I didn't want to look but I had to. Thinking maybe each one would be better than the last; they couldn't get much worse. Of course this never happened.Attack Force is the final straw. I will never rent his schlock again. He's a washed up has-been that can't even muster enough energy to use his own voice.Shame on you, Seagal. You stink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one - actually 0 stars","review":"This is a total disaster, no good fight scenes, no coherent plot and no funny lines from Stephen (when you can hear or understand him).

To make it worse, they used at least 3 different voices for the voice overs.I've been a Segal fan for years, but this is the last one of his films that I will waste my time watching. I'm just glad that I chose to rent it instead of buying it.Overall, the whole movie is awful. From the bad acting to Segals pseudo, badly done fight scenes. In the last fight scene when Segal is fighting a female \\"bad guy\\", her wound keeps changing from her left to her right side. Looks like the editors fell asleep while they were trying to make heads or tails of this fiasco.Can't believe that Sony actually allowed their name to be associated with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Submerged","review":"Better than Submerged, but that's not saying much.

We kept trying to guess whose voice that was (Burgess Meredith, The guy who played the other terminator on T2, etc.). That was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film.I can't see why Blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe; maybe there are more of us die-hard SS fans than I realized.

Whoever takes the CTX becomes an unstoppable killing machine.I'm not the biggest Seagal fan and it has been awhile since I have seen one of his movies, but Attack Force has to be the worst. The plot is unrealistic and confusing. The fights scenes are ridiculous, the acting is laughable, and half of Seagal's lines are dubbed due to the script being changed after the movie was filmed.

Also, in the book, Clay is doing just as much horse as everyone else, while in the movie, he is totally against it. Most of the scenarios in the movie are not present in the book at all.

The movie is inconsistent and inaccurate with the book. They change the events as well as people and places in almost every scene of the movie. Worst of all it seems that they didn't even understand the book. The book wasn't just about Jullian, and his struggles. In my opinnion the focus of the book was Clay, and how he and none of his friends were happy. They had everything, and they cared about nothing. Everyone was just distant and estranged. The movie failed badly at capturing this. Clay's family wasn't even in the movie for god's sake. To top it all off they changed the ending. You can't change the ending of a famous piece of literature. There should be a rule to keep amature filmakers like this guy from doing that. Bottom line...they [messed] it up.

I remember seeing it in 1987 when it came out and was furious that I shelled out money to see this mess. I thought that a viewing on video 12 years later might help me appreciate it but it did'nt. The problems begin with a warped, unrealistic look at \\"life in the fast lane\\" 80's style and continue with insipid performances by Andrew McCarthy and (especially) Jami Gertz (what happened to her anyway ???). Most of the publicity surrounded Robert Downey Jr's performance, which for a time was considered brilliant.

The only performance worth a damn is Andrew McCarthy, he actually cares about his snobby, heartless friends, I always thought McCarthy was highly under-rated.

The music, the wardrobe, and McCarthy, Gertz, Spader, and Downey, Jr. were some of my favorite actors during this period. While watching the film now as an adult, I can see the flaws in the dialogue and direction - some of the scenes played like music videos - but the acting, especially by Downey, Jr. was actually pretty good. Gertz is quite believable as the snobby, \\"I can quit anytime I want to\\" coke queen, Blair and McCarthy displays his charm as Mr. Nice Guy, Clay, but it's really Downey, Jr. as the drugged out Julian who's the real presence in this film. Downey's Julian is spot on as the guy who's down on his luck and can't catch a break so he resorts to drugs to mask the pain of life and the pain of losing his friend, Clay, to a successful college career. Spader's drug dealer, Rip, is fun to watch as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED!","review":"I give this film credit for not being just another \\"80's teen\\" movie. This film is not a comedy and is really a downer. The likable cast is very familiar,as we have seen them many times before in light \\"high school 80's\\" comedies. James Spader who normally plays a snobby rich kid(at least back in those days) portrays a cold hearted drug dealer and Robert Downey Jr. portrays a kid with a serious freebase or crack addition(sounds like his real life) who gets into a big debt with the drug dealing Spader.

The DVD transfer looks pretty good and there are some trailers for the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crappy adaptation","review":"Don't watch this movie expecting to see Bret Easton Ellis's \\"Less than zero,\\" it is far from that. The similarities between the book are as follows: They have the same names, and they do drugs (but not even as much as they do in the book). They leave out a lot of important stuff from the book. With this movie the notion that the movie is never as good as the book, is definately 100% true.Had I not read the book prior to watching this movie, I may have liked it a little more.

Although I admired the performances (particularly Downey's), I just couldn't get very involved in the story and look of the film was too slick. It often seemed as if director Marek Kanievska really wanted to make a music video. One could argue that this look is appropriate for the superficial world that the characters inhabit, but that doesn't make me enjoy it any more. It is filled with absurd MTV moments like the two young lovers stopping their car right in the middle of the road and making out passionately while bikers rumble past on either side of them.

I look forward to more from the DJQ2O."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't tell a book from its cover","review":"This book is a fascinating and critical analysis of what lays beyond first appearances when looking at the external garb of a Hasid. It is well researched and shows itself to be the academic sociology thesis that it is (or at least was in it's first incantation). Unlike other stories that tell of folks who bristle and don't fit into the Hasidic community of their birth, this book brings an historical perspective to the movement since World War II when it's growth developed in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels","review":"A very interesting read lots of emotions, thoroughly enjoyable. Views from a different perspective.I would recommend reading the book. Kept me enthralled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unchosen: The Hiden Life of Hasidic Rebels","review":"I did not walk away feeling that I learned anything new about the Hasidic community. After reading about each \\"so-called\\" rebel, the story line did not provide any new insights. In fact these people did not seem like rebels, just people who questioned their life-style.Often it was stated, they just changed clothes, and I met them at a Starbucks to protect them from what their families or community members would think. You talked of a couple that left Williamsburg to live in another part of New York, and it just stopped. The book started out by discussing an interaction the author had with a group of Hasidic women, and it just stopped at that point. Not alot of depth to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unchosen: One-Sided sure, but that's not a bad thing.","review":"This was a very informative look into the world of Hasidim who find that the lifestyle doesn't work for them. I'm a bit surprised by the low reviews claiming one-sidedness since, well, this book doesn't hide its subject contents and really states as much openly. You need two things in mind when you go into this books, namely:a) an open mind, andb) there are a few errors here and there.However, it's very informative if you approach it correctly. It goes into detail in all of the accounts, though Yossi is the string that ties them all together. In the process of reading, you become attached to many of the \\"characters\\", but most specifically him. The downside to the book is that it leaves it on such an open note for many people involved that you wonder what happened to them. It is very lacking in that regard.A very good book about a subject matter that isn't often talked about. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good look that those that buck their culture","review":"After my ex-hasidic (but orthodox) friend complained bitterly about the book, I decided to read it. It is a fascinating and balanced look at a very closed community. All the \\"rebels\\" have emotional/pyschological problems but it is unclear what comes first; rebellion or problems.The work is extremely thought proviking and has ramifications for anyone who rebels against their culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Author with an agenda","review":"Impressive amount of research and detail in this compilation of stories of hasidic jews who desire to live non hassidic lives. Unfortunately the author bends over backward to portray the potagonists as innocent victims of some hassidic conspiracy. She clearly has no objectivity when she excuses or marginalizes drug use and goes on to condemn some parent or community leader for being protective of others.Not at all a fair representation of the hassidic world which she has less and less compliments for as the book progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased and poorly written","review":"poorly written, and clearly biased.

It just won't do! Although I have only read part of chapter 1. of the book that is posted online, it is so blatantly obvious to the reader that you have done a very bad job of contriving, stereotyping, and turned something which contains a scintilla of truth into a cloche of fully overgrown with figments of your \\"vivid\\" imagination.

Ms. Winston does not say that this is a doctoral dissertation. In point of fact, the book grew out of her dissertation, but it is a separate entity. The dissertation, at present, is still in the works.One of the the best parts of the book is that Ms. Winston is fair. She doesn't pretend that this is the definitive treatise on Orthodox Jews or on people who \\"left the fold.\\" She merely tells the story of several very interesting people who are dealing with conflicts between their upbringing and culture, and their individual wants and needs. The purpose of the book, in my humble opinion, is to stimulate discussion and debate.

Dieker is a poor man's Scott Turow as he drily depicts his struggles to write his way onto a journal, keep abreast of a torrent of reading matter, and, most important, get a summer job which will lead to a real job. One of the best uses of black humor in the book is the rejection letters regularly quoted in the text, each one more unctuous than the last.The book summoned up the angst of law school for me so effectively that I had a hard time finishing it. That speaks well for the power of the author's writing. Mercifully, he includes an epilogue to assure us that this was long ago and far away and that things turned out all right for him in the end. That's good. By the end of the book, I found I really cared for the protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A follow-up to a modern 1L","review":"This book offers a completely different perspective on law school (specifically the second year) than others out there (at least what I have read). This text doesn't list out what you should or shouldn't do. Instead, it presents one man's story during his second year from August to December. You walk away from each reading deciding for yourself what were his good and bad choices. This text is written journal-style. As such, some topics skip around. The overall text seems lengthy, however it gives a realistic illustration of how tedious the second year can be. It focuses a lot on \\"the job search\\"...listing out rejection letters, following phone calls, and divulging interview blunders. These on-goings coincide with trying to manage coursework as well. An excellent book to read during the summer before the second year or for anyone trying to piece together what law school is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and marginally helpful","review":"It apppears that the primary purpose of this book is to warn prospective law students of the unlikelyhood of getting a summer internship. While a valuable lesson, it is the only one contained in the book. Nothing can be gained from this book except a reminder to take school seriously. For individuals trying to determine whether to go to law school, I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little toys for kids to explore animals.","review":"We bought a large selection of these for \\"potty\\" prizes for my little girl.

If you are expecting heavy, highly detailed items you will be disappointed - these are little plastic animals.

For scanning photograhs to e-mail and for importing images for greeting cards, brochures, and so on, this scanner is just fine. Scanning time is fairly quick. The software allows you to manipulate images to try and improve a photo or cut and paste one photo with another to create an entirely new image. For text, I would not recommend this scanner. Even top-line scanners have trouble with text, so don't expect great character recognition from this low-end model. Again, for the casual home user, you can't do much better than the 5300Cse; it does what most people want a scanner to do and it does it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice and Simple","review":"This scanner is one of the best for it's price.

I did not see in the instructions that you could refill them so I was pleased to find the bait remains very effective thru several water changes.

As soon as my wife opened the box, she tried to take the reservoir apart to clean the inside of the dispenser, but it just wouldn't come out. She asked me to get it apart, and it was next to impossible. I found a suggestion on Brita's user forums where they suggested soaking the entire thing in soapy warm water to get it apart for cleaning, but it's obvious it was not designed to come apart. This one is going straight back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I have owned this Brita water dispenser for 2 months now and it works great. I previously owned a pitcher but the capacity was too small and I felt like every time I went into the fridge I had to refill it. I haven't had any issues with mold or leaks or anything of the sort with the dispenser and that is on a monthly cleaning basis. The only negative side, as many other people have mentioned here, is the filling process.

I liked Brita products, but thier quality in manyfacturing seems to have gone down on this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it - poor design","review":"I can't stand this thing. The tap is one inch above the bottom of the container so you can't empty it properly. Even if you tilt it, the water rushes to the two cavities either side of the tap. Refilling it is the worst though. You can only do a little at a time and it's awkward to fit under the tap. Forget about filling it unless your sink is completely empty. If you tip it up the filter falls out. The filter pebbles frequently come out the top and can easily end up in your water. Quite simply I hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Saver","review":"With far fewer trips back and fourth from the fridge to the sink this dipenser is a real time saver versus the pitcher. I like the LCD vanishing bars to alert you when a new filter is needed. My refridgerator also has shelves that slide out which helps with filling. I find reaching back and pulling up on the lid's left rear corrner the easiest method for popping the top off. The filters do a fantastic job of making our town water taste great. My Wife was hooked on Aquafina (She rejected all other brands.) Britta won her over! No more Aquafina bottles filling our recycling bin. The spotlight is now on the first word in the slogan- REDUCE reuse recycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are these people talking about?","review":"I've owned this item for about 18 months now and love it. Yes, I have experienced a small amount of leakage on occasion from the seal on the spigot. Very minor leakage, as in a few drops over the course of a week or more. The improvement in the quality of my tap water is well worth that small issue. I've experienced no mold or any other kind of sanitary issue at all. It is larger than a pitcher, and therefore not terribly easy to fill if you're yanking it out of your firdge and trying to put it under a tap. I use a plastic cup, filling it through the opening on the top while still in the fridge, and have no difficulty doing that. Maybe I'm just too thrilled by having such and improvement in the quality of my water as compared to the tap, and I'd be happy with any water filter, but I am amazed to see such negative reviews for a product I have been so satisfied with."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!!

Bought it for our small office because I was tired of drinking pool water. After the first filter was replaced, tho, I started noticing problems. Funny taste to the water within days of replacing the filter; I noticed some of the water wasn't draining into the tank, but sitting up top fermenting (I guess). I started wiping it out with a paper towel soaked in vinegar. I guess if I did this every day, it wouldn't be a problem, but what a pain! Even propping it up doesn't seem to help. It has to be the design that is causing the problem. We live in a dry climate (NM) and the water was being used up regularly so mold shouldn't have been an issue.My PUR pitcher doesn't have that problem. I'm probably going to pitch this one and buy a PUR pitcher for the office.

Perhaps it was just pulled and shipped in error. I didn't really think it worth the hassle of returning, particularly as I don't even pay attention to the \\"manual\\" (sticker) change indicators but was interested, if there was a price difference in the two products, of receiving a refund of the difference.Amazon offered to ship out another right away, instead I chose to keep it (I was also concerned after all the hassle I may end up with the same exact thing) and they refunded me the shipping cost plus a little extra as the item was already discounted more since my order.Maybe it still deserves 5 start but I figure no one will notice the review if I give it that many.Amazon, however, deserves 5 stars for their great customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt Free and Thirst Quenched!

The dispenser fits nicely in the refrigerator and the water tastes great. I think we are actually drinking more water than before. One thing that I really like is that I can fill and lift it myself, which was harder with the water cooler replacement bottles. The drawbacks mentioned in other reviews are true--you need to remove if from the refrigerator to fill it and you can't really drain it to the bottom.

Removing the storage reservoir from the tank below it is extremely difficult. Algae grows in the tank after a month so it MUST be cleaned. The only way to clean it is to pull the reservoir out of the tank. Good luck! It fits very snugly -- so snugly that it won't come out.Just look at the picture and you'll easily see what I mean. Water is placed in the upper reservoir and subsequently filters into the dispenser. That works fine. I contacted Britta for the secret. \\"Put it in the freezer. Then it will come out easily.\\" That failed. There are no instructions for separating the two pieces in the directions. This is a huge design flaw. Do not buy this dispenser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moldy, dirty and leaky...","review":"So, I have to agree with all the others who said it leaks and it grows mold.... because it definitely does. But also I returned this product 3 times because of it's leakiness and also one of them was cracked upon purchase. I contacted Brita through e-mail and got NO RESPONSE. Not only does it grow mold on the outside of the spigot around the o ring where you can see it, but also on the inside where you can't. G.R.O.S.S.

Filters are cheap and doesn't last very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect solution for a family","review":"We have been using the Ultramax for eight months. We had a regular Brita Pitcher, but when it is full it was too heavy for our young children to lift and pour. This model with a spout lets the kids refill their glasses without mess. It is also easy to refill and it never leaks when you take it from the sink back to the fridge.Some of the reviews mention a vent in the lid leading to fridge odors - there is no vent in the lid of mine. There is less air flow than a standard pitcher. The water never tastes off. We have to refill it at least every other day so it doesn't have time to sit and collect odor either.To contradict another review, the spigot never leaks and is situated close to the bottom of the tank. I tip it to get that last half-cup of water out, but no big deal. We have had no mold issues either. Please note that several of the 1-star reviews were made by the same person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what i wanted","review":"This is a wonderful product.

It constantly leaks around the spout and makes a mess in the fridge. I always have to be careful of what I put on the shelves under the pitcher because the items below always get a little damp. It is incredibly difficult to clean around the spout, where bacteria grow. It is also hard to refil the pitcher. There is only a little opening for water to be poured into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks.....badly","review":"Bought this at target. The spigot is cheap plastic now as well as the nut on the other side. Furthermore, there is only 1 O-ring which is on the inside of the unit. I filled up the unit to discover all the water on the floor of my refrigerator and kitchen floor in only 30 mins. When I attempted to tighten spigot, it never gets tight. As it is plastic, it just rolls over and never stops turning nor gets tight. Although my experience might not be typical and might be extreme, the obvious design flaw leaves everybody vulnerable eventually, which is what you can read in other reviews. If Brita had any brains, they would use a much sturdier screw and nut assembly as it will break eventually; or immediately, as it did in my case.

However, the Ultramax dispenser was a disappointment. The capacity is not much larger than my old pitcher, and the water flow out of the spout is very slow. I have to leave the fridge door open while I wait for my glass to fill up, whereas before I had the fridge door open for just a second while I took out the pitcher, filled my glass almost instantly, and then had it back in the fridge, all in less time than it takes for the Ultramax to fill my glass.

I live in an old building and the entire point of the purchase is as insurance against any residual lead. I was skeptical but ordered anyway based on the description; however when the unit arrived it was clear from enclosed specifications that this is not true (or at least, no lead reduction is attested to by Brita).

I couldn't get the plastic insert out of the reservoir. I called Brita and they told me to put it in the freezer. I can't believe their answer to a defect in the manufacturing process is put it in the freezer. I still couldn't get it out and I called them back. I had to wait for them to send me a label to ship it back. I then had to ship it back and then wait for them to ship me another one.

Nearly from the start, it's been leaking around the spigot. I was blaming my refrigerator for the little puddles on the lower shelves, but then I pinpointed the problem. I'd stocked up on filters, so I tried to deal with it for a while by putting an aluminum pan underneath it, with a notch cut out for the spigot. I'm finally on my last filter, and now it starts to dribble every time I open the spigot, beyond the edge of my pan. I'm ready to throw in the towel (or stop throwing in the towel!) and get some other brand.I probably should have given it just one star, but I'm a generous guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-airtight filter design creates issues","review":"I was initially happy with this product until I noticed some sediment forming in a ring underneath the filter itself. I figured it was a faulty filter and replaced it. Not too long afterwards it also started forming the same sediment ring.My guess is that if you pour water into the basin too quickly, it can \\"rock\\" the filter from its base and allow some unfiltered water to leak in. Whatever the case, I've decided to try the Pur filter instead, which does have a lock-in seal as well as a barrier that prevents water from gushing over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, not ready for prime time","review":"Brita filters do a great job filtering water. I thought the large capacity and the dispenser system was convenient. Within a few days of purchase, it was leaking. I repaired this by tightening the nut and bolt system at the spout. About 9 months later, I am struggling with mold building up in the corners. I wash the dispenser weekly with warm soapy water and a non-abrasive brush. The sharp corners inside and also around the spout are VERY difficult to clean and that is where the mold builds up. I got rid of this and purchased the 10 glass capacity pitcher by Brita. The rounded design inside is less likely to grow any vegetation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!","review":"Got this because I liked the big capacity and the fact that I could leave it in the fridge. Unfortunately, it leaks. The leak comes from where the spigot connects to the reservoir. I tightened the nut as tight as I dared (didn't want to break the plastic), but no matter what I do it still leaks. I contacted Brita and they sent a replacement, but they only sent the reservoir, a new spigot, and a new washer. No new nut. So it was worthless. Stick with a pitcher and avoid this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOLD","review":"Oh boy.

They are not reviews of this current model. This redesign is a not a good one. The filtration reservoir is very difficult to remove from the filtered water reservoir so prepare to get wet when cleaning. The old model fill top was easy to get off - could be done with one hand. The new model is more difficult - takes me two hands. The also changed the filtration reservoir so it holds less water - not a huge amount less, but less.

Unfortunately, it lacks a summary chapter that gives a comprehensive listing of its properties. Specifically, there should be one chapter listing known values of its electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties. This book should have included a chapter that summarized the known compounds of this element, be they ceramics, intermetallics, or coordination complexes. As such, I would not recommend purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy, Helpful Read","review":"Refreshingly conversational and informal, this is the kind of book you can go through in 3 days, the pages turn so quickly. LaRose does a good job of bringing you inside the house, well the shell of it anyway, and seeing both his and his wife's predictable reactions to one frustration after another. The book itself is a great idea; everyone knows someone with these types of horror stories, but this serves a purpose as a warning sign of some of the problems that WILL (not \\"could\\", not \\"might\\") be involved in home renovation. I highly recommend it for anyone who's thinking of doing anything major to their home and hope to keep to some sort of budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed, Cried, Learned, Laughed again","review":"I was skeptical about this book, but LaRose proved that a story about renovating an old house and nearly demolishing a new marriage can be hilarious, touching, and educational all at the same time. I have never renovated, nor plan to, but this book was still fun and entertaining. A friend gave it to me as an engagement gift, if you can believe it!

Most of the tracks are quite funky and one would think it was a black saxaphone player instead of a white one and that's good. Dulfer is not the most original musician but it really doesn't matter. It's not hard core funk but does make one want to shake his or her booty. Highly recommended if you're in a soulful mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter did not fit","review":"The part number was correct according to the Owners manual, but the size was not correct.

Hubbard's usually beautiful tone is flat and ugly,and it's nothing to do with the muffled quality of the recording. The tone is just harsh and ugly. I listened to Red Clay the day after I popped this one out of my car cd and there's no comparison. You keep praying for the missing saxophone player to finally show up so Freddie can have a break.

The dimensions are a little larger than described (by about a inch or two), which is all the better. The one negative: if you load the bag to capacity (which it can easily handle), in time the front strap that closes the flap will become frayed from constant use and will eventually wear to the point of breaking. But one would have to carry about 20-30lbs. of material virtually every day for a year for that to happen, as is the case with me. Bottom line: if you take care of the the bag, it will take care of you.

Then I read the review on amazon. The owner of the store called my attention to it as a book not to buy. As I looked throught the book, it became apparent the best part of the book is the cover. The book pictures a lot of postcards that a reputable a dealer would put in a twenty five cent box. The cards pictured had missing corners, heavy damage and lots of ground in grime, this reveiw sounds like a commercial for laundry soap, sorry. Even the better cards shown in the book came from a different source than most of those pictured in the book, probably an internet action source because thes images were crystal clear althought somewhat smaller in size with no damage noted. The prices listed for the cards are not realistic at all. If you are interested in postcards, buy the books by Mashburn and others.

I give it 5/5 for durability, still looks good and works properly. It isn't the most versatile pedal out there, but for the sticker price it works. I will say that I liked the tone it gave when I had a solid state amp. Now that I upgraded to an all tube amp, it doesn't sound the same. But, it does still sound good. It has a way hotter sound through the tubes, all in all I love it, and even after my new Boss MT-2 arrives and gets plugged in, I will find room for the Fab Tone, it still works, why get rid of it. It will just give me that old fashioned Metallica sound from Kill'em All.Be sure to get the plug in adapter to save the 9 volters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best distortion pedal ever","review":"Keep in mind, this is not the sort of pedal you want to use all the time. It is not your standby to produce your general distorted guitar sounds. This thing is absolutely insane, over the top, fuzzy, velcro-like distortion. It has a very specific sound and should be used carefully. All in all, it is one of my favorites. the band Mogwai swears by this pedal. Listen to the song Rano Pano for a good example of how it sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurl, then whirl","review":"2 1/2If not for the third and final track in another short full length, the disc's dated dichotomy of electronic invigoration and pop desperation would have been busted beyond repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Dream With Some Vocals","review":"Unfortunately, not a very good Tangerine Dream album, but when you've got over 60 CDs released, the occasional non-favorite is to be expected.

Cyclone is the first album that Tangerine Dream used vocals to their music. Jolliffe was also part of T.D. on one of the first line-ups in the groups history, back in -68. This album was slaughtered by most of the fans, but not by me! His vocals suits perfect to this kind of music. He does a tremendous job on both \\"Rising runner missed by the endless sender\\" and \\"Bent cold sidewalk\\". The instrumental \\"madrigal meridian\\" is brilliant too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated....even by Tangerine Dream members!","review":"In an old interview Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese referred to Cyclone as a \\"failed experiment\\" while many fans despise it because it has vocals.To be fair there are no actual songs like on their forgotten Kaleidoscope.True there are vocals at the beginning and end of Bent Cold Sidewalk but the third and longest track Madrigal Meridian has no vocals at all.Cyclone is full of driving pulsing music with some vaguely artsy lyrics blending nicely in.The final track mellows out near the end to haunting effect.At under 40 minutes it's a little short to make a big impact but in no way is it as bad as many people claim.Some of the music was actually resurrected by Tangerine Dream in Dream Mixes 4 so maybe in the end Edgar Froese didn't think Cyclone was such a lost cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please skip the Lyrics TD","review":"I own 50 or so TD Cd's with a lot being of the 5 star caliber, this in not one of them.

This is one of the handful of Tangerine Dream albums that every music lover ought to own.

What I find most helpful about it is that it honors the subjectivity of qualitative methods. It is a feminist approach that begins with the self as knower, not an easy transition for those trained in the positivist tradition. Furthermore, Margot Ely involves her students in the writing of the book, demonstrating the peer relationships she establishes with learners and the possibilities for collaborative learning among adults. It is a great book full of ideas and reassurance. It s not a step-by-step guide to a particular approach or method. Rather, it is a guide to experiencing fully being a qualitative researcher and the level of engagement and transformation researchers should expect from the undertaking.

It would have been nice to have some step-by-step examples though.Aside from that, the book is geared toward the graphic artist and the professional sample projects are excellent.Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong recommendation","review":"This product was recommended and Amazon said it fit my vehicle but it does not (2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee).

They all seem to be mad at the book because it's not some other book they thought it was going to be. What it IS, is a fantastic shuffle of images and characters that resolves, like an old-fashioned animation, into a kind of narrative. And, as in an animation, a lot of the characters look so alike it's easy to mistake one for another. You can regard that as a bug or a feature; your choice.For the record, this book is not much like a book by Neil Gaiman. It's a lot like books by Christopher Moore and a little like books by Jeff Noon. Maybe a little Terry Pratchett thrown in for luck. I would give it five stars or six, but all the popular kids are already doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsubtle attempted satire","review":"I bought this on the basis of the fact that it came recommended by Neil Gaiman, whose taste is normally impeccable. When the book arrived, I cracked it open, hoping for a clever, funny read in the vein of Mr. Gaiman. What I got instead was a heavy-handed missive about homelessness. Now, I'm not saying homelessness isn't a problem that needs to be talked about and exposed. It is. I just don't appreciate opening a book sold as an urban-fantasy-adventure-with-moral-lessons and getting a lecture on homelessness with all the subtlety of a bag of bricks. I understand the author's point - he intended to write a satire, a novel in which our attitudes towards the homeless (viewed through the lens of our reaction to the transient fairies) are examined and challenged. The problem is, satire requires great subtlety, and as stated, Millar just doesn't display any here. Even the \\"twist romance\\" is, well, definitely not a twist from the start. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will read a cereal box if Neil Gaiman tells me to but...","review":"This is actually the second time that Mr. Gaiman has recommended something I found ho hum. The first was perhaps above me intellectually. this is below most of the fifth graders I know. Real Fairies in New York? If someone had sprayed a can of Raid on these things I think it would have been the high point of the book for me. Were there two fairies or three? I lost track.

C'mon! I don't wanna have to go to the UK to buy the rest (or take out a personal loan to buy 'em on Amazon or Alibris!!) jeez!Thanks Mr Millar, for a GREAT read, and one - like Tom Holt - that i'm sure i will read again, again, and again.

I can sometimes read humorous fantasy fanfic online, but almost nothing annoys me more than finding that I've found a whole book of the stuff. So credit to Millar that I liked this frothy little book anyhow. Fairy musicians who get kicked out for playing the Ramones; true love in the inimitable style of the late 1980s; a character with Crohn's disease and blue hair;, fairy gangs of New York; the ghost of Johnny Thunders. It is all very silly, honestly-- but still manages to be a whole lot of fun. Somehow.It does not make me want to rush out and buy another book buy Millar (although I may give one of his Martin Scott books a go) but I have to own to several loud chortles as I read.

Which ultimately meant the book was on his shelf for about 5 years. And then he kicked himself for not reading it sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the hype and big endorsement from Neil Gaiman, perhaps my expectations were too high. The characters are imaginative but the story is thin and after awhile all the quirkiness of the characters became tiresome. I donated the book to my local library. Hopefully, someone else will appreciate it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whimsical","review":"Morag and Heather are a pair of Scottish fairies who are exiled from their clans due to a regrettable mistake and due to an even bigger one, end up in New York City. They part ways over a feud and end up befriending a hapless pair of humans--Heather takes Dinnie, perhaps the worst fiddler in humankind, and Morag takes Kerry, a tragic young girl with Crohn's and a colostomy bag.Now, two country Scottish girls in a big city can stir up a lot of fracas. We discover that every population of NYC has its own fairy representation and those fairies are after Heather or Morag for various reasons.\\"Fairies\\" is well written with the infamous understated dry Scottish wit. The pacing wasn't quite the rollick I'd have hoped for. Humor isn't quite as funny if you're slogging through a bog of text to get to it.Characters just didn't grab my attention or my heart. I admire Millar's attempt at having a colostomy patient as a heroine, but people's natural fear of the disease doesn't bring us closer to Kerry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely intelligible","review":"I bought this book under the impression that I might be reading an intelligent fantasy novel. As a great fan of literary fantasy, I try very hard to discover and support books of this genre. With a foreword by Neil Gaiman, I thought I couldn't lose. I'm not sure Gaiman even read the book when he wrote the foreword.This is one of the worst books I've ever tried to read. I'll admit to being a literary snob, but I've read romance novels more engaging. This novel has no depth to it--or if it does, it's in the second half of the book that I didn't bother to read. The narration is completely straightfoward and unenthusiastic with a seemingly limited knowledge of the variety of English words and sentence structure available. It reads like a comic book without the pictures. If you're looking for something like Jonathan Strange or Stardust, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"I was recommended this book as something that fans of Susanna Clarke's novel, Jonathon Strange and Mr. Norrell, would like. I read all the reviews and figured I couldn't go wrong.Well, I was. I'm not saying this is an awful book. The idea for the story is very creative, and certainly has potential, but the end result is not impressive. I felt like I was reading a very long childrens book, with some sex thrown in so it could be pushed as a grown up fairy tale (really, there are these phone sex ads on TV that add nothing to the story whatsoever). I didn't feel I could really connect with the characters, and there is so much jumping around it left me with no desire to develop any interest in anyone's story.I will say again, it wasn't completely horrid. But I wont be reading it again, and I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known what I was really buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ma Masterpiece","review":"This album is timeless.

But by the second album Zap Mama was becoming a showplace for leader Marie Daulne and by now sounds like a mere catalog of her jet-setter whims. Another annoying example of Luaka Bop's littla-this, littla-that gentility. Shame on anyone who accepts the hip-hop on this album as anything more than tacked-on cool.

Horner really knows how to capture the flavor of a world and of a time (as evidenced in his scores for ALIENS, TITANIC, STAR TREK II, COCOON, GLORY and on and on), and WILLOW is no exception.

It's classically adventurous and at timeshauntingly angelic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Horner's best","review":"It's hard to describe how good this soundtrack is. Horner combines non-Western instruments with great themes to produce one of his best scores ever. There are at least four dominant themes, all of which are memorable. Willow's Theme compete's with Glory and Star Trek II as Horner's best theme. Horner does remarkably little \\"borrowing\\" from himself, as he is known to do. Khan's theme from Star Trek 2 is interspersed through the album, and a few others have a few phrases from other Horner scores.The only problem with this release (and the German Phantom release) is that 74 minutes of music CANNOT be satisfactarily be divided onto only 8 tracks. Track 7 (Bavmorda's Spell is Cast) is over 18 minutes long! There could have been easily 15+ tracks on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great score!","review":"I gre up watching movies like Willow, and i still love them, this soundtrack is trully amazing, The music is powerful , full of action and makes one feel as if theyr ein the movie itself.

Alas, the soundtrack to \\"Willow\\" is one of these times. As well as the music works in the film, and I believe does, this reviewer just cannot get over the similarity between the 'Escape fromt the Tavern\\" theme and the third movement of Schumann's \\"Rhenish\\" Symphony.

After a while, you just don't care. The main male lead, Adam, was very wishy-washy. He just kept changing his mind back and forth all the time about helping her or not. If he truly loved her, no question. And how deep could their commitment be if he decided to see the other girl April within being with his fiance a total or two days in Mobile? After a while, you don't care what happens to Shona either. She is kinda mousy.She deserves whatever she gets. As far as eroticism in this book...its not there.

About as sexy as a toothache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic amateur attempt","review":"I don't know what book some of the other reviewers read, but it wasn't this one.

The basic Gertie ball is soft enough and light enough that we can toss it around in the house and it bounces harmlessly off most things (as long as it's not thrown too hard - there are limits). We pull it out at random times and kick it/toss it/throw it at each other and always end up laughing. Note: the bumpy Gertie balls are heavier so not quite as \\"harmless\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect for my twins","review":"My twins are at the age where they find balls so interesting. They can play with one for hours, it seems like. I was in the market for a sturdy ball that could hold the weight of them laying on the ball and jumping onto the ball. I also wanted to find a ball that was soft enough to not hurt so much when one twin would throw the ball at the other twins' head. The Gertie ball seems to fit the bill. We can inflate the ball as much or as little as we like. The balls are soft, yet tough for little ones who rather chew or lay on the ball. The most important part is that the kids love them. They sit and giggle at each other when one throws the ball or when they bounce the ball-- it has a very good bounce by the way. I received two of the same color (green) as other reviewers mentioned. I would rather have two different colors so that way they do not fight over the same ball. Either way, it's a good, simple, quality toy that will have years of use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Kids Grew Up on This Album","review":"This album brings tears to my eyes and has ever since we first I heard it.

After a while, the sequencers kick in and sound upon sound is layered together to form a chaotic yet controlled composition.

What I mean is that you can't really sit down and listen to this album as attentively as you can with \\"Phaedra.\\" You have to be really relaxed to get the full effect...but what effect! I almost prefer this album to \\"Phaedra\\" because there are less songs, ergo less changes in mood, and the sound sort of drifts from one mood to the next.

It could have been a very interesting story - Lee Harvey Oswald's mother's point of view. However, it was written not too long after President Kennedy was assassinated (1965), and Ms. Stafford obviously still had those events fresh in her mind when she interviewed Mrs. Oswald. Ms. Stafford's opinions of Mrs. Oswald were biased and she failed to allow Mrs. Oswald's point of view to come through. She refused to let the reader have his or her opinion of Mrs. Oswald. This was a total failure, since we may have been able to possibly understand (even a fraction) another side of Lee Harvey Oswald.

After a short time watching the events around the unjust abuse experienced by this innocent, trusting woman, I could only feel pity that several women have had to deal with similar or worse circumstances caused by men. There is an argument (weak one) justifying some of the man's action; he felt love for this woman and had great difficulty expressing his emotions in a conventional manner.

It's a more obscure type of British film that is about a man- an entomologist who collects butterflies. He ends up seeing a woman in a pub one day and decides to drug her, kidnap her and take her back to his home out in the countryside.There he imprisons her in some type of stone dwelling on the side of his house and visits everyday to talk to her and have her entertain him with conversation. He seems in love with her but some warped type of love or control deal. At the end you realize he really probably wasn't (he got over it quick) and is a real sicko.The actor plays a great sociopath type. You keep hoping he'll let the woman go eventually. The movie builds good tension and has suspense. If you can look past the 60's music, the dated look of the film, etc.. you will like it.

Two weakness of this book: the first one is the fact that it is published in 2005, which is in the middle of a bull market and thus may not therefore be up to date. More up to date information should therefore be sought online in the Morningstar website as well as other websites. The second weakness is the relative lack of comments of the international perspectives, especially on emerging markets like China and Latin America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in Geek.","review":"While if I studied the book for weeks, I may be able to gain the useful info I was trying to obtain.

There are some questions that cannot be answered... yet at the same time none of the games have featured stories that were next to impossible for me to follow. This comic was guilty of that crime, as it bounces around way too much, and the artwork is perhaps too sloppy and muddy to make it clear what is going on. By the time I finished reading this comic I had a whopper of a headache trying to follow this story.I hope the other Silent Hill comics fared better. I'm more tempted to blame the art work than the writing on this one because if the art work had been clear enough to convey the story I might have been able to follow it better.I was disappointed when I learned that the Metal Gear Solid features similar art in their comics, and simply I plan to avoid it too, I simply cannot interpret the story from this slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Sporadic and Hard-to-Follow SH Comic from Scott Ciencin","review":"Decent artwork with some really cool creature designs.Otherwise, the story, (from what I gathered), wasn't very interesting. The writing is composed of numerous partial sentences and the whole presentation just moves way too fast. Perhaps the story would have done more for me if it didn't come off like the nonsensical ramblings of a homeless man.There's almost no point in writing this review.

My two year old loves this book! I would give it five stars based on his love for it except for the fact that there are times that Mommy is not in the mood to be creative and make up her own story to it since it is strictly a picture book. Most of the time, it is not a problem, the pictures make the story easy to tell, but sometimes I am just not in the mood. However, my son adores this book and has learned how the pictures help tell the story as we discuss, for example, which way the truck will go when it reaches a fork in the road and how there is fog on the bridge. As a certified early childhood teacher, I know how important that skill is in learning how to read, so I love that about this book. All in all, this book is a wonderful addition to our home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Choice for Preschoolers, Especially Boys","review":"Semi trucks, with their noise and power, hold an unspeakable attraction for young children, especially boys. This wordless book follows a semi on one of its long journeys -- through tunnels, over bridges, through traffic, with a stopover at a truck stop... ending at the loading dock with a cargo if tricycles unloaded. The outsized bulk of the truck is emphasized in close-up view by showing only portions of it when close-up, and there is a wonderful aerial perspective of its place in the traffic world as the red vehicle wends its way through a complicated mixing-bowl exit.Wordless books make good self-entertainment for preschoolers, and this one has enough unexplained road signs scattered through its scenes that it can provide some learning opportunities for older children as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true picture book","review":"The lack of words (other than street signs or on other trucks) allows parents to extrapolate as they see fit. You are free to tell the story three times in a row and tell it three different ways.

Perfect for any baby boy (or girl!).Given that even the hardcover (Truck) and paperback (Truck) editions are as wordless as this board book, why does Amazon list the reading level of those at 4-8 years?P.S.

Deceptive description.","review":"The book description is very deceptive. The description makes it sound as if the book shows all types of scenery as the Truck travels the U.S. I thought it would be a great book to help my youngster see a bit of America. But beware, most of the pages are ONLY close-ups of the side of the Truck and of road signs. Only 3 or 4 pages show scenery; very disappointing. I thought the book was so awful that I am returning it, paying the postage, and don't care if I lose money on the deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you for real? WORDLESS BOOK?","review":"I do not recommend this book to any parent. It makes me really doubt the legitimacy of the Caldecott Honor's.There are no words, no story line... just big, boxy, ugly, images of trucks.The other reviews that state it's a great book to teach shapes and colors. I can recommend many other books that are better than this, including Caldecott Honor books.Instead of buying this book, if you want a wordless book on trucks you would be better served buying a photo truck book.

Are not any where to be seen within the interface.Also, their support line goes to an answering machine (I've called several times over a three week stretch and have yet to hear back) and their email support falls silent.

I have to unplug the unit to get it up and running again.This isn't a good thing when you are hosting a few domains and e-mail for friends and have to keep going onsite to reboot the unit. It is wierd in that the lockup only occurs when people log in to access webmail.

I want to give it to my granddaughter, now age six, when she is 18; yes, twelve years from now when she is going to college, when she might be ready to hear about what her grandmother's generation tried to do for her and how hard the struggle was. Perhaps, also, I want to make sure that she keeps high expectations for herself, knowing all the women who had high hopes for her.It seems to me that we start the women's movement over and over and over again.

They are women who are rich or poor, educated or less so, but the single trait they have in common is extraordinary persistence no matter how tough things get. Although this book was first published 29 years ago, it strikes me as having particular relevance to these difficult times. For anyone who has ever felt like giving up-and who hasn't--keep this book on your bedside table. It's like having a mentor.And if you don't have time to read each story, take a good look at Lynn Gilbert's photographs. These are real women with heart, soul, humanity and humility--and Gilbert succeeds in capturing those elements in a single picture.Bonnie Webster"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea vs. Execution","review":"2 1/2 starsAttempting another soundscape masterpiece, Stratosphere has not aged so well. The music - simple, the production- dated, the performances- uninspired. There are attempts at greatness, hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping. Mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as Jarre or Kraftwerk than their more inspired material. Whereas on an album like Phaedra, the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated, on Stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at, rather then truly feel. The self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay, but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating synth-bass-cheese, you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Just some classic Tangerine Dream electronic music.

I'm pretty impressed with it for what it is.Don't get me wrong, it will not replace a 2 hp honkin' tiller, but for a small garden and with not-so hard soil, this will do just fine on a good power head (I have the Poulan Pro PP133).It does a better job of mixing compost, manure, topsoil and humus together than a metal rake. It will also dig a pretty good chunk into lighter soils. I have a lot of clay here, and I had to wet the clay down a little before it would really rip it up, but it did it.Overall, I like it and would recommend it for the situations I described.~~~~~Update 7/17/12The plastic slot that holds the shaft from the power head is garbage. It stripped out while tilling up my garden. It's bascially worthless at this point. In addition, the tiller head itself gets stuff tangled in it easily and that also makes it worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"the weak link","review":"We tilled up a few small beds when the shaft broke off from the cultivator.

If Tolkien were alive, imagine how he would shudder at the very idea that you are paying $90 for something that doesn't exist! Rare books like this should not be used to take advantage of buyers. They should be available at a reasonable price (but oh, that binding is so expense) to allow people normally unable to purchase them an opportunity to do so.

Gould does not discuss training until you are half way through the book. The training starts with introducing the dog to the field and the waist cord. You will do better to look elsewhere for more in depth training information, especially if you need to start training at the basic level of come, sit and stay. I would recomend \\"Game Dog\\" by Wolters. He is precise and compasionate in his training techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confidence is a two way street.","review":"I felt that Mike Gould's book was a positive move away from the majority of the other training books I have read on the subject. The author makes a point to establish confidence in your dog while at the same time building the dog's confidence in you. After reading this book, I realized that I was asking the dog for too much control and I was teaching the dog to act against its god given insticts. I wish I had read this book earlier in my dog's training, but I still found it very useful for an already started dog. I use my dog as both a waterfowler retriever and as an upland flushing dog and I felt Mr. Gould did an excellent job in training for the all-around hunting dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I am a novice upland hunter who recently purchased a lab and wanted to train him as a hunting companion. Based on the reviews and description I thought this book would be a good place to start. I was very wrong. The first 50 or so pages are the author carrying on about what is wrong with the field trial circuit and justifying his feelings, he could have summed this up with a single line and moved on. Each chapter is light on actual training technique and heavy on tangential stories of different dogs/trainers/ and how good he or the dogs/trainers are and it adds little value to the book. With regard to training for handling the author actually writes that it would be redundant for him to cover handling so he won't. At that point I threw the book down and will not continue. This book was frustrating to read, the author changes his tone and point of view several times in each chapter, and with a byline of 'Training the Labrador Retriever...' I thought this book completely missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag - worth picking up on the cheap","review":"This is a chillout CD that really doesn't compare in overall quality to similar CDs put out by Ultra Records.

But a CD like this needs to set a consistent mood, and for that you need a DJ/Producer who's willing to provide an overall vision and sequence the tracks in a meaningful way. There are too many throwaways on this CD for me to recommend it as a purchase for most people, sorry to say, and I'm someone who really enjoys chillout and downtempo mixes.The cover model is Jessica Hall.

They are probably going to think twice about my advice from now on. Not a one of us liked it. Maybe it's because I'm into something happening when I read a book. The unconsumated marriage, the problem, the miracle all seemed contrived to me. The author wanted to show her knowledge of history, and tacked it on to a romance. To be honest, the whole book seems to be about why Juliana and Sebastian can't do it, and then why they can with a little bit of action thrown in. And lots and lots of talk. The thing that really caused me to give up on this book, was when Juliana copied Sebastian's words in announcing the problem. I kept waiting for the halo to appear around her head. That's the kind of book this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Cup of Tea","review":"I picked this up because of the good reviews not only here but on TRR and AAR.

Don't get me wrong, Sebastian and Juliana did have a sweet love for each other (although I had a hard time with his disability...YUCK) but there was absulutely nothing at all exciting about this book. I was not blissfully anticipating the next page or chapter. I did not squirm and my heart strings never ached. I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about. All in all, more than a little dissapointing. I will not be in line to buy the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not really sure why I liked this book so much","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was one thing and finding that it was something else. Yes, it's wordy, but it flows beautifully, almost poetically. The characters are deep, but sometimes boring. The plot is one of the most original I've read, yet it lacked excitement. The love story is beautiful, but very drawn out. I hated the ending, it left me feeling lost. But overall I'd have to say that I liked the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical Karen Ranney book","review":"This book was very slow and very boring.

I don't want those things to overshadow the romance. Sebastian and Juliana spend most of the book thinking about each other or watching each other. BORING. As far as the earlier reviewer's concern with the \\"boinking\\" [sic] scenes, whatever. They were few and only in the last 75 pages of the book. I thought the secret and the miracle and the resolution of seemingly insurmountable problems just a bit pat.

The hero and heroine slowly getting to know each other, falling in love, and building the tension before they actually make love. That's a romance! Anybody can just jump in the sack - a romance is supposed to be about having feelings for each other.I didn't think it was perfect, however. Even though the dialogue was very good, I occasionally found some of their statements odd (like when Juliana asks Sebastian if he is \\"death\\"). There were a few other kinks along the way, and the ending was a bit pat, but those things are very minor in view of how great this book was overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The versatile guy I found !!!","review":"I was searching for some serious Indian Classical Singer.

If you read and loved TBOMC and you're curious to know what happened in the lives of Francesca and Robert between their last day together and their deaths, this is the book for you.TBOMC told the story of how Robert and Francesca met, their few days together and how her children find out about all of this when their mother dies. It gave us a pretty good picture of Francesca's life and left most of Robert's a mystery. We do know that they never see each other again, so don't expect this to happen here. However, if after reading TBOMC, you want to know more about the mystery that is Robert Kincaid's life and find out how Francesca lived the rest of her life, this will be a very enjoyable book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah right","review":"This is, what you call, a quest for money... Considering the planetary success of \\"Bridges...\\" it became obvious that any day now, one should expect a sequel... Which is not entirely bad, when you come down to the bottom... what makes it bad is how that sequel was written...Without any kind of emotion, or as once were said for Kerouac \\"that is not writing, it is typing\\", with cheap philosophy, small minded attacks on academic world or any kind of higher education, presenting life in a way that never existed, with narrative that every house wife can tell you in five to six minutes, it is a sad thing that someone actually printed this.Well, what can you say, if you have any taste, you will skip this one, you can think of a better ending of \\"Bridges...\\" for yourself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I loved this book, I could not put it down.

Yes, it would have been wonderful if Francesca and Robert could have met again later in life but we know from reading Bridges, they did not. They both lived a good life having their ashes sprinkled over Roseman Bridge upon their deaths. In A Thousand Country Roads, it's like you get your hopes up that there's a possibility they will see each other again all the while knowing it's just not going to happen. This book tells a little bit of what happened in their lives after meeting each other and confirms that what they had was indeed unique and very special. Neither could be with anyone else for a lifetime afterwards. I read the book simply because the first story touched me so deeply. This one left me feeling blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert James Waller should have left well enough alone.","review":"If ever there was a book that shouldn't have been written, this is it. This epilogue was terrible. The Bridges of Madison County was such a triumph. It was perfect. It left you wanting more, but in a good way.

It wish I had never read this epilogue. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good closure","review":"I liked Bridges better, but I was so excited to read this book and find out more about Robert Kincaid. I think the reason I didn't quite like this book as much as Bridges is because I already knew that Robert and Franscesca would not meet again, so it couldn't contain the same passion as Bridges; however, this book did bring closure about Kincaid and let me know more about his life which is something I have thought about since reading the first book. In a few days I am heading out to Winterset for the third time and it will be even more special to me now than it was after reading Bridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Desecration to The Bridges of Madison County...","review":"Once in a while, a writer spins a tale that touches your heart and connects your soul with the souls of the characters in the book, who in this case would be Francesca and Robert Kincaid. The Bridges of Madison County did just that, not only for me, but for millions of other readers as well. A Thousand Country Roads is a book that I feel was written only to capitalize upon the fame (and fortune) the previous book generated for Waller. He knew people would buy this book because of their love of the first book. A Thousand Country Roads should have been titled A Thousand Disappointments...Really, I don't know what I expected from this book, I knew from Bridges that Robert Kincaid and Francesca would never meet again. Bridges did not need an epilogue, some things are just best left to the imagination of the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disastrous epilogue to an excellent story","review":"It would have been much better if this book had never been written. The story in this volume takes place in the time period after the wandering photographer (Robert Kincaid) left Madison County, Iowa, following his short love affair with the conventional wife of an Iowa farmer (Francesca Johnson), until his death. Actually there is not much discussion about Francesca; rather the story is focused on Robert's new discovery of his forgotten son produced from a one-night sexual encounter with a free-spirited girl in Northern California when Robert was much younger. This epilogue dilutes the beautiful love story between Robert and Francesca described in The Bridges of Madison County, which I have always defended against pretentious friends who regarded it as a trashy romance novel. It appears to me that Robert James Waller was forced to write this terrible \\"A Thousand Country Roads\\" for some reason which I don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"I saw this book at a store and immediately felt I had to buy it.

I kept turning page after page after page, still waiting for the reunion. Instead, I was introduced to characters I had never heard of nor did I care to meet.By the end of the book, I felt robbed of the chance to have closure for this couple. All I could think was poor Francesca...all her life she spent waiting and hoping...what a disappointment.

Bridges followers,As with the original Bridges, I read a Thousand Roads at one sitting. I could not put it down.Waller has done a magnificent job of connecting most of the important Bridges dots and produced a clear Thousand Roads picture. In connecting the dots he has brought closure to Bridges and left the door open for a sequel with Carlisle.In a few weeks, I will be traveling to Alpine, Texas, to visit the publisher's book store and hopefully obtain a signed copy of a Thousand Roads. Since, I was born and reared in Fort Stockton, Texas, I am familiar with the area. Maybe even have a chance encounter with the author who lives on a ranch near Alpine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I started reading this book about five times before I forced myself to continue, and the journey to the end was less than moving. Although there are references to Robert and Francesca's love affair, those accounts are scattered throughout the book and garbled with other facets of Robert Kincaid's life. Francesca's life is portrayed as one walk to Roseman Bridge after another, which renders further focus on other facets of her life and even some character development.

There were some new twists and unexpected turns, and I do like Mr. Wallers style of writing. He has the potential to write such a wonderful love story but I think in trying to recapture the magic of \\"Bridges\\" it simply missed the mark.Perhaps if this book were about different people it might have worked for me.

All poems are written in rhyming verse and depict common, everday occurences that bring back happy memories to those having lived the simple life of of the early 1900's. There are poems written about almost any topic of daily living imaginable. The poems give a great insight for modern generations interested in getting a glimpse of the way things were for many of previous generations - what many often refer to now as \\"the good old days\\". 'Raisin Pie' is one of my favorites. My best friend had a copy of this volume years ago that I always envied.

He is no longer the humble servant going to the cross; He is the resurected eschatological Judge who reigns and leads Heavenly armies.

Within two days, the Portafilter began a slow leak, the next cup a major leak and within the next few cups it blew off and spewed hot water everywhere. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement which, within a few days, began leaking in the same manner. It never flew the portafilter across the room but did get worse over time.

I contacted Amazon's customer service asking for replacement and was advised that because it is over 30 days since I got the machine there is nothing that they can do and I need to contact manufacturer directly, but they don't have any contact information for them.

I shelled out an extra 25 bucks for the latest one thinking that surely for that much more they put in a stainless steel tray. Nooooo, it's the same painted or coated junk as the last one. You would think that this is no big deal but the coating bubbles up and falls off and rust bubbles up and over the sides rendering it uncleanable and simply downright ugly. I would hold out for a maker with a stainless steel drip tray. I have had this new one for a few months an have resorted to foil to attempt to stave off the budding cancer which is already moving right along. Why a company would go to such great pains to build a good product and then finish it off with this kind of crap is a mystery to me.

My water basket started leaking the minute is was filled and will not work.

I followed steps suggested in the manual and tests instructed by the Lello technician. STILL THE SAME RESULT!!! It either took like 10-15 minutes to get a 2 ounce shot (drop by drop) or 5-10 seconds of watery coffee. I tried with both provided baskets.

You have to turn the handle 45 degrees past the \\"lock\\" marks on the front of the machine to actually lock it in place, which results in the pour spouts being 45 at a degrees angle. If you don't turn the handle until it is fully locked, the basket might blow off when brewing (this happened to me). This is dangerous. You could be burned. Does anyone have one that actually locks in place with the handle aligned with the \\"lock\\" marks on the unit? (It is locked when you cannot turn it any farther with normal effort)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best coffee maker!!!","review":"I love this machine,it makes the greatest coffee.

For the first year, everything worked well. I maintain my machines well, using cleaning tablets and clearing out the portafilter regularly. Almost immediately after the warranty expired (!), the amount of steam for milk frothing decreased by about 50%, despite cleaning. Shortly afterward, the steam started coming out near the junction of the machine and the wand. Water flows freely between the top and bottom of the disconnected wand, but no steam passes throgh. Then the rubber ring gave out, so it won't even produce coffee.

I contacted AMAZON, who offered me little assistance other than to say they would return 75% of the cost to me. I eventually got an address for the manufacturer, Lello, and asked my friend to mail it in with a description of the problem. She did. It was returned a month later with the same problem. No solution. No substitution. No fix. Why AMAZON is still selling this product is a mystery to me.

My old Hamilton Beach pump machine beat the pants off Starbucks using pre-ground Illy from the grocery store, but the shots from this machine are too weak. Got a friend to make some different grinds of Intelligentsia Black Cat with his burr grinder, but some were too coarse and some too fine. For me, a machine at this price is intended to make coffee easily and reliably. I don't want to have to spend hundreds of dollars on a grinder and screw with the grinds, I just want it to produce a decent cup using commercially available ground espresso. Looks like I'll be ordering another Hamilton Beach, even though the last one only lasted two years and the parts on this one are higher quality and a bit more user-serviceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bait and switch","review":"Like many, many others, I ordered this months ago as a birthday present for my daughter who is in college.

I didn't want to overspend without knowing whether I could really make espresso or not. After doing my research on coffeegeek, I decided that the Ariete would be a decent compromise between price and quality. Long story short, it died after five days (about 15 shots or so).It makes a decent shot and warmed up quickly. I was quite impressed with the looks of the machine and how quickly it warmed up and was ready to pull a shot.I never got the chance to replace the pressurized portafilter with an non pressurized version but that was the next step I was going to take before the machine quit working.Despite my bad experience with the machine itself, Amazon did a fantastic job of taking care of the return, customer service get a A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great price","review":"I have read other's reviews of this product and most say good chinesse machine.

I was told by a friend that works in coffee shop that nozzle should not spit water at all, just steam and this one does it, spits water when you try to use steam.BTW I am not worried about that, just need good espresso and this one does it right as long as I pack the coffee tight in the holder.No weird behavior as reported before.Great machine for the money, stainless steel, minimum plastic parts that are seen in most other more expensive/overpriced junk brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"1000 Airplanes: A Spacy Opera","review":"I wasn't sure what to think of this album after listening to it a couple of times. I found myself enamored with Track 10, however, a very fast, powerful, maddening tune, and felt the need to go back and re-evaluate the entire album. I found that the album is quick, very thematic, thought-provoking. In fact, I didn't know anything about the theme of the album, but as I listened, I felt I was on the brink of insanity. As it happens, a friend of mine mentioned that the opera is just that--about someone who is a bit whacked. This album is a top five of mine. It's a bit spacy, edgy, crazy. Linda Ronstadt's out-of-this-world vocals are awesome. If you like Philip Glass, you'll love this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"As a huge fan of early Philip Glass, I was anticipating wonderful things when I bought this album.It disappointed me greatly, though. The organic tone of the Farfisa organs was gone, replaced by a very cheesy plastic dull sounding FM synthesis keyboard sound.And the compositions seemed to be rehashes of the earlier Glass idioms.I ended up getting rid of this album, after trying a few more times to get into it.And that's pretty sad (compare to my favorite Glass albums -- including \\"Music in 12 Parts\\", \\"Einstein on the Beach\\", \\"North Star\\", \\"Akhnaten\\", \\"Satyagraha\\", \\"Dance Pieces\\", \\"The Photographer\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"mahjong","review":"tiles are great, but plastic holders do not last long.

This case fits the iPaq 3650 perfectly (with or without the Expansion Pack attached) and has a nice nylon belt loop with a snap for easy on/off. I like it better than my Palm case because the Palm belt case has a metal clip that damages my belt. I've even started to carry my Palm IIIx in this case when I carry it (I'm using it less as I transition to the iPaq.) I also like the zippers better than the Velcro on my Palm case. There are internal pockets that I'm hoping will carry CompactFlash card(s) when I get them. I tried the RhinoPak 2000 which also has a belt loop, but that case, while nice, was too big for my purposes, and not professional-looking enough for me. The padding and protection in the 1100 are good, and this case is a winner, in my judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"RhinoPack 2000 is like a purse","review":"The RhinoPack 2000 is too big to put on your belt. It is not confortable to walk or sit while the it is hanging on your belt. Furthermore, the straps inside does NOT hold my Jornada firmly in place. It's too big. If you don't open it carefully, your device may fall out. I carried it two days to work and it ended up in the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly and unprotective","review":"I got this case as a gift for my palm V and thought it was pretty nasty. I gave it a try anyway but was pretty disappointed that it didn't hold up for very long. I dropped it by mistake and my whole unit gave up working. What a drag. It took me at least 3 weeks to get a replacement. I saw some other cases that i liked, the hardcase from palm and the softcase by Incase. Both very stylish cases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive let-down for sure","review":"This case has a couple of things going for it: the extra pockets are very nice to have, the construction is solid and the materials are a nice alternative to leather. My main problem with this case is that it doesn't do it's job which is to carry and protect the device inside. The elastic bands lose their pull within a week, and when your device is under them it's very hard to use. Even when the elastic was fresh my Handspring wouldn't stay underneath them.In short, the decision to use elastic bands to hold the PDA are a design flaw that for me killed an otherwise great case. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"RhinoPak 1100 - very disappointing.","review":"I bought the 1100 because I really liked the elastic securing straps (I didn't want to stick a piece of Velcro on to my Palm IIIxe).When I recieved the RhinoPak 1100, I couldn't believe that this flimsy piece of junk could retail for over ($). The shell, lining and zippers felt so cheap I truly felt ripped-off. The plastic screen shield was ultra thin and flexed easily. The padding on the back was so thin, I could easily feel the shape of my Palm through it - it felt like it was wrapped in a couple of paper towels.Don't bother trying again, RhinoSkin - I'll never buy another Rhino product again.Positives: Elastic straps eliminate need for Velcro on PDA.Negatives: Everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sloppy, unsafe product for your Visor and keyboard","review":"This is a bad product, but I bought it because I thought I needed a large case for my Visor and Keyboard, which I use a lot. I should have paid attention to the other bad reviews. This is an unsafe case.For starters, your PDA won't stay in there, unless it's somehow modified with the use of velcro. They could just as well leave those limp little bunge straps out of there, because they are useless.On the outside, it has all sorts of clips, loops and whatever that serve no useful purpose.The only thing that makes in marginally adequate, is that it can hold an enormous amount of stuff. But God forbid if you open it, all your precious stuff will fall out.,Yuck.If you need a good case, by the Handspring Folio module case, for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Case - Bad clip holder","review":"The case is exelent for keeping my Jornada HP. It get very well hold to the case by the Velcro. The bad news is that the clip holder to the belt is to weak, made of a fragile plastic that tears appart very easily. The center button, of the holder break appart very soon. I recomend to manufacter to review this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"After 4 days use, I have to agree with criticsms seen elsewhere about the elastic straps used to hold the PDA in place. With a Jornada 568, and with the screen cover attached, the straps quickly become \\"stretched and sloppy\\". Who wants to use velcro patches on the battery pack. This product needs a serious re-design!The Rhino 1100 will make a handy accesory case, but I wouldn't trust an [expensive] device in it. GripGear Designs makes a superior case, although it is 1.5X the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty BIG disappointment","review":"In short - too big and too flimsy to really be considered adequate.I read lots of reviews on this case ..., both positive and negative, and took the plunge and bought the Rhino 3000 PDA case. There are better options for the same price (see the Handspring folio module case).The main gripe - it does not hold your PDA safely. In fact, nothing is safe from falling out once you unzip it. Every time I open it - I have pens, batteries, PDA's falling out. I will say this - the keyboard stays in pretty good.On the positive side - it is a huge case and holds lots of stuff. I could even stick my phone on the side pocket and carry a PDA, keyboard, phone and a bunch of other stuff.But it's not worth it - not when there are other cases out there for the same price.And what about all those hooks 'n stuff on the outside. What are they for?Beware. There are better cases out there if you have to carrying a keyboard with your PDA.

The fit for my Aero 1550 was tight which is a good thing BUT, the easy access to \\"ALL major buttons and functions...\\" is a bit of an over statement as the zipper covers all of the side functions which include the stylus, function buttons, voice recorder and the headphone jack. ALSO, the plastic insert (if that's what they call it) is soooo weak that all buttons, including the power can be accessed when unit is zipped shut.

First of all, I have the HP Jornada 548. I did not want a case that velcroed the unit in, and with the 1100, there is no velcro. If you have a casio or compaq, there are 4 straps on the inside that easily fit around the corners of the unit to keep it attached. Or, if you have the Jornada, then I just like to pop the unit in with the flip cover still attached and just pull the whole thing out when I need it. As for protection, the 1100 has a firm, form fitting interior with soft casing. I have dropped it twice on concrete and nothing happened at all...great protection! Finally, the 1100 is compact, and on the inside are 2 very thing pouches for compact flash cards, stylis, etc. This is the perfect case for me and I think that youll like it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its JUNK!","review":"I bought this case after reading it was highly recommended for Compaq iPAQ's, its a complete rip off in that respect. Any case so poorly designed as to allow your $500 unit to fall out when you open it should be recalled. The straps that are supposed to hold the pocket PC in place are a complete joke, any moron can see that. As a consumer I rely upon a fair and resonable evaluation by a reviewer. Task #1 is what? Holding the unit in place right! This case is so poorly designed it actually increases your chances of damaging your Pocket PC.

It's best use was in my suitcase on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on Protection and Function","review":"I bought the RhinoSkin RhinoPack 2000 PDA Case for my Compaq Ipaq and I can't help but feel that I should warn people agianst the purchase. I say this for two reasons; 1) it doesn't provide much if any proctection, and secondly it is not useful for carry much of anything else which is hard to believe because of its size. This is due to its lack of internal pockets that were designed properly. The pockets on the outside of the RhinoSkin are practically useless. Also it doesn't even hold my ipaq in place, the straps within are misplaced and unuseful.If they redesigned it which would be easily done and if they provided better padding on the sides for protection and used better material it would be a great buy, but as it is I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for PocketPC devices!","review":"I had read that this cover works well with the iPaq PocketPC computer, and bought it on that recomendation. Althought the case itself seems solid enough, it is worthless as a iPaq cover. The elastic strips are too loose, and it was very easy for the device to fall out when opening the case.

He seems to have chosen a poor master for his religeon work (Hubbard, perhaps?), his feminism could use a quick LeGuin refresher, and his politics ... well, perhaps he had to skip his Herbert class - but no one can be expected to master everything. His personal contribution, however, is only a rather incomplete paste-up of these studied touches into a not-quite connected narrative which never quite announces its point, nor ever seems to feel it's been reached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolfe's most penetrating character study","review":"I had the chance to read all four volumes back-to-back. A long-time Gene Wolfe fan, I am glad I did: because what emerged was, I think, the finest character study I have found in twenty years of reading science fiction. Starting with Silk's real revelation from a real god, and ending on an unresolved note (like much of Wolfe!), the story gradually reveals Silk's character, of an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances. Much is left unsaid; by doing so, Wolfe invites the reader to participate in assessing Silk the way his contemporaries would. At the end, the reader is left admiring a thoroughly good yet humanly flawed man coping with an especially ambiguous world, a character drawn as successfully as any in non-genre literature. The book has other complications, of religion and will and governance, but at the end, it is the character study which leaves the book stuck in my memory"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boots, Great value!","review":"Bought these boots for my husband, who wears a size 10, in a size 11.

These ones fit the bill:The boots are pretty much as described. Mine actually had a yellow CLC logo on the side of the boots (unlike the picture which shows black only). I will upload a picture for your reference.Pros:- inexpensive (especially with free 2 day prime shipping to the door...)- seem sturdy enough for the occasional use (garden, grass trimming, light \\"muck work\\")Cons:- run larger than the usual size. I ordered a 10 and I would guess these are more a 11 to 12. Even with a pair of thick boot socks they are still floppy...- not the highest quality / material thickness: I would not recommend these for every day use.

I have been using this replacement for less than 6 months and today, after it dropped from a chair onto a soft floor, it quit working again. Yes, I dropped it but seriously, a phone should be made to withstand some minor trauma like this. It's not like it was thrown or fell off a balcony.

We're a local news source and production house, and we use them in handheld cameras, large cameras, and recorder decks without any problems.We've gone through hundreds of these tapes and never had a bad one or had one break. Seriously. Not one. They record well in EP mode (though we don't make a habit of it), as long as the camcorder is in good working order. Rarely any dropouts in these... if there are, I'd believe it's the camera causing the dropouts and not the tapes.I've seen no difference between these and the higher grade brands. The only thing I'd suggest is that if you plan on recording tapes over and over again (like recording weekly church services, etc.), then get the higher grade ones. They're made to be used over and over again and will be more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Sucks","review":"I've been an OMD fan for years. I was in middle school when they became famous for \\"Forever Live and Die\\" and \\"So In Love\\". I particularly liked the Sugar Tax album. Dazzle Ships is just pure crap. A lot of the lyrics don't even make sense! It's a bunch of techno-garbage with cliche lyrics sprinkled here and there. Don't waste your money. Buy some of their older albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Something Different","review":"This was OMD's experiment in electronic music. It has the noticeable maritime theme if you glance at the track selections. This album is strange but in a good way. It's very musical in different ways. It has some very strong songs like the two singles \\"Genetic Engineering\\" and \\"Telegraph\\" among others like the title track and the best song on the album \\"International\\" which is mind blowing when you listen to the lyrics. I don't think a lot of people understood this album and that's a shame cause if you're a true music fan like I am, you'd find it \\"musically moving\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzle Ships is brilliant and lovely","review":"I disagree with those of you who say this album is crap. For a synth-poppy band to go THIS FAR off the deep end, in the 80s, was brave and adventurous. They merge Kraftwerk-like obsession with Shortwave Radio with their traditional beautiful romantic songs, for a brilliantly jarring combination. It's definitely noisier and grittier than anything other new romantics were recording, but retains an edge into the musique concrete direction..... I loved this album when it was released, and still love it now. I personally think it was the LAST good album OMD released......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanting Something More","review":"I was really excited when I saw trailers for this film but the finished version left me wanting something more. There was no mystery, no build up, nothing to make you want to watch this film to the end. You get to see Derrida going about his daily business, eating, dressing, speaking, walking around various cities, and watching him be interviewed. I had just read some of 'The Truth About Painting' and wanted to learn more about this man and his theory of Deconstruction. But this film wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably self-absorbed and insipid","review":"Agree with the prior customer views, big time. On Derrida's resistance to the project, he gets no complaint from me. He clearly gave extraordinary access and tried very hard to cooperate, but the crew was so intrusive and inefficient with lights and mikes and the questions so insipid, that he just seemed constantly amazed at what he was being subjected to. Alas, name it Derrida Butters His Toast if you want to do some self-inflated student art project. I learned close to zero about Derrida the thinker, other than he seems to be a nice old French fellow with a long standing marriage and a successful practice in teaching and writing.Taking on a project with this potential, spending years with this level of intimate access, and calling it Derrida, suggesting breadth of content, but bringing little insight about his thinking to the screen outside of mostly silly gimmicks, is a sad sad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial voyeurism","review":"this documentary is even worse than expected. the filmmakers/interviewers show little respect for Derrida. for instance, they throw questions too private, such as Derrida's sexual life. this is so embarrassing and rude. they also push Derrida to summarize his philosophy. it is awful, because no philospher is able to, is obligated to summarize her/his own philosophy. we cannot ask them to simplify themselves; we can only hope they become more complicated. i have to say this documentary does Derrida violence. it is so obvious that the filmmakers/interviewers do not prepare themselves with Derrida's works before they make the film, because they keep asking unnecessary, irrelevant, and intrusive questions. i am surprised that Derrida tolerates these filmmakers. but he looks so obviously annoyed and impatient towards the end of the documentary, if you have the heart to finish watching this violent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's first and favorite book of poetry","review":"Every poem in this book is special. The poems are fun to read aloud and will show your young child just how wonderful words can be.

If you're looking for a way to introduce your child to poetry, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a winner!","review":"Our 2-year-old twins request this book every night for their bedtime story, it is a great hit and they love the lyrical poems and the great illustrations.

I wouldn't characterize it as a bedtime book, because the children quickly memorize these silly poems and \\"read\\" along with you, bouncing in rhythm. The book created wonderful family memories; last week my former toddler picked it up from the shelf and read it to me, and we both started giggling again - it's rollicking good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tattered favorite at our house","review":"This book delighted my daughter and me all through her toddlerhood. These poems are clever, fun, and evocative. My only complaints: The spine of the paperback didn't hold up well, and the children in the illustrations are nearly all pale, fair-haired waifs, which may reduce the book's appeal for readers whose world is not pale and fair-haired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original recordings","review":"These are not the original recordings we remember and love. These must have been recorded at some concert he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note the list price","review":"I have this disk.I bought it expecting the popular versions of the tracks listed, and got less than that. These recordings may have been made when Denver was older or something, as his voice isn't what I was expecting.I'm getting rid of this disk, as I feel it is a rip-off. On the other hand, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"If you're new to John Denver, this is a terrible introduction to his talent and great music. If you're a long-time fan, this is a total disappointment. Every track has the same canned jazzy background that drowns out the vocals and ruins the song. Surely not the way he ever intended his music to sound. Try the Wildlife Concert album (fabulous), or some of the older albums, like An Evening With John Denver. Anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS","review":"As is pointed out in several other reviews of this CD, the versions of these songs are not the original versions; they are re-recorded studio (NOT live) versions. In my opinion these versions are also noticeably inferior to the originals, & Denver seems very affected/pretentious on several of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best?","review":"Best is subjective of course. If you like folk music and are a total loser, then this CD is best for you. Get one for the home, one for the office, and one for the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Good Staind Album","review":"I was dubious about Staind when they first came out. However, when I finally took the time to give this album a listen it really grew on me rather quickly. This is great music for when you are driving alone at night, or in a dark and brooding mood. The music is well produced and reasonably well written, and the few mistakes they make are easy to ignore or forgive. It is too bad that Staind completely lost all their edge (even when they were trying to be heavy) after this and never released another good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy and Emotional","review":"This is an example of staind's older stuff, their second cd, dysfunction released in 1999. It sounds different from Break the Cycle and 14 Shades Of Gray, they sound more heavier in this album.Aaron Lewis really displays what he's feeling at the moment, and the listener can actually feel the discomfort, the pain he's feeling and it moved me.This cd features 9 heavy and angry songs, each displaying it's own qualities. Songs that he really sing out on are \\"Home\\" and \\"Mudshovel\\", and the Mudhoney style intro of \\"Just Go\\" really brings you into the song. Standout tracks on this record are \\"Spleen\\" \\"Crawl\\" and \\"Suffocate\\", these are the three heaviest songs and really has you shaking your head back and forth to the beat.This album is for all of you hard rock lovers, scream lovers and people who need something to relate to. I highly recommend this cd to all of you guys for your listening pleasure, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind - the ultimate band","review":"Having bought this album on the release date, i can say that Staind are the most incredible thing since sliced bread. Their lyrics are spectacular, the music is amazing, and they are an all round great band. The way Aaron talks about his past and future is simply stunning. I personally love these songs as every word seems to relate to my exact depressing situatuion."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAIND RULES","review":"This is a great band, their music is amazing, and they have incredible musical talent. I've seen them live twice, and they were by far the best band at both concerts. I've talked to the guitarist Mike Mushock, and he is a very nice person, he's actually helped our band a little bit. This is probably one of the best albums I've ever listened to, it has everything, Great Deep Bass, Insane Guitar, Crazy Vocals, and Wild Drums. Staind = Best Band Of 1999"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review","review":"This is a great album. That is really all i can say to describe it. Out of the four that they have (tormented, dysfunction, break the cycle, 14 shades of grey,) this one is the best. From the start to finish it just drags you in and doesn't let go. If you like this album I would recommend going to their website and purchasing tormented, since that seems to be the only place you can find it at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staid slams in your face & makes you drive silly","review":"I have seen Staind perform many times in Providence and must say they are the BALLS.

Highlights are \\"Suffocate\\" and \\"Just go\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred Durst's find is no copycat.","review":"Staind, which was discovered by Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, is an example of what happens when metal is done right. Unlike many bands in the \\"new metal\\" genre, they actually have a lead singer who is a singer, not a screamer. Aaron Lewis has wonderful control over his voice, and only screams when necessary, and never in excess. He manages to work his moody vocals around heavy but excellent guitar riffs, and the combination leads to a very well-done album. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAIND IS GREAT!","review":"I have to say STAIND is one of the best new bands that have come out. They are very, extremely orginal and they have their own style. They don't have a hip-hop influnce on their lyrics (as KoRn and Limp Bizkit do) and they are heavy all the way through. They are amazing, the lyrics are actually very touching in a few songs--espcially in the hidden song on the end of the CD. GO and get this damn Cd if you don't already have it, if you don't you are missing out on something great."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful band wih many variences","review":"great band.....for all of u who didnt know this is the 2nd album so go out and buy the 1st..........i got fortunate to see them live while i was in las vegas visiting......i got to hang out with aaron what a great guy.....east coasters rock...i happen to live out west now in arizona......the album is great from start to finish.. go pick it up.. i wouldnt even compare it to aic totally diferrent music. for all those springfield mass people your luckyu to have a band like staind hail from there..............peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fresh new band with a lot of talent and potential","review":"StainD is one of the few good new bands to come out lately, and one of the best things about them is that they haven't reached a state of super stardom, so there image hasn't been worn out yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best damn bands around.","review":"All the way from prattville,Al,I am here to say that this is one of the best albums I have picked up recently.With exploding guitar riffs and mindboggling drums,Staind has what it takes to make it big.Forget the boybands like n'sync,they suck f#&*s out of a dead seagulls a**.Pick up dysfunction by Staind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely RAW.....................","review":"Take it from ME......JUST GO, buy it and take it HOME! :) Together with Aaron's excellent voice (one of the best I've heard) and Mike's guitar jams, this CD rocks! Yes, some of the songs sound a little alike, but the lyrics are what make them so great.(Aaron, thanks for writing from the heart) The lyrics will make you SUFFOCATE. Every song is awesome, right down to the hidden track at the end...that one really got me! Actually, they all got me, as I can relate to every lyric. Thanks to the people that know what real deep music is and for giving those small new bands a chance.

The CD is locally submissive and indulged into lower, weaker tones. In common terms.. it's slow and boring. I think that it's only rated high because it's a rip off band. This entire CD lacks any originality as well as something as upbeat as any other band. And their \\"hit\\", Mudshovel.. blows"},{"rating":"1","title":"To me its a terrible cd","review":"I do not like it. I thought I would enjoy it but they are wannabes of Limp Bizkit. All the guy does at the end of almost every song he screams which his screaming is mixed in with a computer to make it cheap. You could buy it but I don't like it. I only like two songs on the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dysfunction in this Cd,","review":"Well, not a Fred Durst fan, but he has proven to help out a good band(Soulfly).

The lead singer has this great voice for transmitting the painful lyrics which the album has. The lyrics are so catchy you may experience points where you start singing along. The sound is somewhat alternative, and it is rooted deeply into hardcore rhythms and dark, deep moods. I can't seem to listen to just one song on the album, because each song is distinctly different, yet slightly connected and blend so well I lose track of time. A definite must for anyone who likes darker moody rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one problem","review":"The whole CD is great. My only problem is that it only has 9 songs, but of those nine, a whole zero of them were bad. Great CD, jsut a little short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, Scared Music","review":"This debut effort by Staind will plaster them permanently on the same wall as Korn, Limp Bizkit, and various other new-metal groups. But once listened to thoroughly, Dysfunction is much deeper than bands like Limp Bizkit. Aaron Lewis can actually write lyrics I can relate to. \\"Home\\" shows depressing lyrics about his significant other (sorry) leaving while he was away, on tour perhaps. Good video, too. \\"Mudshovel\\" expresses his anger with anyone in particular, and in \\"Spleen,\\" he points a finger at a former girlfriend, possibly. It may only have 9 songs, but the reach deep into the brain of Aaron Lewis, pulling out his most scared and aggravated moments. It is music you can really get lost in. Dark music for a dark soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind no longer Tormented","review":"I have both Staind albums, Tormented and Dysfunction. I must say, there is really no comparisan. Dysfunction is more mature, lyrically brilliant, and all-around a better album. From the start of the first track to the last note on the hidden track, this album rocks and then some. One of the best albums out there right now. A must for any hard-music loving fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"where are all the diehards?","review":"Not one. No reviews. A pity, considering this is Stainds shining moment. But anyone reading this probably likes Staind now. This unfortunately means you probably wouldn't like Staind then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind. Dysfunction.","review":"Staind's 2nd studio album, Dysfunction, delivers great hard rock with doses of metal nicely spread across 9 heavy tracks. Aaron Lewis is a vocalist to be admired from the way he can yell harder than system of a down, to the way he can pull out an soft acoustic song, hence, you have Spleen,and Excess Baggage, a bonus song hidden at the end of the album after 10 minutes of silence. Mike mushok displays his true hard rock guitar skill in songs like Raw, and suffocate (the opening to this song is just the perfect way to introduce you to the album).Just go features heavy yelling and cussing at the end and comes off as a stand out on the album. Favorite Songs: Spleen, Raw, Suffocate, Just Go, Excess Baggage(hidden bonus song at end of spleen after 10 minutes of silence."},{"rating":"2","title":"staind is awesome","review":"this band is one of the greatest ive ever heard...if you are looking for some thing mellow tracks like me, just go, home, and the secret song are for you, if you want something a bit heavier. mudshovel, and spleen are perfect.....the secret song is amazing and is well worth the time it takes to get to it<about 15 mins> but like i said staind is the greatest band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durst Did a Great Job!!","review":"I bought this CD last night and as soon as i got home i listened to it non-stop.. i luved all the songs especially, there first single \\"Mudshovel\\", \\"Home\\", \\"Just Go\\", and \\"A Flat\\".... i know it took me a long time to get this album but im glad i finally did.... this album went straight to my top ten list among other great bands like Creed, KoRn (follow the leader), Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and the Deftones.... also Staind is from Massachusetts which is where i live so i gotta like em right off the bat.... i cant wait to see em in concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best new band in rock","review":"Staind are one of the best bands around. I don't like Limp Bizkit but I would like to thank Fred for getting these guys some attention. Aaron Lewis has one of the best voices in rock. The guitar work is not full of solo's, but it blends in great. I hope the band continues to stay on big tours and get in to America's bloodstream. They are already in mine! This is a great CD from start to finish. If you get it you should fast-forward to the 16th minute of the last song. There is a secret song that will blow you away. It is one of the best songs I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred you have done it again","review":"I have to say that Staind has got to be one of the freshest hard rock bands to come along in awhile, and this industry needed it. There is a band in MN that everyone should be looking for too. Their name is Projekt Charlie, they are coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pass This Up!","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best hard rock albums of the year. But don't think that just because Fred Durst is involved in the album that they sound like Limp Bizkit. Staind has a style all their own. If I had to pick a band that they reminded me of, I would have to say Tool or \\"Facelift\\"-era Alice in Chains. In my opinion, \\"Just Go\\" and \\"Suffocate\\" are the best songs, and the cover of \\"Bring the Noise\\" is cool too, which also features Fred and DJ Lethal. Mark my words, these guys are going to be huge before you know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best album I've heard in a while","review":"This is one of the best albums I've heard in a while, Everything on this album rips, Aaron has an amazing voice, with a soft emotional voice, then can scream with loads of power, and along with great bass guitars and drums...I think they sound exactly like T00L and Alice In Chains rolled into one, not one or the other, but both. it's a whole new sound. amazing!...I reccomend this to anyone whole likes those bands or like anything heavy and hard core, I love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best cds of the year","review":"i recently bought this cd and haven't stopped listening to it since. all my friends agree they rule. this is definitly my pick for the year. GET THIS CD ANYWAY YOU CAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and brutally passionate","review":"Very impressed with the sonic quality of this album. As a recording engineer, I have to compliment the engineers who mixed this record. It is not very easy to pull off since Staind uses \\"drop A\\" tunings which can sound muddy if not recorded with extreme precision and clarity. Also it is just me, but does the lead singer (Aaron) sound a lot like Tool's Maynard Keenan? The song \\"Home\\" made me think it was Keenan's side project \\"A Perfect Circle\\". It was not until I was at the record store that I found out otherwise. Still a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind KoRn rip-offs, what are you on about ??","review":"How can you say that Staind are KoRn rip-offs they sound nothing like them for gods sake, your just one of these Die Hard KoRn fans who want to belive that every band ever sounds like KoRn, for one Staind at the moment are a better band that the recently (well since the first album) Lame KoRn, anyway think before you make your accusations. Whats next \\"How come Britney Spears can get away with ripping off KoRn so much\\" Anyway i dont like the way Meatal music is going in America these days, i still live where its unfashionable to like KoRn, RATM, Limp Bizkit or Staind"},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get it......?","review":"Alright, somebody has to clue me in on why this band is popular ? Point taken, \\"Mudshovel\\" was an entertaining song; aside from that, this band bores me - not just the album, but them.Many of there songs seem non-descript, all the lyrics usually coming off as shallow and trite with little meaning. The songs themselves seem non-functional. What's the point of the song ? Personally, I've always felt that the greater songs have always had, well...a purpose. A great guitar solo or riff; or the song climaxes to a wonderful peak. But Staind just keeps on going and going and going...... It's gotten to the point where i just want to shove a sharp object into my ear whenever i hear this band.Please, go listen to TOOL or The Tea Party or Led Zeppelin if your looking for a band which stands as a monument in the creation of qulity music by talented musicians.I even recommend Korn over Staind (and that's saying something)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"My expectations were too high, I think.","review":"I purchased this CD because I really like \\"Mudshovel.\\" I read the other online reviews and thought this would be an excellent purchase. However, considering my taste in music, I found that \\"Mudshovel\\" was the only song on the CD worth a d***. I was not drawn into any of the other songs on the CD whatsoever-- I found them rather boring. If I could have gotten the CD single, I should have gotten that instead of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful lyrics, boring album. Worst CD i bought last decade","review":"I hoped that this CD would be good when i ordered it. For some reason I was expecting a quality band with decent tunes but all I got was an album that's been done so many times before.The worst thing about this album (although hard to chose) has got to be the tragic lyrics.

Absolutely proof of the decline in rock, especially 'heavy metal', that has occured in the 90's during and after the grunge and Limp Bizkit years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do theez guys know wut they sound like?","review":"this is definetley not real music. its a few guys who r good at drums and guitar, but the singing is just a guy moaning a few words. not a cd i would buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful excuse to waste money","review":"Depressing trend heavy metal album is void of all talent and amusement. The sell hit, \\"Mudshovel\\" (which is often confused as the name of a band itself) has a catchy chorus, but the rest of the album fails to deliver anything but negetive ambitions. The band itself fails to be anything different than the KoRn/Limp Bizkit bands that pollute our record stores. Just say \\"No\\" to Staind."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS IF YOU INTEND TO BUY THIS CD!","review":"This Cd took me a while to get into, then I really liked it. Two days later, it really sucked.

I love Staind, one of my favorite bands, so if you're looking for something that rocks, try them out! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!!","review":"Staind is a very talented metal band, and this album proves it. Nine testosterone filled tracks of pure feeling and painful emotion. The best thing about Staind is, they hold nothing back, and this album shows that painful emotion can result in some great and serious songs. Dysfunction is pure perfection by one metal band who knows how to rock!!1. Suffocate - 4/5 Great guitar riffs.2. Just Go - 4/5 Fantastic and serious lyrics.3. Me - 5/5 Truthful but painful lyrics.4. Raw - 4/5 Heavy song with great lyrics.5. Mudshovel - 5/5 Fantastic metal song!!6. Home - 4/5 Great riffs with honest lyrics.7. A Flat - 4/5 Catchy guitar riffs.8. Crawl - 4/5 Heavy riffs with pretty good lyrics.9. Spleen - 5/5 Easily the best and longest song on the album~~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind forever","review":"On this album are a whole collection of beautiful lyrics, which unfortunately is not necessarily to say beautiful songs. Some of the songs seem to have been cut into components, so some songs seem to have part after part after part, instead of a flowing progression from beginning to end. Even so it is enough to showcase the talents of this band.Strangely enough the best song on this whole album is a \\"hidden track\\" that starts long after the final song has \\"finished.\\" It is an acoustic number that really showcases the talents of the singing that appears on this album.Buy this album to say to all your friends I told you they would be big, because they will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"This CD is awsome. I can't stop listening to it! The thing I like about Staind is they don't scream and scream and scream and jam their guitars (which sometimes I really like), one second they're mellow and singing soft and low, then they come on real hard with there guitars and drums. If you like Tool and Creed, you'll probly love these guys. The CD is amazing and worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Electrifying Album This Year Staind - Dysfunction!!","review":"DYSFUNCTION IS PROBABLY THE BEST ALBUM RELEASED THIS YEAR!

HEY MY MOM EVEN LIKES STAIND. SHE SAYS AARON IS A GREAT \\"SINGER\\" BECAUSE HE ISN'T ALWAYS SCREAMING.

I will probably buy their CD soon. That said, as good as their songs were, their overall performance was somewhat lacking compared to Kid Rock and couldn't even touch Limp Bizkit's near hour-and-a-half long stint. Now, that doesn't reflect poorly on their music, but it is merely a lack of experience that they two other bands didn't suffer from. They just sort of played but didn't really try to get the crowd into it, but suppose with the exposure they get from this tour, as well as the experience of perfoming live to thousands of people will change this and they will be able to pump the crowd up. Staind, your music's there, just work on the live show and you'll be up there with the rest of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind is a good band with great potential","review":"First off this band sounds nothing like Limp or Korn and I dont know where the people who reviewed this album got that from. Yes a little they sound a little like Tool or Alice but you can tell that they were the bands influences and they are not, by any means, copy cats of those bands. I bought the album as soon as it came out because I heard \\"just go\\" on the radio and thought it was sic. I saw them play live and they were definitely one of the better bands Ive seen. I am definitely into hardcore music although I dont consider Staind hardcore at all. In fact, some songs are mellow which I enjoy sometimes amongst all these Korn and Deftones wannabes nowadays. Everyone Ive had listen to them loves the music. There was only one song I particularly didnt care for on the album but other than that a definite must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotion is the word i use","review":"this band isn't about impressing anyone or being on mtv to get money. they are about letting go. they live their music through their life and they don't care what the hell anyone thinks about them. some people say they are like korn or limp bizkit but they aren't. you wanna know who they sound like? they sound like staind. just like korn has their own style and limp bizkit has their own style. staind is more about lyrics that make you think. when you get done thinking about the words that have just filled your ears you think to yourself:\\"damn, this guy is pretty messed up.\\" so just remember this limp bizkit:rock-hop::staind:emotionfilled hardmusic"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD KICKS A**!","review":"this cd is just plain incredible, i picked it up when i heardabout them through a friend, and it's awesome! \\"Suffocate\\",\\"Just Go\\", \\"Mudshovel\\", and \\"A Flat\\" are the best songs on it. if you do not have this, i highly recommend it for anyone who loves hard metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!","review":"MUCH BETTER THAN \\"BREAK THE SELLOUT\\" THIS IS STAIND IN THEIR TRUE STYLE, PURE AGGRESSION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok this CD just rules all.","review":"Now dispite what all you people out there think, Staind is way better than limp bizkit. now don't get me wrong bizkit is cool, they got the beats dropin like \\"Hey\\" but still staind is the best thing to come from FLIP ok. now i think they could of used more songs. and what they could of done is put the hidden song that is just a recording 20 minutes after the Cd is over. well they could put that song on the actual CD. i mean that song i amazing. if you like a band like tool, or a Creed. then hell i go out and buy this Cd. ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"These guys should have stayed far away from fred durst. they would have eventually made it big without him and they probably would have recorded a much better record. this disc has a few tight songs, but over all are too repetitious and sound like the same old thing i keep hearing on the radio and MTV. maybe someday they'll wise up and come up with something new and original because i know they have it in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good cd","review":"This is a really good cd. I started out with Break The Cycle and i liked that so i wanted to get Dysfunction. Some of the stand out songs on this cd are \\"suffocate\\", \\"raw\\", definitely \\"mudshovel\\"(my favorite song on the cd), and \\"crawl\\". Other than those, mostly all of the songs are good except \\"a flat\\" which i dont like that much but maybe its just me. But, it still has eight good songs and a secret track like thirteen minutes after \\"spleen\\" called \\"excess baggage\\" and thats a good song too. Overall this is a great cd and its well worth the money. so what are you waiting for? buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great at first, but keep listening","review":"While this album is not one that will leave you breathless after a first listen, have patience. Listen a couple more times, and the more subtle elements surface. I thought it was somewhat of a letdown upon my first listening, especially since I already owned Break the Cycle, but after a couple more tries I really have started enjoying Dysfunction too. It is an excellent album, quite up to par with the Break the Cycle. While it is evident that Staind has evolved with their sound since Dysfunction, the harder, more angry sound of this album still has its place in any Staind fan's cd case."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzz what? there's music playing?","review":"This is one of the few metal albums that can put me to sleep. Isn't Enya supposed to put you to sleep? I should buy this just to put it on at night when I have to wake up early in the morning and my roommate won't get off the phone or starts cooking or something. We could probably use this against rabid dogs or study narcolepsy with it. Clowns aren't scary, either, so stop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best new CD of the year","review":"I found this CD to have a little of everything on it ...very good rythyms excellent bass...powerful vocals!!!

I picked up their album the first day it came out and I have not stopped listening to it since. Their sound reminds me of a mix of Alice In Chains, Cold, and Tool. The vocalist has both a great singing voice and screaming voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly incredible","review":"This CD is truly one of the best I have ever listened to. Allnine songs are superb and the special song is amazing as well.\\"Me\\" is one of the most powerful and emotional songs I have ever heard in my life. You can actually feel Aaron's pain through the strong lyrics. Also great are \\"Suffocate,\\" \\"A Flat,\\" and \\"Just Go.\\" If you have the chance try to listen to their old CD \\"Tormented.\\" One of my friends let me listen to it and I can see why these guys were picked up by a major record company. It rocks as well and Aaron screams alot more. But the new one is definitely a higher quality production and a CD that I listen to almost everyday. If I don't hear the song \\"Me\\" at least once a day I feel deprived. Pick up the CD now because it is one of the best CD's out there right now if not the best and it costs only 10 bucks or so. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic At Best","review":"I love Staind, so I have decided to check out this band in the hopes of getting all of their CDs. Their first major-label release, Dysfunction, is an energetic and heavy record at best, although not as heavy as their first album, Tormented. I have one issue: the song Spleen has a bonus track, and the track itself lasts 21 minutes and 1 second. If you are going to make your album shorter, why not just make the hidden track an individual track? That way, I can fit more CD space onto my computer. Other than that flaw, Dysfunction is a great album.Rating: 4 stars/5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Different","review":"Staind is my favorite band, even though I just recently (as of the summer) got really into them. I LOVE 14 Shades of Gray, and Chapter V is amazing too. So when I got Dysfunction, I was totally amazed. It is much more hardcore than the two most recent albums. Of course, Aaron Lewis makes all the songs have meaning and emotion with his unique voice, which is what I think sets them apart from all the other bands out there. My favorite song was by far the hidden track, which is a ballad. It is depressing but beautiful. People who fell in love with their newer stuff might find this album to be too much screaming (yes, screaming). Actually, most of the songs on this album remind me of Infest (Papa Roach). Anyone who likes Staind will like this album, but you have to have an appreciation for different variations of rock. Just wanted to put out a warning to fans like me who had no idea Aaron Lewis could actually scream and make it sound musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome staind at their best","review":"this album is an amazing debut it's not as heavy as tormented, yet not as soft as break the cycle. it's one of my favorite cdssuffocate 4/5-pretty good song not the best on the album but worthy enough for the openerjust go 4/5-the second single and a pretty good song good videome 5/5-the song that got me into the album one of my favoritesraw 5/5-awesome intro with the cymbals and aaron screaming RAW!!! not that heavy in the verses but stil awesomemudshovel 4/5-the first single i personally like the version on tormented better but this is a good versionhome 5/5-the third and final single an awesome songa flat 5/5-my favorite song on the album awesome riff awesome lyricscrawl 5/5-the verses are heavy the chorus is soft awesome song nonethelessspleen 5/5-the heaviest song on the album theres a hidden song about 18:00 into the song called excess baggage havent paid much attention to it thoughmust have for metal fans that have a softer side"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TITLE SAYS EVERYTHING","review":"The title says everything indeed. There are some hard songs \\"Mudshovel\\", \\"Raw\\"; Some mellow songs \\"Me\\", \\"Home\\"; And a little of both \\"Just Go\\". Sometimes the songs get boring, leaving you no choice but to change to the next song. But that doesnt mean it's not good. I would recomend it to people who want a mixture between hard/soft rock.Most of the songs talk about problems and it gets depressing listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Semi-Hardcore metal with Seattle overtones","review":"I really like this CD, it is pretty short, but hey, the songs make up for it. There are some nice and heavy cuts (Suffocate, Raw, Mudshovel, Crawl, Spleen) and soft ones (Home, Me.) The bonus track is kinda pathetic, but it has some cool sound effects. This CD has no real down points, very nice. If you are ever just too happy, pop this in, lyrics like \\"I'm so lonely, You're so beautifal, not the only, one thats pitiful. Cute huh?

This one sounds nothing like that, and it is much much more of a hard rock album filled with yelling, screaming, and loud guitars (except one song which is much more slower and relaxing). I would not reccommend this to anyone who does not like that type of music and it is, once again, nothin like \\"Break the Cycle' or \\"14 Shades of Grey\\". I really couldn't find one song I appreciated on here but this isn't my type of music so....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Indeed!","review":"I have to agree with the others. All the songs are depressing and they all sound the same! But, don't get me wrong, they are a good band, it's just that i expected more.

Sure, Fred Durst may have found them, but they lack the innovation that LB (mostly Wes' guitar playing) had on 3 Dollar Bill. Remember after grunge took over the world in '92 how there were about a million derivative bands trying to sound like Nirvana/Pearl Jam/Soundgarden/AIC? Staind is the equivalent of those bands. They are another band caught in the mix, trying to be the next Deftones/Korn/Limp Bizkit. And please, for the love of God, no more secret songs! If the song needs to be hidden, do it like Adrenaline and just make it the next track. I don't want to fast forward through 13 minutes of silence for an extra song"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"When are these middle/range metal bands going to start showing some initiative and originality again?

Oh well...Slipknot, System of a Down and Soulfly are keeping it real for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck Barris Tells All...","review":"Was Chuck Barris an agent for the CIA? Maybe. Its impossible to tell for sure. And from the standpoint of the entertainment value of this book, it really doesnt matter. Chuck Barris does a great job of detailing his rise as one of the most prolific creators of game shows in our nations History. Barris, despite his reputation on \\"the Gong Show\\" is a highly literate, intelligent, Ivy League educated man. I read this book taking the train from New York to Washington, and I couldnt stop turning the pages. This read is fast, entertaining, and insightful. I cant wait for the movie to come out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"The book is a well-written, fast-paced narrative of Chuck Barris' bizarro, manic depressive alternative universe.Barris was a television game show producer and he relates the history of his most successful programs -- The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, and The Gong Show. He also, briefly, mentions his less successful programs, like The Mother-In-Law Game.What gives the book its punch is Barris's claim that while he was a TV producer, he was also an assassin for the CIA. He relates that he murdered people, bad guys, all over the world at the behest of the U.S. Government. Fact or fiction? Who cares! It makes for a great read.The humor-challanged should skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Intriguing","review":"Though I read this account two years ago, I still vividly recall of my impressions. This is not a book you soon forget. Though some say this is hype or improbable, I found it believable and think it was accurately written (however,I am sure certain details were left out). Mr. Barris makes no apologies for his behavior, which I found particularly interesting because to do what he did one would have to be able to be an emotionless sociopath or psychopath. He is obviously highly intelligent and for someone who created many of the game shows we still watch 40 years later, this was the ultimate game! Anyone who favors the genre of murder mysteries or finds True Crime intriguing, would not want to pass up this book. I also think those in law enforcement and the psychology professions would gain insight into the motivations of a hired killer.If you enjoyed the movie, the book is much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...well, I don't think I believe him, but who cares?","review":"It's a good read anyway. The movie is quite good too, although both versions of the tale - both Barris's own memoirs and the film adaptation - contain some narrative flaws that more picky readers/viewers might not fall for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T GET IT","review":"I don't get it. One editorial says this \\"reads like a classic\\".Not to me.Chuck Barris likes to use foul language. I mean all the time. A simple line like \\"I sat under the tree\\" is transformed into \\"I sat under the ***#*!* tree.\\" It's gratuitous, it's silly, and it's too much. It becomes seriously grating. At first it was humorous. In the end it's annoying.The whole CIA angle is preposterous. Again, at first it's kind of amusing to think of a little nebbish like Chuck Barris working as a hitman for the CIA, but that too gets old fast. I get a kick out of the \\"is it true or isn't it\\" debates. Folks, it's a crock. Okay? End of discussion.The parts that are interesting all revolve around the game shows. But a lot of what's written has me wondering what part of the game show stories are true. I'd like to believe all of it, but given the nature of the book, I can't tell fact from fiction.So I'm left with a book that isn't really all that entertaining.All it really did was annoy me."},{"rating":"2","title":"the big question","review":"Very good and interesting but of course I am a Chuck Barris fan. It is especially interesting to read the book and see the movie in the same week. The BIG QUESTION of course is: is it true or another Barris Production? And reading the book will still keep you guessing. I have a BA degree in Psychology and JD degree in law and still I cannot figure out if it is fiction or non fiction - the only disappointment I had was (after reading his first book) I wanted this book to be longer AND I wanted updated material and to know more about Penny (his wife). I hope he writes again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun, Even If It's Not True","review":"Chuck Barris gives a very fun, expletive-filled reading of his book that adds a little more crediblity to his story as you wonder: Is this for real?I didn't know anything about Chuck Berris and maybe I still don't, but I was very entertained by this book and his reading of it. The CIA/Show business biography is a great little suspense story that keeps the reader interested even if it is a little predictable.There isn't a whole lot of detail on the behind the scenes of the Gong Show, etc. but it finds its place in the story.I say give it a listen or a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the easiest piece of work I ever did to my vehicle.","review":"All I had to do was remove two bolts (of the four) that held my original bumper on then assemble three bolts per side to mount the hitch.

I bought a sony one, for like 10 bucks and it was crappy, terrible terrible quality sound. The Phillips one is comfy and nice, and only 10 bucks, that one is the 2nd best.The only drawback to this one is it can be a little small for your ears, and the little thing that makes it comfy in your ear falls off pretty easily, so after you're stuck with small earplugs.

Cahill's warm and expert style enhances reader appreciation of his protagonist, Bill Gastner, middle-aged undersheriff of this rural county. Gastner's experience and wisdom include deep understanding of tradition and human nature as well as appreciation of the gifts of subordinates and the developing technology that makes the job easier and more successful. This addictive series of police procedurals follows the personal and professional development of the characters through time while examining significant social issues as they impact a region seemingly remote from the outside world. I am reminded of Steve McQeen's 87th Precinct novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific from start to finish","review":"The story revolves around a small town in New Mexico with a very small police force. The Sheriff is more politician than cop and the only experienced officer is an old, out of shape veteran that has one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. Big city problems crop up in this little town and it is up to the old policeman and a conscientious, hard working young detective to solve the crime. The main character is a very likable, capable detective that is well defined.Just as most books go, this book gets better and better as the reader gets deeper and deeper into it. I found it captivating from very early on all the way to the very end. A really great whodunnit with no obvious suspects until well into the storyline.

Undersheriff Bill Gastner.Bill is aging, paunchy, a smoker and a heart attack waiting to happen. But it is Bill who has the experience when violence and drugs are found in a sleepy little town near the Mexican border. It is Bill who must apprehend the perpetrators. Just goes to show that you can not put a price tag on experience.I very much enjoyed the relationship between Bill and the young Detective Estelle Reyes. They make a workable and believable team. This isn't a book to be read for the action sequences, but it is a book to be savoured for the wonderful character of Bill Gastner. A very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still No Subject other Than NAZIS","review":"Thousands of books, articles etc have been released on Nazis but still there is a passion about the subject.

Almost a hopeless novel !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remasters: NO!","review":"Others' reviews here of Rick Nelson's work have been near complete and quite informative. I personally have found the \\"remaster\\" quality and content of these tunes to be unacceptable in that they have \\"remix' and edit qualities about them that are entirely untrue to the original production. Compare, for example, the opening seconds of \\"Travelin' Man\\" in the digital remaster and original versions and you'll hear what I mean. And in many tunes an artificial stereo effect is hyper-exaggerated in that the accompanyment and vocals are too separated R-to-L. Go with a good analog-to-digital conversion of the ORIGINAL producton and not what seems to be a quick re-do afterthought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky Nelson - Greatest Hits","review":"I am overjoyed to have found this CD with all of Ricky Nelson's Hits at Amazon.com.Pure 60's: The #1 Hits"},{"rating":"2","title":"real good collection...","review":"Real good collection but it could use a few more songs that are missing like \\"Today's Teardrops\\" but a good collection nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old Songs","review":"This cd is really fun to listen to.

I consulted the mfg and they were not available on Saturdays as they said. When I DID contact them during the weekdays they expected me to be at the car, which I can somewhat understand, but their advice was still useless. The advice they gave conflicted with the manual and the web advice. Their advice was similar to \\"Just do this or just do that...\\" and it did not agree with the cautions in the manual.

I've had tapes of the Shaggs for ten years, and have heard them often on WABC and other stations forever. And Irwin's obscure songs are unusual, but hardly worth the effort to preserve on a CD.

Her lyrics are fresh, sarcastic, and intersting. Her vocals are complicated- one song she sounds light and airy, like a child, the next song, she's screaming in anger. She's bringing someone different to pop right now- she's not trying to be anything she's not. She doesn't claim to be \\"hardcore\\" or \\"punk\\" or a \\"badgirl\\". She's just herself, and that's so refreshing. \\"Overdrive\\" is a great example of her more sarastic lyrics and \\"Lemon\\" is a poetic, dark ballad that shows a slightly more mature side to her. And the special interview shows how smart and genuine this young girl is. Best of all, you get a free stream of the full album \\"Because I Can\\", in stores Jan. 27th. The album is unbelievable!

Worse, perhaps, the writing is on par with a 6th grader: one small section (the two pages of magnetic mines) calls these things \\"fiendish devices\\" and \\"infernal devices\\" within paragraphs.

This translation isn't terrible but it is clearly written by someone who doesn't know English rules of grammar very well. There are some very awkward passages and the worst punctuation and capitalization errors I've ever seen in a published book. I do not think Amazon should be selling this edition.

The book as literature can't be bested.Unfortunately, this edition is rife with typos, inconsistent translations and erroneous duplications. Words at the beginnings of sentences are not capitalized, the same noun is spelled any number of different ways and entire phrases are repeated sequentially. The first two are annoying, the third slows your reading and comprehension (hence enjoyment), and all are inexcusable in these days of grammer- and spell-checks. Strangely, there is no publisher data in this edition.Definitely buy the work of art, but not this edition of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather a poor edition","review":"Well, to begin with there is no name of translator mentioned.Pages look as if printed by a home printer directly from MSWord file.

Tolstoy's flavorful writing is such that you can almost smell the smoke of the cigarettes and burning wood from the forts and aouls. I will not go over what this book is about since so many other reviews have already done a fine job, but one thing I would like to mention is the excellent introduction by Azar Nafisi. Azar Nafisi, the author of Reading Lolita in Tehran, outlines and provides a compact analysis of Hadji Murad as well as some historical information. It is worth reading the introduction before AND after you finish Hadji Murad."},{"rating":"1","title":"hadji murad","review":"Hadji Murad is Tolstoy's last novel and represents his mature story telling in a way those who are only familiar with the denseness of War and Peace or Anne Karenina will find surprising. The story concerns Chechen and Russians fighting in the 19th century-which still seems to be going on-so it also gives a sense of perspective to a 21st century problem. All praises to Tolstoy aside, this particular edition is dreadful. The translation is clumsy and confusing and the copy is so filled with proof reading errors that, after a while , I became irritated by the laziness of the copy editor.

Although I am not familiar with Groenemeyer's other albums, if they are anything like this one, they're worth a listen. Throughout this album, Groenemeyer makes good use of a variety of musical styles--punchy rock with gravelly guitar riffs, a touch of techno, folk, and classic string arrangements. My favorite track has to be \\"Schmetterlinge im Eis\\" (Butterfly on Ice). Groenemeyer uses a simple note pattern, which turns into a theme and variation--elegant and beautiful. Typical of his style, this song is surprising, delivering a quiet, sad love song in a way that avoids cliches and yet delivers an almost universal emotion--love unrequited. Groenemeyer uses lyrics in unusual, creative ways that have the ability to touch listeners from all over the world.His work is an excellent expression of music as an universal language--which is exactly how I believe God created it to be. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful parisian romance","review":"this is one of the more modern books of mrs cartland's. it takes place in paris, where a girl obtains the post of a governess, because of poverty issues. there, two men try to attract her, while she becomes friends with a famous actress who gives her gowns, and a general makeover so that she looks even more beautiful. also, underneath there is a mystery plot, because the girl's uncle wants her to spy on her employers and his \\"friends\\" threaten her. finally, she runs away and the hero searches everywhere for her, until he finds her and tells her he is crazily in love with her.i also loved the places in Paris, if you have been there, it makes this book come alive in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"liquid hotties","review":"otown's single liduid dreams is outstanding it comes w/ the trax remix an take me under in which jacob underwood from otown co-wrote an they are so sexy whoooooo go otown"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I ended up watching the show. At first I liked the guys because they were trying to live their dreams but as time went on I got down right sick of their spoiled brat behavior. If that's not enough, they can't sing worth beans. Their voices on this CD is obviously studio created. If you've seen the show you'd know. Every time they sang I had to mute my television. I am not at ALL a fan of boybands but if you're going to buy one get quality like Backstreet Boys or Nsync. Please. They got these guys off the street to prove one thing. Anybody can be a star.

I you want some good pop music listen to the kings of pop, I mean the Backstreet Boys. They are the only \\"boy band\\" out there with any talent. All the others like: Nsync, Take 5, LFO, and this crap shoot should be kicked out of the music business. There is only room for one and the is the BSB.

However, when it was advertised that O-Town would sing at the Miss America Pageant, I was intrigued. When I watched, I was appalled. Not only was O-Town even worse musically, the lyrics to their song \\"Liquid Dreams\\" were horrible! On the CD, the sound is better, simply because of computer enhancing.

If we give movies like this 5 stars we are telling African American directors/producers that this is the type of garbage we want to see.I'd much rather watch The Best Man, The Brothers, or Love and Basketball for the 15th time rather than watch another movie like this.Don't worry this will show up on BET at some point and you can watch this bad movie for free.

Most people think of Hasidim as ultra-Orthodox, incredibly strict people who wear funny old fashioned clothes and have bushy beards. This volume reveals to the general reader the ecstatic and contemplative nature of the devotional practices of the early Hasidic masters. The content of the book is gleaned from a number of volumes of \\"theoretical Hasidism\\" (to use Gershom Scholem's phrase), all of which are highly inaccessible to anyone not well versed in Hebrew and Yiddish, Bible, Midrash, Talmud and Kabbalah. While perhaps a deep understanding is not available to we other folk, this volume is a portal into a powerful world of mystical attachment to a very personal Lord of the Universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"Let me just say that if your reading this then buy this book now... fate has brought you here.

They only have two albums, so they play almost all of their songs with a cover of Psycho Killer by the Talking Heads. The quality is definitely up to par and the camera angles are great. If you've never seen these guys live, you will for sure want to pick this up. Just so you know, they get pretty wild during their concerts. This also comes with three live videos from Lollapalooza earlier 2011, which is pretty awesome. I would reccomend this to any fan of the band. You can also get the cd at Walmart and Best Buy.

It may be a good introduction for those who have not seen the series on TV but your money is better spent on buying one of the seasons already available on DVD or catching whatever you local PBS station may be using as a filler in its broadcasting schedule.

It is so nurturing.By American standards, the characters are not, at first glance, beautiful, by any means of the word, and then they grow on you..Their beauty shines from within. I wanted to be a part of their lives. When the series was over, I wanted to start it again, but I will give myself a year, or so. Definitely a series for your collection, to watch in your doddering old age.Love comes around a second, and a third time. It is always a precious experience. Indulge in Jean and Lionel's love story.

I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the producer's time would have been better spent by doing more seasons. Another thing i have to admit was weird, was that there was no laugh track, it was just silence after the jokes, i'm just use to having it. i would like to get the episodes i missed, to complete the story, esp the love story between Alistair and Judy.

Lyricist and co-vocalist Nathan Moore has long personified the postmodern troubadour, traveling to play for his meals, praising the virtues of vice. And when paired with his vocal foil, bassist Aimee Curl, the drifter's words leap beyond his capable voice into the haunt of her beautiful warble. But on this latest release by ThaMuseMeant, the long-running and always-struggling project of Moore, Curl, mandolinist David Tiller, and violinist Enion Pelta, their complementarity has reached a zenith.Unfortunately, ThaMuseMeant never caught its deserved success, and has since stalled.

Remembered the Wharfedale name from the 80's, figured for the price and with Amazon's return policy these were worth a look. I have been pleasantly surprised. First impression when you open the box is that these are solid, very well constructed and nicely finished. Sound is fairly accurate. Mids and highs very good for this price range, lows were an improvement over the Bose I had been using. The speaker is able to provide the effects without calling attention to its position, something the previous unit could not do. I plan to buy some more to use as background speakers throughout the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of speakers","review":"I just happened to come across these Wharfedales when I was looking to replace my Polk audio satellite rear speakers. Typically, a set of bipolar speakers will run well over a few hundred dollars. Under $90 shipped was an absolute steal. These speakers sound great and give a lot of depth to my surround effects. I'm not sure how they would be as mains, probably plenty good for most, but as surrounds they are great. Hey are white and mounted on my wall, blend in well, they are not small, and are very solid, and surprisingly heavy.

Yeah, it comes nicely packaged with a neat, sturdy little slipcase and all, but the content is pretty unoriginal.

The first song, for example, manages to bring together St. Sebastian, the Romans, Dante Alighieri and his lover Beatrice, the death of Lincoln, and e.e. cummings' poem \\"Buffalo Bill's Defunct\\" to bizarre dark comic effect. This is mostly acoustic, but unlike later albums the music here (to me) takes a back seat to the lyrics, twisted both conceptually and lyrically- in one song he sings of \\"the dock of the baby, the resort where strangers liaise, the port in every girl where the sailor obeys...\\" This is classic stuff from one of the most brilliantly provocative minds of the last few decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeshiva bochurim make the day...","review":"Got this on a bit of an impulse.

And as a platform for communication, Agent Emes gives parents and children, teachers and students, the cool kids and the rest of the class -- a means of talking about the Dr. Lo Tov in all of us.That's a lot to ask for any video, but it's not too difficult for Agent Emes; because Emes means \\"truth\\" in Hebrew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubious","review":"This book appears to be a paraphrased collection of freely available information complied by someone who doesn't understand it himself.

This isn't a review of Buddhism, or this lineage within Buddhism. This isn't a review of this particular set of CDs. I wouldn't know how to do any of these things.

Pema is not only fun and 'centering' as a speaker, but she speaks articulately and without a lot of extra verbage. She gets right to the point and in the gentlest way shows us possibilities of responding differently to things that disturb us. We learn that by looking at things differently it is easy to empower ourselves to not be so disturbed, to not be so reactive, and yet still be very much authentic to ourselves.

Her experience as a mother and as a non-monastic really informs her wisdom as an advanced teacher. In this work she continues to refer to and revere her teacher Chogyum Trungpa Rinpoche; but she once makes a very dry comment about having some different views than his (to audience laughter). She manages to acknowledge all the stories about Chogyam's alcohol abuse and sexual adventures without lessening her view of him as a critical teacher and that is remarkable.In addition to all the usual teachings about not getting hooked by shenpa (attachment), Pema gives some examples using a man she knows who was in prison for drug-use, and she waxes philosophic about the film \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming back into fashion subject matter","review":"I discovered this book after reading the recent obituary on J.F.

Hob-knobbing with the weathly, which at first seemed to benefit his order, turns into a nightmare in which he remembers his duty at just the last minute. This prose is so dryly humorous you must read it carefully to catch it all. You will become enchanted with Father Urban and sorry to leave him at the story's end. I wanted this story to go on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Well written book with interesting tone that (intentionally) stops short of full Waugh-like satire. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rap metal - for better or worse","review":"These guys are not bad.. but there are also no surprises. Overall, this CD is a competant helping of rap metal better than many popular rap metal bands. But, it is a formula which grew tiresome and predictable pretty quickly and Innercorse does nothing to push boundaries. It is nothing new, but fans of the genre might find it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent and pure;an album full of great tunes!!","review":"This album was that kind of album that makes me fells so better after the first contact.All of the lyrics are modern and with pop-rock influences,and blues tunes in a happy way,that reveals the great capacity of this great productor Jim Gaines to be at the right way, in the company of great musicians.G.B. Leighton and his own style will hit the top of any great particular collection.All of the musics touched the soul,specially something like \\"Trouble with Sophia\\" like only few other albums done yet!!Great album,Great revelation!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Moons Inspires Many Dreams","review":"I read this book for the first time as an adult. After finishing it I asked myself what it was about. Just as the new moon arises...so are new dreams. Each one possibly attainable, created as the old ones fade and wan. That idea has sustained me a number of times as I have had to weather a turbulent period of my personal life. I particularly love the book when I read it with that in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughters New Favorite!!","review":"Was suprised to only see 18 reviews on this book. My daughter (aged 7) loves this book and has asked me to read it over many times!! I enjoy reading it as much as she enjoys hearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"''Many Moons''","review":"The story Many Moons is very interesting because it is funny. It is funny because of the way they describe the characters and there characteristics. I especially liked the story because the Court Jester helped the girl. He helped the princess Lenore by going to GoldSmith and telling him to make a fake moon and attaching it to a gold chain.I also liked the story because of the way all of his wise men pulled out a scroll of parchment. Each scroll had what they did for the king. I also liked the story because at the end of the story the Court Jester winked at the real moon. The End"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Reiview","review":"The story \\"Many Moons\\" is a great book and I would love for someone to read this book, because this book is interesting that the man that is suppose to be silly is the wise one. My favorite part of the story is when the wise men read their list of the things they had got the king. He is very lucky to get all of those things, because there are things on their lists that are amazing. I think the book is called \\"Many Moons\\", because everybody, except the king and the Court Jester decribed the moon in diffrent ways. The book \\"Many Moons\\" is a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Court Jester Rules!","review":"One of my all time favorite books, it has a fairy tale story and illustrations to rival disney. It's by an awesome author. And any little kid would love this as a bedtime story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received this package, Amazon!","review":"I never received this package, Amazon! And I don't appreciate your not providing a more appropriate venue for telling you that!! - Mary Davis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good","review":"This book was good, however in my opinion I did not care for it as much as some of the other books I have read that were Caldecott winners. This book's story line consisted of a little girl who became ill and asked her father the king to get her the moon so she could become well again. After calling on many trusted wise officials to help, it was the court Jester that finally solved the problem of procuring the moon. Then, the king did not want his daughter to know that the moon was still in the sky. So, after talking again with his wise aids it was the Jester that finally asked the princess of why the moon was in the sky. She gave him the answer and then went to sleep. The pictures in this book left a lot to be desired in clarity of detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply and poorly made","review":"I bought this based on the good reviews, and now I regret it. The pen for my tablet stopped working and when I opened it up to check the battery I could not believe how shoddy the construction was. When I tried to put the pen back together, it broke!The installation disk is NOT XP compatible, you have to download a patch just to install it. None of the included software is XP compatible either.The tablet that I recieved looks different from the one pictured here. I do not know if Think Geek has replaced the tablet that they used to sell with a \\"equivelent\\" model, but what you get now is JUNK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book and forget Internet.","review":"Before I became aware of Rough Guides, I used a lot of time (and money) searching for information about travelling in USA on the internet. After this discovery was almost no need for that. The quality of the information is high. The authors have a very critical attitude to what they the write about.Enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another guidebook instead!","review":"I've been using different Lonely Planet guidebooks and I wanted to try another guidebook, so I bought The rough guide to the USA, but I'm very disappointed over The rough guide to the USA.Compared to Lonely Planet The rough guide is:-less informative-not so funny to read-of poorer quality (the back went broken in a week)And worse: The maps are really bad, if they exist at all. And they do not point out sights, hotels, restaurants etc with numbers like they do in Lonely Planet guidebooks. Also it lacks on historical background which is very annoying for a person who have never been to the states. The section on dangers and annoyances is far from comprehensive. Distances are in miles...I can continue with more annoyances but I think you'll get the point.The only positive I can say about The rough guide to the USA is the price, it's cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to cover the country's highlights","review":"My wife and I have covered most of the US using this book. We've found it very helpful in helping us utilize the time we had. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail that was there for a single book covering this immense country. Most recommended restaurant and sight information is still very relevant three years on. That being said, I cannot speak to the transportation or lodging information, since we didn't need or use it. Some unneeded political commentary, but I see that in most guidebooks, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Guidebook, awful images","review":"I have very mixed feelings about the Kindle version. It is great to have everything in one place (as the book has 1000 pages) and things are easy to locate and read on the iPad. The Rough Guide itself is as good and dependable as always, with interesting history and background information as well as specific local knowledge mixed in.Everything, however, falls down with the image quality. The images are very small sizes and thus blurry at any size above a postage stamp. The maps are basically unusable, as the image quality is so bad that you cannot zoom in enough to actually read the street names and references from the text. Which basically means we will have to either download specific maps wherever we go, or buy local paper maps and carry them around too, which we were trying to avoid in the first place when we bought the kindle edition...Am thinking of returning it, unfortunately, guide books aren't much use without the maps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"This guide does not include half the details I was looking for. It lacks on historical background, demographics, maps, neighborhood information and totally leaves out several cities. It lacks major cities in the details that it does cover. I had high expectations, and was left very dissapointed. I felt this guide was mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inaccurate book","review":"I found the information in this book to be completely inaccurate and wouldn't trust it to guide me anywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A MISTAKE-BUT DON'T GIVE UP READERS","review":"I'm so glad this was not my first introduction to Linda Howard! I don't care that this book was written back in the early 80's, its attitude between this particular man and woman came out like something back in the 40's & 50's. Reading about Jessica's acceptance of insults, belittling, and domination by the man she \\"loved\\" and still have \\"stars\\" in her eyes was way to much for me. Maybe it was just the degree of it all. I'm glad Linda Howard has left this level of writing behind her and has written the battle of the sexes with more fun in mind. Don't let this book stop you from reading her newer books, she really has gotten better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!! Not her best work","review":"I am Linda Howard's biggest fan, but even I have to say that this book was awful. The back cover made it sound promising, but the characters never developed the way I was hoping they would. The 'hero' was such a jerk! I kept waiting for Ms. Howard to shift the story to his point of view or explain his actions, but it never happened. The heroine was a total pushover. Along with 'An Independent Wife,' this is her worst book. Read anything else by her and I promise you'll be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a romance don't","review":"As an avid Linda Howard fan my eyes are always open for new releases and reissues. I cannot express just how disappointed I was with this story. How can this be called romance? I would never want this kind of love. Nikolas Constantinos is the single most abusive (both verbally and physically) male character I have ever encountered in a Romance novel. Jessica Stanton was weak and I would never consider her a role model. Nikolas' behavior was inexcusable yet Jessica repeatedly forgave him for his rages. Do not judge Linda Howard by this book! I would have never read her books again if this were my first! Try \\"Diamond Bay\\" or \\"Dream Man\\" to discover a real man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domestic abuse doesn't bring the\\"warm fuzzies!\\"","review":"In this book, Howard is definitely thorough! All aspects of domestic abuse(verbal, physical, mental, and sexual including marital rape) are main components of this book. The only positive I have with this book is a lesson on WHAT NOT to look for in men...otherwise RUN! If you are into this type of plot, buy a whip and have at it. At least you'll have more backbone that the herione(or rather mindless, teary ragdoll!) Terribly revolting read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"All That Glitters","review":"I'm an avid Linda Howard fan. With that said I found this particular book to be unsatisfying. The heroine is not likable. She is spoiled and manipulative from beginning to end. I would recommend that readers of L.H. skip this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reprint of an old and lousy book","review":"The publisher seems determined to cash in on Linda Howard's current popularity by ruining it--republishing poorly written books from 15+ years ago is not going to win new readers. The characters and situations in this book are thoroughly ridiculous to modern readers. Don't waste your time with this; get a modern Howard to read and you'll see what a wonderful writer she has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not up to Linda Howard's usual standards.","review":"\\"All That Glitters\\" is a reprint, first issued in 1982. The heroine, Jessica Stanton, a.k.a. The Black Widow (a 23-year-old crybaby) keeps the hero, Nikolas Constantinos (an overbearing billionaire bully) in line by bursting into tears every time they have an encounter. The love scenes are flat and uninteresting. All I can say is that I'm glad I read the \\"Mackenzies\\" first or I would have missed a lot of good reading if I had read this book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly one of the worst romance novels ever written!","review":"I like Howard alot. It is incomprehensible to me that this book was reissued. But we do have Elizabeth Lowell with a reissue of Remember Summer to make us wince as well. The male character abuses the female both mentally and physically to the point that pain is a central issue both for the reader and the protagonist, if Amazon allowed zero or minus star rate values it would apply here. please excuse my typos"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abuse that glitters?","review":"The \\"hero\\" is abusive - there's just no getting around it. Even in the 1980's I don't think this type of behavior would be accepted. I also found it highly unbelievable that the heroine would continue seeing the hero after their first \\"date\\". That said, Linda Howard is a talented author and most of her work is truly worth reading. I am particularly fond of \\"To Die For\\" and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that even Linda Howard can produce a dud","review":"Greek tycoon Nik Constantinos summons virginal widow Jessica Stanton to his office to find out why she continues to vote against his mergers. He offers to buy her stock and decides he must possess her. She holds out on him like any good virgin would, and he reluctantly agrees to marry her so he can sleep with her, and whisks her away to his Mediterranean island to meet the family and conduct the nuptials. Won't he be surprised on his wedding night to find that the woman he could swear is a tramp is really a virgin.Only in the 80's could crud like this be published... It was hard to finish this one without laughing my butt off. Thank goodness Linda Howard's writing improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"a truly horrible book","review":"I simply cannot believe that this book was written by the same author that wrote Son of the Morning. I consider myself a big fan of Linda Howard, but this work was so awful that I'm sorry I spent my time (and money) on it. It's truly one of the worst books I've ever read. Both main characters were repulsive: the \\"hero\\", an abusive control freak and the \\"heroine\\", a schizophrenic weeping mess. The plot line (such as there is) is repetitive and boring. In addition, I was horrified to see several instances of sexual assault (if not rape) handled as if it were an acceptable course of events between two people; when a woman says \\"no\\" and a man uses force to continue, that's assault. Don't waste your time or money on this one; try Howard's \\"Son of the Morning\\" or \\"Dream Man\\" for good romantic suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, this was the worst. I can't believe Linda Howard wrote it -- in fact I'm convinced someone else has the same name and is cashing in on her writing reputation. An abusive hero (yuk) with an uncontrollable temper and a whining (fearful) heroine who can't make up her mind whether to go or stay with him is not a story for the 90's. This novel should have been rewritten before being reprinted. The publisher is really cashing in on a well-liked and prolific author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even As A Howard Fan, I Hated This Book","review":"This book was a frustrating read. It is definately not one of Ms. Howard's best. The hero was a jerk, and the heroine was weak. I wanted to strangle them both. For a better Howard, try \\"Diamond Bay\\" & \\"Come Lie With Me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not have been reissued!","review":"Like many other reviewers, I am a big LH fan. This definitely is not one of her best, IMO. However, it is a reissue and her writing is much better now. I usually keep and re-read all of her books, but I have only read some of the earlier ones that have been reissued once. Believe me, ATG was not her only early work that I did not enjoy. An Independent Wife, Against the Rules, Heartbreaker were others that I did not like.I just wanted to say that many of the reviews posted here had me laughing soooo hard. I know that they were meant to be serious and I agreed with most of them, but the humor was fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only LH Book I've Ever Hated","review":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I would give it 0 stars if I could.There are already many overwhelming negative reviews but I have to add another one just so you know HOW BAD IT IS. Jessica is lovely but damaged and Nikolas is a narcissistic and crass bully. You would think in normal Linda Howard fashion they would grow for the better and learn to love, but Nickolas is horrendous and domineering--he all but forces Jessica to sleep with him at one point. He's not just unlikable, he's actually a bad person and her acceptance of a clearly abusive relationship is disgusting. I like the hero/heroine interaction in EVERY other Howard book but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth.***DO NOT JUDGE HER BY THIS BOOK. If this is the only one you've ever read, GO READ ANYTHING ELSE BY HER and you will love it!***Sorry Linda, but 1 stinker out of 300 isn't so bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"There is tragically little plot in 'ATG' and very superficial character development. The primary storyline consists of the relationship between the two main characters who are, unfortunately, as unsympathetic as humanly possible. The female lead is wet beyond belief while the male lead is simply obnoxious - you cannot help but think that they will make each other miserable and deservedly so. Altogether a waste of time and energy.I have read and enjoyed Linda Howard's work before and was extremely disappointed with this book. It is hard to imagine that the same author produced the excellent 'Dream Man' and 'Kill and Tell'.If earlier works have to be republished why not reprint the 'Mackenzie' series?"},{"rating":"2","title":"bookworm","review":"I first read All That Glitters when it was first issued and I have to say that it is still one of my favorite books. I feel that Linda Howard is a wonderful author and I enjoy most of her books, I have favorites of hers (like Duncan's Bride and the sequel Loving Evangeline) that were written in the 80's and those that she has recently written. All I can say is keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive!","review":"Like most of the other reviewers on this book, I am an avid Linda Howard reader. While I don't love every story she has written, I was horrified by this book. I have never read a story where the \\"hero\\" is incredibly abusive physically, mentally and emotionally. It is truly unbelievable that anyone would publish this story, even in the 1980's. How can you love someone who has terrorized you, physically assaulted you numerous times, and ignores anything you say? It makes me shudder to think that some young girl might read this and think that this is the way relationships are supposed to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this one.","review":"I am a fan of Linda Howard but this book was so unbelievable that I can't believe she penned it. The characters are beyond outrageous, especially Niko. Any woman would walk away or shoot the man. Jessica is indeed a doormat. I should have read the reviews before I bought this one. I spent the entire time reading it feeling angry and frustrated but finished it anyway because I always try to get through a book even tho' it is not good. This was NOT good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I also didn't like the book; it made me very uncomfortable. I've noticed that older romances run along these lines - very young girl with no career & older man who is definitely the boss. Someone like I in my early 30s cannot relate to such a scenario. I loved her Mackenzie novels, & expected this book to be similar...not so. The couple was very disfunctional; should have been in therapy, not in a marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Howard's standards.","review":"I am a big fan of Linda Howard but was very disappointed in this book. What a whimpy woman, I thought if she cries one more time I would scream!I think this book needed a little updating before it was reprinted. Please don't let this book keep you from trying Linda Howard's other books- they are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD!!!","review":"I had to check the cover just to make sure I was reading Linda Howard!!! The is possibly the WORST book ever written, where does one start. The herione made me want to meet her just so I could slap her and the hero well.....knee him in the balls. Utter trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"To dumb for me to describe","review":"I really cannot stand this book it had idiot characters in idiot siituations. Jessica is an idiot for getting herself in a relationship with Nikolas he is rude and he is a tyrant and she isn't a doormat she's on the level below the doormat. She let him control her and she lost her self respect when she agreed to marry him. All I can say and we are not living in a time whare women can be or will be treated that way. This story is dumb with a stupid spineless wimp for a heroine and an autocratic tyrant for a hero and they both are a an ebbarassment to both of their sexes"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL THAT GLITTERS","review":"I love Linda Howard and read anything that she writes. But this book was the worst. The hero treated the heroine awful! I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. If you were turned off by this book, please try another Linda Howard book (Duncan's Bride is a wonderful start, and Open Season and Mr. Perfect are truly some of her best books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this one!","review":"This is the earliest of Linda Howard's books that I've read, as I thought I'd delve further into her catalog. I should have checked the reviews here first because I completely wasted my time. This book was awful and lacked the high sensual romance that you'll find in her later works.The man is a disgusting sexist pig that *never* lets up in his beastly treatment of the main woman. The book was very reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast, where the man imprisoned and treated the woman terribly throughout the entire story, except in All That Glitters the \\"beast\\" never turned into the charming prince. Don't waste your time on this and read one of her better books from the 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Howard book I've NEVER finished - Soooo BAD!","review":"Not my usually lovable Linda Howard - an early bodice-ripping stinker! I've read everything Howard has written and went on Amazon to find anything else Linda Howard that I could get my hand out (i.e. early works, out of print stuff). I got a used copy and hated it so much that half-way through the book I literally threw it at the wall in disgust. The \\"hero\\" is chauvenistic jerk and the \\"heroine\\" is far too weak for my modern sensibilities.
