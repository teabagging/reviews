The rest were juvenile at best, incompetent at worst. I usually enjoy the often bizarre entries to film festivals, but these were poorly done and was reminiscent of behavior found in the junior high school boys room.

The quality of the media is poor compared to the OEM Mann/Hengst filters for my car. The media was discolored with what appears to be black spray paint.

The author offers a general and boring view on the exciting history of Sparta, and how great it once stood. It may be because I am a student, but this book spent way too much time analyzing theories and guesses of Spartan history, and I felt Forrest dwelled entirely too much on Lykourgo's and Gerousia.

Neither let me down, but I have to admit that the score seems too short! It's only 41 minutes long and it left me feeling as if something was missing.Portman does wonders and indeed each track truly takes one back to the film (my stomach growls each time during the \\"Chocolate Sauce\\" track; no lie!). By far the best track is #1, the \\"Minor Swing\\". You will want to jump up and dance to this, as I have found myself doing in public while listening to this on my discman!I have had this disc on constantly, from in my car to in my discman to in my cd player while falling asleep at night.

It is somewhat akin to 'Goodfellas\\" set 1100 years earlier. Compelling characters, fascinating plot, lots of action and excitement, and even a little educational. You should start with The Last Kingdom, and once you do start it's hard to stop until you've read all three volumes. I suspect that men will probably enjoy the stories more than women, since they're heavy on violence and action and short on mystery and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lords of the North","review":"Another fantastic Bernard Cornwell masterpiece - cant wait to read it.

It would be great to see a listing of authors books in the correct order to read them before buying the product to help with choice. It is a pity that we dont have an Australian Amazon which would help with the cost of postage - some book sellers overseas now offer free postage to Australia. Cheaper postage would mean that we can buy more books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action and twists...","review":"Great story writing talent; not just at the level of \\"an adventure\\", but at the deeper level of what drives people to do what they do in a setting most people can but imagine (the life of \\"the middle ages\\"). Melodramatic in places, and a tad bloodthirsty (no private read for a very young teen), but not gory (and zero sexual details, so you are safe with young teens reading it). Plot well-woven, in the sense of intersecting braids of characters that appear then re-appear... but not so convoluted that you need \\"dog-earred\\" pages, or re-reading to remember the details and nuances that are alluded to or referred to later in the series.A great tale and a great tale spinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply good","review":"3rd installemt in Saxon series is as good as the 1st two. Cornwell paints the picture of 9th century England in a brisk and refreshing fashion using his protagonist as the 1st person narrator. The story is already well established, and although we know what happened to Saxon England based on historicals, I am still yearning to find out the conclusion to king's and fictional characters fortunes. Make suer to read all 3 novels before the next chapter of Saxon adventures apparantly coming Fall of this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberated!!","review":"I've read several reviews and see I'm not the only one who felt Uhtred's devotion to back stabbers is not only unrealistic, it's bad writing. As my past review of The Pale Horseman details Cornwell lost me as a fan, and now entirely as a reader, by making his main character so unworthy of respect.I listen to these audio books during my commute. I DON'T want to get aggravated by the masochism of a dunce. Uhtred may not be capable of standing up for himself but maybe he'll swing Serpent Breath against the cobwebs in the library book return box. I'm through with Cornwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but predictable","review":"This is a good book, not Cornwell's best, but good. If you like the previous two, you'll like this one.What kept it from getting 5 stars was the predictable nature. I'm not going to give details so I don't spoil things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, but readable","review":"This book is kind of predictable if you've read the rest of the series, but people read this sort of thing expecting a formula. This is the Starbuck chronicles with armor and swords, set in Saxon England.Also, it is drearily anti-religious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"The author combines historical elements with fiction in this tale of Saxons vs Danes. The tale takes place mainly in what is now Northern England. Perhaps most interestingly after the tale is over the author reveals the fictional and the real life characters, battles and locales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornwell at his second best","review":"As one would expect, yet again, Cornwell has produced an exciting read with varied pace, thorough research, and above all, excellent action scenes. The strength of the plot hides a few weaknesses in the narrative (bumping into most key historical figures of the period; returning quickly to proficiency with a sword after countless months as a slave-rower at sea etc). But story is satisfying, and the character, Uhtred, is slowly finding some depth. Whilst this may not be Cornwell at his best (I would reserve that claim for his Agincourt) it is still a gripping read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trip-hop","review":"Who: Richard File, songwriter Ant Genn, with James Lavelle, make up the trio with various guests (including Ian Brown) on vocals.Why: It's dance and trip-hop music with a bit of broody guy vocals, angst without the whining, and manages to be not so dark. There's the guiding piano much like Ben Folds, a heavy breakbeat like Everything But The Girl, guitar riffs like Frou Frou or Goldfrapp, and string-driven like the Badly Drawn Boy, and pondering lyrics with vocals that remind you of Massive Attack. My favorite song - \\"What Are You To Me?\\"When/Where to listen: For those strangely damp and moody times when you want to reflect on your life or maybe be in a dance-trance while going about your chores, pausing for a moment of flashback when reminded of somebody, but still want to be left upbeat and not delve or wallow in the gloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let-down","review":"i just bought this album today, and i must say i am disappointed. i love dj shadow, and unkle's first album, but this new album totally blows. aside from a few tracks (which i could have downloaded for FREE) it's really a boring cd. i do love the opening intro track though. after the intro i was expecting something totally amazing, something beautiful and abstract. but all i got was a boring song with crappy vocals. the third song was even worse. what is up with that cheesy, unimaginative, boring beat?!? i am going to be very cautious next time i think about buying anything from unkle, and even dj shadow, again. i know some people are gonna attack my review, but i am a music lover, especially electronic music. i know electronic music inside and out, but just compare the two unkle albums, and i'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpening your brain","review":"The questions in this book is becoming quite standard and out of date.

But if you are looking for questions that will turn up in interviews, you might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, I will say that","review":"I have a different experience, and I guess different reason than most for buying this book. I already worked as a software engineer when I picked it up last year. This was when we were interviewing some people to add to our team, and I realized that since I only have taken a few courses in my professional area, I probably woulndn't be able to give the answers they wanted, they would never have hired me.And, Yet, I have been there the longest, and probably have the most tribal knowledge in my head about a lot of stuff in our product.

If you don't need that refresher, you don't need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice review of computer science and puzzles","review":"This book serves as a good review for the student of computer science, prior to entering the interview arena. The trick questions and puzzles that are in common use by technical interviewers are covered, as well as a general overview of the interview and job hunting process. I must recommend the book for those unfamiliar with the interview process, and unprepared for the sometimes bizarre questions that interviewers ask(particularly the infamous Microsoft questions, i.e., Why is a manhole cover round?). For those familiar with the interview experience, it may serve as a guide for interviewing your own job candidates (the reason I bought it, myself).For a better review of CS topics, I recommend Brookshear's Computer Science, An Overview, sold here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book for interviews and refreshers","review":"These questions are the type that Microsoft will ask you in the interview (Interviewed there 5 times). If you can't get these questions right then forget about working for Microsoft. But I noticed that all organizations don't use this technique to determine the qualifications of a potential employee. I moved to washington, dc and companies here are more concerned about a canidates ability to do the job then to solve frivously puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordered used got the new","review":"I have ordered an used book with a low price and got a brand new book. not a single mark in the book.

After tracking the package and realzing that the seller had received it and didnt contact me about it, i contacted them and was told that they would be willing to re-ship me the package if i paid the shipping...which i felt was unfair since no other seller i have delt with has asked me to do that, and additionally i had told them about the issue with the address right away.

I really wish that there were more vocals, the guy has a good voice, but some of the instrumental songs are just as cool. Overall this album is enjoyable. Great guitar riffs, bass, drums.

Not a huge breakthrough in music but worth checking out just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller","review":"This \\"original\\" is very well crafted excitement. Gregory Peck gives excellent performance trying to stay one step ahead of stalking Robert Mitchum. Excellent addition to any film library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE One!","review":"This original production of the early 1960's Cape Fear is superior in every way to the remake in the early 1990's. The reason is that there is far more suspense, drama, and believability in the older one.Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) plays an attorney that sent Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) to prison for assault/rape. The time comes when Cady gets out of prison and seeks to exact revenge for 'eight long years in the bucket.' He returns to the city where Bowden and his family live and begins with thinly veiled threats against Bowden.As the film progresses, the tension rises notch by notch as the interplay between Cady and Bowden becomes more intense. The climax of the film occurs on the Cape Fear river and is one of the most suspenseful and exciting ever. There is no gore in this film-it relies on the artistry and talent of the story and its actors. Not many movies made today can make that claim. I think this is Robert Mitchum's best movie ever. Five big stars for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Cape Fear","review":"Compared to Martin Scorsese's brutal re-make, J. Lee Thompson's original is a subtler, vastly more chilling exercise, with Mitchum's Cady a searing portrait of evil and barely contained violence. The story examines how the law can work against the innocent when the victimizer knows just how far he can go to harrass his victims with impunity. Peck is reliably stolid as Sam, Polly Bergen excels as jittery wife Peggy, and both Martin Balsam and Telly Savalas provide assured support playing a sheriff and private detective. Edge-of-your-seat entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intensive","review":"This is a very intensive movie with good directing and Mitchum shines. The photography is masterful and creates a tense atmosphere. This movie delivers and pkays very well with man's primitive insticts. Evil against good.

They have a unique sound to them and the best part is that they use only their voices. No back up or anything. Like they say \\"Six guys, six mouths, that's it\\". The talented part about them is that they write their own music. It's amazing how they put everything together. It takes a lot of patience and coordination. They perform beautifully on stage and it gets the crowd going. The best songs on this CD are Helen becuase Mike (the bass) sings it and his voice is absolutely mesmerizing, Home because it just sounds really nice. I've met these guys and they are awesome and they really care about their fans. They're trying to make it and share their love of music...especially a capella which is often overlooked.

Mijares has a fabulous voice, and can do power ballads as well as softer romantic songs. The songs are mostly mainstream Latin pop, so folks looking for edgier fare may not like it. But again, Mijares has an amazing voice and the musical arrangements are beautiful. He's kind of a mix of Billy Joel and Roy Orbison. I usually hate when reviewers make such simplistic comparisons, but there you go! For the cost, I thought this was a real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"True sexy romance with mystery and suspense","review":"One of Lisa Kleypas best.

Some things -- the changing of the victim's names for the sake of their families -- can be overlooked and forgiven, but as for giving Ed an explosive personality and casting the rail-thin Carrie Snodgress as the obese-in-real-life Augusta Gein...these things are just unacceptable. The acting is only fair and the movie tends to focus more on Ed's interaction with Plainfield's citizens than it does on the childhood that eventually caused Eddie's dementia. Throw in some cheap-looking body parts and obviously fake blood, and you've got yourselves a messy, boring, falsified mockery of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The best part of this film was the beginning and end, where you see actual newsreel footage, including interviews with people who knew Ed Gein, I wish there had been more of this.

Just stating my opinion, later."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOORING","review":"Who'd have thought that a movie about the guy who inspired the Texas Chainsaw Massacre could be boring? Let's be honest, when I tune in to a movie about Ed Gein, I want to see some killings. I don't want 2 hours of a pathetic loser being verbally abused by his weird fundamentalist mother. The nasty little flashback scence of the pig gutting was the only scene that I felt was really necessary and illustrative of the sickness of his family.I kept watching in the hopes that this movie would get better, or at least keep me awake, but to no avail. Re-rent Psycho. It's a 1000X better.OK, having learned more about Ed Gein, I can say that this is a credible attempt to make a quasi-documentary about his life. Perhaps if the pacing had been more even, or the acting decent, this would have been a good movie. It just doesn't make the grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to watch, as you might expect...","review":"Well, I do have to give credit to the actor portraying Gein, as it did take some courage to take on this role. As far as the movie goes, you definately will not come away with anything approaching a smile on your face. This is one of those movies that will probably bother you the rest of the day after viewing it. Now, of course this was a horror movie, but there really wasn't anything in this film that made it interesting enough to watch twice. I'd pass on this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent & Disturbing Portrayal of the Infamous Ed Gein","review":"Personally, I thought this film was a thoroughly enjoyable ride. As mnay people know already, Ed Gein (Americas first well known serial killer) was the inspiration for such horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, and Deranged. With such a monumental impact on the horror genre, it was due time for the real story of Ed Gein. One note is the contrast of Ed's public life, with that of his macabre personal life. We are shown an Ed that everyone in town knows and trusts- his dark life known only to the audience until the final moments of the film .I also feel that Steve Railsback did na excellent job playing Gein. A fesh twist on a familiar and influencial character, I give this film four stars out of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good","review":"It reminds me of a really twisted TV movie but that is probably because of the pan and scan version I rented from ... Blockbuster. The chain that loves not pleasing its customers. This film feels very personal in a way and is a great evening alone. If you really REALLY love Ed Gein give it an extra star. I liked it a lot, I did not love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"When I heard that some of my favorite blockbusters of all time, like \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacare\\" were based upon the life of Ed Gein, I knew that I had to see this movie. I enjoyed the movie very much, and I was pleased to find that it was not half as gory as I would have expected it to be. The Ed Gein character, was more distured than Norman Bates in \\"Psycho\\" because he would actually keep his victims...hanging around....pardon the pun, as where Norman Bates would quickly get rid of the dead bodies. On the other hand, Ed Gein was more belivable than the leather face charcter in \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" because Ed Gein was a real seemingly normal person, as where Leatherface was more of a monster. I enjoyed this movie so much that it could have actually been longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Gein","review":"The movie was slow, It had some good elements to it and followed the gein story in some ways, But it lacked the violence that ed had done.If you are gonna make a film about gein then do it right there is alot of things that should have been in this film that were not. Mother should have been seen in her shrine, You never see ed trying to fix her up with other peoples skins or even going into her room. This should have been a major role in the film. Why feel sorry for ed that seems like what the director was aiming for, Dont get me wrong ed dancing in the moon light was classic, For die hard gein fans i still think the classic DERANGED delivers the goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"when I got this movie I was thinking maybe this movie would be bad. But to my suprise it came out to be a intresting and well made. There are some things in this movie they leave out, but it basically shows you how (...) this guy was.

I think I like it as much as Texas Chainsaw Massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"the absolute dullest film ive seen based on ed gein's life.","review":"-to begin with, this is not a horror film.... certainly its not a gore film either (there is very little here they couldnt show on tv)... the movie is too inacurate to pretend its a documentary of sorts... at the same time, its not even entertainingly bad, merely boring... a real yawner... if you desire to watch a film based on gein, and want something a little more real than texas chainsaw, and not so old as psycho, rent DERANGED... while being a helluva lot more entertaining, and more convincingly acted, DERANGED is also the most accurate depiction of geins life on celluloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"how dull","review":"i purchased the dvd with high hopes...though it attempted to follow his story i found it very much lacking in detail and full of inaccuracies, railsback, however, on some occasions came thru, especially when he was able to get his eve to twitch and droop, a few great scenes but overall, in my opinion, could have been done much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy transfer","review":"Do not waste your time ordering this video.

Trying to return it has been a nightmare, though, since the post office informed me it was too large for them to ship. UPS refused to pick it up for the same reason--odd, since they delivered it. I had to have Target send a truck by to pick it up and I still haven't received my refund. Oh, and Target stores won't take it back either, which I found the strangest of all. So, make sure if you want to keep this rug, you are going to order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service","review":"We ordered this rug but received the wrong color and size. I contacted Spectrum Rug immediately and Lana responded to me right away. We exchanged a couple of emails going over the problem - sending the item number, the exact color and size that's printed on the label, etc. Once she realized her company's mistake, she told me exactly what to do in order to return it. I packaged it up in order to ship it back to Spectrum, and UPS came and picked it up. Spectrum Rug issued us a full refund with no problems. Lana was very helpful. Although it was a hassle to receive the wrong rug, the level of customer service was high enough to make up for this error. Thanks Lana!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet sells out","review":"This is a total re-write of the previous 6 editions. This is usally a good thing, but I thought the previous author, Jens Peters had a keen insight to the types of things the traveler who would purchase a Lonely Planet guide was looking for. I found the new edition to be much less informative and interjected the writers opinion a little too much in some areas and not enough in others. For example, on Angeles City the writer basically said not to waste ones time there and that only middle aged Australian or European men would want to visit there. My wife and I regually visit there to buy quilts and trek to Pinitobo, not to visit the bars. But we do not judge people for where they visit. The hotel and restaurant reviews seem to been scaled back also. I am taking my 6th edition with me on my trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet, do you screen your authors?","review":"Despite a new batch of authors, the listed places were almost a direct lift of Jens Peters' work (including the ommission of Bulacan). What is different is the condescending way it is written. After reading the guidebook, you would think the Philippines is there with Afghanistan, Liberia, Rwanda and other wartorn countries. Although there are dangers, the risk level in Manila is about the same as any other major city in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with this guide","review":"This guide was a total disappointment. I have never been a fan of Lonely Planet guides but since they are popular you can get them cheap second hand. I always end up taking one with me wherever I travel but this is the first one I threw away because I didn't want to carry the weight around.If you have no guide and found mine in the trash it may be worth having but if you are planning a trip and want to buy a guide, this isn't it.Coverage is lacking, prices are wrong, recommendations are out of date. I honestly don't know how anyone could have been to the places I visited and write the coverage supplied in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guidebook, but needs (already) an update!","review":"I am just returning from a 3 week journey thru the Philippines, during which I have used this guidebook intensively. In my opinion this is the best guidebook available for all independent travelers. The Rough Guide for instance has less practical information.However, I was a bit disappointed about the level of detail. For example for Palawan, many descriptions are rather pointers and leave a lot of room for further exploration. Other information needs an urgent update (regarding prices, quality of service, better hotels for less are available... ).For instance for the town of Sagada: one burial cave with hanging coffins is only accessible with a guide, since the access is locked; on one recommended hike up to a mountain top \\"with beautiful views\\", there is no watch tower anylonger since a long time...This is astonishing, since the latest version has been published in 2006!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distressing injection of political prejudices","review":"Just as the cover photography of the 6th edition is far superior to the cover of this 7th edition, the bulk of the material in the 6th edition is far more informative and much more intelligently written than the 7th edition, with the added bonus that the 6th edition was not written primarily to promote the author's political viewpoints.If you can still find the 6th edition, buy it, and bypass this political diatribe disguised as a travel book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet is not reliable!","review":"Ive seen the Philippines despite of the travel warnings that i have read in the Lonely Planet guide...

The maps were useless as you couldn't read them properly even if you zoomed in on them. Someone in our party had the paper version which we referred to after too many disappointing attempts at using the Kindle version.Perhaps reference books like this shouldn't be sold as electronic versions.Definite waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK..","review":"Bought this edition on Amazon to plan trip to the PI, borrowed the Jens Peters' book and the Rough Guide from the library. Jens Peters' is great if you're visiting the country for months or plan on living there because it is quite comprehensive and detailed. I'll probably buy it if I retire there or for relatives who are already living there. Overall, I wished I bought the Rough Guide instead. It reads better and more informative on places I want to visit. There were more options on lodgings and sights to see, etc. I second the criticisms on the LP posted by other readers. I was able to peruse an old version of the Moon Guide at the library and it is so much better than LP or RG and looking forward to a newer edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Links Don't Work On Kindle!","review":"Here's the problem with this book(And I don't know if it's the book or my Kindle): They've replaced all the prices in the book with links that say \\"Click Here\\". When you click on the links they all take you to something totally irrelevant. For example, if I click on a link about the price of the zipline in Davao it takes me to a map of Bacolod.. Other than that the book is fine and helps me a lot.The links that are actually typed out in URL form actually do work.."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Coughlin","review":"I found the book very easy to follow & it gave a very good discription of what a new traveller to the Philippines would encounter.

Even though I don't have the game yet but ordering it now, but I have the demo. The people and story of the game is great. the voices of the game has the voices of celebrities like David Duchovny from the X-Files, rapper Eve and the old Batman himself Adam West. The thing a lot of people don't like it is takeing down enemie's. It take's about one whole clip to kill one of the enemies. When ever you shoot someone in the head on the game blood is everywhere on the wall, and that's reasen kid's can't play this game.

Man I can't wait for it to come out. It will surpass Halo and all other first person shooters. You have a massive array of weapons and you can even use shovels and other stuff around the levels to kill people. There is also a great multiplayer mode. It supports up to 4 players and on the ps2 and xbox its online. It has a comic book like play, with boxes that pop up on the top of the screen that show you where you killed someone. There are throwing knives, machine guns, pistols, sniper rifles, grenades, and more to use at your disposal. Now the reason I gave it 5 stars, without accually playing it, is because it looks totally awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saga of Vietnam War and its Aftermath","review":"This book is for anyone interested in the Vietnam War and particularly the US Army Rangers. The story concerns two New Englanders who wind up in the same company but become involved in their own private feud while battling the NVA enemy. The battle scenes are realistic and very graphic and it gives the reader an insight into how this brutal war was fought from the perspective of the average infantryman. The second part of the book is about what happened to the two main characters as they live and relive these experiences many years later. I recommend this book for anyone who seeks to find out the motivation of our soldiers when in battle and how they are able to cope with all of it in later life. This book was certainly an eye-opener for me and I'm sure for others who have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic,characters and storyline.

I was hesitant, but I am extremely happy I did because I have not stopped listening to it. Sarah is one of the freshest and best new voices to come to music in years. Her powerful voicer dominates the album with it's uptempo hip pop tunes, to the dramatic power ballads. Never oversinging, never screeching, simply just singing. Highlights include Bounce, French Kissing which samples No Diggity, One Nite Stand, all destined to be radio smashes. Her ballads are not like the sugar coated ballads usually out there, they are gorgeous and sexy, and showcase her powerful pipes. The only downfall is the guests stars. There are way to many, and she's too talented to rely on rappers to spice up her tracks.

None of the supporting characters were interesting and most were generally annoying. The death of one supporting character is completely unnecessary and depressing.

I THOUGHT I would be getting a story with wit and humor, perhaps one pointing out how funny it really is to have to be closeted in this day and age. I THOUGHT that Ms. Robson's acknowledgements thanking \\"several women who wish to remain anonymous\\" meant that these were friends who preferred not to be outed in print.

Then, when I got into it, I realized that it DOES go into detail in each section.

Then it started squealing. The rubber part did not seal correctly. Replaced the entire fill valve portion and the same issue returned within two weeks.

The first few days it worked great, but then I noticed that after flushing it would not start filling the tank. To get it to start I have to hit the outside of the tank or take the lid off and hit the unit itself. Now it's gotten to where when it starts filling, it won't stop!I have never thought something so simple as a fill valve for a toilet could be so stubborn or problematic. This is the first and last Korky product I will ever buy in my life, and I would return it but I can't find the receipt.And as for the \\"quite fill\\" bit, yeah it's quite, but aren't all new fill valves quiet these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I had professional installation.

This appears to be a similar issue reported by other reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"My partner bought a Korky valve to replace the Fluidmaster 400A in the small bathroom. I was skeptical since I had trusted Fluidmaster valves since I watched my Grandpa put one in his toilet nearly 30 years ago, but being tired of having to take the Fluidmaster apart every couple months to clean it out decided maybe it will work. That was a year ago and still no issues, when the big bathroom needed the Fluidmaster cleaned out I just replaced it with the Korky, it is an improvement over the 30+ year old technology Fluidmaster IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive packaging - it doesn't fit all toilets","review":"The Korky 528 toilet fill valve box states that the valve fits all toilets. This valve DOES NOT work properly in TOTO brand toilets. Three weeks ago I purchased and installed a 528 valve and it initially appeared to work correctly but then I realized the bowl was not filling completely. This lack of water during the initial flush subsequently caused our pipes to clog and created a plumbing problem. I have subsequently found that Korky manufactures a special valve (528T)for TOTO toilets at a substantially higher price ($26). I no longer have the packaging or receipt for the original valve so there is no possibility of returning it. I purchased a 528T today. Hopefully, it will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Despite several attempts, I could not get a seal where the new valve/washer meets the tank (Kohler, not Low type).

Not worth the time to constantly replace.","review":"Don't bother with this product. I've had to replace it for the 2nd time, this time after less than 8 months.

If your time to replace a fill valve is worth more than $5 to you, avoid this worthless product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it immediately because water kept flowing","review":"I bought the Korky water valve based on the premise that it would be quieter than my existing one. Installation was easy, but the first trials proved that it was not significantly different than the valve I was replacing in terms of noise. More disturbing was the fact that even after the water stopped filling I could hear the distinct noise of water flowing ever so slightly. It never stopped. I removed and re-installed it thinking that something was off. Same result, it never stopped flowing at the end of the fill cycle. After reading similar reviews here, I returned it to Home Depo and replaced it with a Fluidmaster one. Fluidmaster worked as expected on first try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't refill in locked position","review":"Not that easy of an install, because it's tricky to adjust the water level. At first the toilet wouldn't refill, so I did a google search to try to trouble search and found someone who said their's (a different brand) wouldn't refill in the locked position. So I unlocked the valve and now it's refilling, thankfully. But all this took a little while to figure out, about 45 min. - 1 hour to replace and get it to work. Hopefully, the 'unlocked' status of the valve doesn't cause any future problems. Oh, and it doesn't seem that quiet either. You get what you pay for, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy a Korky!","review":"I have used 3 of these Korky Quite Fill toilet fill valve & flapper kits. 1st one I bought was because I wanted to see if it would actually be quieter than the original simple type of valve I had that lasted 7 years without any issues. It lasted about 6 months and it started making funky stop go noises until it filled the tank all the way. I called Lavelle industries because it comes with a 5 year warranty. They had me take the top section apart, put it together and worked for about 4 days. Called back again and was told to do the same and I said, \\"hack no!\\" I ain't doing this every single week, so Lavelle sent me another. Put that on, 2 weeks later, same thing!

They parallel my own journey. I find it to be a valuable addition to 12 step literature and am grateful that the author has the courage to own and correlate his buddhist practice with his membership in a 12 step fellowship. The only reason that I could not give it a full 5 stars is that despite his promise to deal with the Higher Power issue - specifically what does a buddhist look to as a HP within the 12 step context, I ended up feeling that he had side stepped it. That concept is something that this writer still struggles with and I wished that I had been able to learn more from this writer about that issue and his experience with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Helpful","review":"The \\"God\\" steps were always a stumbling block for me, even though I have been in AA for many years.

Although the AA \\"Big Book\\" is a wonderful book, it is NOT another Bible as some AAs seem to need it to be -- it is a guide, not a doctrine. Every person must find a path that makes sense for them and this book helped me do just that. I highly recommend it, as well as Kevin's second book, \\"A Burning Desire:...\\". Another good read was Therese Jacobs-Stewart's \\"Mindfulness and the 12 Steps:...\\" Don't let the closed-mindedness of others stop you from a full search of what may work for you.

While the author has a good writing style, it is full of scads of technical errors and many programming practices that should not be imitated.This phenomenon is not unheard of for Mr. Schildt either. Many of his past books have been received very badly by the C/C++ community. For that reason, I think it's irresponsible for him to proclaim himself as an \\"authority\\" and \\"master\\". What he should do is take on a reviewer for his books with more technical skill than he posesses.So in conclusion, I'm saddened to have to inform you that this book is not worth your money.

STL Programming from the Ground Up is an introduction to STL programming for those who want to start working with the STL quickly.If I had do say one negative thing, it's only that I would have preferred more material.

Well made and efficient. Definitely lives up to the hype. One teenie design flaw is the opening, which allows the cat to toss quite a bit of sand onto the floor, but this is easily fixed with a little duck tape to cover the bottom third of the opening. Assembly was effortless and since I used sylica crystals prior to purchasing the poop-bot, despite it's healthy price tag, it's definitely going to pay for itself quickly.

I felt the Noise was not excessive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Cats Only","review":"While the litter Robot is a clever idea, it is much too small for a grown cat.

So be warned. little cats only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat won't use it.","review":"My older cat refuses to use it. He would rather use the floor when his old litter box is too dirty than to use the Litter Robot. My Younger cat did go in 2 times, but after seeing the thing spins he refused to go back. I think it's more of the noise though. I do think it is easier to train the younger cat to use it, but not the older cats. I think they also really dislike having to jump in there (it's quite high). When my cat jumps out, he doesn't step on the step, but just kind of jump out and still splatter the litter around that area anyways.I kept the Litter Robot for a few months hoping that my cat will eventually use it, but they never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HEADACHE","review":"I got this hoping to ease my litter woes and it just increased them. The main problem is if you don't clean the lower tray, which is very small, when the ball rotates it scrapes into it, meaning poop all around the outside of the ball. interesting design, but i think the trays need to be wider and deeper, not to leave it unattended longer, but to account for the fact that the litter needs room to settle. if it just drops in one spot, it piles up fast. that and the noise along with how small it was in there. only one of my cats liked using it and i think it had everything ti do with the size of the ball, really small. i threw this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Awhile..","review":"Well, we absolutely loved the Litter Robot for about 4 months.

We took it to the car wash to hose it down and that 'cleaned' it (we didn't hose down the bottom, electric part).

When I restarted my computer my CD-drive was gone, said the drivers were corupted so I reloaded them, then my sound went, so I reloaded, and this process went on until i formatted the PC. Installed the game again, same thing! Figured my computer was messed up, so I loaded it on another, same problem. Not sure what the problem is and I have grown tired of tring to get both UFO Aftershock and UFO Aftermath to work, I am planning on returning them to Cenega with a formal complaint.

I was exited ready to play the latest version of a game I really loved in the past and I did experience many exiting gaming hours with it. Nothing really happened. It was really disappointing the result because what I saw is nothing new. It is what we played years ago but in our days looks really poor. As a program it is very heavy and loading procedures really disturbing. The sound is good I must admit but with good sound only you can't have a good game.Once more I must say I was disappointed from the critics of the game magazines that give high scores (more than 80% some of them) for a game that will not last in your computer for long. I wish I never had bought this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"Even though Aftershock was created in the X-com vein, it's not an X-com game and as thus, should not be compared to X-com.Instead of talking about what was good, I'll just discuss the bad things which is a much smaller list.The game introduces resource management, which can be really difficult. I would strongly recommend going to www.strategycore.co.uk and reading the resource management FAQ. Read all the Aftershock FAQs as well, to enhance game enjoyment.The game is actually too long. Near the end, I pretty much stopped using strategy and just swept the mission area, killing and healing as I went. :)Sure, there are bugs. Nothing is perfect. There are also workarounds.

To date they have not, even with a 1.2 patch.The turn based strategy game had me hooked for months until I reached a point in the game where one of the many glitches meant I was unable to complete the mission. Upon reading associated forums, I could fix this problem if I restarted an earlier saved mission (2 solid weeks worth) or emailed the saved game to the developers. I have been waiting two weeks for this 'fixed' save game to be sent back. Really annoyed, by all accounts I was just one piece of research away from finishing. I have no faith in this software developer and consequently will never buy one of their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite","review":"Nice graphics and good ragdoll physics do not make the game any more fun. It's pretty good for a while but ultimately the player is just killing time as (s)he waits for the next plot point to unfold.

The book's ingredients and preparation methods are relatively simple, making it easy for newcomers to make their favorite Indian dish or try out a new chutney. However, Indian cooking is all about spices and I believe the authors compromised on taste in the interests of simplicity. The recipes I fixed looked great but always seemed to be lacking in terms of taste. After trying a dozen recipes with lack luster results I discarded this cookbook in favor of other books with more authentic tastes. In summary, if you want great illustrations and some easy recipes give this book a try. If you truly want to experience the tastes of India, I recommend you try Lord Krishna's Cuisine: The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking or The Spice is Right: Easy Indian Cooking for Today."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and...","review":"I bought this book since it had the Betty Crocker name attached to Indian cooking. However the book is a huge disappointment, to say the least. It is a mish-mash of North and South Indian recipes, some vegetarian, and some meat dishes, with no demarcation between anything. Recipe titles are poorly translated into English, and the Indian names are sometimes in Hindi and sometimes in tamil. While the pictures are tastefully done, seems like Raghavan iyer is otherwise confused. If you are Indian, you definitely can do without this book. And if you are a non-Indian looking to buy a good Indian cookbook, feel free to pass on this one. There are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch cookbook","review":"I stumbled on to this wonderful indian cookbook while attending a cooking class taught by the author.

This book provides valuable insight on how you can avoid such companies as well as how they accomplish their dirty work. The case studies are absolutely hilarious and make very enjoyable reading.

If everyone followed his advice, there would be no IPOs, no new companies, no banks, no investment of any sort.

It was important to me to stick to the most \\"pure\\" pilates, what Joseph Pilates invented all those years ago. I know enough about the basic moves to know that THIS is NOT anything like the classic pilates. There are a couple of recognizable moves, but this is mostly a dance warmup. These moves are what I have seen my daughters doing at the barre before their dance classes. Not totally without value, but not what I was working for.

Unless a reviewer (AROBINSON in \\"Hot Cinnamon Spice\\" review, compared Spice & Sunset in a different package (sachet or teabag or loose leaf), there is absolutely no logical reason for the difference in taste (AND much higher price). I enjoyed the taste but felt it left a clove after-taste more than cinnamon.

But not for a programming language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I learned ASP and Mysql with great ease and quick progress with 'the visual blueprint' books, the delivery were clear and concise.But things have changed in this new series. The writing style is difficult to understand: instead of explaining the topic first, the writer jumps right into 'you can do this and that'. I have to read each chapter several times in order to grasp what he means. The screen shots are now arranged on top of one another. Which is by itself ok if the text are not reduced even smaller making it more difficult to read.I am quite disappointed by this 'new' approach. I hope the publisher has not changed the 'your visual blueprint series' intojust a reference book instead of being a teaching book which it was so good at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendo in the Glass","review":"I always enjoy Tamar Myers' work. I think CJ, and in general the eccentricities of the characters are what makes this book good. To me, a good mystery is a good book first and a good mystery second.Myers' sense of humor is one of the things that makes her mysteries worth reading. She is primarily a comic writer, with a strong sense of place and of character. The mystery is secondary - which to my mind is the way it should be.I suspect that living outside the U.S. during her early life has given her an outsiders eye; she sees stuff that is invisible to most of us because we take it for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unspeakably Awful","review":"The author has managed to imitate Susan Wittig Albert and her China Bayles series in every detail, with one notable exception. It's bad. Very, very bad. The storytelling is on an amateur level, the characters are simplistic, and the style is almost unbearable. I simply couldn't push on beyond the repetitive and obvious misbehavior of the main character's twit friend, who appears to be more of a tedious bad joke than a sidekick. The heroine might loudly declare that she loves Charleston, but I wasn't made to fall instantly in love with it. It takes a pretty substandard read to make me stop and wish that trees hadn't died for the book, but this one managed it in record time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever...too clever!","review":"SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS is a clever book. In fact, its greatest problem is that it's too clever.Its protagonist is too cutesy, the protagnist's snap responses are too quick and too hokey. This is a shame, because author Tamar Myers obviously is a gifted writer of mysteries.This story is complicated and interesting: Myers' details about Charleston, where the tale is set, and about collectible crystal and antique shops, all seem accurate and these really are quite interesting. Her ear for dialogue, even when that dialogue is strained, is excellent.Thus, the overly cute tone bogs down what actually is a very good mystery, rather than enhancing it, as had to have been Ms. Myers' intent. SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS--even the name is cutesy--is a good book. Yet this novel misses being great, and SPLENDOR did have the potential to be more than it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charleston 1 Abby Washburn 0","review":"This was my first Den of Antiquity mystery and I picked it up only because it is written about my favorite city, Charleston, SC. I found the tidbits about Charleston fascinating! They were funny, they were educational, they were fascinating and they were oh so true. It was great to read about so many of the local spots we frequent (Grace Church, The Market, Magnolia's, Poogan's Porch, The Citadel Mall, etc.). Unfortunately, the mystery was extremely trite. Halfway through, I had more than enough of many of the obnoxious characters including C.J. and Momma. The entire tale was totally unbelievable. I'm a great fan of mystery writers including Grafton, Hillerman, Patterson, Evanovich, Baldacci, etc. Too bad I won't be adding Myers to my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine","review":"This is the first and most assuredly the last \\"book\\" by Tamar Myers I'll ever read. I'm only grateful I borrowed the book and didn't waste money on it.How to state adequately how dreadful this little piece of ill-written dreck is? Are publishers so desperate they're now resorting to street sweepings? The plot and situations are moronic, the characters ridiculous, the writing beyond dreadful.I realize that mysteries are intended to be entertainment, not literature, but this infantile piece of trash makes Black Mask Magazine look like the collected works of James Joyce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large is still too small","review":"First, the liners I got are not in the package pictured.

Also, the yellow package pictured says \\"Heavy Duty,\\" and the one I got does not ... as I said, it ripped, so it is certainly not heavy duty. Too much money to pay for something totally useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved his music, new little about him.....","review":"A very enjoyable read, full of a multitude of tidbits that re-evaluated my perception of the times covered in this book. The author is too much in the forefront, although I got to hand it to him for getting as much out of this recluse as he did.A large percentage of this book is pages long direct quotes from Young. I tired on the perception of how incredible Tonights the Night was, and scratched my head at his negative perceptions of Harvest Moon, Weld, and Unplugged. I always thought those records were the second half of the great comeback. I also feel the author was too judgemental in criticizing Young for going mainstream by attending television events. Neils reply about him fulfilling a husbandly duty was priceless. His wife wanted to go to the big show. If you are even a remote Neil Young fan there is plenty here. If you are not, then you are not even reading this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"freud would have loved it","review":"neil young is/was an important and significant creative force. knowing how and why he rejects high school, how he treated bullies, early sexual views, parental booze abuse and divorce, early music experiences all establish how he got there. if your REALLY interested in how he got there, more is typically better than less.Badly edited? Yes, but I'd rather that - than a slick editor, determined to get it to 350 pages, leaves valuable info on the cutting room floor.great insight on early rock/folk evolution. clever layout but def rambling. perhaps some ego, but no one else has gotten to neil(glad to take what i can get). very weak photos. great insight into his creative process.if your interested in this period, early rock or neil young - you should prob chop your way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I can't believe the reviewer who says \\"Why can't all biographies be this entertaining?\\" I couldn't get through this tome of boredom! I love Neil Young and was looking forward to finding out more about him. But I just could not wade through this. Page after page was boring, not because of Neil's life, but because of the writing style. Blah blah blah. An amazing dude like Neil Young deserves a better biographer. I was sorely disappointed. Every other bio I've ever read was better than this - which I guess makes this the worst one I've ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Neil.","review":"If you wonder why this book seems to stop on a dime, it's because Neil had the opportunity to review a first draft.Jimmy McDonough was an insider. He was granted insiders' access. He accepted it, did what any reputable journalist would do, and reported on what he'd found.Then Neil saw a first draft of the book. He didn't like it. He cut off access.Neil Young is one of my all-time favorite performers. As a human being, if 50% of what Jimmy McDonough documents in this book is true, Neil needs to learn a lot about being a human being.This book is not a review of Neil's CDs. It's a biography. As such, Neil may not be quite so admirable as a man as he is a rock star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to Burn It Than To Read Away","review":"I am a big Neil Young fan, and I like biographies, so I should've liked this, right?Unfortunately, the writing is so tedious it was a struggle to get through. Jimmy McDonough seems more interested (or, perhaps I should say \\"innarested\\" as he does several times a page) in expounding on his own opinions than on Neil's. By about page 2 you realize Mr. McDonough is overly proud of the fact that he has cracked Neil's inner circle, and he spends the next 750 pages reinforcing how chummy he is with the principal characters. We get multi-page accounts of Mr. McDonough recounting how only he would tell Neil that he was being over commercial and over-exposed, then we skip years ahead to the next Jimmy-tells-Neil anecdote. I wanted a Neil Young bio, not a Jimmy McDonough bio.Die hard fans might -- and I stress the maybe -- be able to fight their way through this biography, but everyone else should stay away. Better to spend your money on some Neil Young CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perspective","review":"Note to this biographer and anyone else planning a biography. Check your love or hatred at the doorstep of beginning your book. I get so tired of biographers being fans and critics slanting every bit of fascinating history into a morphed shape of their subject.

It takes you through the years starting with Neil's childhood, how he got involved in R&R, and every band and collaboration along the way. Great quotes from the man himself throughout. My only issue with it, as a die-hard, is that there wasn't much info that was unknown..but that would be true only if you're a real Neil fan.

And my wife pointed out how many times I was laughin' while reading the book.Hey, I would agree with the other reviews that Jimmy put himself too much into the story and the book burned out 'bout half way through. Probably the only way the guy could write the 90's section. I'm willing to give him the benefit.Now, Neil has gotta be one of the harder bio's for any author to get his teeth into. Lucky he had LOTS of long toothed rockers and \\"in his orbit\\" guys to get copy out of.I think he tossed some enjoyable CSNY stories in there.Would I recommend it? I'd rather steer a reader to Robert Gordon writing about Memphis musical legends like Alex Chilton.I think I just get a kick outta reading bio's like this, 'cuz all Neil's music is in my head and the book envokes a kind of jukebox reverie.

Too bad Neil Young allowed this creep to interview him for this piece of junk. Jimmy McDonough is the literary equivalant of Mark Chapman, Lennon's assasin.

I got through all 740+ pages, despite feeling increasingly disappointed and annoyed, and found it to have no redeeming qualities. While I'm sure many of the book's criticisms about Neil Young as a personare accurate, the disection of Neil's music was incredible harsh and degrades some of his best work.

The book meanders here, there and everywhere but never quite finds it target. Hardcore Neil Young fans will love its wealth of information, but more casual fans will wish that the editor[s] had done their job. Despite nearly 800 pages of text, the author never really seems to understand Young and many of the stories are but endless variations on the same themes.As rock music biographies go, its not bad )this is not a genre known for good writing) but unless you are fascinated by those around Neil Young (about whom the book more revealing than about Young), boredom will set in early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much for the likes of the NY Times","review":"Here we get the amazing sight of media monsters spilling true feelings instead of spin. This book redefines what it means to write about the so-called \\"rock star.\\" And wouldn't you know it. The NY Times attempts to minimize \\"Shakey\\" by saying that it \\"soft peddles\\" and tries to be \\"too hip.\\" What they're saying, really, is that this book attempts things that should not be done by a Random House book, one that would have to be reviewed by the New York Times. It's truly curious to accuse \\"Shakey\\" of soft-peddling, when it reveals its subject to often be vicious, creepy, self-serving. Author Jimmy McDonough needs and deserves hardcore psychotherapy for the ten years he spent spilling his life into this remarkable book, which edges a little too close to the truth, both for salaried merchants of the status quo and the degraded value of Neil Young."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man Needs an Editor...","review":"I have been thinking about getting this book for awhile and finally picked it up after hearing a radio interview with the author. I haven't yet finished the book, but I must say it's really getting on my nerves. Information is constantly, annoyingly repeated. First McDonough states it himself, then he quotes Neil Young on the same topic. I prefer to see the author leave him/herself out of the book as much as possible. My ideal of a rock bio style is Tony Fletchers \\"Moon\\" about the life of Keith Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a copy of Tonights the Night instead","review":"Ugghhh. 700 pages of jealous, uninsightful blah blah blah.After 700 pages, McDonough comes to the conclusion that Neil is a \\"Human Being.\\" Wow!

While it held my interest, in a morbid way, I have come away from the subject matter wishing I had remained happily ignorant of. This is not a happy person we're dealing with.

Very disappointed. First part of book about Neil's early live was somewhat interesting but rest of it was boring. I have always been a Neil Young fan but probably not as much after I read this book. Neil treats people very shabby, walking out on any number of people without a word, including CSN a number of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book - long over due!","review":"I couldn't wait to read this - despite my mixed emotions about Neil Young's wishes (there was a lawsuit between the author and with Neil Young trying to prevent the publication of this). The book, 10 years in the writing, was written with the help and aid of Neil Young and his circle of friends and collegues. The book is intimate and explores Neil Young beyond the typical super star bio.Indepth look at his relationship to his family. His hobbies - (i.e Lionel Trains!). And his life behind the stage. His feelings for his native land - Canada. And much more.The book confirms and fills in details about what an awesome and multifaceted artist Neil Young is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy what?","review":"I trudged through this book and actually threw in down several times. Apparently Jimmy thinks ONLY Neil Young did rock and roll in the 70s. How would he know, he was just a child. He spends to much time trashing bands he knows nothing about. Finally when he called Sammy Haggar a 'goon' I got peed. Hey Jimmy, ever here of Montrose? Or Foghat or anyone else with a solid backbeat? Ever see Stempenwolf live at night for free in a Grant's parking lot? Ever see Hendrix booed like I did in Tampa 1968?He states several times that Neil does not listen to other bands. Apparently he does not either, at least not to any degree. And though published in 2002, he does not mention Live at Red Rock. Why? This book is all about Jimmy not Neil Young. Biographers who do not distance themselves to be objective always fail as this book does. I intend to loan it out to some one who has had one of my other bios for 6 years. IE, good riddance Jimmy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing!","review":"I have to be one of the biggest Neil Young fans but this book stinks. Not only is the content poor but the writing is horrible. McDonough seems to pride himself on being one of Young's cronies. I didn't buy the book to learn about McDoughs relationship with Neil. I'm not surprised that Neil sued McDonough to not release this book at one point. The man is a legend that doesn't let out much of his music or much about his personal life. Too bad McDonough didn't take this opportunity and really put out a good archive. I'm in agreement with some of the other reviews in that whoever edited this book should be fired. A horrible disservice to a real legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Major Biography","review":"Knowing Neil Young was loathe to have his story told, this is a book I never thought I would see. I was not able to put it down until I completed reading it. As a biographer myself, I know what McDonough went through to unearth the facts, interview people who would rather he hadn't, and most of all, get the cooperation of Neil himself. This has to be the first biography I have read where I thought to myself there was more information than I wanted. McDonough has written the most fascinating biography I have ever read. Yes, I could have done without some of the author's assessments, but hey - he earned the right. This book is so good and Neil Young's story so compelling, it's scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fittingly, a Mess","review":"I agree with the readers who have noted that there is probably a very good 300-page book here; there is no question that the book is self-indulgently long and McDonough self-importantantly annoying. But in some ways this is a very fitting biography for Neil Young; although -- like his career -- it rambles and is filled with plenty of dross, when you get to the good stuff it's pretty darn good. Due to the high dross-to-good ratio, I'd recommend this for fans only. One final curious note: this book was repetitive enough, and frustrating enough, that at times it made me like the music less (not because of the artist's \\"flaws,\\" the main one of which, we are told (hundreds of times) is that he tends to do whatever he wants). Neil Young is worth of a biography that inspires interest, not distaste. It's too bad McDonough, unquestionably a fan, couldn't achieve that result."},{"rating":"2","title":"For cats that don't care for Catnip.","review":"It has the same effect as catnip though.

It seems like a diverting little car chase movie the first time you see it, but O'Neil's stoic, nihilistic getaway driver has a way of bringing you back for more viewings. It's interesting that Ian Muldoon mentions the similarity to a Jean-Pierre Melville film in his review, because I think this movie owes a lot to Melville's LE SAMOURAI (on which John Woo's THE KILLER was also based). Just like Melville's hit man Jeff kills without conscience or reflection, yet still abides by an unbending code of honor, O'Neil's Driver is, ironically, more moral in his way than the obsessed, power-mad cop (Bruce Dern) who pursues him.Walter Hill no frills, straight-to-the-gut style really works here. The costumes, sets, and cinematography are dark, understated, and really engrossing, especially on repeated viewings. I believe that this is a movie that grad-school film students will be watching 100 years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it up!","review":"A crisp new album and breath of fresh air in the rap world! A nice new flavor from the West coast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hairdryer","review":"I had this hairdryer prior to this purchase (although in a different color), and I loved it. It started making a strange noise last month; I'd had it about two years by then. I was happy to get the exact same one again. I wasn't looking for a fancy hair dryer, just one with two settings (high and low) and enough power to get the job done. This one has good strength and it's compact enough to fit into my small bathroom drawer. I don't usually use the cord keeper feature, but it works well and doesn't seem flimsy or shoddy. This is a great hair dryer to pack in luggage because the cord retracts and the whole thing folds, so it's easy to shove in a corner. Overall, great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Basically, this dryer has three temperatures: COLD, COOL, AND WARM. This dryer only warms up (barely)if used in the ultra-loud, fast speed. If used in the lower speed, it barely warms up to room temperature. It's no better than the wind blowing thru my hair!If I wanted the wind to dry my hair, I would have bought a sports car! I need my hair dryer to get HOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started on Fire!!","review":"DON'T but this hairdryer. I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking. It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard. Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this hairdryer","review":"Bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere. What a piece of junk. Just stopped working one day. Would'nt turn on at all. To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won't get them back. The retractable cord worked when it felt like it. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It started a fire!","review":"I've been through 2 of these hair dryers. The first one stopped working after a year. The second one's cord twisted up and could not fully retract. For about a week it keep going on and off. This morning the cord sparked, smoked, and started to flame. I will not purchase this hair dryer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop.

I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function. This last one, though, shorted out and started a fire. I have notified the company and will see what happens. But I doubt that I will purchase another. It's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure would be nice to get a quality hair dryer for the wife.","review":"It was great out of the box. Nice strong dryer. It actually still does dry nicely. But, now the cord doesn't wind up. and it has two broken buttons. It only can be put on and dry. It only gets used by my wife once a week or so. Can't change the drying power level. Of course we have it on the high level. A product with good ideas, but made poorly.

I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again. Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together. Very frustrating. Go get a professional dryer. it might cost a bit more but it'll work! And probably for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece o' JUNK!","review":"Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn't damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud, cord too short","review":"I recently purchased this hair dryer and it is the loudest one I've ever used. The volume combined with a high pitched whine is so bad I was plugging my ears to use it. The cord is only 5 feet long which is too short to see myself in the mirror near my outlet. Lastly the cool jet button is not in a position that makes it easy to use just by feel so it makes drying time longer and more tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought the silver colored version of this at Target about 5 months ago. I was happy with it until last week. I straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound. The handle would no longer stay straight when I used the machine. Like some of the other reviewers I found, upon opening up the device, that the very cheap plastic piece that kept the handle in the locked position had broken. There was no way to fix it and it wasn't worth the hassle and expense to mail it in for repair. So I bought a different brand last night. I'm very unhappy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER!","review":"I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years. After one year I am going back to my old one. There is NO WAY to clean the vents on this one and it heats up HOT. It burned the top of my ear the other day. The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm. Look for the Conair dryers that have vents that can be cleaned and they will last you a good long time. Then only good thing about it is it travels well."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give this less than 1 star","review":"I bought this dryer as a replacement for one that my puppy managed to chew the cord on. My \\"old\\" dryer which I had for years, worked WONDERFULLY! I thought having the retractable cord would help to keep it out of his mouth and help keep me better organized. Too bad after less than 10 uses the \\"retractability\\" of the machine's cord stopped. Unfortunatly, this did not happen with the cord out. Furthermore, I was very disappointed with the force of the air - even on high. For the amount of noise it produced, I expected to be getting my hair blown dry in a windtunnel. I tried to take it apart to see it I could fix the cord, but the whole thing fell apart and I threw it in the garbage where it belonged. Too bad I didn't spend my time prior to purchasing it reading the reviews.

I now (very happily) own aInfiniti by Conair 223 Cord Reel Folding Handle Dryer, which, despite Amazon's title, does not have a folding handle.This was my second hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient, but there are several things I really hate about it. It is very noisy and I have to turn the radio up loud to hear the news--even when using the slow speed. You should be concerned about hearing loss if you use this. The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand. I have to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord. It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings. I prefer to use high heat and a slow speed, but that is not available on this cheap piece of junk.I highly recommend you do not waste your money on this hair dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay in locked position after 6 months","review":"Like many out there, my last Conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years.

It's like someone broke it's little red neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"I really hate this hair dryer. Absolutely every single time I use it, it shorts out and won't turn back on for at least 10 minutes. You want to talk about stress? Try getting ready to run out the door and never knowing if your hair dryer will actually finish the job before it calls it quits. And, even if I've only used it for 1 minute, if I turn this dryer off, it won't turn on again for at least 10 minutes. How can a stupid hair dryer overheat in ONE MINUTE? If the phone rings or my husband calls, I have to let this thing keep running because I KNOW it won't turn back on.I hate this piece of junk and am online right now trying to buy something else to replace it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No fires... yet...","review":"Well, my hairdryer hasn't started any fires, but it also hasn't worked correctly since right after I bought it either. The retractable cord doesn't retract anymore. The button broke off that controls that and, in general, it just isn't a good quality hair dryer. Pieces of a hair dryer shouldn't just break off.

I literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when I used this dryer. I mentioned that I had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter-in-law were visiting, and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too.

Gregg spends the whole movie talking directly to someone that you can't see and never makes a sound. [Rather than looking into the camera or audience] Then, the DVD hung up twice and missed big sections when it got back on track. The whole production was boring and unimaginative - not good for a medium that depends on engaging the viewer's emotions and imagination for its success.I like Gregg, but if all his videos are like this one, he should definitely stick to writing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for ...","review":"This is a re-tread of Canon's APS 55-200 lens.

In general, a wobbly lens is NOT a good thing!If you're looking for something in this price range, I would recommend the 28-105 f/3.5-4.5 USM. For about the same money, you get ring USM, better image quality, and solid construction.If really need the longer focal length, spend the extra money for a 75-300 f/4-5.6 IS USM which has image stabilization and comparable image and build quality to the 28-105.

It's still a decent read, but I give it 2 stars for the missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story!","review":"This book was just amazing. I couldn't believe that this kid really built a reactor in his mothers shed. What was really amazing was that he was never charged with any crime. He, after all, put not only his life in danger but his parents and neighborhood and school. The EPA never pressed David to seek medical attention, they just suggested it to him. I just couldn't beleive that he never even received a slap on the hand for what he had done. The icing on the cake was that he joined the Navy and after boot camp was posted to the U.S.S. Enterprise which carries nuclear war heads. What a great country we live in! Never the less a good read that will blow your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Tale","review":"The Radioactive Boy Scout is quite a tale--intelligently written, thorough and pretty darn scary when you get right down to it. David Kahn, a high school student, chemistry fan and Boy Scout in search of the Eagle Scout honor pretty much constructed a rudimentary nuclear reactor in his back yard potting shed in suburban Detroit, using old clocks and discarded smoke alarms, among other things. Ken Silverstein takes this unbelievable story and fashions it into something the reader can believe, however scary that may be. Silverstein tosses in much nuclear trivia and information that add to the story. An enjoyable and scary read. I am recommending it to all of my scientifically oriented friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Golf Manor, MI?????","review":"I'm from suburban Detroit and had never heard of this story.

I heard about this book and thought it would be a good story to share with my Scouts and coworkers. Silverstein is (1) a poor writer, (2) obviously biased and (3) did not to do any research on the truth about nuclear technology.

If the anti-nuclear, anti-Scout and amateur observations pertaining to the anti-nuclear family (pun intended) are extracted and thoughtfully edited, perhaps a chapter or two of \\"on topic\\" content remain.The potential for several good, and worthwhile, stories are certainly present in this booklet. Developing those stories will also certainly require the talents of a more focused, less biased and better writer.It is not likely that I will again be fooled into purchasing a booklet by Mr. Silverstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Library Wasted it's Money","review":"Apparently the author had some extra facts on the history of nuclear power, the boy scouts, and a human intrest story that he couldn't sell. So what is a person to do? Twist the facts, tell small lies, and put three seemingly unrelated stories together to make a bad book.It is obvious that the author has had some bad experiences with nuclear power, becuase he takes at least 70 percent of the book to bad mouth america's cleanest and safest form of energy.The title was inviting and the cover art is interesting, but the words and story are a waste of time and not nearly as controversial or interesting as he makes them sound.I feel bad for the library wasting thier money on this, but I am sure glad I didn't waste mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like it should","review":"This Auto Meter Sport Comp Boost gauge works like advertised.

The author either can't understand, or misrepresents, basic scientific thinking as well as Julian Jaynes, Noam Chomsky, Richard Leakey, and Charles Darwin. Thompson is obviously sharp enough to understand his primary sources -- and I'm afraid that he selectively quotes things out of context as well as setting up straw man fallacies.

The relationships are complex but Mr. Zimmermann does a fine job of presenting the situation for the layman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally biased and demonizing.","review":"I found the book totally biased and chauvinistic towards the Western view of events and history of the region. For a man who supposedly spent a lot of time in Yugoslavia with the Serbs, he shows a complete misunderstanding of their collective psyche. He makes little mention of the atrocities committed against Serbs of Krajina or of the secret protocols of Rambouillet which would have left Serbia a vassal of NATO. He lists war criminals who are all Serbs without mentioning that their were criminals on all sides. There is little about the legal justifications of NATO's undeclared war or on the civilian casualties caused by Nato bombing. Worst of all, he still uses the lie that the bombing was justified to stop ethnic cleansing when it is clear that the cleansing came after the bombing began. There is very little truth here.

The only problems are a sometimes repetitive and preachy text (he dfinitely has an axe to grind!). Still - the rewarding story of a profoundly fascinating and important man with a voracious hunger for sex, writing, and above all freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explore the Sexual, Political, and Artistic Life of Arenas","review":"Reinaldo Arenas' Before Night Falls is a sexually driven account of the author's life which encapsulates the journey of a homosexual artist and the violent opposition to his very existence, as well as how he survives such opposition. Arenas gives a fascinating perspective concerning masculinity, Castro, and artistic purpose. His style is simple, honest, and detailed. In addition to Arenas' straightforward approach he has a great ability to place the reader in his shoes. Considering the tale is given with such a personal angle the reader can understand the complications and contradictions of homosexual masculinity. Moreover, anyone who is curious about the artistic and political experiences of a homosexual in Cuba this memoir will serve them like a well-balanced meal. You will fall in love with Reinaldo and the way that he experienced life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, moving, fascinating biography","review":"Albeit, the accounts of his youth, which had hints of bestiality, took me by surprise, in all, his biography is one of the best I've read. The verbal imagery used to describe places is vivid. His honesty in expressing his sexuality, fascinating. One feels his frustrations of preserving his art and the pain of betrayal by so many of his colleagues and friends. He injects humour in unexpected places, even in the midst of horrors. For a short time, you are taken into his world and your eyes, opened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is Arenas' autobiography. Let me say, first, that I have read his works of fiction and have found them to be excellent, and in some cases, hilarious. Second, I really found his graphic descriptions of his homosexual activities to be revolting. Third, this writer was about to be relegated to oblivion because of his frank anti-Communism and the film that was made with this title rescued his writings from oblivion, yet, it is pathetic that he is now being read by the English speaking world not because of his literary talent but because he became a famously persecuted homosexual writer. Again, let me urge the reader to read his other works, because they are good. I have read them in the original Spanish and don't know how well they've translated into other languages, so if you can read them in the original Spanish, do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS blech blech blech","review":"This book just made me gag.

Unlike some of the other reviewers the sex did not put me off enjoying the book. But to claim that the book is known mainly for the writer's sexual preferences and politics is a view I don't accept. It is well written by a very talented writer. That is why the book should be read. To die at 47 after finally escaping Cuba was a tragedy but what a colourful life he led for all of it's up's and down's. Hardly a dull page in the book and you have to admit that it was as funny as it was chilling and moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuban misery revealed in one gay man's memoirs...","review":"'Before Night Falls' is certainly an eye-opening read. Sure, everyone has heard about life in Cuba in Castro being tough. But for one novelist and poet, a gay one no less, life was unbelievable horrific. Such oppression, including incarceration, for little purpose other than to suppress free speech.Yet the book isn't all doom and gloom. The author often sees the lighter side of misery and had seemingly remained optimistic through it all. Yet I had difficulty with the author's delight in describing his rampant homosexual trysts; he admits to having sex with about 5,000 men by the time he was 25. Obviously having sex and lots of it was important to him. But honestly, after a while all the names, places and details of his sexcapades grew boring. I am not sure why the author felt the need to share such information with the readers.Bottom line: certainly an educational and oftentimes moving read. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the back of the book:","review":"This book demonstrates how one can talk about God in a way that is not exclusively male and is also biblically responsible. Many attempts to reclaim the female imagery for God in the Bible have foundered on the paucity of explicitly female images. However, the author seeks to reimagine the God who feeds, which traditionally has been regarded as gender neutral, in maternal terms. A metaphor of God's provision of food includes aspects of a mother's attentiveness, a mother's discipline and teaching, and a mother's household management. Biblical texts where an explicit connection between God's provision of food and nursing imagery are made to encourage such a reading, as they create a lingering association in the mind of the reader.

Death, Famine, and Plague have each come riding into town and then been sent packing. Now War is on the rampage. He has also collected his cohorts to make a final stand to bring about an end to this great big mess we call the world. But the surviving adversaries from Symphony (book 1), In the Mood (book 2), and Chariot (book 3) are coming together, albeit it reluctantly, to head the horsemen off at the pass. The final battle for the fate world will be waged, as is the case in all of Grant's stories (both in the series and out), in some small, off the beaten path town. Again emphasis is placed on atmosphere and character, story always being something of a weak point in Grant's writing. Those looking for tale with an autumnal chill to it will find Riders in the Sky well worth galloping through, others looking for something more focused and gritty will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late Summer: Early Afternoon","review":"I bought this book on the strength of some other books by this author.

I scoured the cover to see if there was some indication of this, but found nothing. A quick visit to Amazon revealed the truth however. This pile of merde is part of a much larger pile of merde going back to Symphony. I have seen other authors attempt to employ cinamatic idioms, but none fail worse than Grant does in this book. From what I have read in this and In The Fog Charles Grant is a great editor, but his own story telling ability sorely lacks. The epitome of all style and no substance.Go buy the revised version of The Stand and pass on this one.

Every time the author approaches an analytic question or theory, she soon lets go of her thread and diverges into another irrelevant story. While reading this book, I asked myself several times \\"wait a second, what does this have to do with pollution or taboo?\\", \\"what was the subject matter of this chapter again?\\" and \\"what conclusions can be drawn from all these examples?\\".

Even without the crease it was extremely difficult to slide the rubber piece through the channel. After it had been mounted for about a week the rubber seal came out of the channel and is now hanging down in the middle of the garage door. Also, I wish I had known that the screws used to attach the seal to the door required a hex driver (not a regular flat blade or Phillips head screwdriver), which I didn't have available at the time so I ended up nailing the aluminum strip to the door (I can't wait until I have to rip it off the door)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage Door Seal","review":"After reading several other reviews I took their advice and use some silicon spray on the rails.

I can't recommend this product if you like quality taste in your coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement for an expired model","review":"We had a great little coffee maker that, after many years, we had to replace. Unfortunately that model isn't being made anymore so I thought I'd give this one a try. It's not so great.The thermal mugs are nice and the unit itself looks good but the design is a little difficult to use. The filters where you put the groud coffee are kind of in back of the machine and swing out towards you to be filled. So it you have it against the wall you have to more the unit whenever you fill it. Becasue of the angle to get the grinds in they always get all over the place.It also doesn't make hot coffee unless you use very hot water to make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin Coffee maker","review":"I am sooo in love with this machine.

The filter holders open to the rear, obligating the user to pull the unit out from under any kitchen wall cabinets in order to put coffee into the filters 2.) water is not dispensed equally at all between the two sides: the right side on my unit gets about 1.5 times as much water as the left, so the left side has to be about 1/2 full to avoid having the right side spill over 3.) the coffee is very weak - no comparison with the coffee quality from the 10 year old Black and Decker unit I replaced this with. It seems that the water is too cool once it reaches the coffee/filter to make strong coffee so I have to use quite a bit more coffee per cup than usual (same coffee and grind).Quality control may be an issue with this unit since some reviewers had great results while others had experiences similar to mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good quality","review":"to start...why have the one cup option on the left and have the water dial icon on top show the one cup picture on the right and the two cup faceing left. if you don't use this maker alot you will forget and have coffee coming out the right AND left. the heating element needs to be a little hotter. The filter door comes off easily and emptying the filter always causes coffee water to drop onto the counter.so always have a paper towel ready.I just read other reviews stating the same problems...you would think by now that the company would reach out to unhappy customers to rectify this problem.

I was hoping to have one side just for tea and the other side for coffee. That is not possible. The switch does only 1 or 2 cup brewing. Not Left - Both - Right. Plus the switch is mislabeled. When you select the picture of 1 Cup it brews on both sides.

I drink regular coffee and my husband drinks decaf. Before purchasing this coffeemaker we had to make one kind and put it in a thermal carafe and then make the other kind. This coffeemaker makes it possible for us to make one kind in each cup at the same time.

This Toastess just doesn't make very good coffee and I am now going to replace it. I think the problem may be that the water isn't hot enough to extract the full flavor from the coffee but, whatever the cause, I'm done. I would not recommend this to anyone who is fussy about flavor. I've just put a Zojirushi coffee maker in my Amazon cart so I'm hoping for results worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source for coffee for this machine","review":"Some reviews mention difficulty with telling the difference between a single and double brew setting. I agree with other reviewers who said just pay attention to the graphics on the machine and you'll figure it out. Mainly I wanted to share a great source for coffee pods I found that work great in this machine. I was using loose ground coffee but sometimes emptying and rinsing can be messy. Through Green Tree Coffee you can get single serve pods that fit perfectly in this machine. My husband likes one but I use two as I like it a little stronger. They are relatively inexpensive considering they are individually wrapped. Shipping is fast and economical and with each order they send me a coupon for % off my next order. I love this coffee maker and these coffee pods make it an even better functioning unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"The cups are nice but the design of the brewer is horrible. It splatters all over the place regardless of how you position the cup and cleaning the filter only adds to the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Workmanship","review":"This is a very convenient coffee maker. However, the workmanship is very poor. We have had it for about a year. The filters are fragile and tear easily. Replacing them is extremely time consuming, and customer service is not very accommodating. Additionally, after about four months of use, water started leaking out of the reservoir and down the front of the machine. Furthermore, on the one-cup setting, a sizable amount of the water still drips into the second cup, resulting in measuring difficulties. I strongly recommend going with a different brand/model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toastess Coffee Maker","review":"Overall the product works quite well. One improvement would be to have the filters loaded from the top instead of opening outward.

That's when I realized that this game is the most fun that I've had since Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. I love this game. It's hard, fun, addictive, and DEFINATELY replayable. My recommendations, however, are that you should rent this game to make sure that it is right for you before buying it, because you may come home after buying it, play it fot 5 minutes, and declare that this style isn't for you.

The style of the Eljer uses a plastic bracket mounted to the tank bolt in order to secure the flapper. This mount had snapped, and in order to attempt to repair this toilet *without* removing the tank, I purchased this kit. The kit installed fine. I cleaned the surfaces as directed and the parts adhered without issue. However, after a month of regular use, the seal began to leak. I do not use any chemicals in the bowl of the tank, but rather it appears the act of flushing the toilet was enough to break the seal. This may be an issue with the design of these older Eljer toilets and the amount of water pressure against the flapper. Regardless, the seal did not hold up. I have discarded this kit and removed the tank to install a new Eljer mount/flapper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY Flapper you will ever need","review":"With rental properties, huge remodels and a number of personal homes, I have had to replace dozens of flappers. Unfortunately it took me a bit to find the Fluidmaster 555. But now I am convinced this is the best flapper for all kinds of toilets. I have used it in one piece, two piece, old and new toilets. I recently had a Kohler one-piece 70's style toilet (Rialto, I think) that specifically said this kind of flapper would NOT work. I special ordered the Kohler part and it was WORSE. I finally went out to the store and bought the Fluidmaster 555c. Despite the tight space, it worked great. Installs in minutes and ALWAYS works."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs better sealant","review":"The design of this unit at first had me inpressed. It is VERY straight forward and simple.

However, after reading Doug's review, I realized that all these years I have been struggling with the plastic chain problem and large hook problem exactly as he has described them. If you don't want to risk running your well dry I suggest you avoid this kit until Fluidmaster replaces the plastic chain with a metal one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Sealant","review":"I didn't have quite the same problem as other reviewers...The 555C comes with a \\"no wait drain seat sealant\\", which is basically a pliable rubber (like hard chewing gum).

My toilet actually leaked worse after installing this 555C.If you are just repairing a slow leak around the flapper, skip this product, and try this: Get a new Fluidmaster flapper and add some weight inside the flapper hole (pennies, a rock, whatever) or use a water-safe glue to attach weight on the exterior of the flapper...

While Airwaves sounded to cater to radio listeners, Say No More is pure rock. That's not to mean that this is a hard-rocking album--Badfinger sounds overall as poppy as ever on this one. However, there is nary a ballad to be found here (though a couple of the lighter songs come close) and the production barely sounds \\"80's\\" on most of the tracks.Say No More honestly isn't a GREAT collection of songs and the best ones don't stand out TOO much, but what it IS is a solid album, which is more than what can be said about its predecessor. It doesn't stand up too strongly next to Badfinger's \\"classic\\" albums, but it is definately a worthwhile listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"9.6V Makita Replacement Battery","review":"I was somewhat skeptical to buy a \\"generic\\" brand replacement battery for a very well known name brand tool.

Might sound good if you've never heard anything else, but really, a lousy, overpriced hunk of junk. There's a reason that the Bose display in most brick-and-mortar stores is separated from the rest of the other companies - Bose insists on that, so that people can't make an honest comparison with other products.

I had a couple of friends listen to it before I sent it back just to make sure I was giving it a fair chance. Like me they thought it sounded slightly better than my old boom box but not worth the $1,064 I paid at that time. That was several years ago so maybe they have improved ( but so have the $120 systems ) I would say go listen to one of these in person before you spend this kind of money.

Alien, a great Sci-Fi flick, had the birth and rapid growing which was poorly repeated in this flick. The Beast Within (notice the title similarity), which was a decent horror movie for it time, has the same theme of a monster trying to mate with every woman it comes across. They took two good movies and made one pretty bad one. The low budget definitely didn't help. The \\"Gargoyle\\" reminded me of Godzilla. A rubbery suit that was too big for the guy wearing it. Water, or some sort of goo/liquid sprayed on the suit would have helped - looked too dry. I will give it 1 star for gore though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A plant family that may be more ingenious than the orchids","review":"I've long been a fan of the Orchidaceae, but I didn't know that the Aroids are possibly an even more advanced branch of the Monocotlydons. This book exposes some shocking facts. Some species routinely metabolize lipids to generate temperatures over 100 F around their inflorescence while surrounding temps are near freezing. Other species manufacture aromatic compounds rarely encountered outside of the ANIMAL kingdom. There are aroids we can eat, and others that smell so horrible they inspire nightmares. Some species' reproductive contrivances are almost too imaginative for the plant kingdom.Deni Bown has provided an invaluable service: she's compiled nearly everything Aroid known to science into one, comprehensive yet accessible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful bood, but","review":"This is a wonderful book if you want to read about Aroids, and explore this fascinating group of plants. However there are minimal illustrations or pictures, and I often found myself longing for more of the many pictures that Deni Bown must have taken, in her travels. I am unlikely to see many or most of the plants she talks about in my lifetime, unless I plan some jungle exploration holidays, and would have loved to have more pictures to help me imagine what they looked like.

The tale of Rose Walker, the dream vortex who must be killed to save The Dreaming, is a complex one. The Doll House introduces the reader to many of the characters who would have a major effect on Gaiman's plans for the series. Particularly excellent is the tale of Hob Gadling, who becomes Dream's friend when he becomes the man \\"Death will not touch.\\" Their meetings each century are little history lessons so well executed they make you wish for more. The \\"Cereal\\" convention, with special guest lecturer the Corinthian, is a scary look at the fascination with serial killers and the final twist involving Desire gives the reader some insight into the relationship of Dream with his siblings. This book really shows what a truly original creation The Sandman is."},{"rating":"2","title":"the natural progression","review":"Vol 2 is still early in the series and Gaiman is still feeling out the character and what all is possible in this series. It's really good, but I don't think it's quite at its zenith yet, to deserve the reputation it has, but I'm looking forward to the next volume to see how Gaiman and the Sandman grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"If you're new to Gaiman, you might not be used to his style but this volume is a great accompaniment to Vol I - Preludes & Nocturnes. It follows Rose, who was first introduced in Vol I through uncovering secrets to the whereabouts of her missing brother & meeting long, lost relatives. A truly great graphic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding His Place","review":"Following a decent beginning Neil Gaiman truly shines in this second volume of his acclaimed series, The Sandman. Taking the second incarnation of the Sandman (who he completely reformed for the series), Gaiman spins a story seamlessly around his first volume and introduces elements that will affect the title the remainder of it's 75 issues. Even bringing in William Shakespeare in one issue, Gaiman uses elements of fact and fairy tale along with some of our worst fears to write an extraordinary story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something unique","review":"Sandman even after being written 10+ years ago is still as clever and dark as it was then. Showcasing Neil Gaiman's fantastic writing and complex plot threads, scary and wonderous at the same time Vol. 2 is the first time we actually start to see what Gaiman is truly capable of. I highly recommend to anyone who loves horror and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cultural mix of dream creatures and humans, GREAT STORY","review":"Gaiman has written a wonderful set here. Except for the prolouge and the part with Hob Gadling, the story is knitted together incredibly. It leaves you with questions about the Endless and how they actually view mortallity"},{"rating":"2","title":"A confusing, but enjoyable read","review":"Well I liked this book, loved it even, but I have to wonder just how Neil Gaiman gets away with straying from the path of his main plot so often. The Doll's House is literally a seven-part story called The Doll's House, but this is totally misleading. It is, in fact, a four, maybe five part story called The Doll's House, the rest being stories that must have just appealed to Neil at the time of writing. And, honestly, the stories that stray from the path are the best in the book. This is much better than the first Sandman book, but [contrary to what another reviewer said] is not as dark. This lacks a truly incredible chapter, such as the chapter in Preludes and Nocturnes when Morpheus travels to hell, but the whole book is excellent all in all. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I liked 'Preludes & Nocturnes' a lot (minus the superheros) but this was really bland. The overall story is a great idea but all the subplots that make up the story just seem like filler or a reason to be shocking. I missed all the demons and magic of 'Preludes...'. I really hope this series gets better, I had really high hopes for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately the best one of the Sandman comics","review":"The characterization and storytelling is amazing.

Some were barely audible and I had to fiddle with bass and treble to get a decent sound. Thats the fault not of the original recording but of the engineer of this album who did not think that the listener would be annoyed at having to do hands on adjustments throughout the album. I agree these are not all original recordings. Most of these selections are played by mediocre-at-best musicians and was positively annoying to listen to. The only thing stopping me from tossing this disc of junk recordings out of the window was that I don't like to litter. Please spend your money on something else.

This movie is wonderful and Voight gives a great performance. As someone said before me, if you ware thinking of giving up on your teaching job, watch this movie. Although it doesn't relate to affairs today, it is a good movie and I really enjoyed it. It is a positive influence with all the negative happening in the world today.

There are no pictures of plants, trees, shrubs, etc. and only a few rudimentary pen and ink drawings.

Whelen has created a snapshot of traditional Irish life in his danceable jigs, full of life and joy. The one slow track, \\"Father\\" is dedicated to the artist's good friend, Father Frank Hoffman, and is eerie and lovely, creating a sense of mystery. One wonders if this is an exploration of personal faith or a tribute to an individual - or perhaps both? The talent of all the musicians playing in each song is quite evident.This album deserves a better name, as it sounds like it would be a New Agey album, and it's really not - this is a mix of new and traditional Irish music.

I did the same.I agree with the comments posted on Amazon.com regarding the quality of packaging of this item and I am sure the sellers could have done a much better job there.The quality of the movies are great, even the oldest ones and that is all that matters to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond ultimate collector's set","review":"I am a 007 fan.

Don't care about packaging appearance just wanted to have the set for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Bargain","review":"This boxed set is absolutely a must for any James Bond fan! The digital transfer is beautiful and the extras are great. I don't like the slim cases MGM put the dvd's in but that is my only complaint. For the price you can't go wrong! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is It!","review":"This is it!I enjoyed every bit of it!Best picture and sound quality!Nice package, attached brochures and comments!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Set with a Great Price","review":"The set itself is excellent in the fact that it has all of the James Bond movies, with the exception of the most recent release Quantum of Solace, but the organization of each set is ridiculous; the movies should have been put in order from beginning to end, or at least in order of who played James Bond. Instead, the movies are placed in what seems a random order which makes it a pain to watch if you wanted to see them in order. I mean I had to go online and look up the order in order to watch it from beginning to end. That was the only problem I had, the features and bonuses of each movie are great as well as the time it took to receive my order from Amazon. If it wasn't for the order I would have given the set a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond rules","review":"This item was bought as a Christmas gift.I did notice the packaging is a bit cheesy and flimsy.

The problem was that one of the movies was duplicated. This is not the first time this has happend to me. It was a real dissapointment to find this discrepancy. The company putting these sets together needs to come up with a better packaging system. It's really upsetting to see this happen so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Knives","review":"My grandmother owned these knives and I inherited one. I love the one she had for years.

I place EVERYTHING in the diswasher and didn't want to spend a large amount of money on a cutlery set. I used these over the holidays and I'm very pleased with the quality. I will continue to purchase other pieces of Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition as I replace my old set."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a steal","review":"I bought this set when the price was at $15. But even at current price, these knives are a steal. All of them are very sharp, and very useful. The chef knife is kind of light in weight, but still versatile. They are not forged but are high quality stamped knives. I could hardly believe I could buy such high quality knives at this price. To get started with cooking, all you need is this set to get started, without spending huge money on a larger set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best at any price. No need to pay more...","review":"Professional cooks may pitch expensive ice-hardened blades on TV but what their kitchens really use is cheaper high-carbon blades like these, because they respond to the steel while holding an edge relatively well.Restaurants need NSF certified with plastic handles that can go through the dishwasher(Dexter-Russell Sani-Safe, Forschner). Home cooks don't have to meet NSF so wood handles are okay. These Chicago Cutlery knives have beautiful walnut handles and brass rivets that last forever and just look better with age (and a little oil from time to time).The Walnut Tradition 6\\" chef, 7\\" boning knife and 8\\" filleting knife have been in our kitchen for 25 years in more or less continuous service. A few strokes of the steel or a few pulls through a cheap Radu steel sharpener is all you need to keep them super sharp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for!","review":"Bought this set so that I could use it on Thanksgiving but realized after cutting up my turkey for left overs that the larger knife ended up having ridges on the blade from bending. Not sure why since I was not chopping up the bones of the turkey only the meat. Now I have this knife which I only used once and I am unable to use it again! :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"One of life's few bargains","review":"When the ex-wife absconded with my Henckels I wasn't in a hurry to run out and replace them. I decided to give these a try and am absolutely delighted. These are high quality carbon steel knives at a small fraction of the price of their German counterparts. Will a Henckels hold an edge slightly longer? Sure. Are the Henckels more difficult to sharpen? Yes. These knives are a bargain and are of more than adequate quality for the most demanding chef. They sharpen and hone easily as well. Buy a good steel and you'll be pleased too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knives for the money","review":"I got these knives for $10 from an outlet, they are amazing for the price. I have compared them to my roommates double-man Henckels and I have found that these knives:- are easier to hone/sharpen, but don't hold an edge as long (I hone them before every use and it's fine)- are lighter in weight- are not as sturdy (the paring knife got a little bent)- have a slightly higher tendency to rust if left in water (which you shouldn't do with either brand)They are MUCH better than my friends single-man henkles. I have had them for 2 years now and have certainly gotten my $10 worth out of them. They probably won't last as long as the henckels, but I end up grabbing for these knives 85% of the time because I can get them much sharper."},{"rating":"2","title":"purchased for my grandson","review":"My grandson loves this DVD. It has real animals and happy songs that he can understand.

As if these teenagers hadn't had enough to deal with, they find themselves in a bind only to find creative ways of getting out of them. They include blackmailing the school chaplain and one biology teacher with photographs, backstabbing Porky, and countless other tactics to take back what is righfully theirs(their dignity), and let's not forget about Kong and Tommy Turner butting heads for the last time at the Motel room. This is a must see for those who have already seen the first two Porkys movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come celebrate the Year of the Pig","review":"Most of the gang from Angel Beach High is back, and they're preparing for graduation. Trouble abounds when their basketball coach gets in hock with Porky over gambling debts, and is ordered to throw the state championship game-or else. In between tangling with their old nemesis, the boys \\"help\\" Meat pass his biology exam by blackmailing the teacher, Pee-Wee becomes enamored of Inga, the attractive exchange student from Sweden, and they're still locking horns with the diabolical Ms. Balbricker. Lots of fun for fans of the series. I've heard rumors about a fourth movie but nothing definite yet. Veteran TV director James Komack took over direction from Bob Clark and does a good job, adding a different kind of look for this sequel.

Well, I was only right about one thing: It's cute. It turned out to be an easy and predictable game with no twists and turns whatsoever. If you did like Ape Escape, then you'd probably enjoy the storyline of this one. But it has poor controls, and it is the most predictable game I have ever played.

However, when I rented Ape Escape 2 and played it, I was dissapointed!! Although the graphics are better, and the levels are er, slightly bigger?, the game is WAY too easy. It's not very fun to play. The monkeys just kinda run around in circles until you catch them... and they're VERY easy to find. The levels LOOK nice, but they're nothing better than the original ones. Also, the main character us annoying. His voice HAS to be the voice of Ash from Pokemon...it's horrible. The gadgets remain the same, but I swear the whirly-thingy dosn't go as high...I guess this game would be better for younger kids (10-13) and not older ones(14 and older).

I also would like to see a sequel to this movie showing what became of the people involved with this war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprise Excellent Movie.","review":"I never heard of this movie but it was excellent. Have an interest in WWII history and found this to be an excellent take on the early start of the war in the Pacific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Have no idea why so many \\"critics\\" panned this film. This is an acadamy award level film. The actors and actresses owned their roles. Cinematography was excellent. Accurately captured the horrors of the Japanese occupation forces and their beastly behavior to the populations which they occupied. Kudos to Zhang Yimou and the cast for an excellent production and performance.For those interested in a deeper understanding of Japanese behavior during their \\"colonization\\" of other nations and during WWII may I suggest reading \\"the Rape of Nanking\\" by Iris Chang, \\"Comfort Women\\" by Nora Okja Keller, or \\"Bataan Death March: A survivor's account\\" by Lt. Col. William E. Dyess"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!!!","review":"I have never written a review before in my life, but here I am. I understand that there is some controversy over the portrayal of the evil Japanese soldiers in this film, but none of this detracts from the fact that this is a cinematic masterpiece. I was moved (almost) beyond words by the deep emotional response I experienced as I watched this film. If you want to be entertained with mindless action then this is not for you. If you want plenty intense of action, startling character depth, and absolutely heart wrenching drama then you must watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Zhang Yimou film","review":"Zhang Yimou knows how to paint a beautiful picture even against a backdrop of gray death and despair. I thought this story was told with amazing skill from the point of view of the Chinese people on the occupation of Nanking. Considering that not all the Japanese were portrayed as rapists and murderers, Zhang displays a deft hand at attempting to make all his characters as three-dimensional as possible with what little screen time the Japanese soldiers have. What the Japanese did to the people of Nanking was beyond imagining. Unfortunately for even the few that were cultured and not rapists and murderers of women and children, going against their orders was not an option for a Japanese man. Wonderful performances coupled with gorgeous cinematography (the lush green and gold color of a cheongsam against the gray dust and concrete of a ruined city) make this film a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Bloomers","review":"A not-so-common story of tears, trials, transformation and triumph amidst the horror of war.

Yes, I know war is violent. However, this film goes over the top with graphic scenes of brutality. This coupled with the poor performances of most of the actors in the film, including Christian Bale's, add up to a miserable experience. This appeared to me to a Chinese film which utterly demonized the Japanese to an almost cartoonish degree. Yes, I know the facts of the occupation of Nanking, but this was a shallow and brutal depiction of the situation there. It should be rated X for violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"subtitles-was not aware of this- Did not watch.

However, I found it to be too graphic with the sexual things that took place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic horrors of war, but touching humanity at core","review":"With many disgusting scenes of the depravity of men/nations at war, this film nonetheless delivers a powerful message about the power of men and women to rise far above their former selves to display courage and compassion beyond what they themselves would have thought possible.This is a moving film with powerful images that on one hand horrify and on the other uplift. Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the outstanding actors of his generation. In this role, he brilliantly creates two very different human beings residing in one body . . . his magic is to be convincing as both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"This movie didn't come across as believable.

The story is incredible, uplifting and gruesome. The movie is well made and totally engaging. I would recommend this movie with the reservation that you must be willing to see the horrendous way people are willing to treat others."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and disturbing!","review":"Very disturbing with obvious China bias. It seems this was made to sell well to the China market. Also the sexual assault scenes are very graphic and disturbing and seem to be that way for the sole purpose of painting the Japanese in a certain light. Too much political agenda going on to make a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Pearl Buck get credit for this film?","review":"Yes, I saw the film. Then, I recently read \\"Dragon Seed, China at War\\" written by Pearl Buck about 1942. In one chapter, Buck describes Chinese girls - students and prostitutes - hiding in a missionary controlled school. When Japanese soldiers demand girls, the prostitutes offer themselves to save the young student girls.

I would love to own this on DVD!! Brings back memories of late summer nights and middle school sleepovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fingering weight yarn dreams but.....there be steeks!","review":"I am very fond of this book. There is a sophistication of color in the designs that I find appealing. I prefer fingering weight yarn and if you do as well, you'll love the designs in this book. I'm not a fan of zippers in sweaters but the patterns which include zippers could easily be turned into a v-neck, etc.I was surprised at how many of the patterns used steeks. Steeks require you to cut your knitting in a variety of ways (for sleeves, cardigan fronts, necklines). All of these can be reconfigured if you dislike steeks. Be aware of the need to noodle with the patterns if you choose not to steek.The sleeveless giraffe pullover is to die for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was hoping for more true tribal/regional patterns but this book is more about the author's interpretation of what \\"seems\\" african-like.The patterns are all shapeless and look more like standard fair-isle/intarsia patterns to be found elsewhere.Do not buy if you are looking for true African-inspired patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice designs","review":"I'd been looking at this book in the local yarn store for a bit. I really liked the designs. I started one of the sweaters and realized it's a little over my present skill set, so I abandoned the project. However, I'm still glad I own the book -- gives me a reason to improve my knitting! There are some very intricate designs. Overall, I think the book is well written, good photography. Some of the charts could be a little better presented. They're in color, and for me, a little harder to read. I copied the one I was using into black and white, and it was easier to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zanzibar is the greatest story","review":"The story \\"Zanzibar\\" is unforgettable.

The rule of thumb is you get what you pay for and 99% of the time that is true. Certainly, in this case, it is very true. This set of spreaders is inexpensive and the price reflects the quality. The bottom part of the handle of one of them was gapping open because the rivet didn't go all the way through and in general they were cheaply and poorly made.

Dr. Shaeffer's thesis is that art, whether that which we think of as traditionally \\"Christian\\" or \\"secular\\" is okay with God as long as it meets certain conditions which the author finds by plucking a few verses from descriptions of the Temple, from the Psalms and from the Song of Songs.Far better in writing about this subject (if indeed it needs justification) is Madeline L'Engle in her beautiful \\"Walking on Water\\". This one, I'm afraid, left me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pump it up!!","review":"This album is perfect for anyway who likes to walk. As a born in the fifties gal, I enjoy all the songs.

ACtually, if you think about it, there were more profound changes on the daily lives of people earlier in the century, when the automobile, electricity and other conveniences first came into prominence. THis book offers no new insights, no entertainment value( surprising from a radio host) and nothing of any significant value to a serious reader of history or culture. While I can appreciate the need to dumb down history for some, this book makes it an exercise for morons. Even the author's political agenda is ludicrous by any liberal or conservative standards I am aware of. What a collossal waste of time. I'm glad I read it so quickly.

Scientists and statisticians have proven that statement to be false. But if you blindfolded a drunk monkey and gave him a broken typewriter, he would come up with something better than this in a few hours. I heard a lot of good reviews about this book 10 years ago when I listened to A.B. on the radio. After reading a few pages I felt like I was listening to bar room philosophy. He seems to misperceive getting slower as we age with things in society moving faster. I also perceived a hidden message of support for a New World Order government. Listening to his radio show confirms to me that he has a communist/NWO agenda. Save your money and find it at the library or used book store.

Of course, Bell's show fails to entertain several people.I am a physics major and I like reading nonfiction (biographies, technical manuals, titles such as Operation Desert Storm: From Khoramshaar to Kuwait, etc.). Instead of spending hard-earned money for The Quickening, take a look at Carl Sagan's A Candle In The Dark. Unfortunately, Dr. Sagan died in 1997.

As a sane, open-minded adult and an avid listener, I am able to make a clear judgement onto what is blatently ridiculous and what deserves to be looked at further and discussed. Art Bell is a very talented talk radio host and a highly intellectual human being. The book touches on aspects of twenty-first and near twenty-second century society that are merely crumbling before our very eyes. Any human being in touch with reality can not argue the fact that today's world is in utter chaos and is not headed into a positive direction.

But the book does manage to reflect some paranoid, superstitious position of the most murky kind.The greatest disappointment of this book was the tone of it, as if impending danger lurks around every corner and we as a species are doomed.

Bell has a surprisingly conservative perspective, berating everything from environmentalists to the New Age Movement, and he does so on the basis of distortions and generalizations. He dwells on the negative aspects in \\"today's trends\\" but offers no solutions. Thus his concluding remarks are lame: \\"Right now, the world is only getting progressively more chaotic and dangerous. At the very least, let us all hope and try to change what we can. We are at a crossroads in human history, and it is clear that unless we take some drastic measures to improve our plight, the road less traveled will not necessarily be the brightest one.

I find it very annoying to have to reset the watch so frequently. It also goes into power save mode at random times and displays an incorrect time (power save mode freezes the clock hands and shuts off the digital display when it thinks you won't be using the watch).

I usually end up taping the liner to the box to prevent it from moving around so much, but my cat does end up putting holes in them. It works in that it does keep most of the litter in the liner and makes it easier to clean up the litter box without worrying about scrubbing.

The graphics, while being cell shaded, look very nice running off of the Unreal engine. Some of the levels are extremly fun and the whole feel of the game brings me back to Goldeneye, which I don't know a person who didn't love that game. The story is decent, although it does have some twists and turns, but it's cool to search for your identity throughout the game.

There's quite a bit of pointless wailing and foreshadowing which only serves to confuse the reader, but what I really couldn't stomach was the unbelievably andro- and Christian-centric tone of the books. The only woman with any spine at all is the villian of the piece. How shocking. And the self righteous piety of Merlin and his merry band can only be stomached for so long.

The ending is powerful because of how Samuel L. Jacksons character gets a hardcore latino gangster to break down and admit a sincere reason why he lives the type of life he does, also because of what Samuel L. Jackson is willing to do to himself for the life this gangster has had to lead and to prove a point in how unnessary it was to live that type of life.

I recommend this movie to those with an open mind, and a strong stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Great movie though I thought the teachers reaction was a little over the top.Also the boom mike guy could have done better job.Watch out for the brightly coloured mike every now and then.But overall portrays LA as a searing heat bomb,both in the acting dept and the brilliant use of drab coloured footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping film","review":"The theme of violence in our schools takes on a different ending than most other films in this genre. In most cases a teacher who is attacked by students and humilitated would probably leave the profession. Sammy's character does something else. Sadly, he was a teacher whose desire to stay led to a sad ending. This films takes a look at violence and gang activity in a California school. The films shows the main character leaving NY for a CA school after violent incident there (in NY). He left making a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"187","review":"i writing to tell you i did nt get this movie 187 it should had been here by march 30th and it not here so where is my movie 187 i check my visa and i been charge for that and have not got it so pls email me at ace48420@yahoo.com thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal lesson life !","review":"This is a very dark film .

It is long on sight gags, great music, and (for the 1050's) interesting cinematic techniques. The story is cool and amusing.The best endorsement I can give this movie isn't my own; it was the Beatles' favorite movie. In the \\"Beatles Anthology\\" Paul McCartney talks about how important this film was in the Beatles' formative years, and as a further point of interest, according to David Quantick in his magnificent study of The White Album, \\"Revolution: The Making of The Beatles' White Album,\\" the band took a night off of setting the playing order of their greatest record to watch this film when it aired on TV in 1968.What more endorsement do you need?

Why the exorbitant price?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Monroe Comparison","review":"I saw this film while I was in high school and I have never forgotten it. Jayne Mansfield was beautiful and it's a shame she couldn't get past being a typical Monroe copy cat because she wasn't. She was smart, funny, and made any woman want to be like her at that time. Her presence was dynamic and Tom Ewell was hilarious as her counter-part in the film. It is by far the best film she made and what a joy to watch so many young talented rock'n'roll singers like Little Richard that exploded onto the screen with his awesome voice. If you like the 50's music and you like Jayne Mansfield then this is the film you should start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my favorites?","review":"These so-called greatest hits often leave out their best known songs from their TV program.

A travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daydreamer and cherish","review":"It's an excellent compilation!! but it could be superb if it would include some songs from: \\"Dreams are nuthin' more than wishes\\" album, wich in my opinion it's Cassidy's best performance. By the way, does any body knows if this album exists in CD? I'll appreciate any information about it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in this recording. I was expecting \\"The Best of\\" the Partridge Family. Instead, only eight of the 20 songs are by the Partridge Family. Because this is listed with the Partridge Family recordings, I expected it to contain mostly Partridge Family recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! A must have!","review":"This CD is great! Not only does it contain Partridge Family hits but it includes a few of David Cassidy's solo hits. Although the CD is overall great, they were missing a few songs. Where was \\"I Can Feel You Heartbeat\\"? And what about songs from Bullitin Board? There weren't any. This CD is really good, don't get me wrong, but I think that it missed some of the Partridge Family's greatest songs. Not the best it could be, but really good anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"Though there are many, many album cuts and songs from the television show that I would have included in a \\"definitive collection\\" -- LET THE GOOD TIMES IN (first episode); the theme songs, both versions; more songs by Tony Romeo -- it is hard not to appreciate this collection of Wes Farrell's manufactured pop, which absolutely holds up. Those tight arrangements remain marvels of commercial music, and the melodies are infectiously optimistic and fun. The liner notes are also fun, though there are mistakes -- POINT ME came from the first album, not NOTEBOOK. And if you think the theme song is on the CD, as listed above, you would be wrong -- it is not there. And what about the inclusion of one or two of those spiffy Christmas recordings from CHRISTMAS CARD? Definitive, no, but fun, yes yes definitely yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing-a-long fun","review":"Sure their songs were just retreads of the popular songs of the time, but the Partridge Family had a way of making them work. The TV show made a teen idol out of David Cassidy, who was a bit too busy preening himself. However, he could deliver a good tune when the time came to do so. \\"I Think I Love You\\" was perhaps their strongest song, but I also liked \\"I'll Meet You Halfway,\\" and of course there was their theme song, \\"Come on Get Happy,\\" which has to be one of the best television theme songs of all time. They don't measure up to the Monkees, but the Partridge Family is great sing-a-long fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not definitive at ALL!","review":"This CD is far inferior to the previously released \\"Greatest Hits\\". The liner notes have eroors (and aren't very informative to the crazed fans), one song was butchered by poor, unnecessary editing and worst of all, their best tracks from \\"Bulletin Board\\" and \\"Crossword Puzzle\\" were left off! NO album can be definitive without at least one or two tracks from each of those albums....but then again, Arista has always been horrible with reissues. Look at what they did with the Monkees catalog on CD before Rhino got around to it....NO COMPARISON!Back to PF...the \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD has a better selection of songs (including the theme song and one song from \\"Bulletin Board\\") and better liner notes to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Definitive, Nor Partridge Family","review":"If you want a definitive Partridge Family CD, do not buy this one. You will not find many of your favorite songs and someone decided to threw in solo work from David Cassidy as filler. The CD is not bad, just badly titled. If you aren't mislead by the title, you might enjoy the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't be serious","review":"The Partridge Family was nothing more than a pseudo band contrived to cash in on David Cassidy who himself was merely the flavor of the month back in the early 70's. Just another in a long line of pretty boy teen idols who had their 15 minutes and then were discarded by an industry who moved on to the next big thing. I've no doubt that there are many who have fond memories of these songs from their childhood, but to award this stuff five stars here in the year 2000 is just plain silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best left in the 70's","review":"Insipid songs, lame production, cheesy arrangements, laughable singing. It all adds up to excruciatingly bad music from one of popular music's silliest eras. It is quite telling that David Cassidy HATED singing this stuff, and it is amazing that anyone who has managed to successfully complete childhood would have any interest in hearing this sap again."},{"rating":"1","title":"E-gadds!","review":"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear it is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc","review":"As a fan of 70's pop I am extremely happy with the content and crystal-clean remastering this disc.... I also like that this cd combines \\"most\\" of the best of the Partridge Family with David Cassidy solo output.I don't understand why discs producers didn't include \\"Come On, Get Happy\\", \\"I Can Feel Your heartbeat, and \\"Echo Valley 26809\\", so in a sense the collection is not really \\"definitive\\". Still, it's the best overall PT, DC compilation, (and superior to the latest uk collection). This one's out of print, so get it while they're still available! Great songs, musicians, and production abound here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difinitive Hits!","review":"This 20 song compilation includes all of the biggest hits of The Partridge Family and David Cassidy from 1970-1974. There is an expanded version of this CD that contains 4 bonus tracks from 1973-1975. Even though there is a war between Cassidy and Partridge fans, some of us appreciate the efforts on great collections like these.It includes the worldwide #1 hits I Think I Love You, Cherish, How Can I Be Sure and Daydreamer. It also includes their top 10 AC hits Doesn't Somebody Want to be Wanted, I'll Meet You Halfway, It's One Of Those Nights, Walking In The Rain and If I Didn't Care. Most of the rest were top 40 hits.What's missing is Come On Get Happy, but that is no disappointment. It is on many other CD's.So jump on the bus and get up to date with this awesome collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Partridge Family/David Cassidy Collection to Get!","review":"The best collection of ORIGINAL versions of Cassidy solo hits, plus the Partridge hits we all know and love. The liner notes are absolutely superb...and the sound of the CD? Top-notch! These tunes are first-rate and the production is meticulous and brilliant. No stone was left unturned in making this music.The chart success for the Partridge Family and the Cassidy hits was no accident. David Cassidy and Shirley Jones are talented vocalists and everyone involved made these tracks great! This outstanding CD is a masterpiece presentation of the classic Partridge Family singles and favorite album tracks, plus TV favorites. You'll also love ORIGINAL versions of solo worldwide hits by David Cassidy...this collection is truly deluxe.Die-hard fans will no-doubt go after ALL of the Partridge albums, but if you really want the best of the best, on one CD, buy this one. This truly is, like the title says, \\"The Definitive Collection\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme disappointment","review":"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book, and gaining further insight into questions of morality in the moral crucble of concentration camps. But Todorov's thinking is fuzzy in the extreme, moving from cliche to nonsense. There are many extremely good books that cover the same material. The Nazi Doctors, by Robert Jay Lifton is infinitely better, as are The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness by Erich Fromm, Treblinka by Jean-Francois Steiner, and Modernity and the Holocaust by Zygmunt Bauman. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is that the original quotes by concentration camp survivors that he sprinkles liberally throughout the text are extremely interesting. The quotes themselves give insight. Too bad the analysis doesn't match the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect educational tool!","review":"This documentary is one of the best I have ever seen regarding the stark realities of the Holocaust. It demands attention without both oversimplifying and overdoing the topic. Night and Fog is a wonderful educational tool for classrooms everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Hollywood version","review":"This documentary was made in the 1950s and is both simple and confronting. It is not political or apologetic nor is it for the faint hearted as it deals with the reality of the deportations, the camps and the genocide. It is a must see for anyone interested in historical reality rather than the Hollywood retellings of this awful time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Unfathomable","review":"I can not post the first words that popped into my head, right after this movie was over; because it might offend some people. But wow! I have seen a good few of these movies on the subject of the concentration camps and wow, if you have never actually experienced it; this documentary really can bring you into the horrors that these people went through. I am dumbfounded on how any human being can treat another with such humility and am purely disgusted at the mere fact that this actually happened. Although a very heart wrenching subject to even talk about, this is a must see documentary. Because more than the disgust of this actually happening is to deny that this actually happened.... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"My history teacher said he was going to show us a movie about the Holocaust, and I was just expecting general info, since it's a 9th grade class, but I was wrong. This movie has terrifying images and video clips. This was scarier than any horror movie I had ever seen because its REAL. Most of us don't know and will never know what the Holocaust was truly like, but it's important to have an idea. You won't even have a clear idea about how horrible the Holocaust is if you dont see this movie.The narrarator's main point was who should we blame this on? Can we place all of the blame on the German soilders and the SS? It also brought up the possibility of this happening again. If you want to see how terrible the Holocaust was, which you should because it's so important to be educated so you can prevent the past from repeating, see this movie. It's great but just a warning, the haunting images stay in your head forever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I did not like it at all and thought it was money wasted in buying it,and would not buy it again if it was free"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguiding Title","review":"Not one of these reviews mentions the fact that the actual 'Night and Fog' operation by the Nazis was a completely seperate atrocity from the murder of the Jews; 'Nacht und Nebel' was an action implemented upon the Gentile populations of Europe for the sake of sheer terror; Thousands of civilians were kidnapped from their homes, murdered, and disposed of without a trace and without any publicity or notification just to keep the occupied populations in fear of the Germans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling but necessary DVD that everyone should watch","review":"I first saw this film in a religion/philosophy class when I was 17 and a senior in high school. I'm now 53 and it has and will remain in my memory forever. The crimes against humanity that the Nazis committed were vile, shocking and the work of sadists whose emotional lives had been warped beyond the belief of most people. I had been told that this film was actually the intentional work of Nazi soldiers and confiscated by the Allied soldiers who liberated the camps. The description above says differently, but truly, I do feel had to have been work tht the Nazis were resonsible for as who else could calmly film such horrendous atrocities?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important and Devastating","review":"I watched this film as part of a course on French identity. Before showing the film, my instructor (French and not Jewish) mentioned that it would be about the Haulocaust but did not explain how extraordinarily graphic the film is. It's been three weeks since I watched the film, and I still feel raw. The film is absolutely DEVASTATING. I strongly recommend seeing Nuit et Brouillard; however, I also strongly caution potential viewers that the film may have profound and lasting psychological effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruesome Images","review":"This was a great documentary. I will never forget the images that were shown in this documentary. The style the director used with the archive was great; I felt a huge amount of sadness for the lives lost while watching the present day archive. The technique and style of how he put everything together kept my eyes glued to the television the entire time. The reality of what happened at those camps was so gruesome that it made me want to cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"Even for someone like myself who has been exposed extensively to the images and facts of the Holocaust this is a chilling, moving and enlightening film. There is no attempt to put a polish on history or get the viewer to \\"chin up\\" and feel good that he will do his part to make sure \\"never again\\". It is an unvarnished, emotional emptying. I would be surprised to hear that anyone finishes this 30 minutes of film with much emotional energy left. It is simply mandatory to see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the greatest film ever made period.","review":"While many people still admire an overrated .... like 'Citizen Kane' , Night and Fog is far better than many other great films in terms of a message it sends and the impact it has on the audience, questioning the value of human-beings. If there is only one film you can see about violence against humanity, this is the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just VHS piped to DVD","review":"This is what Enhanced CD tried to do in SF's Multimedia gulch three years ago.

I'm running Windows XP which recognizes the cable automatically, but for those running Windows 95 with USB support or Windows 98 the drivers are provided on the accompanying disk so you don't even have to go to the web site to download them.

With the Samsung software already on the Dell, this cable was a breeze to install and it works great. (It might have worked just as well as a plug-and-play without installation of the Samsung disc, but I can't say for sure.)

Most older HP printers are not, so even with the cable an old HP printer won't work.

The author's glib and cute classifications of the misery caused by the breakdown of a marriage will be offensive and unhelpful to most thoughtful people. The author's primary goal is to show us his perception, which is woefully shallow and moralistic, rather that to guide the reader to greater understanding.

I had an affair with a man who was/is verbally and emotionally abused by his wife. Her abuse was \\"infidelity\\" and a \\"betrayal of trust\\" long before he \\"betrayed\\" her by seeking love, acceptance and intimacy with me. And does Pittman think that the \\"betrayer,\\" my lover, wasn't agonizing over his own failures and responsibilities?

Furthermore, I don't find the humor appropriate at a time of marital crisis. I cannot appreciate the fact that this book centers around an affair having to be sexual intercourse in order to truly be damaging.The text is confusing ato follow, I lose track of the names that have been appointed to the hurt partner, the unfaithful partner and the lover. I found myself skimming through most of the chapters as they were irrelevant.I bought this book in attempt to make sense of confusing emotions and to help me get my marriage and life back on track after my husband's affair was revealed. Which, I might add, included everything BUT intercourse, and lasted for a year while I was pregnant.This book might be remotely interesting to anyone that has never actually been devestated by an infidelity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book written by a very wise woman.","review":"I knew Darlene when we were both in our 20's.

We had problems getting the water to shut off completely. FINALLY, we had had enough when I turned the water on one day and the handle fell off in my hands. The mechanism was made of a light weight plastic. We went to plumbing supplier and they said they had numerous returns on the unit. We then purchased a Kohler faucet and are very happy with the unit.

I've tried to tighten it, and even had 2 plumbers look at it; neither were able to do more than hand-tighten it, due to an odd configuration of hot and cold water lines that suuround the washer bolt holding the faucet to the base from beneath, which prevents any conventional tool to access the bolt.Other than that, the unit works fine and is an attractive, ergonomic design."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are on our 2nd faucet and are having the same problems","review":"When we bought our house it came with this faucet unfortunatly it broke(about 1 year later, 4 years old) was running water very badly, had to turn off the water and we went shopping.

Try something different for a change - it might wake you up. Here is a marvelously modest tale about a teenager seeking his first job, bewildered and intimidated by the rituals of the workplace. Although the director's empathy with his cast is clear, this film's main strength stems from its rigorously simple story-telling, leaving the audience free to enjoy the fact that the main pleasure of a tale is in its telling. This film goes far beyond the pedantry of the social realism of its time and the 'story' is transparent and uneventful and may seem almost non-existent, yet this film is so good that it'll get you off your couch and make you want to direct films yourself (that's what it did to me).

If you prefer protagonists who combat evil and overcome hardships, avoid this book. The book is set in California during the Depression.

Cooper, to avoid a prison term, becomes a paymaster for an orange grower who employs and abuses migrant workers. A nanny employed by the orange grower believes that she has the power to control dead animals and dead people. Cooper, seemingly unable to control any circumstances, is driven by circumstances beyond his control into mental and emotional hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"White 4042 \\"Jeans\\" Heavy Duty machine is great!","review":"I wanted an all-purpose machine, one that is easy to use and built to last.

Upon closer examination of the cartridge I see it is composed of two main parts: the outer body of the cartridge and an inner stem. I tried an experiment and lubricated the rubber \\"O \\" rings of the inner stem with silicone grease and also the outer ' O ' rings and rubber inserts on the side of the cartridge. I reinstalled the old cartridge and it worked like a charm for several years when I had to repeat the procedure.

I wrote to them regarding the leak in less than a year and half but they never replied. On the internet some other brands make it so easy to see instructions on replacement procedures but with Moen you have to click all over to get somewhere. Also the instruction inside the cartridge is not the best. I used to change cartridges when the faucets were simple and you just pull out the cover on top, the clip, made a half turn and was done in a couple of minutes, good luck if you put back in some pieces in reverse (They look alike on both sides but it will leak if not put in correctly!).

Also not only is he not a defense lawyer, he's a former prosecutor, and the one time he tried to be a defense lawyer he failed miserably.

As always though Chauvelin underestimates the cunning and brilliance of Sir Percy and the League of the Pimpernel.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book - it was exciting and romantic; although to the veteran Pimpernel reader the ending may seem predictable, Orczy manages to keep you in suspense to the very end.

Prior to the first crusade Muslims burning of the Holy Sepulcher, the church that was built on the site of Christ's empty tomb ,Muslims shutting out Christians who seek pilgrimage to Jerusalem.It doesn't even acknowledge Saladin's siege of Jerusalem.It makes the viewer think that he took it without a shot being fired.Etc,Etc!The reenactments looked fake and the knight's uniforms and placement in battle were wrong.I was realy hoping the documentry was going to begreat but it fell extremely short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Misrepresentation of Muslim Christian Relations","review":"Why does this program attempt to make Christians look like the devil? This is not even worth a full and well thought out review. I just want to state simply that this documentary is one-sided, mis-leading, and biased. I think it is attempting to be politically correct at the expense of being historically innacurate (or at least mis-leading).It is obvious to any historian of the crusades that there were atrocities and wrong-doings on both sides, but this presentation simply points out and emphasizes Christian wrongdoing. There were many instances where Muslims intruded into Christian lands before the first crusades...they took over the Iberian peninsula, they pillaged and slaughtered and enslaved...they don't mention the wholesale massacre of over 1,000 Christian pilgrim prior to the first crusade.Why does this documentary leave so much out at the expense of Christianity? Don't buy this. There is better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Basic Introduction..( only a 3 hour Introduction)..however a Fairly Nice one","review":"Not going to get the whole story..but for those that are not really knowledgeable at all on the Crusades..this gives a general IDEA about The Crusades. Requires further study ..and i dont think there are many film documentaries on the subject...so probably would require reading.A really nice thing about this documentary (Which most will enjoy) is it gives viewers actual film footage of how people would have dressed and weapons carried as well as the views of the actual areas of the world in which it happened and the specific places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muslim PC Crap","review":"Although most of the facts were correct (legalistically), the spirit of the documentary was framed in PC terms, and hijacked by a pompous, final \\"authority\\" on the crusades, a muslim scholar from the UK.In particular, the muslim scholar (I forgot his name) was a narrow-minded, intolerant, and prejudiced individual. I especially detested the callous disregard of the meaningful contributions that the Catholic Church made to protect innocent Christians from persecution. Many of these persecuted Christians had roots that went back hundreds of years in areas that were \\"Islamitized.\\" Moreover, the Catholic Church, protected Christian pilgrims: an honest, God-fearing people.P.S.: In case you're wondering I'm not Catholic. This documentary just pissed me off with it's historical revisionism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can there be a 0 star rating?","review":"I bought this book because it includes a source disk and I did'nt want to reinvent the wheel in BASIC.

A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors in code listings and no comments to help correct them","review":"Too many code errors and very little help on how to correct them. The theory behind the code is extremely sketchy. Hence, the main reason to buy this book would be the included diskette containing the mathematical algorithms, but those too are erroneous.

Otherwise pretty nice solutions. Recommendable for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating, clear & constructive on language and reality","review":"As a non-philosopher but interested in philosophy and history i found this book very interesting, refreshingly clear and well-written. His ideas of language as not representative of anything but itself, and the unfruitfulness of considering truth as the approximation of language with 'reality' i found very helpful and pragmatic, cutting across centuries of philosophical debate that did not seem to get any grip on the world. I have no idea how new all of this is but it does fit in with modern thinking in philosophy of science. Although i could not always quite follow the line of argument in his more technical pieces (which are more for his fellow-philosophers, i suppose), what he writes is certainly also meant for a broader public. Thought-provoking and sometimes, at first sight, outrageous, but consistently engaging and challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better -Spanish teachers expect boredom and sleeping.","review":"If your students are anything like mine they will be bored through at least 80% of this documentary. It could have been a lot better. Although, it does have a lot of good information, the way it is presented is lacking.Many people are talking about what this celebration means to them but it is just talk and by far not enough examples. Examples that could be presented better only get a few seconds in the spot light then it switches to someone talking infront of a wall or simple back ground. They should have had the people talking present their altar, art work, dance and more of the meaning behind it. Teachers look for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Scarce--Students were not engaged","review":"I bought this DVD to show to my Spanish classes during our fiesta del Dia de los Muertos. However, the video was not as informative as I would have liked. There are a lot of traditions that could have been shown and explained in more detail to make this video better instead of focusing on individual testimonials. Also, they could have taken this video into the heart of Mexico to gather more footage instead of Southern California, but instead they created a film that in some way lacks true authenticity and depth. In addition, there were times when I thought they put way too much emphasis on the performance of a certain band. Watching them on stage seemed to be a major filler for dead time in this video in lieu of thoroughly exploring the history, traditions, and celebration of this Spanish holiday. I would NOT recommend this video if you want a well-rounded explanation for students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell short of my epectations....","review":"This film seems like more of a home video rather than a comprehensive documentary on the day of the dead. I purchased this hoping I would be able to use it in my classroom to give my students a sense of Mexico's day of the dead traditions and I was quite disappointed. I never used it in my classroom. It does not talk at all about the indigenous roots of the tradition and was more of a series of very informal interviews. Save your money and get something else, anything else would be better than this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring film","review":"This film was so boring we could not finish it.

Poorly organized and terribly written, this text may be fine for someone who has already had linear algebra and wants a compact review of the material, but it is an absolutely terrible source to learn from. The author does an incredibly poor job of explaining the concepts and mathematics behind linear algebra, forcing the student to learn the material completely on his own using other sources. My professor remarked one day that this is the best book on the market. If so, the market is in a very sad state right now. Do yourself a favor and get another book, and if you're a professor, for the love of your students and mathematics, DO NOT USE THIS BOOK IN THE CLASSROOM."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BUCK [is bad]!!!!!!!!","review":"I gave this book one star only becasue there was no 0 star rating, this is the worst math book I have ever used.

Unless you have an exceptional professor be weary of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"This book is horrible. Not only does it do an awful job of teaching you linear algebra, but the book itself falls apart pretty easily. Now I'm stuck with this (way to expensive) book and I won't be able to sell it since people tend to like the pages to be in the book when they buy it. For the record, I do like linear algebra, but that interest was developed by my professor but not by this book in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreed! worse math book EVER written","review":"this is by far the worse math book I have ever read in my life! not only is it hard to learn from the book due to the errors and bad workings, but the examples done in the book do NOT help at all with the problems, and solutions given in the book are so few. STAY AWAY from this book, the author does not deserve your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a textbook, of no value","review":"You will love to attend lectures after getting this book.Because it teaches in a way of confusion, while I can see the author knows the material very well, I would assume this is not written for students.

Examples that doesn't relate to the practice problems at all.I have no other problem with my calculus book and I'm not a lazy student. I only use this book as a practice problem source.

The opening on \\"Anything you Want\\" is as innovative as some of Yo La Tengo's work. Sharp guitars and emotional strokes on the keyboard really make their music addicting.

Spoon is becoming a very mature band, and this album is testament to that. 2001 is looking to be a good year for music if you know where to look. And Spoon is leading the pack so far. New albums from David Garza, Wilco, and perhaps the Old 97s are poised to join \\"Girls Can Tell\\" as the year's best rock albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect album","review":"I really can't say enough good things about this album. Sure there is plenty of filler and a couple of throwaway tracks. Sure Spoon has made more consistent ablums before and after this one. Regardless, this is their masterpiece. The weak tracks fit perfectly with the strong ones (which are without peer) to make a cohesive, unified statement. This album is brilliant. Britt Daniel writes some of the best lyrics in music; they're not showy or pretentious but consice and memmorable. He may also possess one of the greatest rock-n-roll voices of modern times. Fittingly enough, that's what this music is--great, unforgettable rock-n-roll. This was the first Spoon album I owned. I bought it early in 2001.

Yes, I just criticised Stephen Sondheim. I literally could not finish the show. The story is weak, the script sounds like it was done by Andrew Lloyd Weber (from me, that's as low a blow as you can get) and the lyrics, usually Sondheim's showcase, are clumsy and ineffective.

I love Sondheim, and was so sad to see this boring and slow production. The show is moody and depressing and the music just is not as good as other sondheim songs.

People walked out of the theater during the curtain call, and I was sad to have wasted my time watching this show. It truly upsets me to speak of a sondheim show this way, but there are so many better ones of his to see, Into The Woods, Sweeney Todd and Sunday in the Park with George to just name a few.

His musicals were never Broadway Hits, the only popular tune he ever wrote was \\"Send in the Clowns\\" from Little Night Music but in spite of this he achieved to be the genius composer of Broadway Musical Theatre. Every one of his works is based on different theme, each of his themes is totally original, his lyrics are inteligent and very integral to the show they belong to.PASSION is no exception. It deals with a story of a soldier, at first passionately in love with a married woman, later finding a deep affection for a disfigured, unattractive daughter of his superior officer, who eventually dies and leaves him a long love letter.

This is truly a different type of musical that should be appreciated and expereinced by every musical fan. The production is top notch, the sound Incredible.

Mr. Stromberg has, through this photographic glimpse into the very soul of horses, put us all in a better place as we journey across the plains with each turned page.In viewing this beautiful book, I got a sense of the message that the horse communicates to us about the simple truths of life, and it sits on our coffee table for all to enjoy.Thank you Tony, what a gift to all of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Gift","review":"Tony Stromberg's images moved me. Everyone who sees this book is amazed by the beauty and depth of emotion found in Tony's photography. The work in this book captures the beauty, strength and spirit of the horse.

The textures and composition amaze... From the dust, to the lips, to the eyes, to the hair, these images can take the viewer deep. I am not a \\"horse person\\" per se, but the artistry and beauty in this book is so very rich that it surpasses that perspective. Along with the sheer beauty, there is humor and irony, strength and flow, and much more.

The seat on top of the elephant allows plenty of space to where the Diego figure can sit down and there is a second button on the drums that will make realistic drum beats when pressed. What I like about the set is that it comes with Diego and his jaguar, it is not a loud toy, and can take withstand some pretty good falls.

It becomes rapidly apparent as to why they were never published. My hope as I waded through this dreary offering was \\"may there be an ending!\\" May There Be A Road is an unfortunate effort to posthumously profit from the L'Amour name while offering nothing to the reader.

I am a died-in-the-wool L'Amour fan and have purchased just about every book he has written. But watching these poor early efforts being published with his name is agonizng.

But what are they up to with this poor album? There are a couple of good songs, but you're better off listening to Miles Davis' \\"In A Silent Way\\" than this. If you haven't heard this band before, listen to \\"Tortoise\\" or \\"Millions Now Living...\\" This album is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny Pastiche","review":"Tortoise's music used to be a lush and convoluted affair, and their rampant borrowing of motifs from aged soundtracks and lounge jazz were made all the more palatable by the way in which these were integrated with contemporary electronica and good ol' fashioned rock attitude. But \\"Standards\\" is beyond the pale - devoid of any real creative direction, it is a shameless jumble of hackneyed instrumental references. Way too clever and media-literate for it's own good, it offers too many references and no musical message of any real substance - the sound of post-modernism gone horribly wrong.The musical content of this album scores two stars, but it loses another due to the overprocessed and unsubtle production - \\"Standards\\" sounds hopelessly overcompressed and totally lacking in natural dynamics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhh! we got a new studio!","review":"Upset and confused thoughts of sledge hammers thundering down from the sky like a hail of vengence, then cooed with the hum of a soft wind as the storm moves on. I just can't except the fact that this wonderfully experimental band keeps moving forward. Tortoise never reached perfection: they began with it. Their self-titled record was Tortoise at their blissful peak as a band, then Millions... came along, still amazingly beautiful, yet leaning in a slightly new direction. After that...? This is a warning to those fans of the earlier Tortoise sound: you won't find any duel bass groves or McIntire's sweet drumming style here... just a bunch of electronicaly \\"enhanced\\" songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prog rock instrumental noodling","review":"The CD starts out reasonably well, with sort of a generic anthem-rock instrumental number that could have come from an old Joe Satriani album. But then it takes a serious turn into lightweight doodle-noodling that quickly becomes downright annoying. When I first bought the CD I was listening to in the car, and I actually turned the volume down in embarassment that someone in a neighboring vehicle would hear it. Overall, this sounds a lot like the 70s rock band Kansas, only without the fiddle or the vocals, with a dash of Manheim Steamroller (\\"Fresh Aire\\") and maybe some Jethro Tull. Bad bad bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not jazz. Not rock. Not anything.","review":"For those who may be thinking of buying their first Tortoise CD because they heard it was a combination of rock and jazz (like I did) be warned: this is not a combination of anything but a drum kit and synthisizer. Just one more in the avalanche of non-music electronic noodling. More sound effects than music. Starts nowhere, goes nowhere. Give a three-year-old an electronic piano and you'd get the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"TNT is a hard act to follow","review":"In terms of music, Standards is great. In terms of Tortoise, it is only pretty good. Most of the tracks are good, but the first couple of minutes of some songs is just build up for a cool ending. The bonus track Blackbird is a funky electronic-track, but Blue Station doesn't really go anywhere. I recommend this to any Tortoise fans, but if you're new to Tortoise, check out TNT or the self-titled album first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't stand out until you listen to it all the way through","review":"When I got this CD I did what I usually do with the CDs I get: I listened to one track for a little while, then went to another, and then another. None of them sounded very interesting to me, so I put the CD away and went on to another one I had just bought. A few weeks later I decided to give Standards another try. I started playing it from the beginning and listened for a while. I was amazed at how it sounded when I just let it go without changing anything. Some great rhythms come up in the middle of a lot of songs and some songs just need to be listened to completely to really enjoy. It is an album that sounds best as a whole and not as a collection of single songs. Standards is a great album to listen to when you're doing something else that doesn't require much thought. It makes it much more interesting and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"but of course, tortoise","review":"Well, the godfathers of post-rock return with a 10 song disk. The rock-jazz, eastern, instrumental, \\"I don't quite know what genre this is\\" sound has returned. This disk is less synthesized and symphonic when compared to TNT, their last release. This album is more rocking and \\"in your face\\"--kind of like their self-titled debut album. At first I liked it, but it sounded like all the bands that Tortoise had influenced, and it did not blow me away. The more I listen though, I realize that this is ahead of most of the imitators. It will please the jazz nerds, the post-rock nerds, and most likely, you. Yet another great Tortoise release.

So thus you have the basis for this series, the first four episodes are on this collection.If you're a fan of Clamp you'll like the animation. If you're new to this style, it might take a bit of getting used to, but I think you'll find you're drawn into the story and Watanuki's adventures fairly quickly.

That is pretty much the artistic style of this anime. The characters look strange as hell with legs and arms 3 times the size of their torso. I found this anime extremely frightening.

Clueless boy...check. Worldly girl...check. Annoying sidekick characters (and I mean REALLY annoying)...check.

In this book DeLillo adds a few hundred pages to the somewhat interesting postmodernist take on reality he presented in his more imaginative novel, White Noise. Indeed, since the plots of these novels are similar, there is no excuse for reading Underworld. This does not, however, imply that there is an excuse for reading the other novel. But, if you're looking for something new to read, you could do worse than a 2-star novelist like DeLillo, who is at least trying to be meaningfully relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great big yawn!","review":"Yes, the baseball game in the opening section is interestingly described but this book was so boring, I stopped reading it halfway through for the sake of my sanity!Life is too short for this kind of pretentious, over-hyped, long drawn out waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort of wading through the 800-plus pages","review":"When I first picked up DeLillo's monster, I thought it was great. One of those books that you can't seem to put down. Then, after I read about 300 or so pages, it became harder and harder to pick it up, until finally I put it down permanently after close to 500 pages. I experienced a great sense of loss at the fact that I had wasted a lot of precious time that I could have devoted to one of the classics. If you like repetition, though, you will enjoy this book. DeLillo tends to repeat certain passages over and over, which in a sense is why the book seems so long and drawn out. Close to 500 pages into it and I couldn't possibly see how or when he was going to end my misery, so I did by turning it back in to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This book came touted via the Internet and friends, but I found it so cumbersome and tedious that I cannot recommend it. I liked the first chapter, even though I'm not a baseball fan. However, the author lost me when he left the ballgame.It seems to me that DeLillo must fancy himself a Faulkner for the '90s. However, his dark, dense prose lacks Faulkner's rhythm, beauty, and poetry.I finished the book just to prove to myself that I can still run an endurance race.

Dellilo strives at every oportunity to conjure the most complicated dribble of words imaginable. His imagery is way too verbose and he is obviously trying too hard. The storyline is the most disjointed one i have every known. It seems to be building up to some over-arching climax but fails miserably in its execution. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no \\"main\\" character that emerges. The story required an enduring, likeable character to help us through the mess. It is obvious that Dellilo is a brilliant exponent of the English language. However, with Underworld he has intentionally sought to write a masterpiece.

The initial section at the 1951 playoff game was the best part of the book (but still pretty relentless), and it went downhill from there. I also love long and intricate novels in which I can get lost, but I found this one incredibly tedious. It was impossible to maintain a stake in the characters or in the jumpy plot, which seemed to be more of an exercise in showing off than anything else. It was impossible to draw the much-touted universal insights from this mess, though I'm of about the right age and experience to do so.I didn't finish the book, and it was a wonderfully liberating feeling to bail out.Maybe it's just because I'm a Dodger fan. . .

Later, here it is as the prologue to some of the most verbose, long-winded, meandering drivel of recent years (apart from Salman Rushdie, natch). Does DeLillo even have an editor these days ?

Anyone got any extra copies of Daniel Steele."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up","review":"I tried, really _tried_ to plow through Underworld's 800+ pages. I just couldn't do it. Too much like work. I can appreciate what DeLillo was trying to do to sum up post-WWII America, and using the travels of one of the most famous baseballs in sports history is certainly a clever way to do it, but I simply never felt engaged in this work. The characters seemed flat and uninteresting...and I got really fed up with nearly every character speaking like Jackie Mason. \\"What? You want I should finish this book?

Had it not been for that juxtaposition, I would have abandoned Underworld. But, reading Joyce liberated my reading style and I was able to just enjoy the ride DeLillo took me on. Much of it felt like I was eavesdropping. I didn't always know who, what, when, and where, but it certainly was fascinating. This book is not about the last page, it's about all the pages. Relax and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Often genius","review":"This large volume by Don Delillo is a great book, placing Cold War American life under the microscope. Though events often seem choppy or meaningless to the story, this book reaches, at times, the high expectations that its author aims for. The prologue, as long as it is, remains the best and most powerful section of this book. I could easily see it being extracted for large college anthologies for 20th Century Literature. This wasn't the best book to come out of 1997; John Banville's The Untouchable was. However it's one of the best, along side Philip Roth's American Pastoral and Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The most extraordinary reading experience I've had in years. Underworld is a glorious dark fugue of language and experience that leads not to some comforting, narratively tidy ending, but to where we were at the beginning -- alone with words and what we can recall of a shared history. If people are still reading 100 years from now, this is what they will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provacative stream of consciousness, but difficult to follow","review":"As a first-time reader of DeLillo, I was seduced by the wondrous first chapter in Underworld. All of the praise for this book you will come across is well deserved when directed at this sweeping prologue.From this pinnacle, the book quickly turns downward. Or rather outward - in a smattering of images and moods. These broad-stroked moments are alluring to the reader, and in some cases are enough to sustain one through many difficult passages. But the more I read, the more I was hoping for some piece of the story I could hang onto a little more tightly.Sneak a quick read of the first chapter, slide the book back onto the shelf, and walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"A dense, impenetrable and ultimately dull, directionless novel.

I wish I could say that Underworld hadn't moved me, but it did--I was enraged at myself for wasting the time to finish all 800 odd pages.Sure there were overarching themes--the Cold War, how novel--and some character development but done with such self-consciousness I couldn't bring myself to care. Even Delillo's \\"complex\\" literary techniques are flat--superomniscient--PLEASE!So, what do you get after 800 pages of this? Nothing. Delillo's talent is as thin as Donald Trump's combover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tome by any other name...","review":"I received this great, heavy book from someone who mistook me for jaded or goofy enough to enjoy it, apparently. Something is amiss with language if DeLillo's work is critiqued as genius. My guess is that 'genius' is French for 'Annoying, Yet Still Boring'. I read thru this pile as a perverse exercise, perhaps atoning for sins in my past lives. It was with great pleasure that, as voluminous as it was, I transformed it into a jolly good door stop. The novelty wore off, alas, and I dropped it in my library's return bin as if it belonged there.

That much we can tell from simply looking at it or lifting it! If that fact alone causes the prospective reader such distress they'd do themselves well to make another selection. I suspect that those who do actually read the damn thing will find much to enjoy and contemplate. Yes, in fact I did read the entire book, and I recommend it without reservation. Although it is true that I could not explain it to you. I confess that going back to it after a few days often left me at a loss to recall earlier characters and connect all the dots.

Wait for the paperback edition (or get yourself a wagon, like I did) because you're going to be lugging this loser around a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For lovers of DeLillo, it doesn't get better than this.","review":"Beginning in the golden 1950's, specifically Ebbett's Field and the instant of \\"The shot heard round the world,\\" DeLillo weaves an intricate tale of interconnected people, events and places. With no apparent concern for chronologic sequence, the reader is taken to New Mexico nuclear testing sites, the burned-out South Bronx, J. Edgar Hoover's hotel room and massive New Jersy landfills. The themes of lost innocence, the unforgiving nature of technology and--above all-- the power of hope resonate throughout. As in his other works, DeLillo's characters range from banal to bizarre, with dialogue that is as fascinating as it is believable. This book is not easily forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"The king's new clothes","review":"A classic example of the sort of book that 'everyone' raves about because they don't want to appear uncool by not doing so. Ignore all the hype and the mad stampede to heap praise upon this - it is, quite simply, tedious and unreadable. The style is turgid and the prose pretentious. It lacks structure and development, and is populated by characters notable only for their forgettableness. Believe me, you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this. Don't let me detain you any longer - we have better books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I like books. I like books a lot. I have been known to read manuals for heating systems if nothing else is to hand. This said I don't think my critical faculties have suffered and I found \\"Underworld\\" completely unreadable. I was disappointed and felt gulled by the glowing reviews on the cover which claimed that it was the best book of the century etc. Unconvinced that I was right in the face of such venerable opposition I lent the mostly unread book to several friends who also found it utterly unreadable. I don't know- maybe you have to be American or at least a baseball fan? A horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and in need of a good editor","review":"I was tricked into buying this book by the good reviews it got in the literary press. Actually it is overly long and mostly a bore. It is said to evoke the atmosphere of the US in the cold war period. Actually I don't think DeLillo knows anything more about this than he got from looking at the pictures in old issues of Life magazine and the attempts at evocation through long stretches of purple prose beg for the red pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underworld puts you to sleep","review":"The book's style is rambling and hard to follow. You don't get the sense that there's a story. Reminds me of Pynchon's style which I find ambiguous, elliptical prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"First ~50 pages are outstandingCHARACTERS: poorly conceived and incompletely drawnPLOT: needlessly complicated and confusedSTYLE: impressive at times, but rendered pompous/pretentious by the contextEDITING: unforgivable. This should be a 400 page book or a collection of short stories. Instead it's a ponderous, 800 page, incoherent messAside from the first 50 pages or so, I can't think of a reason that anyone would want to read this book, and I'm even more confused that anyone could LIKE it. But what do I know...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Says more about its fans than America","review":"A good writer has written a deeply irritating and pretentious book. It has brilliant spells but at other times it is so pompous it's embarrassing. \\"Cosmologists of waste\\"...what does it mean? To love this book, you have to lack confidence in your own taste and understanding, the kind of person who goes to exhibitions (by the likes of Klara Sax?) because you think it's good for you, and because you are afraid your friends might get there before you. Go back to Saul Bellow for brainy thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it!","review":"The first 80-odd pages were intriguing. But the further I read, the more disappointed I became. The book has some stunning imagary and keenly observed set pieces, but there seems to be little substance beneath. To me it was like going down a hill on a go-cart with four flat tyres - you expect it to hit pace at the next turn, only for it to continue to limp along and eventually grind to an embarrasing halt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond belief","review":"What an incredible waste of supreme talent! Don Dellilo writes with imagery and poise second to none. I took pause often to marvel over his writing skills. However, the only reason that I finished Underworld was several plane trips with no other reading material available. The reader begs for this marvelous author to actually tell a story or teach us something about the human heart. I am not sure what we get instead. It reads more like an an author's notes from Creative Writing 101 than a novel. It's one thing to get angry about a book, often a mark of great art (e.g. Phillip Roth). It's an entirely different thing to get bored. Underworld rates a generous 3 only because of fantastic prose, but I would not actually recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark, Too Pretentious, Too Too","review":"Underworld has the distinction of being the first book I have put down (in many senses of the phrase) since The Adventures of Augie March in the eighth grade (sorry, Saul Bellow). The setting is dark and not really evocative of its period or its place. The gimmick of having the characters live backwards through the narrative is just that. The female characters are poorly drawn, and the male characters carry around so much angst that they sink below ground. I am both a Cold War kid and a hazardous waste professional, and Delillo needs a get a life more pertinent to mine. All in all, you can indeed fool all of the reviewers at least one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk is cheap - just read it.","review":"Underworld is very appealing if you've got an interest in America's recent history and the discipline to assimilate one writer's fictional interpretation of it. Do not make the mistake of reading so many reviews that you become concerned with the book's length or it's \\"literary significance,\\" whatever that means. Forget the comparisons to Joyce. Forget the book awards it \\"should have\\" won. Just enjoy the story - it has more redeeming value than any sitcom I've seen lately and it might just help you generate some meaningful discussion around the dinner table. What are the challenges for our country in a more dangerous/volatile post-Cold War world? How do we teach our children to embrace both success and failure in the midst of an absurdly superstar-obsessed culture? A great companion read for Underworld is David Halberstam's The Fifties. Don't overthink this book - just read it, reflect on it and move on to the next one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful, sweeping panorama of postwar American life","review":"DeLillo's work is one of immense size and scope, and he does not disappoint. From broad panoramas and massed scenes (sporting crowds or countless B52's lined up in the desert) to passages of exquisite detail, focus and intimacy, Underworld does not allow detail to get lost in the broader canvas, nor is the wider picture lost in trivial detail. It is fitting that DeLillo confronts our consumer age with a book about waste: garbage, nuclear destruction, depravity. And yet, for so potentially bleak a subject matter, Underworld is intensely funny: humour, irony and satire all have their place in DeLillo's epic journey through postwar America. People seeking a nice, conventional linear narrative, or a single authorial voice will not find it here: DeLillo's underworld is a challenging book for those who want to be challenged: read it, and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold war era ennui","review":"Delillo, in his fashion, has written a vaulting piece of historical hyperbole. Perhaps his opus, the best of this novel is in the mordant descriptions, the evocations of family life, and the volleying conversations. However, there is little of a standard plot, and the rewards of a thorough reading may only come for those with an interest in the craft of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews better than it reads","review":"An unreadable book. Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole. To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk. Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it. Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end. Not in this case. Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue. Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read.It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid","review":"Its amazing how many people have read some of this book (I dont know ANYONE who has finished it!!) and are too chicken to admit that it is so awful. I am convinced that the critics who lauded the book are having us on. (Best book since Ulysses, oh yeah has anyone actually READ Ulysses?)Turgid self indulgent and pointless twaddle, one of the worst books I have EVER read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syrup of Ipecac is Cheaper","review":"DeLillo is a shallow genius. He often makes witty observations and quips and attempts to assemble these (in Underworld using the pathetic motif of baseball as his \\"glue\\") into a coherent novel. He fails, as he did in White Noise and Libra.Unfortunately DeLillo, the unabashed postmodernist, substitutes superficiality in character, plot, and trivializes the novel as an artform while garnering reviews from hungry critics desperate for anything palatable. For them any food tastes good (look at Grisham, Clancy, King etc, gawdawful) as they are very hungry.This made me vomit. Go check out some ipecac if you want to induce vomiting, it's much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written dreadfully boring","review":"A boring novel, lacking any significant cohesive thread, written by a man attempting to examine a large chunk of history he is not distanced far enough from to be able to describe with clarity.The lack of emotional investment evidenced by both the author and the characters in this novel is a serious flaw making the leaps between times and events so disjointed that it becomes hard to care what happens next or why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic - Ignor any review with less than 4 Stars","review":"This is one of the most thoughtful and creative novels I've read in years. DeLillo presents wonderful insights into the evolution of contemporary urban american culture and values. Yes it's a long, complex novel but well worth the time and effort. The one and two star reader/reviewers obviously did not finish this novel and should be ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"DeLillo grabbed us with White Noise, and has dropped us ever since. This book, although poetic at times, and although is represents \\"the way people actually talk\\" is tedious, chaotic and difficult to stay with. If \\"reality\\" or \\"historicity\\" are the benchmarks of a good book, you'd have a better time sitting in the lobby of the Smithsonian and trying to eavesdrop on every person who walked by. I gave up on the cusp of part 5. Why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"who cares","review":"I read this book, because it was recommended by a friend. After reading the opening story about the \\"Shot Heard Round the World\\", I was prepared for an amazing book. But to my disappointment, it turned out to be boring and convoluted. I get was this book is about--a deconstructive look at the American psyche during the cold war period. It is a loosely tied together set of stories--glimpses into people's lives really--linked by the number 13, a baseball, nuclear war and garbage. But who cares? For all of the author's witty prose and random occurences, the book does not do what it should--tell a story. The author could have made the book 400 pages or so and done the same thing. Instead, he gets too caught up in his deconstructionist experiment. Don't read it unless you have a lot of patience and time on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"A semi-pretentious friend of mine recommended this book to me. I should have seen it coming.Tried to read it, got through about three hundred pages, and still mourn the time I wasted trying (as well as the tree that gave its life for the printing)...This is book is boring in an \\"epic\\" sense of the word. And I don't just that \\"it didn't entertain me\\". I mean that it's a monument of sterile self-indulgence, vacant pretention, and pathological wordiness. Somehow I can't help but see it as a symbol of the excesses of our times: 800 pages about nothing, and people praise it.You might like it, but don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never met a book I didn't like at all...until now.","review":"I don't ask much from a novel. Give me a tangible plot, some coherent paragraphs, decent dialogue and characters with reasonable definition, and I'll wade through it somehow. Particularly when Newsweek went into rhapsodies over it, and even the promotional reviewers in Amazon rated it the Book of the Century. So, what went wrong? My wife, a woman of very good taste and a liberal attitude, got to page 263 and gave up; I lasted for a few pages more. Tell you what I'm going to do--I'll stash this one on our bulging bookshelves for a year or so, and then I'll try it again. I hate to see the twenty bucks go to a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Offering from a Good Writer","review":"\\"Underworld\\" is the type of novel that frustrates me. This is because DeLillo is a good writer and the ideas about which he writes are great, yet somehow he manages to create a mediocre work of fiction. I think that he tried to make his canvass too large and as a consequence DeLillo has created a novel that has little cohesiveness. The disparate characters and settings are united under the umbrella of the Cold War, but these sketches of prose and ideas never gel into a novel nor into a true story. I understand that DeLillo writes in a \\"post-modern\\" genre, more or less, yet a novel full of seemingly disconnected events still needs to have threads of story connecting them, however tiny these threads may be. As a series of vignettes or a colletion of shortstories it may have worked, but as a novel, it is too long and just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor adaptation to Kindle","review":"I haven't finished the book yet so I won't comment on the story itself. I will say though that this is the poorest adaptation to Kindle that I own. I'm 80% through and there have been typos and formatting errors throughout, averaging about one every couple pages. Line breaks that would mark a change in scene or time seem to have been omitted and quotation marks are sometimes missing, making the dialogue hard to read. I understand this is a postmodern work but I don't think these were intended by the author. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delillo's exhausted themes","review":"I was disappointed in this work. Like Whitenoise and Endzone(not to mention his other novels), Dellilo is still writing about the same problems of our American culture, that is, we are too much of a \\"consumer culture\\", everything is a \\"simulacrum\\", and we live in an age of crisis or apocalypse. Dellilo needs to move on and write about something else; Postmodernism is dead, if it ever really existed, and perhaps Dellilo could write something less formulaic and something with a little more heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuckers out in the end","review":"This book starts out brillantly with an amazing first chapter about a single baseball game. The quickly changing scenes (ballgame to J.Edgar Hoover in stands to announcer to kid in the stands) captured the spirit of America of the time. Then the next few chapters show some promise that the characters will be intriguing and watching them develop will be fun.Alas, by the time I was 300 pages through the book I was already tiring of it. Not wanting to give up after having committed the hours to read the first 300 pages, I trudged to the end. What a tiresome/disappointing end it was. The last chapter was simply silly. I felt Delillo was trying too hard to make a profound point of which he just wasn't capable.Would I recommend this book to friend? Maybe, especially if (s)he likes baseball (I love the game). Will I read another Delillo novel? Probably- though it will have to be short (White Noise?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took 6 months, but I finished it!","review":"I read this book based on the initial review and recommendations of various columnists. It was generally interesting but in the final analysis, I would say not worth the effort. I was unimpressed with the writing style which I felt was overly descriptive with no real connection to the plot. Although I would not recommend this book, I felt that there were some elements of the story and the writing that were excellent. My ultimate regret is that the book as a whole did not live up to the first chapter's tantalizing introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanging on for dear life","review":"I'm only about 200 pages into this octopus, and its eight arms (read: subplots) are slowly and painfully entangling me. I want to survive until the end but I will freely admit - it's tough. This is not exactly a page-turner, but it's so adventurous and promising that I'd like to finish it. I wanted to get other readers' opinions for some possible encouragement. This is my first go with DeLillo. Is this typical of his style? So far, this book does not fill me with desire to read his earlier stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, written for effect, not readers","review":"DeLillo has created a tour de force. Unfortunately, it is a legend in his own mind. Artfully presented, the prose is heavy and dense, the characters are built up at a glacial pace and the plot is still relatively remote after 300 pages. This, combined with the incessant time-hopping chapters, made for a most unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this all about?","review":"The first 60 pages are spectacular! Then it goes downhill from there. I could not finish this book. I stopped at page 181 and couldn't go on. I have read a few other reviews here and agree with those who did not like it. It is bascially a bunch of unconnected stories that do not have any sense of purpose or narrative for that matter. I couldn't care less about the characters and cared even less about what they were talking about. A condom factory?! Why was that put in there? Can anyone explain this to me? I returned the book back to the bookstore and picked up \\"Lloyd What Happened\\" by Stanley Bing and a baseball book by Yogi Berra. If I want to know what REALLY happened to baseball in the '50's I'll listen to Yogi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After a wonderful start, this book became an amazingly boriing exercise about half way through. I would not argue Dellilo's brilliance as a writer, however, some deeper sense of humanity seems to be missing in his characters. Also, there is a pretentious arrogance that comes across in his writing. He tries too hard to show off his ability to be a brillian descriptive writer. If he would of done a better job of getting us inside the heads of his characters instead of just describing them in a \\"I can see through everyone, aren't I brilliant,\\" sort of way, this book may have worked. Why did this book get so much hype?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ex - cruci - ating","review":"Delillo is a keen and insightful observer; this populates his book with brilliant phrases, sweet cadences. He also happens to be in love with his style; this has removed any sense of balance or proportion from this tome.Here we have an author who flogs a good idea to death and then one more. In his world, if drinking tea is pleasant, it would be even more so to grind on the leaves.I read someone comparing him to Pynchon. Ha! This book is a smudge compared to the brush-stroke of \\"Gravity's rainbow\\".Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I can't tell you how many times I've picked up this book and become bored and confused.

This book ranks in unreadability with Mason & Dixon."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end?!","review":"I'm 200 pages shy of completing this novel, a feat that has spanned over MONTHS. To put it simply - and without boring anyone with ten dollar words - this book is not worth the time. Classics like Moby Dick and Ulysses are read in schools across the country. I doubt this book will ever reach such high standards, and expectedly so. I'm lost, confused, I've had enough of the baseball pity. What do all the other people have to do with the story? If they're all intertwined, then someone explain to me HOW!

However, it does to some extent work as a fairly readable mediation on america since the early 1950s and there are some passages which are impressive. Other pieces are hard going and it is not always easy to knit together the threads, but it does remain a strangely resonant and seductive novel which repays the patience it sometimes requires"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable masterpiece","review":"The best, most ambitious, most achieved novel in a long time. What a writer's book. Every page has a sentence that you want to write down in a notebook somewhere. The opening Polo Grounds section is just so good, and the final evocation of Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, 1951, is so beautiful. Yeah it's long, but worth it. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very long and boring","review":"I bought the hype and got the hardback. At best this is a used paperback read. I kept waiting for it to get entertaining.

I finished, which is better than quitting, but it took a long time to do it. I read several other books in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Quite simply, I found this book to be every bit as enthralling as I've been told. I find it inconceivable that anyone can gripe about length. Can't you see it's a long book by looking at it? Reader's digest is available and recommendable for those of the MTV-generation whose attention spans have waned to the point of boredom at paying attention to anything longer than a six-panel Sunday comic. This is an excellent, if lengthy, novel. (Sorry if this got a bit long.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"Yeah, it's very long. It takes a while to get through. But really, how can people write negative reviews of a book they didn't FINISH? The disparate threads actually do all have a purpose, do connect to each other in subtle and astonishing ways. DeLillo's writing style is superb; I admit a few passages could have been excised, but by no means is this a collection of unrelated short stories. As long as you're willing to put in the effort it takes to keep it all together, this is a very satisfying book at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might have to read it again to say anything intelligent about this book.","review":"I made it all the way through, which was an accomplishment.

Good boy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To write thick books does not make you a good novelist","review":"Some American writers, dazzled by the novels of the 19th and early 20th centuries, seem to think that to make a great book you only need to fill hundreds of pages with endless, tedious descriptions and hollow dialogues. They do not seem to think that any especial literary ability (such as imagination or psychological insight) is required. DeLillo is a nice example of this kind of writers. Thus, whereas The Magic Mountain and War and Peace are literary wonders, Underworld is simply unbearable. The prose is beautiful and carefully worked, but it is absolutely not enough to make a good novel. My recommendation to writers: if you are not Thomas Mann or Leo Tolstoy, either stick to the 200 pages or find an interesting story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Did not make it through the first chapter.

These are only my opinions, but I feel that over 800 pages are a far-sight too many to go through only to be let down.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT BUYING THIS BOOK.

The prime issues I have are that you CANNOT disable the internal DHCP server and you cannot specify internal IP subnets; yeah, you can limit the number of IP addresses it assigns, but it's not the same as being able to subnet. This has caused some issues in having to rework my home's internal network, but for the average user this won't be an issue. The one thing I really like about this unit is the firewall.

I set security to High & I had major problems sending emails or changing between emails. Called Motorola twice. Tech's helped, but neither one had much knowledge about this unit. Wish I could remove whip antenna as I can not put on top of computer. I disabled wireless, so do not need antenna. Set up manual limited & no owners manual. I could not download the CD owners manual. So I downloaded it from Motorola website. Price varies on Amazon a lot. I ordered it after price increased to $117, then dropped again. SBG900 should be best Cable Modem/Router/Gateway available. Look for it < $110. If it screws up, best reboot & wait a day. Using Astound 6 Mb/1Mb for $30/month for a year. Tech was here 10/11/08. He could not troubleshoot slow cable problem. Obvious he had not taken A+ & N+ courses. Motorola should provide hard copies of their manuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"This is simple. Just attach cable and power. No desk area clutter as with separate modem and wireless router. Works great with Vista. Only caution comments would be that the Motorola direct router setup (for those of you who know how to do this) is not as easy to navigate or intuitive as the Linksys setup. Also, despite having all of the account and passwords, etc. established with the cable comopany, I could get no service until I called the cable company to give them the modem address. Did I miss this in all of the CDs and directions??? The cable company said \\"Sorry about that!\\" Anyway, works great.

It was manufactured in 2007/2008 and ran out of warranty in 2010. We notified the seller, and they stated that they really weren't a modem supplier, that it was the last one they had and it had been laying around for a while.

I then jumped through the hoops with the Motorola techs and it was determined after a week that I was due a replacement. (don't use the e-mail approach, call them) But I have to pay shipping to get it and again pay shipping to return the defective one. So much for the great warranty.

Vonage devices simply do not work reliably with this device if the router and network-address-translation firewall are enabled. Mine came from the internet service provider (ISP) so I had no choice in the matter -- it was the cable modem the ISP insisted on issuing -- so I had to negotiate with the ISP to cripple the firewall and router functions.

It offers a 2 way firewall watching both inbound and outbound packets. Most router firewalls are inbound only thus some setup is required for products like steam that need special outbound ports opened. A simple Google search for this modem and steam ports showed me how to fix the problem. The wireless is good not the best but has the latest encryption formats and I get signal thru the house. I have no connection issues to my laptop or playstation 3 using WPA encryption. I have been using this modem combo for about 2 months with no issues except the firewall ports. I do not see closed non standard ports as a problem as I appreciate the better firewall, verses my old router firewall/wireless that only blocked inbound ports.

You do have to call your cable provider and tell them that you are installing a new cable modem and give them your MAC ID number and ask them to syncronize it.

I had a little trouble getting it to work with my Vonage phone service though, but after calling Motorola tech support, everything went very smooth. If you are using Vonage VIOP, you basically have to tell the SBG900's firewall to allow the Vonage system to work. Call Motorola tech support. They are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about VIOP issues. Above all, I am very pleased with this router. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't a \\"N\\" band router, but even though it isn't, it still works awesome.

Even if I could follow the instructions, I probably wouldnt of made any of the projects anyway. They are all very old fashioned and just not wearable.

The hero, J B Hammock, was a jerk from the word go, but, miraculously, he becomes every woman's dream in a matter of seconds. Then there is the narrator. I listen to audio books because of low vision, so I know what a narrator should sound like. This woman (or child) should be relegated to childrens' or teen books, as that is what her voice sounds like. She made no attempt to give the characters different voices; just the same sweet, teeny-bopper voice throughout.

If you have another title, just change the names of the characters and you will have it. Like the other reviewers, I too am a Palmer fan who has some of her other titles on my keeper shelf. However, in recent years, her books have all been pretty much carbon copies of each other. All of her characters are the same in every one. I would love to see her write a book just once where the hero and heroine were not somehow related, where they are not infatuated with Science Fiction, spoke every sentence with an exclamation point or use phrases that have not been used since the 70's.

Apparently not. I cannot believe that Silhouette would publish such an awful book. The hero in this book is simply mean, hateful, and abusive to the heroine -- yelling at her, screaming at her, demeaning her. He has absolutely NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. He's physically and emotionally abusive of her, and then in the end, he shows up with a ring and she forgives decades of abuse to fall into his arms. Please. That is so 1970! I actually read this entire book in one sitting (it's short, mind you) because I couldn't believe a book published in 2006 could be this outdated and this bad.

No drug busting subplots, no mercenaries, and no criminals. But one thing pulled me out of enjoying this book as a total piece of brain candy. The military/Green Beret/linguist background of Grange. As a former service member and a speaker of the Arabic language, this section bothered me. Farsi is not Arabic, nor is it a dialect of Arabic (it's actually a seperate language, with a different alphabet). Also, it's hard for me to imagine that someone who is threatened with court martial would be given the option of \\"court martial or honorable discharge\\". Possibly a general discharge, but NOT an honorable discharge. Diana needs to learn how the military works before using it as a plot device.I did like the story, and it flowed well and <mostly> made logical sense.

There is nothing your brain cannot accomplish, and Bandler provides the steps to take you to levels of brain development that you have not begun to think about...yet. In Using Your Barin for a Change, you are now in control of what you think, and how you think of life, concentrating all of your past miseries into one moment and then having it disappear to refocus your energy into the moment which we call the 'now'.

However, it would be wise for experienced practitioners to skip this one. It is full of great self improvement advice, but not of true history cases with patients.Unfortunately, in my 10 years experience with NLP trainings, trainees tend to confuse real life stories and metaphors. I've even heard of a practitioner who tried to immitate Bandler's story, and almost aniled his client to a wooden cross... Hey, that story IS A METAPHOR! It did NOT happen in real life, unless Mr. Bandler is willing to prove it. No REAL psychiatrist would allow a stranger to threaten a hospitalized patient in a psychiatric hospital. Get over your wishful thinking and learn to separate the fiction from the truth.All and all, it's an easy to read book, and it can satisfy the newbie.Shlomo Vaknin, C.HtNLPWeekly Magazine"},{"rating":"2","title":"{{{sigh}}}","review":"Do you remember the line from the movie 'American Beauty', the one about sometimes things being so beautiful you don't think that your heart can stand it?

The guitar and vocals and percussion blend beautifully, and are like an out-of-body experience.I lost my breath the first time i heard this album, and sometimes i get so carried away by it i need to remind myself to breathe.

There are plenty of pictures throughout the book.Unlike the author I don't see the downfall of the gingham dress to be such a success. The girls in the beginning of the book just look so cute.

Some of the sample formulas simply do not work or else are not explained fully in context. Added to this, the accompanying CD skimps on the first four chapters, making it impossible to follow along on some the exercises the author provides.

And that was long before I considered teaching as a profession.This book is hard to find, or I'd have replaced it more often than twice.

Huxley and Orwell have already blazed the trail and unfortunately Michael D. O'Brien does not explore new territories.In fact, he does not even go as far as these authors. But the major flaw of the book is its style. It is poor because Micheal D. O'Brien has pre-conceived ideas and uses words only to convey these ideas in the form of a novel.

One imagines reality, by believing the study of words leads to enlightenment. However, enlightenment never comes with a Pharisaical understanding of words. Example: does one really know love, forgiveness, justification, righteousness by definition and study? Perhaps you've heard people say or have said yourself, \\" I never really understand something until I do it.\\" That's because we're designed to be objective beings and eschew thought alone as truth. As the old Jewish saying goes, \\" Don't tell me what you believe, I'll watch you for a day and tell you what you believe.\\" Masters points how infamous charismatic leaders lead large populations to ruin by shrewdly connecting words to emotions. Truly, words are no more than symbols for meaning and surly the meaning, not the symbol is that which is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"Roy Masters stumbled upon a hypnotist's arm levitation measure and ingeniously saw its power as a meditation tool.

Numerous times I was flipping around to try to find a chart he was talking about, only to find that it wasn't anywhere in the book. You get the impression quickly that this was churned out to scrape in some extra dough. Larry's writing style is \\"conversational\\" - and that's a charitable way to describe it.

The animation is kind of bland sometimes but it's still a step up from most modern US television cartoons.

As one reviewer mentioned, this is not an original book in terms of concepts (several others have already published the same ideas, albeit without the same clarity) but it is definitely worth a try because what you will find in these pages is yourself, not someone trying to impose their own idea of how they think or are.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for the Heart and Soul","review":"The Messiah Seed has become a bedside book for me--a daily companion of wisdom and guidance.

They only play a piece of these videos. So if you are looking to see some footage of the band performing at least 1 song in it's entirety this isn't the one for you. I did enjoy the interviews w/ past band members and their insight to the songs and albums. I only wish if they couldn't get Beefheart himself for an interview couldn't they find some old footage of him talking about some of these great albums.This isn't a DVD that I will play often.

If the makers were to show us all the footage of every concert, then there would be no time left for the documentary. It would merely be a concert DVD. And if that's what you're looking for, by all means, put up your petitions to the powers that be.But we loved learning more about the magic band members and seeing how time has ravaged or been good to them. Their tales of behind-the-scenes goings-on were very interesting. We also loved finding out where the next interviewee would be perched/lurking/hiding/sipping...I recommend this DVD to all Beefheart fans and collectors. It's just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the whiners....","review":"This DVD is a review of Beefheart's career, album by album. For what it is, it's very good. No, it isn't a concert, nor does it purport to be. The rare live clips are excellent and hopefully someday they can be compiled, uniterrupted into a DVD collection. Look at this as an audio book with snippets of tasty music. There is so little available on Beefheart on DVD if you don't have access to BBC documentaries or bootleg live films. So the 2 hour length didn't bore me at all. It just made me want to listen to Clear Spot and find a record player to crank up my copy of Lick My Decals Off, Baby! The only thing the critics missed was how much of an influence the guitar on Alice in Blunderland had on Tom Verlaine and Television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Captain?","review":"This could have been a great dvd.

Any beginner would immediately come away thinking that the classics are is stale and boring, mere accompaniment to bugs bunny cartoons. The disc simply does not give an exciting impression. I'd choose a collection that features exciting and shorter compositions (perhaps a Paganini caprice, a Chopin etude, any Mozart sonata or concerto, a Bach cello suite--anything that rocks!!!)

Every new release kept me interested in them beyond the typical passing fancy of the indie world. Newness Ends is a strong release. It sounds very much in the vein of \\"Transaction du Novo\\" which means the vocals are a touch louder, the songs have fewer \\"wall of sound\\" moments and there's a conscious melodic effort. On songs like \\"Newness Ends\\", \\"Half a Day\\", and \\"Great Expectations\\" The New Year really shoots for a gentle pop melody that more swirls around the listener than knocks them in the head. I guess that's why I like The New Year and Bedhead, their music is never overbearing and it's more than simply pleasant. It's a band that has mastered gentle/edgy rock music than doesn't fade with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly well made","review":"Bought this to hold a piece of jewelry I bought for my wife this holiday season, and really didn't expect much.

They also redo \\"I Could Sing of Your Love Forever\\" with Martin singing the bridge in Spanish (and it actually sounds pretty cool!), and \\"The Happy Song\\" (which really benefits from the new treatment to go from the rockabilly sound it had to a rugged rock sound). \\"Fire\\" sounds like it comes across hard and rocking in the live version, and Stu actually takes to the mic for his acoustic version of \\"King of Fools\\". All in all, this is a great double set and is well worth it, especially if you've always wondered how Delirious would sound live. The only downside to this is that it doesn't contain as many solid worship songs as \\"Live and In the Can\\" (their other live cd), but you really wouldn't want the same songs on both cd's, so that's ok.

That said, once I realized that political orientation of the author, I was able to put it aside and get to the meat of the matter. The author's discussion of the Baldrige process obviously comes from his extensive experience as an award examiner. His discussions of how corporations have used the Baldrige process were quite illuminating.When I looked at the source material the author quotes from, I found one misquote and a botched bibliographic reference.

When cooking, food leaks through and burns as it reaches the metal base. The point of the crock pot is that you can put stuff in it and leave it -- all day, ideally. I cannot do this as I worry that I have a fire hazard on my hands. Additionally, even when home all day babysitting it, the smell of burnt food -- insteado of a delicious meal -- wafts through the air. I need a new insert, but am thinking of just buying a different company's product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"While shoping in a local store, I bought this crock pot on impulse, The store did not have one set up on display, so bought it upon the 'box facts' and the knowledge that our other Rival crock pot had given us years of good service. When I got home and unpacked this unit it took me all of 30 sec to relize this was a cheap piece of junk, and would be lucky to last a month. Thankfully I packed it back in the box, did some checking on Amazon, confimed my suspicion's of junk status by the other user reviews. I then found a highly rated Hamilton Beach, which I ordered from Amazon, and at a later date got a refund on my impulse buy. This is a piece of junk, never even used it so can't comment on it's cooking abilites. But can say the lid would even lock down flush, also the plastic locking clips almost broke on the first use. I will now steer clear of Rival, I know they make better units, but still it is their name that is on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I purchased this same model from Walmart. Now, it might have just been the particular box I chose but the locking handle tab was broken off and getting the lid hinged and unhinged is practically impossible.The box had not been opened nor was it damaged in any way so I believe the slow cooker was just poorly made.Even though I didn't purchase this through Amazon, I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Crockpot I've used that burns food!!!","review":"I bought this Crockpot at Wal-Mart and cooked one of the recipes from the booklet that was included (pork chops with rice). The lid did not fit securely - it left gaps in the front and back allowing steam to escape. When I came home the food was burnt, but only on one side of the crockpot. The heating element must be uneven. I didn't try any other recipes, just returned it to the store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE crock pot, DO NOT BUY!","review":"I bought this crock pot at Target on sale for $30 a few months ago. As others have mentioned the lid did not fit securely. I was sent a \\"replacement\\" crock pot. The replacement crock pot lid was fine although very difficult to remove to clean. Today the hinge broke. I'm going to call the company and see what they can do. This crock pot is awful and I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil in a pot...","review":"I love the idea of the hinged lid that locks, but it is a pain in the buttocks to get the lid off. I've just spent the last ten minutes fighting the lid, trying to detach it from the pot. You can't access the ceramic pot unless the hinged lid is off! How annoying!This slow cooker is going back tomorrow. As convenient as it is to not have to put the lid down or juggle it while stirring, it's not worth the hassle. Do yourself a favor and just get a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this junk!!!","review":"I got this as a gift, and used it 3 times. I handwashed it because the lid is so delicate. It completely broke after the third time. I tried to cook with it, using a fork to lift the lid up and burnt my fingers. I tried to contact Rival customer service...what a joke. I would not recommend this unit to anyone. Out of fairness to rival, I have a crockpot with a normal lid that I have used for 7 years now without a problem.. The genius who designed this lid should be fired!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome crockpot","review":"I actually bought this crockpot from a local Costco, but after reading the only review listed I thought I should add my two cents. I literally just bought this last week (8/25/05) and made a potroast over the weekend. It worked AWESOME!! I honestly think crockpots don't work for some people because of operator error, something to be said for reading the directions. I had no smoke, no burnt meal, no rattling lid, no under-cooked meal. Ok, the sides get hot but that is where the heating element is, not a big deal. Slow cook on 10 hours, put enough liquid in, brown your meat well beforehand .. this is not rocket science. The crockpot is very beautiful and functional, super easy to clean up. I used some of the left-over juices to make gravy for the meal and the rest made a phenomenal french onion soup that surpasses any I've ever had. Way to go Rival!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle Broke","review":"I have had this crock pot for just over 3 years, but have only used it a handfull of times. The low setting is too high and burns foods if you are not stirring every few minutes. The handle just broke off of the lid due to shoddy design. A new lid costs $15. Am waiting to hear from Crock Pot if they will replace it or deny me replacement which will have me out looking for a new slow cooker made by another company. This is the SECOND Crock Pot product in 7 years that the handle has broken right off of.Crock Pot e-mailed back and said they no longer make the replacement lid, but would be happy to send a regular lid that will fit as a replacement.

Boy was I mistaken. The 1st or 2nd time I used it the hinge broke, then the latch broke, a little bit, piece by piece, by then the warranty was over. Today I used it and a handle has broken off. It almost seems as if it is melted. The screws are barely holding on. No replacement parts available, and getting the lid off without a handle or latch/hinge is nearly impossible without burning yourself. DON'T BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic disintegrates.

The CrockPot is great, but the hinge broke off after less than one year of usage. I'm sure the special design cost me more than I would've paid for one with a regular lid. I went to CrockPot's web site to order a replacement and found that (though the part is only $10) by the time you pay the add'l $8.50 for shipping, to reorder the part is half the price of the crockpot itself! Moral of the story: Don't waste money on any special lids."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! This crockpot burns food!","review":"This crockpot burns food and the lid does not work properly.

The 3rd time I used mine the hinged part of the lid broke off. If the lid doesn't seal well, then that ruins the whole way a slow cooker works. I've researched where to find a replacement hinge. The manufacturer has the whole lid listed but also as out of stock and without a listed price. Comments I've found put the price of the lid at $15 and with shipping the total becomes $26. Do I want to spend nearly the price of a new crock pot for a lid that might only last 3 times again? Let alone the hassle factor of checking back to the website often to see if it is in stock yet. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this","review":"This crockpot burns food and the lid does not work properly. I have been cooking with crockpots for over 30 years so have some experience with them. Food cooks at too high a heat, and swiss steak, which would have been moist and tender in another crockpot was burned in this one. The lid was terribly difficult to remove, and the screws on the henge broke. Now it is useless. This was a good price, but a terrible product. I am going back to the lid that I can just lift off with the knob on the top. This one is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with other reviewer","review":"I also purchased this same model (from Walmart). Upon the first use, although the food cooked well and I enjoyed the hinged lid \\"idea,\\" the plastic open and close tab broke upon the first use. I also found the hinge difficult to operate. I didn't even wash this lid in the dishwasher (which the instructions said was fine to do) but it just snapped off at the screw attachment area on both sides. The price was great, but I would not recommend this product due to quality issues. So, I would conclude that this is not just a random issue, and would take serious consideration of this before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible construction","review":"The concept of the hinged top that locks is wonderful, but the execution is terrible. I have used this approx 4-5 times and the pin has been broken and replaced twice! Once the pin breaks, there is no way to open the lid safetly or easily, so it renders it unuseable - what a waste and what a disapointment.

After trying to use it for several months, we threw it away. We've probably wasted $100 worth of meat in this crock pot. It always burns the food.We even used a meat thermometer on the low setting and found that it cooked the meat so quickly that the outside of a roast overcooked while the inside was still raw.In the past we have owned other crock pots that did not look as nice as this one, but worked much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"I love making stews and soups and this beautiful crock pot works well in making the best meals as well as looking very pretty in my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy","review":"Crock Pot model SCVS600 is not a good investment. The lid gets super hot after a few hours of cooking and it is very hard to detach the lid from base.

It remains to be seen what kinda service they will provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 years plus....","review":"I bought my first databank watch over 20 years ago in Hong Kong and was very happy to have a way to keep track of phone numbers. Unfortunately, the hazards of living on a navy ship claimed this one. So, I bought another when I got back to the US. The first one only had room for 30 records; the second only 50 and now it is up to 300. I've always heard the saying \\"a short pencil is better than a long memory\\". But who wants to carry a notebook around all the time?I believe this is my 6th databank. So one might think that I am a bit abusive to my watches. But this brings out the only negative thing about the databank; and that is that it is a bit on the fragile side. So, if you work in an industrial environment it might not be a very good choice.Otherwise I am still giving it the top rating. I look forward to the say when it has text to speech and then becomes a wirelss device a la Dick Tracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Databank watch/Casio","review":"My Data Bank Watch DBC310-1 was exactly what I ordered and received.

I didn't have to read the instruction book because it operates the same as old watch. I was lucky, I was able to retrieve my list of phone numbers from the old watch, and put them on the new watch. One more thing, I would like to see Casio Data Bank with Solar power and Atomic time keeping.I received the new watch in a timely fashion. Pleased with the product and service. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Data Bank 300","review":"This is a great watch. I have worn out two prior to this.

A better engineered attachment would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a watch?","review":"This is a type of watch that I wanted since I have a lot of phone numbers to keep track of and I also like to be warned ahead of time for appointments etc...I also like to have a calculator close by in order to figure out equations that need to be figured out right then. If any one of you need something to remind you of appointments, telephone numbers and you want a calculator nearby, then this is the watch that you'd want."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Favorite","review":"This is the fourth one of these I have owned so it is obvious, I like this watch.It has great features but they have not been updated or added to in years. I wish it would tie into the atomic clock because it does tend to be a few minutes off over time. I also wish you could view a full monthly calendar.Finally, and most importantly, I wish they would make a real metal case. The \\"metal case\\" they have is just plastic one made to look like metal. ALL of my replacements have been necessary because the plastic cases failed where the band pins are inserted so you cannot put the band back on. Not convenient as a pocket watch!Each time I had the case break, I have looked for a different watch with all the features of this watch, especially the appointments, but haven't found one that had all of them or I would have tried it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to find a source for the DATABANK watch","review":"I have had a Casio Databank since they first came out in the early 1980s, and have happily replaced each one in turn as it failed for whatever reason (the usual failure was a break in the case where the band attached). I work in the medical profession and got used to having and using the calculator feature, storing telephone numbers, setting alarms, and using the memo feature to remind me of upcoming things that would need my attention. This was before getting an Ipod Touch, which, of course, has many many more features, yet I still rely on my Databank to do basic things because it is right there on my wrist. I was dismayed when my last Databank started to fail and couldn't find it among the Casio watch selection in stores. In a moment of inspiration, I decided to try Amazon and there it was, still available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"many years with casio","review":"This the second time I brought a casio watch in years, 1st one finally went out, had about 10 yrs or more.

Not bad for a less than $50 watch! When it finally began to have serious enough problems that the watch needed to be replaced, I already knew I needed the successor -- the Data Bank 300. (The 300 refers to the number of memory slots available in which phone numbers, names, and other short reminders can be stored.)I called this watch the Poor Man's PDA -- and it is! Its great! I'm delighted with it.Buy it... I bet you'll like it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Organizer!","review":"I bought this for my husband who has had the the same one for about 10 years. His finally stopped keeping a charge and he lost all his data. Figured it was time for a new one. He uses the watch as his calendar and date organizer. He puts all his appointments into the watch. The watch front shows the whole week as little boxes along the top and little ovals will appear in the boxes if you have set an appointment for that day. He uses it daily and also keeps notes on his watch. The only problem he has had is the watch is plastic and the black paint will wear off. The watch band also will break but you can get a cloth/leather replacement band and it will last for alot longer. The watch is waterproof as far being able to be able to go in the shower. I wouldn't recommend going swimming with it. Overall it is a great watch, but would recommend buying a new watch band for it. I would give it 5 stars if the body was made out of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"CASIO DBC310-1 DataBank Men's Watch","review":"I have been wearing a DBM-150 for the past 10 years and needed a new replacement Casio DataBank watch. I am disapointed in the DBC-310-1 because you can only input 8 characters per line, but you can input 16 characters, double the amount, in the DBM-150. I guess this is how Casio can say they have 300 pages but can only use half of the memory character wise. Also, there is no password secured data input on the DBC-310, but memory is on an EEPROM that is not erased when you change batteries. Otherwise, they are identical; however, the difference is significant.

While it's really not \\"dance\\" (more like cardio and isolation moves based off some belly dance inspired movement), it's still a gentle, smooth, and wonderful workout. If you're careful to isolate your muscles and squeeze and release, you will feel a burn. My heart rate got up a little bit, but nothing crazy - which is perfect since I\\"m 6 months pregnant.While this workout won't make you sweat, it will stretch you and relieve tension and soreness in your muscles. I felt GREAT afterward! Tension and discomfort in my back and hips was relieved and I felt relaxed and renewed.

I'm trying to replace these speakers with something better...don't waste your money here"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexspensive, yet still not a good value","review":"I bought these speakers without hearing them because I just wanted basic sound for one of my computers. I had an older Altec Lansing satellite/subwoofer computer speaker system that was only slightly more expensive, so I expected these to sound reasonably good because the older ones sounded quite good for the price. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, but I was very disappointed when I hooked them up and started listening to some music. They are very dull and there seems to be some plastic resonance to the sound. Bass is nonexistent. Low midrange is about as low as these will go. Do not expect any \\"punch\\" whatsoever. News clips, fine, but music and even movies suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic British Comedy!!Great Props!!","review":"The late great Peter Sellers portrays a humble scottsman determined to become Britians poet laureate.His dual role of the oversexed Queen Victoria adds to this very funny, off the wall film which makes british comedy so unique.Monty Python fans will love this little known gem!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! \\"pics-place \\"","review":"PRODUCT NEVER ARRIVED-SELLER NEVER RESPONDED TO MY EMAILS.

This is by no means a recording of historical interest only. It's a vibrant collection by a great singer, which stands on its own as well as providing a base for understanding what Hester is doing with her music today, and the work of the many artists-Dylan, Nanci Griffith, Emmylou Harris, the Kennedys, Rory Block among others-she has touched in her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Like it Should Be...Honky Tonk Heaven!","review":"Dale makes great old style country music. He is hard core and does not compromise to make it sound like today's watered down country-pop. If you like songs that could easily fit in with any Merle Haggard classic, then Dale is your man.While the songs sound like \\"real\\" country to me, they also are not dated, dull or uninspired. These songs have a true sense of urgency, quality and are just as fresh sounding today as they would be circa 1968.Give Dale a try and you will be looking at buying all his CD's (I recommend, \\"I Hate These Songs\\" CD as a follow up to this one).You may even find yourself (like me) making several trips to Austin, Texas to see Dale live at the \\"Broken Spoke\\". A true country music dance hall classic. Dale often plays there.

I got a copy and paged through it. At first I was disappointed, because I suspected that even if I forced myself to plow through the whole book slowly I probably would not understand the reasons for its popularity.

When, not if, I replace this cyclometer with a better one it will be wireless as the mess of wires is a little ugly even after spending some time carefully routing and dressing them. I will walk carefully through the interface of the next cyclomter as this one is at least a little unintuitive.

There was just no life in the tracks. I have been singing along to Irish tunes for many years and was wanting a Karaoke DVD for my wife to listen to and learn. She had previously shown an interest in doing this, but after listening to this I think she has been put off for life.The only thing this DVD may help is for her to get a gist of the songs and learn the words.

You may not be able to read the words in the picture but they are marked on the nozzle. I assume it is an attempt to imply quality.

The Melnor nozzles are made from cheap, Chinese junk metal.I have two of these nozzles (purchased in a twin pack) and one corroded so badly I can't get it off of the hose it is attached to. Now I have to throw the hose away. The other one started to corrode but I had not used it as long so I was able to remove it in time. I have lived in my home for 27 years.

The deeply layered horn loops that make up the main texture and the simple synths that underlay the quiet section are pure Daft Punk. Make something extremely complex sound very simple.

Then in science class we collected evidence and matched it with the three suspects. It was really fun and in the end we found out the jury's verdict.

My only peave is that it doesn't include any reference to or excerpt from the novel Breath, by Tim WintonBreath: A Novel, which I think is a seminal piece of surf fiction and and fun read to boot.

I had a hard time getting into the book and staying interested in it. It took me over a week to read and finish the novel, which is a rarity for me. It's not like the characters of Jordan, Annie, and Tom were bad and not likeable but it was just lacking something. The backdrop of youth in the era of hippies and the Vietnam war are interesting and is kind of like what the world is experiencing again at this moment.So even though \\"Special Relationship\\" is not my favorite Robyn Sisman novel, it's still worth reading if you've read and enjoyed any of her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brit's take on American history in the 90s...","review":"The heart of this novel had the potential to give readers a great story and several hours of entertainment.

For me, all it did was remind me of a not-too-proud era of American history and that's not really something I care to remember when I'm just trying to kill some time with a good book.I liked the flashback to Oxford in the 70s, where we were shown \\"firsthand\\" accounts of our main characters. It did prove to make them more sympathetic. But, the pacing of the story was terrible and the resolutions to the conflicts laid out in this story were subpar, at best.I'm usually a big fan of Sisman's work, but this does not get my stamp of approval.

The only problem I have found is the program not reading the mouse after using the tablet, along with minor lags. I find this a minor inconvenience, well worth the price, and great if it is your first tablet. It takes around 2 or 3 days to master it, and after a week you'll be zipping around your art with your tablet.

This is a case of getting what you pay for. The patches didn't turn black they were brownish not unlike apple cider vinegar, which they smell of.I bought 3 packs (one for myself and each of my sisters). My sisters have never used patches or any detoxification and the patches still were light brown not black. It didn't work on any swelling or leg pain for any of us.

Having first used Hitachi's jigsaw hardiblades (Hitachi 725397 4-Inch 6 TPI Jig Saw Blades For Fiber Cement Siding - 3 Pack), I found this blade to be so much easier and efficient that I was completely delighted.

Noticed right away that it slings less dust and it lasts for a loooong time. I made quite a few long rips with it and it cut very easily.Do I think these blades are worth the very high price?

Nope.It's a good blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"I won't be quite as scathing as the previous reviewer, but I can't recommend TIME NO LONGER either.

Eric leaves behind a number of African artifacts brought back from a recent trip-including a shrunken head, and what just might be...a voodoo doll. Karl, wishing to avenge Eric's death, takes up these artifacts to use them against Kurt.I have to admit that after such a truly bizarre beginning, I thought the book might turn out to be a guilty pleasure. But, no such luck. After the over-the-top melodrama at the beginning of the book, the story immediately drops away, and Caldwell launches into a dull, dull diatribe on the loss of innocence or something.

From the heavy grunge of Territorial Pissing to the slow, almost dirge-like Something in the Way, Kurt Cobain's fantastic lyrics and the band's awesome musical prowess shine through.This is, arguably, the greatest album of all time and which everyone should have heard.The album's true greatness is illustrated by the fact tthat neither before nor since has the grunge scene captivated so many people and that this scene died with Kurt Cobain in 1994.Believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"I dont like Nirvana.

A new sound for a new decade, Nirvana and other grunge groups put an end to the popularity of the 80s pop/metal movement. While, Nirvana is an alright band, but I don't consider Kurt Cobain the musical genious that many people claim he his. Kurt wrote some really good songs, but Nevermind isn't really a masterpiece by any means. Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Come as You Are are very good songs, and Nevermind is an enjoyable listen every once in awhile, many of the songs don't leave a lasting impression.

It destroyed a musical generation and rose from the ashes of it. I listened to Gouge Away by the Pixies and although it is a good song It sounds very little like Nirvana. Just the vocal sounding.

Who else could sing about \\"Had to eat my dinner there, mashed potatoes and stuff like that, couldn't chew my meat so good\\"....and get away with it! I mean c-mon, the man was brillant and unfortunately his life was ended way to soon! There will NEVER be another ~KURT COBAIN~ or ~NIRVANA~!!! Rock on Kurt!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated.","review":"Sure, it has a few good catches to it, but even the best songs are very boring after the first few listens. What makes it so very unenjoyable to me, however, is that there is no proof why Kurt is put on guitar magizines and classified with very talented guitarists such as Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, Gilmour, Hendrix, pre-non-heroin Clapton. Sorry..., I just don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"The one good thing about Nirvana and the grunge movement is it got rid of drum-machines and over-produced music. Here you've got gritty drums and guitar. But the sound--aside from its more natural feel than Billy Ocean type crap--is monotonous, and has no \\"charisma\\" or personality to it. Every song sounds the same. And Cobain's lyrics are nothing special. That Nirvana should be considered the great band of the 90's shows how little the 90's has had to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!!!","review":"This is cool this is cool this is cool this is cool this is cool.

Is this even a question? Ive talked to many people about music, and Nirvana's Nevermind always comes up as one of their favorite albums if not their favorie album. The cd's a classic. It outsold michael jackson. It's simply a must have. Its the best rock album of 90s and possibly the best album ever made. Almost all of the songs on the album are played on the radio everyday. There is not one person I have met who does not like this album. This is seriously not a debatable topic. Ask anyone in the world. Its black and white. Nevermind is one of the best albums ever made and you must buy it now. Its powerful grunge, its powerful vocals, its a humongous powerful sound. There is not one bad song on this cd. Let's face the facts: buy it buy it buy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY CAN'T I GIVE IT 10 STARS","review":"the main point of this review is to tell you lovely people that this album - Nevermind by Nirvana, is the greatest album that has ever been produced and that ever will be produced. All this talk of how Pearl Jam's Ten is a better record is absolutely rubbish. Don't get me wrong, 'Ten' IS a great album, but is nothing compared to the pure brilliance of Kurt Cobain (R.I.P.), Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic. Of course most people will note 'Teen Spirit' as the stand-out track, but I beg to differ. As good as 'Teen Spirit' is - I beleive 'Something In The Way' to be a more revealing song. It talks of Kurt's supposed time living under a bridge in Aberdeen, Washington and is a genuinly moving song. This group of three - Kurt Cobain (greatest musician ever), Dave Grohl (greatest drummer ever) and Krist Novoselic (greatest unrecognised hero ever), have produced an album of pure intensity and passion that in my mind - and hopefully in many other minds, is the greatest album EVER !"},{"rating":"2","title":"for BlankaVerde77","review":"Kurt Cobain is a punk because he has a K records tatoo on his arm???

Almost every song has the same chords, just played at a different speed or octave. \\"Come As You Are\\" is by far the most overrated song ever. The lyrics are incoherent, but I will admit they are cool. \\"It's okay to eat the fish/ they don't have feelings.\\"(Something in the Way) This album did ruin rock, inspiring Nu-Metal and all that garbage we hear on the radio and MTV today. But, Nirvana did pave the way for the other \\"grunge\\"(I hate that word) bands that actually had some talent to get big, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam(Kind of).

If it wasnt for Nirvana and \\"Nevermind\\" we would still be listening to 80's crap. Kurt Cobain was the most creative song writer in music history. He ranks right next to John Lennon. Kurt was a genius, and his death was really a tragedy because the world has lost a lot of powerful music. One word: IINCREDIBLE"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD WROTE 90's rock","review":"This album was one that guaranteed that the 90's would not suck. The four bands that shaped 90's rock are Nirvana,Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, and Rage Against the Machine. This album could easily be the best one of this decade. While Kurt is not the world's flashiest guitar player, he developed his own style of sound and music, and influenced God-knows-how-many bands today. It was this album that defined 90's rock & roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing that ever happened to music","review":"This cd is the best cd for teens from 12-25 or higher this is the best cd i own and i own thousands of cd's if your going to get a cd get this one you cant beat the songs like smells like teen spirit,come as you are,lithium etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Foundation of Grunge","review":"Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, has been the defining moment for the grunge movement. Kurt Cobain shares his views of angst and frustration, while the other band members provide a heavy background for his message. It's not a happy message, but I feel that many listeners will be able to relate to it. If you want an album that addresses relevant issues, along with a hard-rockin' backdrop, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Alt Rock","review":"This album is such a listening experience that any fan of rock should love it. Nirvana combined the melody and talent of classic rock artists like Led Zepplin and Cheap Trick with the energy and emotion of punk acts like Black Flag and the Ramones. In short they created the modern alternative sound. I think that the only other Nirvana album this good is \\"In Utero\\", but I would heartily recommend that you at least listen to all of Nirvna's recordings. Even though Nirvana is my favorite band, I'm not simply hyping them up. Real talent and emotion deserve credit. So rock fans, if don't already own this, buy it!! Non-rockers, you might want to check this out as well, you may indeed enjoy it. Also check out Smashing Pumpkins,Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden for some more great alternative rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A victim of The Loudness War (remastered album)","review":"The original CD release sounds A LOT better than the remastered version (more dynamic) .The remastered CD is over-compressed to the point where there's clipping all over the place.Dave Grohl's drums sound flat and lifeless now.

The only thing that pisses me off about this album is that it's to short. I remember when I first got this album, it's all I listened to for months. The songs never grow old. I have to say this, and I said it on the Pearl Jam review sight; STOP comparing Nirvana and Pearl Jam!! They are completely different bands that happen to be from the same place. They are both great bands, but are both unfairly placed in competion with each other by the media and some of you people buy into this. It's unfair to Nirvana to compare them to Pearl Jam and vice versa. If you want to hear the album that changed, and still is changing the face of rock and roll, go buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest album ever. Period.","review":"If you're even remotely interested in Nirvana this is the album for you. This isn't their first album, however; \\"Bleach\\" is (another great album). But I suggest you try \\"Nevermind \\" first, as a way of growing to appreciate one of the greatest bands the world has ever seen. Every song on the album is excellent and they vary in style, a characteristic you'll find that seperates Nirvana from other bands. Now I'll admit, I may have a bias viewpoint. I own 15+ Nirvana albums and love every song Kurt ever wrote. But WOW!, what a band they were.

He put it on and, about 10 seconds into Smells Like Teen Spirit, literally everyone in the bar went nuts! I never saw so many people react that fast to a song.

Nevermind has frozen music for the past twelve years. The music industry is stagnant. It ain't going anywhere. That is THE sign that we need something fresh. Everything that comes out nowadays is hawked as \\"alternative rock\\" when it's as disgustingly popular and manufactured as Backstreet Boys pop. So-called \\"alt. rock\\" isn't alternative when it's the norm. Every kid on the block wishes they were lonely and alienated because that's how MTV tells them to feel. So what's the first step they do after listening to MTV's brainwashing? They go to Tower Records and buy Nirvana's Nevermind on CD for $20. Kurt didn't start a revolution, he started a mass pollution of purposely poorly-produced hate rock.Here's some folksy rock & country albums I recommend instead:Willie Nelson: The Demo SessionsRobert Clyne & the Peacemakers: Honky Tonk UnionMelissa Etheridge: Yes I amThe Refreshments: The Bottle & Horses"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Liberal Propoaganda","review":"I have never seen such a display of vulgar Liberal Jiberal entertainment.

Its Nirvana and if you don't listen to them you don't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible music from a terrible band..","review":"You know, for as much hype as Nirvana gets, they really did write some mediocre music. They get remembered as \\"legends\\" for inventing trash called grunge and simply because Cobain killed himself like the martyr that he thought he was. I am not reviewing \\"Nevermind\\" specifically but I am moreover reviewing all of Nirvana's music, since this album is no less and no more garbage than the other 2 albums.This music completely lacks in depth, substance and any musical talent. The musicianship is extremely mediocre and childish and the songwriting is certainly no better. Isn't it wonderful that this kind of music burst onto the scene in the early 90's and displaced classic rock?Drop this music (not just Nevermind) but all of Nirvana and enlighten yourself with real music like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Yes and Queen. Cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, maybe not a 'classic'","review":"Like many others, this was the first Nirvana album i heard and bought. Many people say this album shaped the music industry forever. I can agree to that, the songs are just really damn catchy. They DO have meaning to them(lyrically), but not so much as maybe In Utero or some of the earlier works.But my main point is, this isn't what Nirvana was and only was. A lot of people tend to forgot or they don't even know this. Kurt himself thought that this album was pretty polished up. Compared to their 600$ recording of 'Bleach', I say that it was polished.In conclusion, this is a great album; however it's not as raw in sound as 'Bleach', down to earth lyrically as 'In Utero', nor is it as versatile in both lyric writing and song writing in general as 'Insectecide.' Take your pick, i took all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good...","review":"But personally, I didn't like this album as a whole. Yes, it's a NIRVANA album, probably one of their best records ever made. But I listened to it for what it is without thinking about Kurt Kobain or the hype that the band got, which you have to admit would've been non-existent if it weren't for him. At the end, all i got was a mediocre rock record. Apparently, it spoke for a certain time and place in teen culture not too long ago, but it didn't speak for me. Also, Kurt Kobain's image also empowered the message of this album. The only song I liked on it was Smells Like Teen Spirit, while the rest to me either sounded the same, or just didn't have the same affect as SLTS. Sorry, I understand the big hype and praise for Nirvana, but not their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed the face of music...","review":"Rememeber back when having a hit actually took musical talent?

The \\"remastering\\" is horrendous! Terrible clipping, distortion all over the place. If you want an easy test just purchase the MP3 versions of Lithium off the remastered edition and the original single album. Vocals are distorted, percussion is muted by overboosted guitar and bass. Give me a break! There is next to no dynamic range and compression distortion everywhere. Read the other reviews, this is noticeable even with modest listening equipment. Skip the remastered and get the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobain needed to dress like the rich snob he was living as","review":"Nirvana's Nevermind is total bullsh*t. I can respect Bleach and Incesticide because the songs off those albums were recorded when the band actually were dirt-poor and somewhat genuine, but when Nevermind made Kurt richer than he'll ever be in all of his future lives combined, he really needed to start dressing like the rich snob he was living as. It's an insult to poverty-stricken people and fans alike when a multi-millionaire like Cobain purposely tried to publicly hide how much of a spoiled brat he was. He only let his closest drug dealers see that side of him. Kurt should've turned all that heroin money from Geffen down. Yes, folks, Cobain was the ultimate tool. When Cobain acted like he had no reason to live after he'd gotten millions of dollars from singing about how he wanted to die, it never did tug on my heartstrings like it does all hoodie-wearing preteens. He had it better than any of us will know. Boo-hoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nirvana hid behind a wall of gloss because they blew","review":"\\"Nevermind\\" is one of the biggest cop-out excuses for an album ever. You'd think that a band with such a slick record could replicate that sound onstage. Or come close to it. But as many of us would-be Nirvana fans found out when we bought \\"Muddy Banks,\\" this band blew live. I'm sorry, but Nirvana never could match the cut-and-paste studio job that Butch Vig did for them. Nirvana's Nevermind is just as overproduced as anything from Janet Jackson, Guns & Roses, and Poison. But at least those three bands used the studio gloss to enhance what talent they already had. Nirvana just used that wall of gloss to hide behind and cover up the fact that they couldn't sing or play their instruments. Go buy a super-glossed album from a band that can play and sing.

Any of you Nirvana fans should really open your eyes to other great and talented bands out there i.e. Zeppelin, Whitesnake, Hendrix, OZZY, Guns 'N f**king Roses, Van Halen!!!

The people who wrote the other reviews dont know what their talking about. Good music,mabie not as good as JIMMI, but u cant expect everyone to be perfect and live up to his guitarist standers."},{"rating":"1","title":"All myth and no substance","review":"To the teenager going through her stage of obsession with Nirvana and Kurt Cobain: It won't last, kid. All of us (myself included) went through that stage. When Muddy Banks was released it made me realize this band was a total mess. They couldn't play worth sh*t live. For some strange reason, Unplugged is the exception to that rule, but still, respecting Nirvana truly is a waste of admiration. Kurt hated his fans, and his live music shows. I guess he loved MTV though. His Unplugged show was quite listenable. The MTV execs scored him some black tar before the show started, so I supposed he felt an obligation to put on a good show for the network that undeservedly made him a superstar.Nirvana were a band of myth and no substance. But substance abuse was a different story. They had tons of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I\`ve evere heard!","review":"This CD is just awesome! Every single song is complete. I promise you I\`ve never heard a better album in my whole life. Kurt Cobains voice is so powerful and emotional that it almost hurts listening to it, and the other guys, Dave and Krist are very gifted too. Dave is crazy on the drums, and Krist...Yes that guy know how to play bass. Kurt are also a great guitarplayer and songwriter. The songs are rough, but they\`ve all got melody. Buy this one! You won\`t regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just... stupid","review":"I don't see whats so good about Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was a very amateur guitar player, and he set the standards for modern rock guitarists lack of talent today (80% power chords, rarely any solos). Dave Grohl was a good drummer, but he was very very overrated. John Bonhom from Zep would kick his buttox anyday. Their bass player was good yet very boring, he wasn't an exceptionally skilled bass player like Flea from RHCP or Mike Dirnt from GD. Their lyrics were meant to make you feel \\"depressed\\", but I think they were just stupid. \\"I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb\\" I mean come on Kurt, we get the point already. \\"Hello hello hello how low?\\" WTF is this guy smoking? How can you call that good lyrics. Okay, some of his stuff is a little funny and clever like in Lithium, but overall its mostly stupid. I think these guys are only legendary now because Kurt killed himself. I didn't think they were anything good then, and I dont think their good now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm just not feelin it...","review":"I honestly don't know what is so good about these guys. I can't relate to any of the lyrics because none of them seem to make sense to me. Kurt Cobain seems like he was just some drugged up dude who thought he was still a teenager and was angry at the world... real inspirational. The only half decent songs on here are Smells Like Teen Spirit and Lithium, because they are a little infectious."},{"rating":"2","title":"NiRvAnA","review":"If Kurt Cobain was still alive today or by some way he came back he would have hated seeing all these people still talking about him. He commited suicide for a reason, to end it. Dont get me wrong i love Nirvana but, Dont keep talking about Kurt as if he was still here. It brings me back to an interview somebody had with Grohl, He said he wasnt going to sit around and mope about what could have been with Nirvana. He moved on why cant we?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"A punk platter bashed out and produced to echo-ey, fuzz-box glory by Butch Vig. Either their \\"sell out\\" or their \\"masterpiece\\" depending on your view of things. There are not many CDs worthy of 5 stars. This and In Utero are two CDs well deserving of that ranking.Song for song, the best experience you can ask for. I've had this album since 1994 (when I was turned on to it from In Utero), and I'm still finding new things in the mix. I never realized the \\"hospital sounds\\" in Drain You, for instance.Any record that has one side composed of tunes like Smells Like, In Bloom, Come as You Are, Lithium, Polly and Breed (not necc. that order) is a cut above the morose junk on the airwaves.This ate both Michael Jackson and Metallica for breakfast when it exploded from nowhere in '91. It left behind a wake of snarl and wreckage that still hasn't been met face to face.Try to find \\"Endless, Nameless\\" if you can.

IT'S A WINNER","review":"This cd absolutely, 100% lives up to it's hype.Not only does it have a collection of great, dynamic, and energetic songs but, it also was pivotal in it's release.Just as \\"Never Mind the Bollock's, Here's the Sex Pistols\\" did in the 1970's, \\"Nevermind\\" did for the 1990's.This changed the landscape of music.\\"Nevermind\\" is essential listening in the history of rock and roll.Cobain killing himself even made the work that much more monumental."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remastering is so disappointing","review":"I love loud and noisy music. I love Nirvana - all of their albums, including Nevermind. But seriously, they boosted the volume so much on this remaster (and compressed the dynamic range - quiet parts are not quiet AT ALL) that it's taxing to listen to this version. I'm about 95% sure that they pushed it so high that there is distortion that was never in the original recordings.You might be thinking \\"this is grunge, it's supposed to be loud\\" - that's what I thought when I saw the early reviews. Seriously, it sounds like crap this way, it's ridiculous. The only redeeming quality about this is the newly released material. (It still doesn't sound great but some of it I had never heard before.) Overall I say find an original Nevermind used and buy \\"Incesticide\\" if you haven't heard it and revel in the glory that is Nirvana - because this remaster really doesn't do them justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Released in late 1991, Nirvana's Nevermind created the grunge music scene and screamed truth in \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", which became the anthem for our generation. A new sound exploding from Seattle, they were among the company of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains who made grunge popular. The songs of Nevermind are classics, songs like \\"Lithium\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", and \\"In Bloom\\" are all landmark songs still played on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is of legendary status, GET IT!","review":"How a band can bring together such an even array of fantastic rock/grunge songs I will never know but Nirvana did it and that is exactly why this album took the rock industry by storm.

Raw power, great lyrics by Cobain, and amazing musicianship Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl make this the most amazing album I have ever heard. Being too young to have been a fan when this album was realesed, it was clearly the first Nirvana album that I should have bought. Every song without exception is a hit on its own. The album's songs range in emotion over the entire spectrum. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is an excellent up-beat and fun song which transends to the youth of any generation, while \\"Something In the Way\\" is heart-felt and sad. My whole life I have been subject to all kinds of music and this single album is greatest one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE greatest CD ever, or at least of the decade","review":"Wow.

Sure, they were good in the past but come on people, if they were a new band now they would [stink]. I hate people in my age group that just love Nirvana and old bands like them. Nevermind was their best one which was made in 1991. Nobody gives credit for Rage Against the Machine's first album that was harder than Nevermind and was only made 1 year later! And almost all the songs on that album are still great by today's standards!

It doesn't take a brilliant songwriter to put on a flannel shirt and mumble incoherently over a bunch of distorted guitar noise! I'm sure this stuff sounded cool to a 12 year old kid in 1992, but once you get past puberty, Nirvana just becomes a faded memory! Nirvana had no talent and was just a passing fad, much like Hanson or the Spice Girls!Come on Nirvana fans, its time to move on!

Rage against the machine now there's a good band. Zach de la rocha is one if not the best musician i have ever heard. sure the rest of the band isnt that special but they fit in perfectly. the only person i like in nirvana is david grohl because the foo fighters are pretty good. listen it's fine if you like nirvana, a lot of my friends like nirvana i just hate them.

This album contains some of the most unforgettable songs in the 90s, like the classic \\"Smells like teen spirit\\", the great\\"In bloom\\", the genial\\" Come as you are\\", and the bizarre \\"Lithium\\", but there are others pieces that entered in the Nirvana's trademark, like the sad \\"Something in the way\\", the desperate \\"Territorial pissings\\", the acoustic \\"Polly\\", the pop-ish \\"on a plain\\" and the angry \\"Breed\\". Then there are others underrated songs that, in my opinion, are different but superb too. The best, in my opinion, is \\"Lounge act\\", but there are also \\"Stay away\\" and \\"Drain you\\".

I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

In order to be Punk, one must have something beneficial worth getting across to the masses. Kurt Cobain telling the world lies didn't benefit anyone. Lying through your teeth is not Punk. Shooting up H every 30 minutes is not Punk. Hating your fans just because they love you is not Punk. Literally blowing your own mind to pieces is not Punk. Enduring life through all the hardship and daily bullsh*t is Punk. Dealing with your own mental illnesses is Punk. Helping your fellow human being is Punk. And, according to John Lydon, erradicating lonliness is Punk. Kurt Cobain never expressed himself in a Punk way, or helped anyone like a real Punk would reach out and do. Punk was never about nihlism and self-loathing. It is a celebration of all the sh*t in life you've waded through to make it to one more family gathering or whatever else makes your life worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooorrrrrrriiiiiiiinnnnnnnngggggg!","review":"Nevermind's phenominal success was a fluke; Nirvana just hit at the right time.

After the obligatory guitar solo, I switched to the next track on the CD because all Cobain does after it is lazily repeat the chorus ten more times. If Cobain didn't have that slight stubble and those baby-faced good looks, you'd all have forgotten about him by now. We all know he felt guilty about how he wasn't exactly ugly. Admit it.

This album has many great songs, including Smells like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Come as You Are, and Breed (which is underrated in my opinion). In Utero is Nirvana's (and Kurt's) masterpiece, but this is still good. Those trashing Cobain are mistaken, but those who act like this album is the Gen X equivalent of Sgt. Pepper are sadly mistaken. So, chill out on this thread, and realise that Kurt was a great artist and musician and should be respected, but he isn't akin to God (and he would probably have said that himself)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best punk/pop/metal album of the 90's","review":"There is no fat on this album. Every single song is memorable. Kurt an Co. did a magical job of bridging punk edginess, frustration, anger, pain, and passion with catchy hooks and melodies. Don't resent the band for becoming famous or \\"mainstream\\". We saw how poorly Kurt dealt with it. Nirvana's success wasn't calculated. It was just cream rising to the top. Sometimes (rarer and rarer) music can be popular AND good. Kurt always wore his heart on his sleeve and just let things come out of him. He was fearless that way. No, he wasn't Lennon, but he was the closest thing my generation had to someone like John Lennon, in terms of being real, honest, and accessible. I can't explain Courtney though, other than to say that maybe he was a masochist and she was some kind of muse in reverse..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like Teen Spirit.....","review":"Nirvana is by far one of the most over rated bands of all time. Really after hearing how great this album was by everyone and their mother I was expecting it to be as great as a Beatles album. Finally when I heard it I had to stop the thing before I threw my cd player out a window. Sure Nirvana sounds great but the lyrics are almost childish. If you want some cd for some mindless fun go ahead and get it. \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" though is not the best song on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"in retrospecto","review":"Okay when it came out (beat \\"Bleach\\" anyway), but looking back? Look hard enough and you'll see a generic corporate rock album. It's got to be one of the most front-loaded albums of all time. Seriously, have you ever heard any songs off side B on the radio? The first six songs are the singles. Even \\"Thriller\\" mixed it up better than that. Also the fuzzed-out boy band photos - in one Kurt is giving us the bird! What a scamp! In all honesty, I change the station when one of these songs come on. I'm tired of them, and you don't get tired of classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Crappy Vocals, Crappy Guitar work, Overhyped lyrics. Rockers are entertainers not poets.

Nevermind is by far their best and most heart- felt album. Smells Like Teen Spirit is probably one of the most famous songs of all time, rivaling other rock greats such as Layla, Stairway to Heaven, and Another Brick in the Wall. You cannot call yourself a fan of Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, or even rock if you do not own this album. Please buy this album if you are not a complete r tard."},{"rating":"1","title":"this band sucks","review":"I cant understand why anyone would like this band. I know the music is good but since whne was the music important? We all know that how many solos you can cram into a song and how high your singer can sing are way more important than the music. Just look at Eddie Van Halen. Sure his music sucks ass, but who cares as long as he plays five minute solos in every single song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Band Of All Time.","review":"Thats what I begin to tell myself everyday why? why did my English teacher have to make my class review \\"landmark\\" albums of the 90's. And why was I stuck with Nirvana's Nevermind? The ironic thing is Nirvan's nevermind is not even close to a landmark album at all. Nirvana has to be one of the most overrated bands of all time. With Kurt Cobain's shrilled voice and wretched guitar skills it makes me wonder. Kurt Cobain can only play 3 cord guitar riffs which I can learn to master in under 15 minutes. Im not going to be on of those jerks and say \\"I'm happy Kurt is dead\\" because thats wrong, he is a human being and did not deserve to die. But that still doesnt give me sympathy to call this a good album. Most of the songs sound the same, and with the wretched guitar riffs it makes you wonder how stupid rolling stone is by putting Kurt Cobain 5th all time greatest guitarists."},{"rating":"1","title":"spit on me, kurt","review":"it was a warm summers day when me could pal 'Jimmy Magee threw on the new fad which something called Nirvana. It most certainly had an impact in the old folks home. Jeekers what a fright! For me it was the day that music died when Nirvana knocked off that nice boy Micheal J off the top of the album charts. A nasty wretched little album which only encourages those lazy alienated masses of people. For Aprils fools day we got it played in the old folks home over the intercome for a little petite joke. The shock of it saw off another 20. Nirvana do have a little bit of potential indeed but they really need to channel their energies more towards where their strengths lie, which is of course alt-country. On a further note the murky production which garnered much attention for being innovative was not only influenced by the Pixies, but was outright stolen off Gary Barlow's early Open Road sessions, whose delay saw it being released after Nevermind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Frenching the Bully if you want to know alienation","review":"Nirvana never embodied the sound known as \\"Grunge\\". Sure, they had the fashion down pat, but they didn't have the raw honesty that their contemporaries did. Listen to the debut album of the Gits, and when you hear Mia's lonely, introspective voice, you'll understand what it means to be shy and alienated. Nirvana's Nevermind never had the thoughtfulness and self-awareness that Frenching the Bully had. Nevermind also never had any insight or deeper meaning. Kurt Cobain just faked his way into your hearts with his whines and complaints, and y'all fell for it. It's heartbreaking that those so happy about life get their lives cut short while bottomfeeders like Kurt Cobain get everything they've never deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiresomely transgressive","review":"\\"Nevermind\\" pinches liberally from Killing Joke, a band with more than a superficial interest in the art of music, the song in question being \\"Eighties\\".Kurt Cobain spends the album doing what I can only presume to be 'guitar-tuning'; he desperately tries to play an original riff that goes beyond 4 chords but his massive lack of sophistication and musical talent prevents him from doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible !","review":"The worst album I ever purchased was 'Nevermind'. I had expected it to be excellent since Nirvana fans recommended it so highly. But I'm sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down. It is hard to listen to more than 3 songs at one go! I found the album to be monotonous & boring. The songs are very bad and the vocals are awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really crummy CD with nothing to offer","review":"I first heard \\"Nevermind\\" in 1991, and thought I had heard it all before. In retrospect, I had. This Cd offers absolutely nothing new, and just recycles old seventies-bop-rock riffs. Also, the singer mutters intelligibly. Some people find that cool, but it just shows he can't actually sing. This is probably the most over-rated Cd of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, Depressing music","review":"This is some depressing music that make me wanna commit suicide.

AVOID PLEASE AND KEEP YOUR BRAIN CELLS FRESH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd is overrated as bad as Nirvana","review":"The solo in Come As You Are is just a repeat of the main bass riff. The whole song is just a repeat of that riff. Pink Floyd in their later days were more amazing than their earlier ones; Darkside of the Moon was just their most popular album, and Rolling Stone told you to like it so you followed suit. Darkside is also one of the most overrated albums of all time along with Never Mind. Everyone seems to own it, but why don't they all love it? Personally, The Division Bell is better. The title track is one of the most sweeping, beautiful songs I've ever heard. Maybe try picking that up instead of Never Mind. Or, maybe Never Mind te Bullocks intead of Nirvana's ripp-off of the Pistols."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this CD!!!","review":"I bought this CD in hope it was good. It turns it,s crap!!!

It has about 6 killer songs that even someone that isn't a fan of nirvana can enjoy (smells like teen spirit,in bloom,come as you are, lithium, polly) and 6 other songs that probably will only be appreciated by nirvana fans. My favorites on here are \\"lithium\\", \\"something in the way\\", \\"on a plain\\", and \\"drain you\\". The only negative thing I will say about this cd is that it can be really depressing, well for me at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever!","review":"Nirvana is the best ever!

The album promoted the Grunge movement in Seattle... It features great melodies, because Kurt Cobain placed music before lyrics. It is the best selling Alternative Rock album... Is that it? I think so...Out of all honesty, why does an album like this become considered the 17th greatest album of all time (check: 500 Greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone)? It's sad that albums like this acquire, so much attention. Beggars Banquet isn't as good as this album??? OK Computer? The Dead Side of the Moon???A candid review from a Radiohead/Pink Floyd listener.Would you say I'm too harsh musicially?

Kurt Cobain was druggie with no musical talent and it shows on Nevermind. Smells like Teen Spirit is a very boring song and is only entertaining the first few times you listin to it(same with the rest of the songs). I don't understand why Nirvana was and is, so popular.

The music, the band, the person or the generation X? Who knows? Now, what we've got here is fabulous, entertaining and exhausting. It takes my breathe away! The sound is incredible, the record nothing but perfect. Krist did a great job on this album, the rest of the band is good but Kurt? Kurt sang perfect. He touches you in the heart with his incredible voice. It seems this album can manipulate you. Me personaly, I would do nothing but buy more copies of this album right now considering I already own one. I regret nothing but it wasn't me on the stage performing Nevermind instead of Kurt Cobain.

It still sounds as fresh now as it did back in 91'. Sure there is alot of hype surrounding this album, but it more then lives up to it. This, for me, is as close to perfection you can get.

This is at the core of Nirvanas legacy . They made it acceptable ..and fashionable to be mediocre. The music industry finds itself in a bit of a quandry these days . Why ? Because no one knows how to play beyond the beginner level . Why ? Because the critics can't cope with anything too complex .

I was a junior in high school when this album came out, and it blew me away. I am certain there have been and will be more tallented musicians than Cobain. Certainly many have proven to be more mentally stable. However, this album just plain rocks. If you want to drive down the road, screaming lyrics and listening to raging guitar licks after a long, frustrating day of work, this album suits the purpose as well as any.

OK, if you are looking for advice this is a very good album for anyone who wants an introduction to grunge or who likes rock with a more raw sound.The real reason I'm posting this review is in response to a review by LouisLoius88 entitled \\"This is not really a review of the album.\\" It's brilliant, you see, because he has read a review by Avril_Lavigne#1fan called \\"A legend.\\" This is a clearly toungue in cheek review and LL88 has attacked the writer as if it were real! Superb! Sorry LL88, but I do suggest you read the rest of Avril_Lavigne#1fan's reviews, you'll probably enjoy them a lot more.

However, Nirvana was one of the most influential bands of the 90's, if not the most influential, and this album was their key to success."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-time Classic - An Unparalleled Musical Rarity","review":"As a devout fan of sound in general, I have heard many types of music. I have heard many wonderful compositions from many talented and inspiring artists. I can honestly say, that this collection of relatively simple compositions speaks to me and moves me in a way that many wonderful artists have not been able. This music bleeds spirit, people. It seems to speak of a primal feeling that I'm sure everyone has experienced at one point in their life. It's the feeling of growing up, of change, and of the spiritual passage that everyone must go through. If what I'm saying isn't absolutely clear to you, then do yourself a favor and invest some time in this album. Listen to Kurdt Cobain pour his guts out to you, to expose his own spirit, to share with you his own spiritual passage. This album is genius. This isn't some fancy, calculated art rock.

If you like punk, \\"Come As You Are,\\" but if you prefer heavy metal, \\"Stay Away\\" because Nirvana doesn't want your business. \\"Drain You,\\" track 6, has extreme energy; much like \\"Aneurysm\\" (heard on Teen Spirit single).

I hear them on every radio station in the world and they only play 2 albums, this and InUtero. Plus I'm glad Kurt Cobain died because he didn't ever makegood music. He was always out of control the first time I heardthis album, and this and Use Your Illusion CDs from Guns N' Rosesruined rock music. This album has a few good songs like SmellsLike Teen Spirit, and Come As You Are. I think the thing withradios is that radios need to stop playing Nirvana 7 days a week.Because Nirvana sucks!!!! OVERRATED TOO. Just like AC/DC.Buy something from Dire Straits."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoopie doo","review":"i firmly beleive that the only reason peopel like this band is because they were the first to do it. because it is talentless, it really is. the guy knew 3 chords, sang like a dying chicken, and wrote stupid, pity lyrics about being dumb and having no friends. if a band like this came out now, no one would care, if anything they'd laugh at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...Nirvana didn't kill 80s hair metal","review":"Everybody keeps saying how innovative and creative Nirvana was and wrongly crediting them for \\"killing 80 hair metal\\". Well I've got some shocking news for you 80s hating Nirvana fans: NIRVANA DIDN\\"T KILL THE 80S HAIR METAL TREND!!! 80s hair metal didn't die when Nirvana released this album----80s hair metal died at midnight on January 1, 1990! Nirvana didn't release Nevermind until late 1991, almost two years after the end of the 80s. Hair metal was still around in 1990-1992, but that stuff was 90s hair metal, so you can't credit Nirvana for ending the 80s hair metal trend. That trend died all by itself at midnight on January 1st 1990. That is a full two years before Nirvana got popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Band in Rock History","review":"Thanks Kurt, for doing yourself in and sparing us from enduring album after album of this drivel. I guess all it takes to be a groundbreaking revolutionary band these days is to sing comotose behind a microphone, going off on rants about teen angst, rape and suicide. I guess you weren't completely worthless, if there was anybody who could take moaning, groaning and screaming to a new level, it was you.Somehow you managed to fool legion after legion of critics into thinking Nirvana was a sublime and trancendent experience, but I wasn't fooled in the least. Thank God the early 90s are over, the faster you fade away, the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"And WHY did i buy this CD?","review":"i have to wholeheartedly agree with those who question the 5-star ratings for this CD. This cd went in and out of the charts like the bullet that permeated Kurt Cobain's brain. Forgotten, collecting dust of the shelves of countless 20-somethings who bought it (or begged mom to buy it for them).The only lasting legacy that Curt Cobain has left on me is his annoying, disease-ridden ex-wife.

If Kurt Cobain hadnt of commited suicide he would be a nobody right now! the only reason he is remembered is because he is a loser who killed himself! he is just an ordinary man who has no talent, just because kurt cobain can scream and whine into a microphone doesnt make him special!

Apparently the man called butch vig was smoking left over feta cheese or something, it sounds like a window pane being cleaned. And how about that smells like beer nuts song or whatever it is, that can't be easily marketed, must have been a doosy of a release party. I think there's like two notes in the whole song. I suppose that's all kids need these days to bob their heads to, one for up, two for down. Up, down, up, down, hellow, hellow, (inaudible sandwich chewing), i'm mufasa, it's less flavorous, we're nirvana, end the hat dance, and then he says something about \\"i'm done flossing\\".

This is one of the worst records ever recorded. Kurt Cobain has the skill of a beginning guitar player, most of which have more. I could play this whole album after playing guitar for a month. I figured out Smells Like Teen Spirit the first couple of minutes I held a guitar in my hands. He sounds like he's dying on these indecipherable and illogical lyrics. If I want to hear somebody scream, I can always pull out my Morbid Angel, and listen to David Vincent scream over Trey Azagtoth's crushing talented guitar riffs.

It isn't worth your time or money. Kurt Cobain's depressing lyrics and rackety guitar playing gives you a headache after the very first song.

Kurt's lead guitar for songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\" are often the first songs people learn on the guitar. That is how easy and talentless they are.

So was Grunge: It was just an excuse to sound like crap. Nirvana, along with their other so-called \\"Alternative\\" brethren were Arena Rockers; the only difference between them and Bon Jovi was that Nirvana never washed their hair. Kurt Cobain was in such denial about everything. He refused to admit he was an unfit junkie parent, and he also refused to admit he was mainstream. Cobain never had any message; he just randomly mumbled words slurred together. Fans just wish the lyrics could pertained to their own lives.Here are some better, equally-polished albums from bands that just as good live as they are in the studio (unlike Nirvana)...Smashing Pumpkins: Mellon Collie & the Infinite SadnessThe Offspring: SmashGreen Day Nimrod"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAH! 5 STARS JUS TO GET YOUR ATTENTION!","review":"HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO UNDERSTAND ANY SONG COMPOSED BY KURT COBAIN?

The only problem I have with Nirvana is the fact that they didn't age well. Please god, all radio stations stop playing Nirvana!!! When I first listened to Nevermind Kurt Kobain's voice sounded good but now, ten years later it sounds like a dying animal. I'm still a 90's rock fan (Alice in Chains, Candlebox, Stp, Tool) but Nirvana simply did not age like a fine wine like these other bands did. I'm not saying they weren't good but please in the 21st century NO MORE NIRVANA!!! by the way the one star rating was just to get your attention, this cd obviously doesn't deserve anyting less than 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beatles?

The proliferation of classic rock on the radio and twentysomethings at Eagles reunion tour and Steve Miller Band concerts owes itself to the disillusionment with modern music that such suicidal, self-indulgent wailing as is found on this album is bound to inspire.

Although I am not a Gen X-er (and I really wish I was older so that I could remember 1991!), I can say that Nirvana revolutionized the world of music. There was no music quite like Nirvana's and there never will be. When Kurt Cobain sings, you can hear his pain, passion, and anger. Also, his lyrics are poignant and thought provoking. They are full of complex messages and political and social commentary, full of contradictions Kurt was easily the best songwriter that ever lived. Whoever says the lyrics are whiny or some crap like that is seriously ill.There are so many things about Nirvana to praise, but I could not fit them in one review. Words just can't describe how great Nirvana is. And when Kurt Cobain died, a generation died, the music died, and a little bit of everyone died.

The songs are Kurts best. 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and 'Lithium' have become anthems to all Nirvana fans. 'Polly' is a very well-written song along with 'Come As You Are' and loads of others.

So everyone on these reviews that somehow thinks MTV is force feeding us rock like Nirvana is smokin weed because last time I checked I didn't see ANY band even like Nirvana on MTV. Yeah, MTV did ruin rock but they didn't do it by playing Nirvana. And what's with everyone saying Nirvana was hate rock? Isn't all rock rebillious and hating some people for some reason? I want somebody to name a rock band that's never used the word hate or implied hate. So if you have no idea what your talking about then I wouldn't talk about Nirvana like it was the worst rock band ever and it influenced \\"hate rock.\\" Anyways for all of you that do know what your talking about Nevermind is one of the best CD's to ever come out, period.

This is a good starting point, but to really understand Cobain's art, check out \\"In Utero\\" with all of its virulent guitar sounds and sheets of white noise juxtaposed against beautiful pop melodies. \\"Bleach\\" is also a killer record--more on the poppier side of things, but great nonetheless. While most of the first half of \\"Nevermind\\" was chock with hits, the second half is even better. Songs like \\"Territorial Pissings\\" and \\"Drain You\\" are just as effective as \\"Come As You Are\\" or \\"Lithium.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic album","review":"Nevermind by Nirvana is a true classic album. Some say it's overrated, but it's not.

Get over it folks, it's mediocre at best. Go listen to Appetite for Destruction and stop taking yourselves so damn seriously. \\"But Nirvana killed the hairbands!\\" so what? They also opened the floodgates for a whole stack of crummy mid 90s bands who have been thankfully long forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated bands, and albums!","review":"This band could not possibly be more overrated. Kurt's vocals are nothing special, and all these songs sound ridiculously similar. It is very rare for me to not like a rock/alternative band from the 90's, but I hate this. The songwriting is extremely simple and bad. Look at the band \\"Barenaked Ladies\\". Their lyrics are very talented and sophisticated, then take a look at these ones. I am only giving this 2 stars because the three decent tracks on here: \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Come As You Are\\". With these 3 acceptable tracks, this album leaves 9 boring, similar sounding, badly performed songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a kid, but please listen:","review":"People should stop spending their time tying bands into a certain genre and just listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobain owes his life to Love & Rockets for \\"No New Tale\\"","review":"Nirvana's biggest, most popular hit, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is a absolute rip-off of Love & Rockets song called \\"No New Tale To Tell\\". So much, in fact, that if Nirvana were sued for plagiarizing, they would undoubtedly lose the fight. I've read that a few have said that SLTS is a rip-off of the Pixies' \\"Debaser\\", but THAT rumour is just not true. The one about \\"No New Tale To Tell\\" IS infact true. Listen to \\"No New Tale to Tell\\". The guitar riff used thoughout was stolen by Kurt Cobain and used in \\"Rape Me\\" as well. As for the songs off Nevermind-- They are the epitome of what Cobain hated; glossy-sounding 80's drum reverb effects were used... the same effects Madonna and Wilson Phillips used in their 80's pop schlop. Cobain could have at least caved in and admitted he never had any punk sensibilities, but instead he lied and claimed he still had the punk rock ethos despite the fact that he gave mainstream America what it wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk when it was all the rage, and junk now","review":"My daughter stole this the other day from her mother in a group home in order to impress her boyfriend.

The thing I love most about this record is the fact that they killed the terrible hair bands and power ballads that polluted the radio at the time. The album itself is pretty much standard rock with some of the best lyrics imaginable. Unfortunately, everyone and their brother copied the sound and that pretty much soured me on \\"alternative\\" music. But, this album still stands out and will stand the test of time simply because it has so much more verve than any of the other alternative bands (except for the Meat Puppets).One thing that I dislike is the fact that many critics have called this the best of the nineties. I say that that honor goes to either Dylan's Time Out of Mind or Beck's Odelay.

It has had a profound impact on the rock music of the entire decade that no one can honestly deny and call themselves a rock fan. The first side (I have this album on tape) is one solid pack of hit songs, something that few bands can boast of. Not only where they all released and made the charts, but a decade after their release they are still played non-stop (has anyone heard 'Losing a Whole Year on the Radio' lately?).For those who violently hate the radio with a bitter passion the second side is true Nirvana with an excellent show of guitar work and what I assume are stunning lyrics ;)Of note: 'Lithium', well heck everything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people nuts?","review":"This album changed the music industry for a few years and thats it.

You just knew even greater things would come, if only for a short time. It's a shame the group as a whole was only around for a short time, but it was a great period in time for music that really shook things up and got a lot of groups after to fire up those guitars, like the equally great Foo Fighters.

By the way, part of my purpose in writing this was to get you to explore these two groups; they're worth it.

Kurt Cobain was not a tortured soul as many believe, he was a druggy who could not get his life together, did not want to be mainstream, yet he became. He killed himself to take the cowards way out, or maybe he was so high, he used his shotgun as a pipe and accidentally ignited the bullet that killed them. He was not a guitar hero, he barely played it in this album, the bass was only audiblw because Kurt could not play that well, yet the bass was boring and subpar. And the songs were written by a crack addict with inaudible singing and awful writing.The only positive thing about Nirvana was Dave Grohl, his drumming was that made the band, quick, exploding drumming.

Sure the lyrics may have been simple and written just before the songs were recorded but they are very audobiographal despite the fact that Kurt insisted they didn't mean anything. Kurt didn't want millions of screaming fans. He didn't want everyone in Seattle to hate him and call him a sellout. He just wanted to write music. This album has made my top 10 list of greatest albums ever and for good reason. Dave Grohl is an excellent drummer. He attacks the drum set in a way no one else could. Just listen to In Bloom and you'll see what I mean. Kurts thundering guitars and sarcastic screams have yet to be matched. Krist's bass on Come As You Are make the song what it is.

It's as simple as rock'n'roll can be - drums, bass, guitar and voice. But it manages to touch something deep in your soul and leaves you thinking about this record, remembering it, knowing it to the note after 13 years of listening to it.This is one of music's finest hours.

Kirrt Cawbaiyneeeie lambasted the poor guys for doing what he and his band requested, and vowed to never work with them again. Like always, Kobayne got his way, soon whined like a two-year-old once Nevermind didn't get indie recognition. Instead, it got undeserved worldwide recognition, and brought him more money than he ever deserved. Luckily, he was able to feed his drug habit with that money, and ended up with a shotgun facelift from his own doing.Egomaniacal Rock Stars.

Then in the late 90s punk was popular which gave us crap like blink 182 sum 41 good charlotte singin about how their life was so hard even tho they were rich and had everything they wanted.

If you forget the fact that this album spearheaded that massive change in pop culture by bringing grunge to the mainstream and all the subsequent effects of that what you're left with is merely a decent album. Its easy to see why Kurt Cobain came to loathe 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' its hardly his most inventive song lyrically or musically (most people know by know, and Cobain admitted that its tune its basically copped from the Pixies 'Gouge Away'). The classic riff from 'Come As You Are' is an even more blatant steal from Killing Joke's 'Eighties' and that only really leaves some good song and some average ones.Sure its anthemic, and wrought with emotion and anguish that you can really indentify with when you're a teenager and even a bit older. But thats not enough on its own really."},{"rating":"1","title":"So overhyped, it's sick","review":"Why is this even considered an essential album?

Sure Nirvana turned mainstream music around, but their sound was by no means original.Now, we hit the dirt. Nirvana was just a terrible, noisy band. That's it. Their riffs were horrible, their guitar solos frightening, Kurt's voice like nails on the chalkboard. There were so many bands during that era, most of them far ahead of Nirvana when it came to talent and songwriting, but they never got the credit they deserved.

I was a teen in the 90s, and this music didn't speak to me at all. Rock and roll was developed to be fun, not as a platform to whine about your pathetic life, and how much it [stinks] to be a millionaire. Maybe 80s hair metal had gone over the edge with bands like Guns N Roses, etc., but at least it was fun, and could make you forget about your troubles for a while.

Come on Nirvana fans, Nirvana does not stand the test of time like other early 90s groups do. They were just a fad and a flash in the pan, and sound more dated in 2006 than the Old Testament! This record is a relic, not a classic. The grunge fad came and went many, many years ago and its time for you Nirvana loving Kurt Cobain mourners to move on! Grunge is no longer relevent today.

I hated them from the start. They killed off all metal had been in the 1980's. They sang about dumb subjects like how depressed that idiotic Kurt Cobain was and teenage angst. Who the hell wants to hear about that? Besides, it started a revolution of horrible nu metal, pop punk, and alternative bands that would still be flowing today if it weren't for band like The Darkness and Andrew WK.

The music is primitive: they're about a plain 'melodie', and ther's no change in the music. Amazing guitar and drum solos? Where? A great voice with a good vocal range? Not Kurt. And they're very overrated. And they're more popular since Kurt has died. RIP, but he was not a talented musician, not a guitar-hero etc.I don't want to your take away pleasure.

Nirvana wasn't even around for 10 years. They were a fad. Let's be serious. A straight up fad. Nirvana was popular for only one song and we all know which one that is. So bash all the classic rock bands I listed, but you'll soon realize that each of them have contributed way more to rock and music in general. Don't listen to mags like Rolling stone or Spin b/c they're liars. They even put Kurt at #12 for 100 greatest guitarists. That's a joke. Kurt wasn't even good w/ guitar in the first place.

When it comes to girls anything is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"The only good thing about this book was that it was a reminder that writing this way to my own children was a good idea. Spending real time with your children in the now, raising them everyday, I feel will do just as well, if not more, to instill the values expressed by the author to his daughters. I'm sure it's a great book for his daughters, but not worth the money to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help your daughter understand why little Jimmy is so weird...","review":"Saw this at the library and had to read it: the title itself was worth the check-out. As a well-worn parent of both boys and girls I'll say that the two are different - it's hard to believe how many people tell me they're not. (Later I find that these good minded folks have either one child or none.) Yes, boys want to look up girls skirts. Boys, especially as they get older, have only one or two things on their mind when it comes to girls. This applies to pretty much every boy who has ever lived. Girls, who obviously have their own drives and interests, just don't think like this and this is where your daughters can get into trouble. This funny and very readable little book can help both parents and girls understand better what's going on with little Jimmy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream of a Book","review":"I'm a new dad of a baby girl, so even though it'll be years before my daughter's ready for it, this book caught my eye. I'm glad it did. Van Munching has written a wise, funny, eminently readable and engaging tribute to his daughters, to parenting, to the minefields of adolescence. Here's a favorite bit that seems to define the spirit of this generous book: \\"I've learned a little something about mistakes: they are the true measure of you....they are what define and teach you....and are maybe the only things in your life that are truly your own. Everyone will jump in to grab a little glory when you do something right; mistakes are yours and yours alone. The trick is how you make use of them.\\" What an important, right-on observation, and how I wish I'd had someone tell ME that when I was an awkward 15 year old boy. Though \\"Boys will Put you on a Pedestal\\" is specifically written for teenage girls, its applications transcend gender. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-nonsense advice can be fun....","review":"While this book is intended to provide teens and pre-teens with fatherly advice, it is especially useful for parents. Van Munching weaves life lessons with self-deprecation and wit into a terrific guide that encourages girls to think for themselves. I especially like the themes of integrity, accountability, empowerment and love that run through the book. It's unfair to provide kids with these gems, when it takes the rest of us 30 or more years to learn them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This a great book. I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter and read this because I wanted to be prepared to give her good practical advise when she gets older. The author expresses his feelings and thoughts very well. It reads like a casual conversation. I would recommend this book to either parent and their daughters. It's very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"old hat (*yawn*) from a boomer","review":"How many times do we have to hear how over-sexed guys are as opposed to girls? As a college student I am approached by girls (and, truth be told, guys too) right and left asking me to go out or pestering me for an e-mail address, so this concept of the guys are the only ones chasing tail is so outdated it verges on the absolutely comical; needless-to-say, this pop is looking at today's youth through the bi-focals of HIS day and age, when 'looking up someone's skirt' was one of the most titillating pastimes of the \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" generation. Sad truth is, dad, guys just don't put girls up on pedestals for ANY reason these days, seeing as sex in *high school* (not to mention college) comes fairly cheap. Sorry to burst your bubble (and no, that wasn't a sex pun), but internet porn has made LOOKING up someone's skirt BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEXIST AND UNEVOLVED","review":"As a mother of boys, the title and tone of the book are not only insulting to boys but a disservice to girls as well.I would like to think that we as a people have evolved since the days of clubbing and dragging back to the cave - Will someone please tell Mr. Van Munching that humankind is actually capable of a level of interaction where members of the opposite sex can share intellect, common interests and friendship? Or shall we just wait for his sequel: \\"Girls will get pregnant to trap boys from rich families\\".It's the year 2005 - give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Belongs on a Pedestal","review":"Concise, informative, easy to read. This is a great book for teen girls - not preachy, but gets the point across very well.

I would recommend this book to any parent of a teenage girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just in time...","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

One of the pots leaks and I've taken it apart twice to fix it. The rubber seals must not be in place right since all the parts seem to be there. The top button you push to pour is very confusing to everyone. Who expects to push a button down on a carafe and have it stay down with a click like a light switch? This produces these results in my guests:* What do I do?* They pump it like an air pot (click, click, click, ....)* They push the button down and leave it down, allowing the coffee to cool fasterNot really the best design but they look nice and are cheap. Well, I'm here on Amazon to find replacements because these are going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Gone To Seed","review":"A very disappointing film starring one of the better western actors. It is such a comedown for Richard Boone of the \\"Have Gun Will Travel\\" fame. Boone probably did this project because he needs the money or just becuase he needs to do something. The film is a pathethic and boring excuse for a western which is neither spaghetti or whatever. It is sad to see a legend like Boone to take on something trashy as this project. The blurry, fuzzy, and hazy picture quality is just as bad as the story. I don't recommend this to anyone including fans of Richard Boone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for \\"flat feet\\"","review":"This is the 3rd pair of shoes from Charles David that I've ordered from Amazon. The shoe itself is very attractive and the color very rich, however, if you have low to no arches and narrow heels--this is not the shoe for you ladies.

Our water quality is quite good but my hydrants eventually begin to weep after it is shut down. I was sold these with the assurance by the sales person that the working/moving parts could be serviced above-ground. NOT-SO. The stem was so well stuck that I was sure that I was going to break it if I pulled any harder. So I reassembled the unit and worked the handle and adjusted the tension until it finally quit leaking. That is the last time I've used either of the units. Now these exist as legacy waste on my farm and a lesson learned. Don't buy these unless you want to dig them out of the ground after 3-4 years. Bad Product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hipster Spies With His Mystic Eye, Something That Begins With--Hip","review":"A nice collection of 60s non-rock hits.Nancy Sinatra is well represented here.I long for the days of hip dudes in tuxes, slick chicks in gowns, martinis without guilt, & smoking indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Sound Quality","review":"I love Tony Martin. He is one of the greatest singers of popular music of the 20th century. Unfortunately, this album does an injustice to his musical talent. There are many reasons for that. Firstly, the selection of the songs do not reflect the real title of the album. The sound quality of the CD is very poor. Tony martin has a very rich tenor voice that comes through clearly in all of his recorded albums with the exception of this one. You can hardly hear Tony Martin's voice. It is buried by disproportional loud musical background with abnormal base sound. This album is an insult to Tony Martin voice and his music. Because this album is of such an inferior quality, it should be deleted from your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be better...","review":"A nice book that tries to take a snapshot of an historical period. The idea is somewhat good but, unfortunately, the book has no head and no tail. Moreover, there is too much sex, even for an Italian reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Musical Ever Written","review":"Passion is an excellent show. It won the Tony for best musical in 1994.One of the things that I find most fascinating about this score is the way it flows from song to dialogue and back again. Songs segue into one another without breaking flow or style. There are no set applause points, no big dance numbers, just a moving, touching story told with some of the most beautiful music ever written for the stage.If you are a Sondheim fan at all, or if you would like to own an achingly beautiful collection of love songs, this is definitely the score for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a dodger*s Bible","review":"Have you ever had that 'friend' who called 8 times a day ...and kept saying on the machine....\\"are you there? Pick up.... are you there.\\" Or someone whe keeps asking you to volunteer at their club....and you have zero spare time. You feel guilty saying \\"no\\"??? This book is funny, light hearted, and I love it. I can't believe this is out of print. There is a reviewer who says, \\"when is it o.k. to lie?\\" I politely disagree, due to the fact this author has a chapter titled....the 7 Dodging Sins. Things you should not do to dodge folks... i.e. never returning their calls. She just teaches you a crafty way to return the call. I vote- BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when is it permissible to lie through life??","review":"Lying is NOT an acceptable means for getting out of your responsibilities. This type of book adds to the free-fall of society by endorsing the notion that it's just fine to break a commitment to someone and not suffer any consequences. This is all done under the idea that as long as you're not rude about it, then it's fine. Nothing could be further from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly proofed","review":"I struggled mightily through the typographical errors in this book, and after reading it, I find it hard to believe that the book ever was edited. Normally I am not the type to fuss unduly over the odd error here and there, but I am certain that, were I to highlight all of the errors I caught in this book, a reader might be hard-pressed to discover the CORRECT words, sentences, etc. Despite all of that, the book gave a systematic overview of the conflict, from its early stirrings in 1945 to its impact today. It is generally well laid out, and the writing is concise and easy to read, excepting the glaring typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Troggs please stand up","review":"Wow. \\"Wild Thing\\" just isn't wild when you are singing it at 60 years old. I guess the remaining Troggs needed some cash. These songs are redone by some original Troggs members and it isn't all bad. The redione version of \\"Love is all around\\" is pretty close to the original. So if you are a die-hard Troggs fan, you will want to hear how they sound now. But, if you are like me and just enjoy them for a few songs stay FAR FAR away from this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quick and easy way to master Office 2003","review":"I've bought other instructional computing books, but I highly recommend the Visual line.

Great song with the segue into Shake your Body. Anyway, overall - worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooo!","review":"At long last a Jacksons compilation. However what is missing BIG TIME is the John Luongo remix of Shake your body (Down to the Ground) The original mix is boring. The 12\\" mix is exciting, and it is unfair to not haver it on this collection. What I would have done was replace the boring 8 minute unmix of shake with John's remix, replace the LP track version of Blame it on the Boogie with the 12 inch version (both NOw on the re-release of Destiny and toss in an extra track from Victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Jacksons","review":"What a collection of hits. Most of the songs on here are worth the listen. \\"Enjoy Yourself\\" is a motivator. \\"Show You the Way to Go\\" delivers enthusiasm. \\"Going Places\\" is an upbeat track for traveling. \\"Find Me a Girl\\" is a brilliant slow jam. I liked the uplifting \\"Blame it on the Boogie.\\" \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\\" gets you to dance. The instruments are used robustly in \\"Lovely One.\\" \\"This Place Hotel\\" has good guitar rhythms and horns. You'll enjoy the guitar used in the blazing \\"Can You Feel It.\\" The breakup but upbeat hit \\"Walk Right Now\\" utilized flute, keyboards and guitar. \\"State of Shock\\" was a spectacular duet with the famous Mick Jagger, head of the Rolling Stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Jacksons classics.","review":"These songs really take me back in time when i was a very young man.

I never let the hendrix comparisons phase me ever. It doesn't matter when you are listening to the incredible work of metal guitar mastering. This band was so incredible live, sadly frank moved on from this type of sound later on. when I saw him live in the 1980's he only played a few songs from this era. Which was his best sound par excellence!. I tried to see him live a few years ago but he cancelled by now he probably plays none of this material which is a mistake but that's life I guess. Still this one cements blues metal with psych metal into a superfast fingered delivery that still stuns the listener.

I have no desire to cast aspersions on Susan Lautenburg, the fine violinist featured on this recording. My 2 Star rating has nothing to do with Lautenburg or her group but everything to do with marketing and packaging. These are NOT the complete Brandenburg Concertos, no matter what the previous reviewer thinks. Concertos 2, 3, 4 & 5 are each missing 1 or 2 entire movements.Also, despite what this person says, Glenn Gould never conducted or played on any recorded version of the Brandenburgs, let alone one with poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose your Daddy?","review":"Let me know when the COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is released or don't waste my time on this nonsense.

Had I ordered the book this would have been the first and only book I sent back in disgust at the writing style. To even refer to Jane Austen and this book in the same breath is an insult to Austen. The writing is stilted, dull and frankly, written to a level of a third grader.

The storyline might have been salvaged with good editing but I think the editors did a sloppy job for White Smith. (Who uses the word \\"mellifluous\\" twice within 30 pages? Ack!) One sentence used the words \\"popped\\", \\"hopped\\" and \\"be-bopped\\" -- yes, all in one sentence. I felt like I was reading Dr. Seuss for a moment.I initially liked the author's idea for these books but there is no way I'm going to dish out cash for the other four books. It's too painful.

I expected interactive CDs, there is one in the entire k-2nd grade kit! Provides nice \\"learn to read\\" books,a workbook, and a couple of very boring audio CDs. Unfortunately, to access the instructions for each workbook session, one must turn on the audio CD, find the place you last stopped, then listen to the monotone lesson. They are so dull, my daughter tunes right out but there's no other way to get the lesson instructions.

It is similar to Ayn Rand's books in that there is an interesting story entwined around a core philosophy. Any similarity ends there, though I suspect Roark would love the Tree. I think it's ideal reading for book clubs because it forces you to think about man's role in the universe(s) and so much of the middle portion is an ideal source for discussion topics. I'm encouraging others to read it just so that I can take a few swings at ideas with which I don't agree. They are many. But there are also many fundamental ideals espoused that I've long held to be true. If you like science, read it. If you dislike science, read it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into meaning of life","review":"The author insightfully contemplates the essential meaning of human life from a scientist's point of view while rehearsing the progress of mankind through the historical record by telling the life story of one individual.

And how does his passion for the attractive female student have anything to do with the meaning of life? The best part of the book is that it makes people think or rethink many aspects of the meaning of life taken for granted. What's more, it actually does tell an interesting story, despite the obvious intention of the author to get you into the topic on the meaning of life. If you don't care about these deeper thoughts, its entertainment value is easily above many books purely devoted to entertaining. The book is not perfect though, especially near the end. The last few pages did a great job (almost) ruining an otherwise very charming story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare book - difficult to give a score","review":"This book is a rare type of book, and it's difficult to evaluate. Let's start from the negative - it's too long (3 volumes), too detailed and partially boring. Sometimes it's difficult to see forest behind the trees.But this is the real book based on real personal experience of a very extraordinary man. How many books we have like this? Almost none. In this it stands out against too many New Age books where authors write too much about construction of the Universe and too little about personal experience.If you want just to buy another New Age book to read about unity with Divine before going to sleep - leave it, it's not for you. But if you want to do something apart from just reading (to walk the path, and not just to know it) you may find here invaluable information for your own journey.

I don't know if there is a biography out on Gordon Scott, but I understand that he lived his later life as a recluse until his death.

It's clear that this particular guitar has manufacturing defects. There are holes for 4 dowels in the bridge, but only 2 holes in the body and only one dowel used period, so it looks like only 1 dowel and a lot of glue were used to hold the bridge to the body.

It really showcases Rutter's knack for religious choral music. Perhaps it helps that I have sung some of his stuff with various groups.

This contrasts with the doomed characters, who struggle against a dark fate that is as overwhelming as the landscape. Linda Manz and Brooke Adams are touching as the orphans in the storm. Sam Shephard is heartbreaking as the shy farmer (a very different figure from the capitalist villain streotype of the left-wing propaganda that Malick is sometimes accused of indulging in--he's a far deeper artist than that.) Richard Gere gives a good early performance that lacks the narcissism of his later work; here he's like a hurt kid.) Like Dreiser, Malick's tragedy is cathartic--if only people could be as beautiful in spirit as the natural world is in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malick's masterpiece","review":"Nothing can compare to seeing this film in a theater, but if the DVD looks anything like the excellent laser disc version, it is well worth owning. Visually stunning, philosophically brilliant, Malick crafted one of the true masterpieces (and one of the last) of the (in my opinion) greatest, most fecund period in film history, the seventies. He even achieves the impossible, getting an emotionally effective performance from Richard Gere, using the actor's natural lack of expression as a believable character trait, as well as an aesthetic device, rather than what it usually comes off as, contempt for the audience. Linda Manz is brilliant; unfortunately, she seems to have dropped off the face of the earth, resurfacing only for minor parts in detritus like \\"Gummo.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen BUT NOT WIDESCREEN ENOUGH!","review":"I was very disappointed when I finally began watching this DVD, which should have an aspect ration of about 2.3 to 1 and saw it was 1.85 to 1. I saw this film in the theater and know its proper width. Moreover, a picture on the back of the DVD shows a proper width frame. Especially since this is probably the most visually beautiful film ever made, cutting the visual experience just makes zero sense. Hope Criterion or somebody opts to put out the correct version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping photography and wonderful performances","review":"Days of Heaven is a winner and should be viewed and re-viewed. The photography is stunning and the lack of dialogue (at times) very effective. Although I'm not much of a Richard Gere fan, this is one film where he actually performs well. Linda Manz is at times a scene stealer (great accent, too). Combine all this with a moving soundtrack (that has long been out of print, but that I am still looking for) and you have a must see film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty and Boring (Pretty Boring)","review":"I'd like to preface my review by saying that I admire the work director Terrence Malick did in \\"Badlands\\" and for the most part in \\"The Thin Red Line\\". This film, though, really misses the mark. It seems more concerned with shots of nature and wheat fields than it is with plot or character development. But the wheat fields sure are pretty. I don't want to say that Richard Gere and Brooke Adams as the young couple on the run give bad performances because the film doesn't allow them to stretch themselves. Only Sam Shepard as the doomed farmer gives anything amounting to a multi-layered performance. See this film, if you must, for it's stunning cinematography but don't expect anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Item received in the time specified.

This \\"film\\" offered pretty scenery though often fake-looking (those barn windows!) and little else.Unforgivable was the running commentary by the young lady mouthing words in her unfathomable accent from a script written by a writer who couldn't find the voice of a world-weary child.Notably, Shepard and the minor characters do a credible acting job causing the lead characters to appear yet even more two dimensional and absent. Maybe as an incentive to keep the audience engaged, Gere is terribly cute throughout -- with his Elvis Presley pout and forelock dangling girlishly over his smooth forehead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film quality, but terrible film.","review":"I have never seen such a poorly made, absolutely boring and worthless film.

Supposed to be the texas panhandle but big mountains in the background. Showing buffalo and Antelope roaming out of context with the era and location.

I declared it my favorite movie of all time, and in the 30 years since, no film has bumped it from this ranking. And I am an avid movie goer. Not wishing to spoil the magic of the original 70mm film, I refused to watch it on DVD. Then came the Criterion re-mastered DVD, HD-TV, surround sound... so I braved a re-viewing. While I can't say I experienced the film with equal awe and splendor, it non-the-less validated it's number 1 spot. Terrence Malick is peerless as a movie maker. Every frame is a work of art. The low-key story and dialogue harmonize perfectly with the visuals. The beauty of this film will quite literally take your breath away - those over 50 should have an AED nearby. I have goosebumps just thinking about it. Come on Criterion - release it on blu-ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and mesmerizing glimpse into very private territory","review":"The director, Terrence Malick, has made few films but his stature is legendary among film buffs and industry players (for different reasons). This film, which he wrote and which is possibly his best, is one reason why so many admire Malick. Winner of a well-deserved Academy Award for Cinematography by the late, great Director of Photography Nestor Almendros (who wrote a wonderful book about cinematography, by the way, called A MAN WITH A CAMERA), DAYS OF HEAVEN does nothing so well as perfectly evoke a place and time. By the way, a previous reviewer was incorrect -- it was not the Great Depression, but pre-WWI. This is a film that does a lot with a little; and it is so beautiful and so well-told that one could turn the sound off and understand the whole story. Don't you dare, though: the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone and others (Leo Kottke, Doug Kershaw, Camille Saint-Saens...) provides perfect accompaniment to this spare and tragic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Etheral, beautiful American films","review":"This is the best version of the currently available, Nestor Almondres,'s cinematogrphic works are always a little grainy.

Why?","review":"First of all, I would like to say that Red Green is one of my favorite comedy TV shows of all time, along with Seinfield. It pains me to write a two star review about a movie with Red Green's name on it. It had some good humor thrown into certain scenes, but the comedy was mostly non-existant. The plot is actually pretty good and everything made sense, there was just not enough humor. Here's another thing I noticed, it's like this movie was made so you can spot \\"The Lucky West Virginians.\\" I live in West Virgina, and PBS really made a big deal out of it. I have a few suggestions, RENT THIS MOVIE FIRST, THEN BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT(I saw it on TV, thank god)! Also, stick with the older seasons of Red Green(anything with Bill is good) and just ignore the newer seasons since they lost all the intelligent humor they once had in the older seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god . . .","review":"Okay, I work nights for a good part of the year (tax accountant), and my local PBS station runs two episodes of Red Green every night at 10PM, and I think I've seen nearly every one of the 300 episodes, I practically lived with Steve Smith's creation. So, like you, being a fan of the show, I thought this was probably marginal and somewhat predictable, but I figured I'd show my appreciation and put a nickel in his pocket.So, having done so, I'd like to talk to all the middle aged guys out there who are fans of the show. Do not watch this DVD. Not ever. You want to give Steve a few bucks? Fine. Buy a coffee mug off his website or something.

We were pleasantly surprised and it was much better than we anticipated. Steve Smith took the characters (all of them, with the exception of Rick Green!) from the Red Green show and created a long comedy bit that actually flowed, made sense and was humorous. He pulled it off well without digressing from the original Red Green show format. Kudos to the writing. And it was good to see all the normal TV show characters involved. Others give the general plot format so I will not repeat it here. There are however maybe a half dozen places which are somewhat crude and could have been left out but that too can be said of the Red Green TV series as well. It is only for that reason that I give it a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\".

If you have any sensuality and creativity at all, you've already done these moves and don't need a dvd to tell you how. If you can get to \\"full routine 6 times\\" by searching forward (it's not under \\"tease segments\\" for some reason), start there and you can pick up the moves while skipping the long, boring instruction. The \\"isolations\\" section is a joke - bellydance moves are much sexier, more beautiful, and never cheesy. Besides the awful music, it is distracting to have SEVEN dancers to watch, especially when only the front 3 really know what they are doing anyway; it would be an improvement to have fewer. I would not recommend this dvd.

Even if you can't do all of the exercises yet, though, it's a great DVD for working up to the instructor's level. It definitely get the heart pumping.

Usually I could get it to take a sheet if I fedd it by hand, but not always, and it is quite tedious if you want to print more than one photo. Also, if the printer thinks it has paper and runs the \\"ink\\" then you waste a picture's worth and you run out of printer \\"ink\\" before you run out of paper.I THINK you can fix this problem by putting a stack of index cards under you photo paper when the cartridge gets less than 3/4 full, but since I ran out of ink and haven't replaced it yet (winkflash is much less frustrating!)I have not tested this theory.I hope Kodak is able to correct this in it's next generation of printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Not Be Sold Anymore, Can't get Drivers!!!","review":"Kodak has completely discontinued all support of Easyshare products, which include this printer dock.What that means is you cannot download the driver anymore from Kodak!!!What that means, is that if you buy this, and use the install disk, its still going to try to retrieve the driver from Kodak, who doesn't have it available anymore, so the install is going to fail, it won't install any drivers, and you can't print from this dock!!!Also, unless you have an OLD Kodak digital camera a new camera connected via the USB port on the dock WILL NOT WORK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product no longer on the market and ,and no longer kodak maked ,no tehc. support or warranty according to Kodak value is $0:00.","review":"Product no Longer manufactures, no tech support. , or warranty by Kodak, no longer on the market.ir should not be sold"},{"rating":"1","title":"Power cord and color cartridge missing...please send them!","review":"Please send other parts so I may review product/Kodak Easyshare G600 Printer Dock and this was not send in it's Kodak Company sealed box, it may have been used, parts were in this order that do not go with this Kodak G600 Printer Dock,like a TV/Video playback cable.

The paper feeding mechanism failed, so I have to force the sheets through - which is hit or miss. The \\"portable\\" feature is silly - as this is designed to work with a computer and camera.

The camera is fine, but the printer is extremely unreliable. It is extremely sensitive to the amount of paper in the tray, and the pick-up rollers that pull the sheets into the printer head very often don't pick up the paper so you have to fuss like crazy to get to work. I'd honestly say that it works about 50% of the time. The prints are OK, not super sharp (when you can get it to print). I've brought it back to Best Buy twice because I bought the extended warranty... and I've decided to return it for a store credit.

The unit is small and portable and, in my mind, easily replace the idea of using a Poloroid in the classroom to display student's picture for \\"good behavior and work\\".

The fights, romances, and frustrations of each parrot are clear and eerily similar to human relationships.The film also encourages viewers to take more notice of nature in their own surroundings, even in urban areas. Just because these parrots live in a big city, doesn't mean they aren't fascinating.The regular DVD has a lot of great extras, including over an hour of additional footage and updates.I hope it will come out in blu-ray soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful heartwarming movie","review":"If you are anything like me and love all G-d's creatures you will adore this movie.

Have patience, and about one-third of the way through its 83 minutes, this will grab you and not let you want to let it end. So the extra features, another half-hour or so of the birds, are worth seeing too. One guy starts being kind to the parrots in his neigboring trees, and in a little more than three years they become the biggest thing in his life. Then he has to move away from them and let them fend even more for themselves. This is surprisingly emotional, and the viewer comes to care for the human hero and the personable birds quite deeply.

Thus, I will comment on the caretaker of the parrots, Mark Bittner.

Then for the next five minutes, you realize that he has a gentle and open soul, and you have great sympathy for him. You continue having this whipsaw effect while around him, because he is so sweet and wants to make the world better, but he also might strike some misguided souls as inimitably directionless.So to this animal lover, the parrots and their human were equally fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for bird lovers","review":"As a conure owner, it was easy for us to see how easy it was to become owned by an entire flock.

I would recommend the DVD as an amusing gift for friends who don't have the patience for books and for skeptics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertainment; not good education.","review":"This movie went for an emotional hook, but it fell flat. I did not learn anything about parrots. There was no story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding -","review":"A great story about a group of wild parrots descended from escaped or released pets - mostly Cherry-Headed Conures native to Peru and Ecuador, now living near Coit Tower. Also 'starring' is Mark Bittner, a 'homeless' person living rent-free in the area who fed and closely observed them for six years - getting to know their personalities, mates, and youngsters. The DVD is based on Bittner's paperback written in 2004. There were 26 parrots in 1994, 50 in 1999. Viewers are likely to end up empathasizing with Bittner, but also wishing he had managed to combine his interest in the birds with a viable income - perhaps as a zoo bird keeper. (Bittner mentions that he hadn't paid rent in 27 years, and only worked at temporary jobs now and then - a loss to both himself and society.) Regardless, in 2006 he married Judy Irving, who had filmed the documentary about him and the birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring film","review":"I don't want to go into detail because it really isn't worth it. My wife and I started this with high hopes based on the number of five-star reviews, but boy, was this boring. We didn't enjoy watching this man--who was focused on more than the birds--and we gave up on the film even though we rarely do that. We're both astonished at the number of five-star reviews here--this is rated as high as the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy! We found it tedious and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill","review":"I guess if you are looking for a movie about parrots you already have a list of other problems. This movie is terribly slow, borderline boring and the music is just unbearable. I would not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad this isnt all about the birds","review":"I had such high hopes for this video. What should have been extra bonus features ended up being (and ruining) the video. Instead of focusing on the birds, it focused on an old hippie who showed how he was a bum living off of others instead of working. We also saw how and why the photographer got into her living...ok nice, but I really didnt buy this to see her life story. Again, this should have been left in the bonus features.They didnt focus on the birds hardly at all. You really didnt learn much about them. Honestly, a total waste of money unless of course you like seeing a bum shave because some photographer fell for him. Yeah, I really dont know what that had to do with the parrots of Telegraph Hill either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippie Not Kids","review":"While the birds are gorgeous, this is a hippie movie and not for kids. Monologue by protagonist (narrator and lover of the adorable parrots) whether he should bother getting a job or not and hints of drugs are not suitable for children. This movie is really only for adult bird lovers. One star as an adult film. Zero stars as a children's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't Paulie","review":"If you want to see a movie about a bird story, then watch Paulie - Paulie was wonderful parrot story. This on the other hand, glorified this person who refuses to earn a living and yet has a better life living off the kindness of others than some families that have jobs in the real world. I made it to the end of the movie but was very disappointed. I totally agree that this is not a kid's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising...","review":"I recently came to San Francisco and selected a few movies to watch that were made here.

After a minute I was engrossed.It's a super documentary. I got so much more than I was expecting. I'm marching straight up to Telegraph Hill tomorrow!When I get home, I will make this DVD a Christmas present to myself :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very special film for anyone who loves animals.","review":"I first heard about this film on Ebert and Roeper. I am a resident of the San Francisco bay area, but I had never heard about these parrots. What a story! Mark, the flock's \\"guardian,\\" has such a close relationship with these parrots and he is able to show us just how smart they are, and how each one of them is a special individual. In writing this review, it is difficult for me to articulate how the film affected me. I loved it. It doesn't matter whether you have an interest in birds or not. It is my opinion that most people will fall in love with these parrots and their stories. Some surprises at the end, too. Check out the special features on the DVD to see various updates on the flock, Mark's trip back to see Mingus, and an interesting follow-up segment from some neighborhood residents who comment about the flock and about seeing Connor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Documentary!","review":"I found this excellent film to be warm, funny, fascinating, and uplifting. Even though I live across the Bay from SF, I was unaware of the wild parrots until this film and the resulting publicity came out. For a big, sometimes impersonal city, I was thrilled to learn that someone like Mark Bittner could survive and live decently without working a traditional job, while caring for the birds and studying them. I was fascinated that he was so involved with the birds that he could tell them apart and name them all, and discovered that they all had distinct personalities. Along with being a wonderful film experience for adult viewers, this would also be a great teaching tool for children to teach them the value of the creatures around us and how anyone can make a difference. I loved that although there were some sad aspects of the film, it had a very happy ending. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat loves this movie","review":"I really enjoyed this film, but I wouldn't necessarily need to own it if it weren't for my cat, Elian. He tends to watch TV now and then anyway, but when this film was on, he was in heaven; leaping at the birds on the screen, trying to find them behind the TV, the works. When the price comes down a bit I'll get it for Elian. And I'm sure I won't mind watching it again either.

As far as adults, it can be somewhat annoying, but no more than Elmo, SpongeBob, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look out when replacing.","review":"This works good just like my previous model but did not fit as a replacement part. Looks sort of the same in the picture but is a different size and configuration and difficult to tell from description and model #. Ordered one to see if just the clear housing would fit the existing top. No match. Since I use several in a series it was obvious that the whole setup would need change. After some plumbing and piping adjustments, it is working just fine. I'm happy with the system. It filters out much of the SoCal water \\"stuff\\" that the aquarium fish and humans don't like.I hope these work as long as the previous set--- 15+ years and then the plastic containers just SPLIT- first one, then the second a month or so later. Good thing my setup was OUTSIDE (no sun on unit)) and I was home and a flood was averted."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Omni worked fine for over 10 years","review":"I am looking for an Omni filter just like the one that finally went out. It has worked just fine for about 10 years. We have a well and use it for sediment, and it's the first filter on the line coming into the house. From inside the house we use R/O. Maybe when people who experience cracks and leaks have problems is because they are over tightening the unit, or maybe the water coming to their house has a chemical that is damaging/weakening the unit. I suggest doing a water collection before the filter, on your raw water, to see if there is a chemical that is damaging your unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to replace, Clean water, leaks if not just right.","review":"Update:I lowered my review due to changing the filter is extremely difficult. The supplied wrench does not provide the leverage to untighten the filter after sitting for a period of time. I found it very frustrating to attempt to loosen it. Once I was able to get it off and replace the filter I was unable to get it to seal again with out leaking...I found it relative easy to install, I did have to go to home depot to get some hardware as it only comes with hardware for 1/2 inch piping and my piping is 3/4 inch. The clear plastic where it meets with the blue plastic will leak if it is to tight or not tight enough, it really annoying as you have to fiddle with it to get it just right. It does clean the water nicely there was no more chlorine or mineral taste. Also I noticed that the toilets and shower don't have to be cleaned as much. The water pressure was the same after installation.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is very poor","review":"When it works - it works. When it doesn't...I've had 4 of them over the past 6 or 8 years. The first one developed a crack in the housing and I returned it to Lowes for a replacement. The second one developed a crack so severe that it flooded the basement. Omni replaced that one at no charge. The third one is now dripping from a seam in the plastic and the customer service rep. from Omni refuses to replace saying \\"she'd never had similar complaints.\\" What the other reviews tell you is true as well - it works well (until the leak) and it does take considerable effort to find just the right torque on the lower canister to prevent dripping. Why the 4th? No time for plumbing - just replacing. I will be shopping for a new filter from a different manufacturer this summer. After that - NO MORE OMNI !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon description inaccurate","review":"Beware that the current (August 2008) description of this filter system is inaccurate, and probably copied from some other Omni product.

The effort to turn it was so high that the wrench (plastic) kept slipping off. I finally succeeded in freeing it and went on to to try and remove the filter housing. I was never able to loosen it up and gave up, fearing I would break the plastic wench that came with the setup. I called Omni Corp to see if I had a defective unit or if they were all like that. I was told that the unit had been out of production for a while and they gave me the model number of the newer version. I am not sure if the problem with the unit I had was age, and the lubricant installed at the factory had dried up, or a very poor design. I think it was a combination of booth!

Turns out I really, really enjoy it, and have listened to it over and over without getting tired of it.This CD is uplifting, but it's also full of excellent music that I can jam to. Those back-up vocalists are fantastic; they add a really rich dimension to the sound that you can't get from paper-thin, generic arrangements that abound out there these days.

Even the book's cover presents a problem in that the dramatic illustration is not from the French and Indian War, although this may have been the publisher's decision. Nevertheless, there seems to be an over-reliance on Parkman for details, a preponderance of some very dated sources, and no archival research. Moreover, Indians get left out almost completely. This is a MUST AVOID book, suitable only for those uninterested in interpretation or research. Read anything by Fred Anderson instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The French and Indian War","review":"A great and historical from Walter Borneman.

This is, at best, a junior level treatise of the \\"French and Indian war.\\" The Iroquois and other native American groups are referred to only to illuminate the character of the French and English generals, description of the actual battles leave one with no impression whatsoever as to how they were fought or won, and long diversions into anecdotes about the founding father's actions serve to distract the reader from the events they are actually supposed to be taking part in. Finally it is obvious that the writer has done little or no original research to justify his having attempted to write a book aimed at adults, much less students of history. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Shakespear ever produced","review":"This book is not the type of play you would expect from Shakespear after that Romeo and Juliet junk. It is a play that would make a good movie in today's society. Murder, Courage, Greed, Revenge, and Guilt are all of the things surrounding our main character (MacBeth) as he goes through the play. It is still a Shakespearian tragedy, so you know the character in the title will end up _____ at the end.

The authors basically offer examples of what has already been done with amateur detectives, which can be useful in its way, but it's no substitute for doing the reading yourself.In addition, the book has a distracting number of typos and spelling errors; for example, the authors--or editors--can't seem to decide whether Frederic Brown's first name should have a \\"k\\" at the end or not, so they spell it both ways at various points in the book.IMHO, the book's best use is as a reading guide to amateur detective novels--but check it out of the library if you want to use it for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference Book For Gamers and Fantasy/Historical Readers","review":"This book is an amazingly complete guide of weapons from the stone age through present day.

It is very helpful to be able to find a picture and description without having to go on-line to a search engine.

Edward Norton is a wonderful actor, and fully represents this within the movie. It is amazing how his character develops from the beginning of the movie to the end. And what amazes me even more is how he plays a stuttering preacher boy, and later on plays a nazi full of hate a few years later in American History X. Primal Fear is a must see movie! Norton and Richard Gere develop true chemistry through out the entire movie.

Norton was the only thing keeping this movie watchable.. He gave such a good performance that I have seen it like 5 times, and still haven't gotten tired of it. The plot is good and so is the script (except for Gere's scenes) but just to watch Norton do his thing is enough for me to buy and watch this movie over and over again!

Gere is the slick, bigshot lawyer who cares little for the truth. To him the end, which is winning his case, justifies the means. No one in the movie is a decent human being. The Catholic bishop who is murdered brutally near the start of the movie is a sexual pervert, presumably murdered by the overgrown altar boy (19 years old) caught fleeing the bloody scene. Gere's legal opponent is the DA Laura Linney, Gere's ex-girlfriend. She is clever too, but not quite as clever as Gere. The ending shows the triumph of evil in a dysfunctional world. If you like movies with no hero and a hedonistic, atheistic theme, you may like this tripe. But it has no surprising twists as some have written here. The ending can be predicted by anyone with a normal functioning brain. The only satisfaction one can get from watching this is Gere's ultimate defeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primal fear","review":"Amazing movie ,didn't suspect the ending,I loved all the characters and actirs who played them!!

Young Ed Norton (one of my favorite actors) was outstanding. Going from stuttering innocent little alter boy Arron Stampler, to diabolical, foul mouthed, ruthless Roy. The movie had suspense, some humor, originality, and a surprise ending, which entertains you from beginning to end. And in real life this could happen. That is why it's hard to prove insanity because they get off so easily in the court of law. Richard Gere deserved an award for this film too. Playing the part of a naive and optimistic attorney. I felt like the end defeated the whole purpose of the beginning and middle, but hell i didnt expect it. It was a well thought out unexpected twist.

Overall, its a great anime with awesome dubbed voice acting but if they made the series into like 3 or 4 episodes it will be more worth it. There is some nudity when the girls transform into bustier girls. This is not Ken Akamatsu's greatest work in anime but its worth giving a shot. The storyline is excellent.

After washing, the fit continued to get worse. However, it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners. The original set of sheets that I had on my bed were 500TC (from a different manufacturer), and I was so happy with those that I couldn't wait to receive these new ones. Unfortunately, these 600 TC sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 TC ones, nor are they as soft as some 400 TC ones I purchased thereafter. Overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price, but if I had to do it again, I think I'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 TC set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreplaceable and Necessary","review":"John Simon is, along with Robert Brustein and Stanley Kauffmann, one of America's three greatest drama critics, and my personal favorite.

True, the characters are there, but nothing much happens to them. And sure, there is some monkey wrenching in defense of what is really important, but the story itself is barely there at all -- a succession of small and extraordinarily repetitive vignettes. There are humorous moments, mostly when he is poking fun at himself, but they're few and far between. Lots of sexual meandering, natural description of the Four Corners area, the usual avalances of wordplay, and some violence (most corporate, but a final Lone act that seems gratuitous). It's still Ed Abbey, but he's nowhere near his best. Given that it's only available in a pricey trade paperback, I'd skip it. The two stars are relative to his other work, not to books in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel","review":"I really enjoyed this book, reading about the old gang joining together again. Abbey mentions names well known to those in the environmental movements. The immortal Hayduke certainly outdoes himself in this book.

Abbey betrayed the cause with that little turn of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for all ages and personalities","review":"This book provides wonderful characters, thrilling adventures, and Ed Abbey's humorous writing style.

Mind you there were only 4 computers on the network. a Call to the tech support yielded no result since the router was out of warranty.

We use it as a router between 4 LAN side computers and a WAN side computer (the internet server). We are pushing 100 Mbps through the router both ways (one direction at a time).Good news, our church bought one to connect to a fractional T1 line and it works w/o a problem. Our installer strongly recommends the latest firmware based on his experience. Bad news, the published instrutions apply to the older firmware.

When it get over-heated, it will start to drop network connections, then the web interface will get shut, and the Ethernet port will refuse to work. I will have to unplug the power, and wait for ten minutes, then the router will get back on once it cools down.

I was on the phone for a total of 5 hours just to get the DSL service to run properly. It never worked. About two hours into the phone conversations, they told me that they couldn't help any longer and that it should be working, because the 192.168.1.1 page indicated that it was connected and the pings were all coming back favorably. I exchanged the first one with another, and three hours later with them on the phone, I still couldn't use the router.

The third seemed to work after I re-flashed the firmware, at which point I finally got around to setting up my VPN endpoint. Which, needless to say, didn't work. Argh!Not all Linksys products are this bad; in fact most are quite good. (I have an old Linksys router that has served me well for four-plus years; it just doesn't support a VPN endpoint.)

I did upgrade the firmware at home. Our home network has all kinds of internet connectivity problems now. These problems don't really manifest themselves when using the Web, but when we get all kinds of disconnect problems when we try to do large downloads, use our Vonage phone, play online games, or access online streaming content like music or videos. I believe the router is closing our ports and not delivering packets like it should. This product should be avoided, and if you do get it, don't upgrade the firmware to 1.52.10.

I can't have the box that is the central point in the network do that, so I'm reverting back to the plain router and will buy a more robust firewall box.

The BEFSX41 often loses connectivity, requiring a hardware reboot (unplug & replug) every few months. At least once a year, a device needs complete replacement when it spontaneously gets bricked.Additionally, firmware upgrades often (50%+) fry it as well; when Linksys tech support is asked about this, they throw up their hands saying there is nothing that they can do.If you are looking for an inexpensive VPN endpoint with good VPN options, this is OK - just expect to reboot regularly and have replacements on hand for the inevitable bricking of the device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this router","review":"We use these routers to connect two offices using the VPN feature.

Great as a firewall but absolutely useless for VPN.

HTTP port 80 is port forwarded to a web server. The majority of the clients can reach the website fine. But for some clients (in particular clients on Southern Bell DSL and international clients in Singapore), the router will drop connection. This problem is particular to the Linksys BEFSX41, as replacing the router with another of a different brand (Fortinet) solves the problem. I'll never buy another Linksys router again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEFSX41 won't work with SBC DSL! Lots of Bugs!!!","review":"First, the bottom line is DON'T BUY THE BEFSX41! It has a lot of bugs and it will NOT work with SBC DSL, especially with a SpeedStream 5100. OK, so why: I design routers and I spent 40 hours debugging the Lynksys BEFSX41 on an SBC DSL link. I tried all the modes and I scanned the WEB looking for possible work arounds. I finally narrowed down the problem to a design flaw but their custromer support would not even consider a refund in trade for the information that would allow them to fix the product. Lynksys technical support ranged from pathetic to marginal (the marginal came only because one tech was willing to download all the firmware versions to me); but I agree with the others, their tech support stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEFSX41 is a dog","review":"The Linksys BEFSX41 is a real dog. My first one rebooted whenever I uploaded jpeg files with the firewall enabled. With the firewall off, it uploaded fine. Tech support said that it seemed to be a hardware problem so they sent me a new one.The new one is even worse. It reboots at random. Tech support said I should flash the new firmware (version 1.50.18). Don't do that if you want the router to work at all. We had to force a reflash of the older version to get it to be able to boot up again. Now it still reboots at random times, and sometimes I have to force the reboot. It seems to want to stay in its diagnostic state with the evil red light on for a long time.Tech support now wants me to get another new one. What makes them think that it will be any better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"completely trash","review":"Constantly breaks down, have to reboot.

The electronic manual and paper installation guide did not help to correct the problem. I was able to manually set the IP address, but that would have required me to do this every day (Not acceptable). A search of the Linksys Web site (Under their Knowledge Base section) provided me with a paper on how to install their routers on an Adelphia Cable network. It worked like a charm. Besides a little frustration in finding my answer, the firewall/router works like a charm. I have connected two computers to it and they both access the Internet with no problems. The logging feature allows me to observe the traffic in and out of my system, as well as the attempts by possible hackers to access my network.

What touched me the most was the description of the mother ship as \\"a happy place where babies live until they find their forever families\\". As an adoptive mother, it is very important to me for my children to have a positive view of their precious birthmothers and know that they were loved and cared for even before they were placed in our arms.

The performances are terrific, especially the drumming with almost impossibly fast double kick. And the songs are well crafted. I'm not sure how Dani Filth can keep his voice on the road, but on this recording he pulls out all the stops to wrench emotion from the songs. Not a bad effort at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some more below average work from Cradle","review":"So after midian came out, I pretty much lost all faith in cradle of filth. Gone are the days of music like in the cd \\"Principle of Evil Made Flesh\\". I remember when I first heard these guys and how much I enjoyed the uniqueness of the music. With this new release, it just shows the band going downhill even more. Don't get me wrong, this cd isn't horrible, but it's just not as good as the older stuff. There are a few songs on it that i like, but the songs that were redone, i feel that they just butchered them. I feel that this is a good cd for people, just getting into the black metal genre of music, but if you have been into it for a while, go for something else such as \\"dissection\\", \\"satyricon\\", \\"emperor\\", or maybe even some \\"dimmu borgir\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I was very disapointed when i heard cradel of filth's \\"Bitter Suites to Succubi\\" because it was not only boring but had no good guitar sound whats so ever.

This EP is the proof that COF began to loose its touch and that they lost their passion to play true black metal music.

The only slowdowns were during the Autosaves. Graphics are decent if not spectacular and the manual is complete and well written.Having said that, the game is boring as heck. The campaign is linear, with little choice about what to do or where to go next. As someone else mentioned, the horribly mangled Elizebethian dialect would get you thrown out of most Ren Faires. Combat options are limited to: Run forward and hack until your health bar drops into the red, then run away, or stand off and shoot arrows, chuck spears, or shoot fireballs and hope nobody gets close to you. I found it a pretty pointless hack-and-slash where I could cere less about the outcome and even less about the depressingly one-dimensional characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ready to launch my laptop over this one!","review":"It's not the laptop's fault. It's that this game is so aggravating. It's a cute premise, and I held out hope for it.The campaign was ok. As others have said, it's pretty linear, and gets dull after a while.The RPG section was ok while I was playing a male character. When I changed to playing a female character, it was like being drop-kicked into the middle of Frat Row on Beer Bash night while wearing a miniskirt. My female character gets hit on, gets stupid things said to her, says really stupid things (gawd-awful 'thou' lingo not counted), and it gets old, fast.Not to mention that the game messages were not looked over by anyone who had a native-level grasp of the English language. It was charming at first, now it's just obnoxious. If you're looking for a time-killer, this could possibly be ok.

This book is clear and consise. Miss Tarpley tells you what she's learned and how you should apply what she's learned from The Goddess to become in touch with your spirituality and you as a person.

Of his company, he was the only one who was there from the invasion to the surrender. All of the others were either killed or wounded. Mr. Wilson's book places you under his helmet, witnessing tree-bursts from German artillery, midnight patrols in pitch-black darkness where every sound is a gun being aimed at you, and the bombing of an Allied tank convoy by American P-47s. You are the one who nearly steps on a land mine in a pasture in France.At the end of the book, Mr. Wilson does a gives a bit of his philosophy of combat which I believe is pretty darn good.

If you've only read his travel works, it may come as a surprise that Kaplan is in fact the dean of the American neo-conservative movement. Kaplan's world view is one where the end game of western international efforts must be to preserve our institutions, rather than force them on others. Even if you disagree with him, this is a compelling and interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Beauty Ruminations","review":"Kaplan's work is clear and direct. However, his conception of nationalism and domestic violence is poorly developed and, quite possibly, misleading. In this work, as with his previous ones, Kaplan bases his expectations of the future on the faulty claims of nationalist groups who now prefer to find continuity in their conflicts. Nations and subcultures, it appears, are resurrected like Sleeping Beauty by the \\"kiss of freedom\\". If a group of people decide to adopt the trappings of a previously existing nation, say for instance Croatia, that does not mean that they were always part of an eternal Croatian nation. It means that nationalists are using history as a political tool. Kaplan apparently disagrees. But we are not privy to his thinking on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self concious 'profundity'","review":"Newt is correct about one thing, Kaplan quotes everyone one earth.

Kaplan compellingly elucidates the state of power and emergent forces that will increasingly \\"wag the dog\\" around the world i.e. issues/factors that will increasingly dominate geopolitical concerns. He also lucidly points to sweeping historical patterns that provide inklings for our own futures - a disturbing and grim but utterly realistic picture that politicians and other leaders of the capitalist world should pay attention to. A great and sobering read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sky is Falling?","review":"As I'm sure many readers will agree, this book is indeed disturbing. What is most disturbing to me, however,is that a book based on narrow and limited research has become mandatory reading for US policy makers and diplomats. President Clinton proportedly has a copy of this on his bedside table.The issues that Kaplan addresses are broad and complex. More broad and complex than he presents them. We need to look at what scholars and local citizens have to say about the causes of and solutions to problems in communities. Unlike Kaplan, I don't believe the world is going to hell in a handbasket. I do think, however, that sometimes an uninformed, blanket response to global and national problems often exacerbates them. I also believe when we come to view an area as beyond hope (as Kaplan would have us believe), we are really just making it easier for ourselves to sleep at night when we abandon such an area, whether it be a Sierra Leone rainforest or a Chicago slum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering and thought-provoking","review":"This is a great read - if you're an American, especially a liberal or progressive, it will really cause you to re-think the inherent bias we have toward \\"democracy\\" - through Kaplan's lens you begin to appreciate that building democracies takes a kind of social, economic and political evolution - you can't just arrive on the shores of a hungry, war-torn country and think that elections will save people - you can't define democracy by elections alone. And democracies need a middle class to be created and then to survive for a period of time. As one person stated, \\"Give us an economy first... then give us elections.\\" A good read for these times.Also VERY interesting are his comments on the changing American social fabric - one where public life is being jettisoned by the middle class for a social and economic life that is private (malls, gated communities, corporations, edge cities dominated by corporate planning and architecture)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real, from fact not from myth","review":"This is why I like Kaplan, this person has never been afraid of public opinion, he is real. I was drawn into the book on a reality that I knew and agreed with. To many details to go into here. I can foresee the future that Kaplan writes about in these pages. But a review here is meant to sway the reader to buy or not to buy, if you are in fact interested in the near future events on the grand scale this book is a buy. I'm pleased with it.I also strongly recommend reading another good book that takes a bold and detailed real stance to our destiny, SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written propaganda....","review":"This is not a \\"good\\" book. Spooked me in a different way than he intended. The ideology masked by Kaplan's claim to objectivity and realism balanced with a clever aversion to self-rightiousness, is just the kind of ego-centric dominator species reality view that is racing us toward oblivion. He speaks of \\"natural resources\\" rather than environment. What can I say? Give me faerie dust any day over this kind of cool-headed fascist approach to running the world...which, by the way is what his ilk is after.

Great for book clubs and salons, required reading for classes in various fields, and, for the solitary reader, the total experience -- a heady blend of history, philosophy, literature, and more, worthy of the hackneyed descriptor \\"tour de force\\". Precise communication via utterly gorgeous writing. Had he only given us his explications of Kissinger and NOSTROMO, dayenu. (I'm another of those who waits for Kaplan's next releases, even though I read him in The Atlantic or, rather, read The Atlantic for him; this one, a quantum leap from great to greater.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see the forest for the trees","review":"Kaplan's Coming Anarchy is one of the weakest books I've read, and now in my 3rd year of a Pol Sci Phd program, that's a lot of books. He is the Jenny Jones of literature, spotlighting all that is shocking yet meaningless. This book is a collection of problems, yet he offers no theory of how all of these events are related, no theory behind this anarchy, and no explanation for where it is leading, except for a possibly racist suggestion that it is leading to a society like that in current-era West Africa. Interested readers should consider Robet Wright's Nonzero, in which he argues there is a progressive and equilibrium path in human development. Even in if you share Kaplan's argument that there is or going to be anarchy, he offers nothing in the way of a coherent argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warns about the terror that has and will come!","review":"The author in succinct detail describes what has been happening since the end of the \\"Cold War.\\" He vividly describes how so many middle-eastern and African nations are without much law and order. The result is a growing attraction to terrorists groups like Bin Laden's, which give poor and disilusioned teenagers and youth a purpose for living.This is a scary book, but Westerners should read this and Kaplan's other books, and become better prepared for years of terrorism from America's bitter enemies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down, read it twice, a little too bleak","review":"This book was written in 1997 and I read it in 2003 and still found it worth reading -- twice. Kaplan is more than a journalist -- he's an important voice for realpolitik in for this century. Dissolution of the nation-state, blurring of the lines between terrorism and crime, and the wisdom of implementing democracy in environments without solid economic foundations are the three key takeaways for me. Kaplan can be a little too bleak in his outlook, however, and it's important to read this in the context of other political and technology books, lest you give up all hope, but I find his writing fascinating and his prose hard to put down.

This book is close to 10 years old but seems very relevant to us today. I'm going to head over to the library now and see if they have any of his other books.\\"Of the world's hundred largest economies, 51 are not countries but corporations.

It uses this scheme to lure innocent gamers into what it a ponderous, confusing, and frustrating disaster of an RTS.The controls reverse everything you expect in an RTS, which leads to many misclicks and frustrations. On the tutorial, I accidentally skipped one instruction box, and I couldn't figure out how to make units.The game is dull. Extremely dull. Almost all the groundunits are some kind of truck or tank, and all look almost identical. To produce units at all, you need 4 different buildings and 2 different kinds of units. There's a unit designed for the sole purpose of lugging resource bricks from the Mining building to the Processing building. Everything takes about twice as long as it should to build, resulting in long periods of waiting.Conclusion: Don't waste your time.

It is similar, or to my knowledge the same as Japanese Manga, or Magna, whatever they call it, with the big eyes. The episodes are not easy to understand, not well spoken, has confusing characters with adult themes. Dialogue consists of pettiness, biting, bratty, and again, for adults. Too many characters prove more confusion.Aquarion is military, science fiction, robotic, with overdone battle scenes and violent in nature. This, again is not for the youngsters. I sometimes doubt if even if kids under 10 would understand the hidden references in the dialogue.

It just didn't grab me enough to hold my interest and want to continue watching the show. Not that it was a few hours of my life I wish I could get back, it wasn't that bad, it just wasn't that good.But if you like anime, I'd suggest at least giving it a shot.

I have 7 other brands of engines and this little engine out runs them all. Most people don't like them because you can't convert them to DCC, at least not very easily.

This song has always stimulated my creative energy for art & writing more than any other song. I get a lot done when this song is on. It's an amazing rock/classical music hybrid.

Never purchase UBI again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your dough","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed both Myst and Riven, Exile has been a monumental disappointment. Myst and Riven set the bar much too high and Exile simply pales in comparison. From a technical perspective I found the constant interchanging of the four CD-ROMs extraordinarily obnoxious, which detracted from the game play. The puzzles were challenging, but navigating the landscapes and solving the puzzles often required good fortune, not skill. Additionally, the soundtrack did not boast the same mesmerizing power of its predecessors, which detracted from any ability to create ambience throughout the surrealistic ages. A highlight was the ability to view your surroundings in a 360-degree nature, which has been a major improvement over Myst and Riven. However, this was not enough of an upgrade that warrants a recommendation. Save your dough or wait until you can purchase the software from an auction site for pennies on the dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Technical Requirements","review":"As a big fan of Myst and Riven, I was excited to buy this game. I would be more excited if I were actually able to play it. I found that the game crashed constantly. I have spent hour upon hour trying to get my system in perfect alignment with the planets as decreed by Ubisoft; I had no trouble installing and playing Myst and Riven. Though the technical requirements listed in the User's Guide clearly state that a 3D video card is optional, Ubisoft technical support, answering an email after two weeks rather than the promised 24 hours, told me that in order to play the game I would have to purchase a new 3D video card. Uh, no thanks. I just won't buy any more of your products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost...In the Story","review":"Myst 3, I was simply lost, but not in the game but its storyline. This game is simply amazing. It is hard, not aggravating, long, but rewarding, and its planning is excellent. After completeing the game you have the greatest feeling. Best game ever! The storyline is amazing, and the puzzles and levels are mezmerizes. Simply, perfect. After each Age, the rides you take are wonderful! Buy It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable!","review":"Myst was stunning. Like most games that come along, it pushed the hardware and the envelope. The puzzles took some getting used to, but once you began to understand, it was great! Riven was beautiful, but the puzzles were much tougher than many people were willing to tolerate. I've heard countless stories of people who never finished Riven. Myst III:Exile is just right! It balances beauty, technology, and stimulating puzzles - all of which are somewhere in the reach of the vast majority of people playing the game. Myst III does run with the fewest problems on the Macintosh platform (although it does re-arrange my desktop icons sometimes.) The PC platform is a little more problematic... They seem to have done a good job for the first version of the program (it is, after all, difficult to accommodate all of the zillion-billion permutations of hardware and Windows operating systems.) I recommend the game highly if you enjoy a relaxed exploration of puzzles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they'd fix it.","review":"I wish i could say I was satisifed with this product, but I advise those of you that run HP computers, or any computer with an intel chipset to wait, because there is still a large bug problem with it. I'm sure the game will be very much worth waiting for, once they fix it, but even the company isn't sure when they'll get it fixed, they keep pushing the date back. So I don't say \\"Don't buy it\\" I say, wait till they get the patches out. . .and then buy it unless you're sure it'll run on your system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myst:: Exile to the world of nausea","review":"I had only been playing the game for a few minutes when I got dizzy and had to stand over the toilet until the feeling of nausea left and I stopped feeling like I was going to blow my lunch out of this world. I played Myst and I thought it was really good. I tryed to play Riven but I coudn't get it to start, so i skipped ahead to Myst Exile. The way your cursor moves in the game sort of gives you the illusion that the screen is concave and the way you move about made me get motion sickness and i am fine on roller coasters. Though my stomach couldn't take it i will admit that the graphics are pretty good and plot line made sense and the concept of going to the other worlds is pretty cool. If you think you can stand it then i would recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Uninspired","review":"Had they started with this installment, the Myst series never would have gotten off the ground. While the 360 free-look engine is really nice, it is absolutely the only thing to recommend this game. The first episode was simply a revelation. Riven gave us an incredible integration of narrative and truly environmental puzzles. Exile adds nothing but the latest technology. It's a poor imitation made without vision or inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game should be recalled!","review":"This is a good game except for one fatal flaw. A white screen(not blue) And an error message that says \\"M3%3!.04x!:%4!.\\" and deletes data from your hard drive distroying everything except three files one BGCDC.ICF and some strange symbols. DO NOT GET THIS GAME. I tried to contact tech support but got no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Errors","review":"I am a fan of Myst and Riven, and was excited when Exile came out. Unfortunately, that was short lived right after installation. Unlike Myst or Riven, for which I had no problems, Exile did nothing but crash my computer. The only way I could get my computer back to normal was to uninstall Exile. I wanted to play the game, not spend hours on a phone or chase emails for possible solutions with Tech support. My computer is a Sony Vaio, pentium III, 500mhz, with plenty of speed that has no problem running all my other software. I decided to skip the frustration and return Exile. I owned it for all of two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myst 3: Exile","review":"Beware of the lovely packaging on this game...I've owned this game for 2 weeks now and have yet to be able to run it. The manipulations have included downloading Ubisoft's 1.2 game patch and discovering the patch itself won't run. I'm no computer pro but with Myst and Riven I was able to set up my computer to deal with game quirks. This software seems to be at an entire different level of poor software design especially for a game that's pitched to the masses.

After years in the software business I should have known better than to purchase version 1.0. If you have a MAC, I suggest you wait several months, years? until Ubisoft corrects all of their problems. For now, I am stuck with a game that is unplayable due to visable grid lines, very jumpy mouse control and choppy speech. Ubisoft answered my email saying that they will get back to me in 24 hours. That was 10 days ago and I am still waiting. I hope ... will return my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble - won't run!","review":"Purchased Myst Exile in May - installed immediately but when tried to play, it resulted in a \\"dump\\".

You should expect a response from us as soon as possible (usually within 72 hours).After 4 months I don't believe the 72 hours any more.Gave 1 star - but I don't feel I'm able to rate the program at all - it just doesn't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd love to play it - but it just doesn't run!","review":"I've had Myst III for over a month and have been unable to get it to run properly. My PC exceeds the requirements stated on the box. I have an AMD K6 3D 400 mghz processor, 160 mb ram, ATI XPERT 128 RAGE PRO video card and Sound Blaster LIVE! XGamer 5.1. All of this is far in excess of the requirements, and it still is not playable.And I am not the only one. There are thousands of messages on forums across the internet complaining of similar problems. Half the reviews here on Amazon.com are negative for the same reasons. Tech support has been decidedly poor. It takes days to get a response saying they are working on the problem, oh and by-the-way you need to upgrade your system some more. Its ridiculous. Whats more, once you open up your software, the sellers won't take it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost There ...","review":"I suggest that any Myst fan play Exile. But, they must expect that the length of play and difficulty will be equal to one Riven island.Why are the Myst games so compelling? Is it just the scenery? I personally play the Myst games because they are unique among all the other games. There is a freedom that exists in these games that does not exist in any others. Exile has this less so. It is not the scenery that draws me in, but the extent that the designers go through to create an alternative world. It is imagination wrapped in sight, sound, and motion that keep me playing. This game is very close but doesn't quite make it. PLEASE bring back the original group of great people to design and work on the next version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could","review":"I have been waiting over a week for Ubi to come up with a patch that will enable me to play the game. I have \\"Intel\\" inside my Gateway. The company should have told you this game would not play without a high-end video card before you sold the games so you would have fewer dissatisfied customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word on acting","review":"All the reviews I am reading seem to overlook one aspect of this game, and that's the acting. Of course, I'm not talking about the acting of Maria Galante or Rand Miller, which is merely adequate. I'm talking about the acting of one Mr. Brad Dourif.His acting chops are, in a word, impressive. Some may think his acting is a little broad, but I think that's neccesary for the medium. If you are playing on a 15-foot movie screen, you can afford to be subtle. But on a computer screen, it helps if you jack the performance up a notch or two.When Saavedro is faced with the possibilty of being trapped for another indeterminate amount of time, Brad manages to convey the moment perfectly. He really makes you care about the character, a person who has been your adversary throughout the whole game.Making someone care about the hero of a movie is easy; evoking sympathy for the villain shows true skill, and Brad Dourif pulls it off in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it!","review":"Adventure gamers seem to be divided into those who love MYST and those who hate it. I'm one of the former; MYST was what got me hooked on adventure games in the first place.That being said, I was really looking forward to Exile for about a year before it came out and I got it as soon as I could. And I liked it. It was just as absorbing as MYST and Riven, the ages were beautiful, and the music was great. I love the concept, and the interface is easy to understand and use.I had some problems getting the game to run, however. The movies never did run smoothly, and a lot of the audio was messed up. I understand there's a patch for this now, however.I also found the puzzles extremely easy, so the game didn't last very long! However, even though they were easy, the puzzles were more than just the \\"apply inventory item X to slot Q\\" variety, which I find tedious. You really do have to think, and think in unaccustomed ways, to get through them.A good addition to the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard but Fun and Full of MYSTery","review":"I've been playing these games since Myst came out and I had a fun ime trying to figure out the puzzles and when I figured them out It unravled the mystery. When Riven came out it was like Myst except better graphics.Now, With Myst 3: Exile, The graphics are 100% better and I loved the free-look system. The puzzles are more frequent and they're harder but 1 or 2 of them are pretty easy to figure out. The story is well developed and the worlds are expertly designed. The villian in the story is Saavedro and he is phsycotic even more that Sirrus and Achnar in Myst. Overall it is a VERY good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very buggy - many having problems - support non-existent","review":"I purchased this program several weeks ago (preordered it actually) and it will not work on my computer.

I would not reccomend this game to anyone until they work the bugs out (if ever)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this before you buy the game","review":"If you want to buy this game i would not recomend it. It will be fun in the beginning but it get old very fast. It is not the best game i have gotten, you might like it but it is very callenging and hard to beat. I would rather buy 'Reign of fire.'

They are the utmost in laziness in taking advantage of what a game can really be, just a series of logic puzzles with backgrounds of computer generated pictures and an average bit of fantasy story tacked on.Just look at all the technical problems people are having... does that not prove to you that these guys are doing the bare minimum and laughing all the way to the bank that their game keeps going on 'the buzz'?

After finally thinking I had it installed I atteped to play the game...All was well for about 5 minutes..I made it through the opening movie and two clicks of the mouse when the game just decided it didnt want to play anymore. I then uninstalled it.

Immediately I was bit by the 'Insert CD 1' message problem. This was quickly solved by a trip to theMyst 3 tech support page and reading the FAQ (I suggest you read through this before buying or installing the game). I was immediately off and on my way. Being a big fan or the original, and being disappointed by Rivan, I had an open mind about what to expect. I was not disappointed. The first puzzle was very Myst-like. That is about as far as I've gotten.Technically, the game is beautiful as its predecessors. I haven't run into any bugs, yet. My only complaint is that the quick panning during the cut scenes blurs the pictures. I have a P4 1.4GH, 128MB and a GeForce32 video card. My recommendation is, if you are a Myst fan, buy it now. If not, wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT XP compatable","review":"Don't fool yourself, this game will not run on XP unless you can make it imulate Win 98.

I managed to return it to the store after producing emails from the publisher stating that they are aware that more testing needed to be done, they know there are lots of bugs, yet they don't know if it can or will be fixed at any time in the near future. If the game runs on your system great, but it's a gamble. Check out the tech support forum on the myst 3 official site before you spend your money.

In contrast to other comments here, I haven't had any problems (yet), even though my machine seems to have similar specs to those who have (Dell with Win Me and both DVD and CD-R drives). Can't comment on how Exile would work on a slower machine, though (it works perfectly fine on my 1Ghz w/ hardware video acceleration). I did a full install of the 4 CDs, but note that the game requires disk 1 to be installed for copy protection. PERHAPS this is part the problem for some users (won't be the first time that copy protection causes problems for legit users). In sum, I'm enjoying the game and haven't had a single problem yet.

While Myst 3 conveys a bare-bones plot and only decent dialogue, each of the Ages is beautifully rendered and thorougly breathtaking. Each one has a very different feel, and absolutely nothing is flat. There is not a single straight line anywhere.

With no help from them, I managed to get the game up and running smoothly, but I was expecting the same challenge as Myst and Riven and it's just not there. Sure, the graphics are spiffy, but the plot and puzzles aren't very challenging. It took me longer to get the game to run than it did to play it.

A visually beautiful adventure that depended on intellect rather than reflex. Most importantly, _mere mortals_ could, with patience and exploration, solve all of the puzzles without resort to any hint book.However, Riven was a different story. I'm certain a few people out there managed to navigate Riven without reference to any outside source...the 99.9th percentile of purchasers,those with infinite time and infinite patience, in my uninformed guess. Unlike Riven, I completed Myst without outside reference. With Riven, OTOH, I was eventually baffled without outside help. And so it is with Myst III.The heck with it.

Compared to any other computer game I've played, this is a great game, but compared to the 2 earlier Myst games, it doesn't quite live up. Like others who've commented here, I found the puzzles to be not so well integrated into the story, and there were surprisingly few surprises. Some of the locations are beautiful and haunting - I could stand to go back and hang out in Edanna for awhile - but I didn't connect with the revenge tragedy enough, and wished the ending could've revealed more. Myst and Riven were more than diversions, they were at the level of literature. Exile is more like a bestseller. Oh well, posthumous sequel-itis.

Having played both Myst and Riven several times, I really looked forward to Myst3, and was not at all disappointed. I have a new computer with Windows XP and Quicktime and have just recently used it to play the original Myst (1993), RealMyst (2000) and Riven (1997) using the CD Rom drive, and Myst3:Exile (2001) using the DVD drive, and had no trouble at all. For comparison, the only game I have played to rival Myst3:Exile's graphics was RealMyst; and the only game I've played to compare to Exile's puzzles was Schizm (though at times, Schizm was impossibly difficult and I had to cheat a bit to complete it).

The puzzles were challenging. The one thing I did not like was trying to figure out where to click to. In other words, in some worlds you had to mouse click over every, and I mean every square inch of scenary before you were able to move on, down a path, through whatever.I would rather spend time unraveling a puzzle. Not trying to figure out were to \\"point and click.\\" Having said that, the game is most challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor","review":"Did you ever wonder what happened to the worlds Sirrus and Achenar destroyed? Now's your chance to find out. A fine game, and a good continuation of the series by different people. Expect the same kind of puzzles, worlds, and solutions, but with a better interface and some excellent writing and acting. Not nearly as difficult as either Myst or Riven, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning Myst Scenery with terrible plotline and unsatisfying ending","review":"I'm a big fan of the Myst/Riven/Uru serries, but in myst 3 they tried to add an in-depth plotline with characters you couldn't interact with. The point is the characters and plot they added made the game seem korny. And Exile was painfully shrot. I think there were only three or four worlds. The game ended and I sat there wondering if I skipped something, I didn't. Out of all of them, Riven has been my favorite. It's a beast though, like 7 disks or something. Anyway, I didn't care for what they did with exile, and the reward for solving stuff wasn't that great either. I wanted to scream durring the bounce-the-sunlight-off-the-flowers puzzle!!! Myst V better not be the last installment, cause it was pretty lame too. The serries is great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"had potential but no good","review":"this game has great appeal on its cover but don't fall for it.generally when i buy a computer game i buy it for fun, this game is so boring. watching paint dry has the same effect as this game.I gave it one star for its graphics, which granted it does have great graphics but this is no substitute for the low excitment level.

We only had ONE minor problem during the installation process, which was quickly overridden, and then we started playing.I seriously didn't think it was going to be as good as the other two Myst games.Well, I was wrong. It's awesome! The graphics are better than any other game I've played, the music is WONDERFUL, and the story is great. Of course, being a Myst game, the puzzles tend to frusturate you now and then, but there's ALWAYS a way to solve them.It wasn't as long a game as I hoped it would be, but it was worth it.CAUTION: If you don't have patience and all you like is the shoot-em-up games, don't buy it.

I have a system that is at or above all the sytem requirements with a standard video card that runs tons of games using DirectX without incident.Yet Myst 3 crashes all the time. It crashes when you try to restore a save game, it crashes when you try to run a new game, it crashes when you swap CDs.

However, I have had nothing but trouble trying to play the game: initial refusal to load, crashes, freezes. Though I checked the hardware requirements before purchase and patiently waited for the patches, I was recently told by Ubisoft tech help that I must purchase a 3D video card in order to play the game. The requirements in the user manual state that a 3D video card is optional. The experience has been very disappointing, not just because I so looked forward to playing the game, but because now I feel turned off from the whole series. Ubisoft really should have made an effort to make the game compatible with more machines and more video and sound cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I so enjoyed the unusual story line, stunning graphics, and non-linear style of Myst and Riven. I ran both on my old, slow computer with minor problems.I anxiously installed Exile on my new Dell and immediately realized that something was wrong. I had fallen into a trap that I'm sure a few others have experienced. Read all small print BEFORE purchasing the product.Exile only runs on Windows 95/98/ME. My new Dell is an XT which UbiSoft won't support. Imagine sitting through a 3D movie with no special glasses. This distracting aspect ruined the rest of the game's good qualities. My disappointment equals a negative 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Quality & Disappointing Follow-up to Riven","review":"I loved Riven and Myst-I, but am very disappointed with Myst-III. The most siginificant problem is that it has so many bugs in it that it is difficult, if not impossible, to run the program. I'm still awaiting a release of the 3rd patch to the game so that I can get it to work properly. Given the care and attention that was taken with Riven, it is disppointing to see what Ubisoft has done (looks like the Microsoft quality control team has joined Ubisoft ...i.e., keep releasing software with bugs). This game was definitely released way too early...suggest you hold off your purchase until they release a working version or an accurate list of pc configurations that are compatible. If you do purchase this program, be sure that you have the most powerful PC available and that you have downloaded all the \\"patches\\" from the Ubisoft web site to correct some of the bugs...and then maybe it will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little buggy...","review":"I absolutely loved the original Myst and Riven. However, the newest installment is plagued with a variety of gliches. It runs just fine on some of the newest, fastest computers, but has significant difficulties on many others (including mine). If you want to buy it, visit the website first www.myst3.com and read up about it in the users' forum. They are working on a patch (a couple are already out but don't fix everything) but then again, they've been saying this since June and it's October.

Yes, the puzzles are slightly easier than in Riven, but still a challange. My only problem was the previously mentioned slight lag in synchronization between sound and image in some of the movies. This may be due to the fact that I have an older iMac with a fairly slow chip (333 megahertz).I suspect that PC users have problems because Macs are still better at handling complex graphics. I have nothing against the Intel chip...it does the things most computer users need very nicely...but even after all this time Macs are still better at graphics. Ask any graphic designer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes beyond your imagination","review":"I've been in love with the myst series from the first one itself.

I've also played Myst 01 and the Journeyman series. However, Myst 03: Exile didn't quite fit up to the rest for me. Why? It makes me dizzy. Honestly, I could play the game, but I couldn't play for longer than 10 minutes at a time until I worked out how to slow the revolving screen view by right-clicking the mouse - and even then it only allowed me to struggle my way through the game's labyrinth at about 3/4 an hour a time. I play Riven and Journeyman not for the adventure, but the visuals and it's hard to enjoy the scenery when you're suffering from a 'Quake' sized headache. I wish that the producers had done the 360 view like Journeyman 03 and not as they had chosen to do. I won't buy 'Uru'. The threat of being mentally incapacitated for a few hours subsequent to playing is too great and I'm not going to risk it.Pity.

At any rate, the company was aware of these problems and pushed the game anyhow.I would advise avoiding Ubisoft like HIV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware","review":"Myst 3 is no doubt a terrific game for the small number of people who have been able to circumvent the bugs. In addition to the problems mentioned in earlier reviews there is also a conflict with Myst 3 and many, many video cards. When one attempts to launch the game it performs an illegal operation and shuts down. Updating drivers, DirectX, and other suggestions do not work. Instead of playing Myst 3 I've been *working* on Myst 3 with no success.The official Myst 3 site acknowledges this as a *known* problem and is at work on a patch. There is no date given as to when patches for any of the bugs will be released.Buyer beware - it may not work on your computer until patches are released at some unspecified time in the future, if at all.Please note that I've assigned One Star to this game only because No Stars or -Stars are not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Function on Most Computers","review":"I would love to play this game however the designers forgot to make sure it worked with some of the biggest names in computing.

I tried the typical install on my iMac. The movies ran jerkily and the sound was atrocious! I couldn't run it on the Full Install because it requires a whopping 2.36G. My husband tried running it on his newer iMac and it also had syncing problems between the sound and video. He's a guru at Mac issues so we're tweaking in hopes of getting it to run - but we really shouldn't have to do this. I suspect UBI Soft developed this on PCs instead of Macs like Cyan did and transported it to the Mac platform which often causes such problems.

There is no story, and the puzzels are just plain stupid. Spend hours arranging reflectors. I don't think so.And let me tell you about the flower zone. First of all, the graphics rely on 'jumping' to the next point, so there is little pathway to follow, given that there is no 3d progress to take you to the next point of play. The screen jumps to your next location in even a more lazy way than Riddle of the Shinx did. Plus, once you have 'landed' at the next point in the 'jump', the stupid game has you turned off the point you 'landed at' so that you are looking cockeyed. I really hate how that happens...programmers, please place us facing the way we landed. I am not anal enough to want to figure out how I can go down a path and end up facing a direction I did not turn to face...I hated Schizm, but I think I hate this more. It is really a bad game.

The cutscenes are pretty boring, and the actors are completely cheesy. The storyline does not motivate me one bit.I do not like the mouse movement, it is far too slow, I prefer being able to \\"run\\" on my own. Pointing and clicking is very disorienting.

My feet tend to run wide, and they were just able to comfortably fit width-wise. But there was no breaking-in period at all. No blisters, no burning, no problems whatsoever. I can wear them all day with no problems.There are three adjustable straps, although the one across the heel is really the only one with a lot of flexibility. The two straps that go across the top of the feet have less give. But that's the idea, I think. My feet don't move around at all. The arch support could be tad higher, but that's my only criticism--other than, of course, the appearance. They're not exactly high-fashion.

This is no routine historical book. It is fresh and lively in approach, and the research is impeccable. The people, events, backgrounds and settings equal credibility and realism. I know of some who have served at Chicksands in the USAFSS, and I am happy to see that Mr. Grayson has instilled their service to the top of the \\"hill\\" with this beautiful and well written tome to celebrate such unique history. Mr. Grayson, have you heard of Simon & Schuster? Random House? They need to see this book. Thank you for your foresight and talent to bring this historical work to the American people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique history of an ancient site","review":"For anyone who has served at Chicksands, this is the definitive history of this ancient site. Bill Grayson covers the history of Chicksands from its Saxon origins, through the 400 years of its existence as a Gilbertine Priory. The book goes on to cover the 340 years of occupation by the Osborn family in great detail. The wartime years and the use of the Priory for intercept operations during World War 2 is followed by a lot of detail on the US presence until 1995. It is a complex tale well told. There are several links to the US and a fair cross section of British history can be imagined through the events at the Priory. The book is being re-printed in its third edition and it will include more information on the Priory restoration which took place in 1998. This book is strongly recommended for anyone who served at Chicksands or who wants to view British and some early US history within the context of a single place and the people who lived there."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of size","review":"the size is smaller than actual.

For example: I've been stuck on a rooftop early in the game covering some guy name Klaus while he picks the lock on a door. Meanwhile, Nazis are coming out of the woodwork. After about the 10th try, he finally opens the door and we go to the bottom of the stairs where . . . nothing happens. The game is stuck. I cannot walk past him, and he just stands there. I go back outside and nothing happens for several minutes. Eventually the Nazis show back up and I run out of ammo. This makes no sense because we supposedly on a covert mission, and we should be running away once through the door.In addition, the graphics engine is severely showing its age, and overall the gameplay, AI, etc. is way behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This game has its moments, but most of the time its more Rambo-style kill everything that moves action. Also, there is very little ammo to be picked up. The game throws a LOT of enemies at you, and several times I've run out of ammo. There may be a pile of corpses at your feet, but you can't get their ammo or weapons. Very frustrating. I am wondering if this is a bug or intentional. At one point I found a cheat code on the net and gave myself ammo that way. The gameplay and graphics are ok if you have enough ammo to survive. There's nothing here however that you can't get out of CALL OF DUTY or the other Allied Assault games. The ammo problem takes away at least one star for me. It literally makes it impossible to play on certain levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medal of Honor","review":"hey, there, MOH fans! Can you believe that the original MOH became a 1st seller?

I find that the WW2 scenery is dull looking and overall the gameplay is dense. But if you don't like colorful games where there is alot of jumping and flying about maybe this game if for you.

If you enjoy playing one scene over and over and over and OVER until you finally figure out that you have to first do thing 1 before you do thing 2 (and it doesn't have to be something logical), then this is for you.

Ridiculous.Spend your money on Call of Duty - EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Just to keep it short, graphics sux compared to allied assault, the ammo is scarce the germans are plenty.

This game is an abject failure on nearly every level.The strategy of EA (or whoever is responsible for over-hyped franchised expansion packs) is to throw overwhelming numbers of Nazis at you in nearly every level until you freak out or quit the game out of the frusteration of lag.Breakthrough offers no innovative improvements from the original and will make you start to question whether you actually enjoyed the original game. Yes, that's actually how bad it is. If you thought Spearhead was a dissapointment, brace yourselves for this disaster.Save your money and buy something else. Boo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to five stars but not quite","review":"First of all, Breakthrough is worth ten bucks even if it is short. Ten Bucks is nothing. I am semi-surprised it went that cheap. Heck, buy it used for 5 bucks.Anyway, about the game. The graphics, battles, guns, and sound are all very good. And one thing that I really like about it is that the AI is not so annoying. In the first medal of honor the AI would hit you without even aiming. Or they would see you even if you were extremely well hidden. The AI in this is better, and the action is crispier. Anyway, I think that for the price it is a good buy and you will be playing it through more than once.It's a good game and was definitely better than Spearhead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sequel to MOHAA","review":"Allied Assault was one of the best games I have ever played. Spearhead was too short and added nothing new. I got pumped up for Breakthrough, I thought EA would try better after Spearhead. Breakthrough while fun, is really hard. You cannot pick up HARDLY ANY ammunition from dead soldiers. Right now I'm on the last mission, Monte Battaglia. All there is is endless waves of Germans, and you are low on health and ammunition throughout the whole thing. I thought of uninstalling it. It is also not worth the thrity dollars or so. Wait until Call of Duty comes out.BOTTOM LINE: Could have been a descent game, but it is nothing new. Shame on EA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the mishaps of Spearhead and buy this","review":"I am a Medal Of Honor junkie. I beat Allied Assult in 3 days and Spearhead in 2. Allied Assult was great, Spearhead was awful. The EA games at the beginning showed that it wouldn't be the same as Allied Assult. It was much worse than I thought it would be. The levels were harder so you had to play them over and over til you beat them. There were fewer levels because of this. Breakthrough was different. Despite being obviously shorter it took the same time to beat as Allied Assult. The game play was better and there was actually a plot. The game had a few sound problems but otherwise it went fine. The new weapons were cool especially the Vickers Berthier. The first level, the Kasserine Pass previewed the rest of the game and I new it would be good after that level. If your one of the people that said they wouldn't buy another Medal Of Honor after buying Spearhead, take it back before you look stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief history of Imperial China during the 1520-1840s","review":"This is a fairly expensive book for 48 pages but it does a credible job of describing the era in Imperial China between 1520 and 1840. There are eight different paintings of various chinese troops in different armor and many black and white pictures throughout the book showing weapons and statues of the period.Various essays in the book also describe the armies of the time, some of the weapons and the setting to each era. In all it does a credible overview of the era and is a very good primer for readers interested in the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor illustrations mar this book","review":"These series of booklets are primers to niche areas in history.

It is a good CD - not as heavy as the Beaver but that Laura Ann didn't let me down. The drumming is amazing.

After 5 months or so the wires broke. My husband did use this with eggs and mushrooms but who wants to buy 2 separate gadgets; I don't have much drawer space so that's why I used this for both mushrooms and eggs.

I enjoyed it much more now that I have more knowledge of organized crime because it covers a lot of ground. I would like to read another book or meet someone who knew Fratianno because he is very interesting and I would like to get their perspective on him. I'm going to read Roselli's book next so we'll see. The only real gripe I have is that the violence (Murders) weren't plentiful and they didn't really put me up close to them often enough. Also, the nickname the Weasel is inappropriate for Fratianno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whether in dreams or...","review":"This is an excellent and unexpected tale. It takes you to an unexpected place full of reasonable fantasy. A true opportunity to think about how things could be rather than assuming you know what they are.

I highly recommend picking this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived quickly ...","review":"The pieces are strong and well made but really really small .. only for advanced climbers or people that hope to become advanced climbers.

Thankfully I didn't buy this book, but instead it was passed out a Beauty Fair for free. I guess that's one way for people to read your book.If you are looking for a great read that captures your attention the whole time, then skip this one.

He is almost one year old and already 60lbs so getting him used to the bath early on was the first thing we did and he used to love his baths. Until I bought this. When I first tried to use it he was terrified of it. I thought he might warm up to it but he still has not done so. I don't know if it is because it is new or the way it sprays directly on him or what but he tries, and has succeeded, in running out of the bath wet and covered in shampoo. I connected this to my bathroom sink (I have a double vanity so I use the one right next to the tub) and it really works well, except what other reviewers have stated, that you must hold the button in to keep it on. If I can only get my puppy to appreciate it then I would give it 5 stars but I think if you are considering trying one you should get this. I will keep trying and update if he decides it is not so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdoor only","review":"I purchased this product to use indoors.

This stressed her out and made bathing her difficult. It was so much easier giving her a bath using this product and caused much less stress. There's also a small wire latch on the shower head that locks the thumb operated on/off button in the on position.

It's thin and small, and the buttons stick out to where if you bump it at all, the next thing you know it's in a different mode or changing time or date. What I ended up doing with this thing is pulling off the wrist band halves and use keep it in my waist pouch for when I go on walks. As I'm one of those odd fellows who intentionally lives without a cell phone, I still need a watch but this one isn't what I'd hoped for.What I'll likely end up doing is ordering another Casio but a more deluxe model that fits my wrist.

F-91W's not applicable for sport, but it's just enough.The G7700 is a little too big for daily use, and I have to take it off when I sleep for its shape make me uncomfortable. The biggest problem is the strap keep accumulating nasty white thing in its gap and web pattern, I need to clean it really often. Design of it is awful, they didn't consider how it really feel. Therefore, I chose this one.For F-91W:Pros:1. Light weight, 20g vs 52g of G-shock, I can't feel it on my wrist.2. The strap is easy to clean and smooth.3. Cost less, it covered 99% percent of daily time use. I don't think many people need a world time and an 1/1000 stopwatch.Cons:1. Only three operation button, and one blank slot.2. If I can be 2-3mm bigger, it would be perfect.Overall, it's a good watch for the price and normal casual occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch there is","review":"It's simple, reliable, and just does the job.

It's a nice throwback to a classic 80s style. The button mapping is very simple to learn, and I picked up on how to use the watch in just a minute or so. Many people comment on how much they love the watch and remember the good days of watches like it.My only complaint is in regards to setting the alarm. I often do this once in bed and the lights are out. However, the light button is the one that lets you change fields, thus making it impossible to set in the dark. Just turn on a lamp and everything is fine. Not really a big deal.Alarm is nice and loud. Display is simple to read indoors and outdoors.

Instead it has a pin that goes through the sides of the watch and the band. Not enough of an issue to subtract a star though.Besides that the watch is extremely reliable, discreet, and affordable.
