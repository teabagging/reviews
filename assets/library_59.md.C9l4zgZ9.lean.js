This is my first PDA and my first GPS. I use it daily. It is very helpful and causes me little trouble. The list of tasks the Garmin iQue M3 is capable of performing is long. It keeps track my office and personal contacts, appointments, task lists, and notes, which are synchronized with my office and home computer. I use it on business and personal trips as a GPS. I use it for email and Internet with an optional wifi card. I use it to learn Spanish and to watch movies (requires memory card). If you need both a PDA and a GPS the Garmin is worth considering. I recommend getting a memory card and I have never used the Garmin without one. Strengths: good PDA, good GPS, smooth integration of the two, and car mount. Weaknesses: no built in wifi, low memory, and the battery cannot be replaced by the user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful as to your PC configuration","review":"I bought this unit and was excited to see how it performed. It turned on and acquired the satellites within 10 minitues initially, all ok. I spent the next 4 days trying to get it to work with my computer. After several emails and phone conversations, Garmin finally told me the deal. No Garmin unit is designed to work with Windows XP Media Edition. Additionally, their USB connection will only work if the USB chips are Intel. The following chips will definitely not work: ALI, NEC,or VIA. I am not happy with Garmin. They could have saved me a lot of grief by stating this in their advertisements or home page technical FAQs."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS not reliable","review":"When I first purchased this item, I loved it. There were a few times the GPS led me astray, but generally, it really helped me get from place to place in my job. It helped my find places where I did not know where they were, or helped my find short cuts from place to place. However, soon after I got it, it quit \\"acquiring satellites\\". It would try and try to find satellites (even though it showed them on one of the screens). Most often it would never find the satellites, or if it did, it was about the time I arrived at my location. The GPS had trouble no matter what location I was in, whether rural or city. I sent it in for repair, and from what I can tell of the paper I received when it was returned (which was very vague)to me, they replaced it. Unfortunatly, it is still doing the same thing. It is a great data management system, however, and I love that it interfaces with \\"Word\\". The GBS is a big disappointment. It's overpriced for what it can truly provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"iQue M3 has disappointed me to a great extent. It is (very) slow when it comes to route calculation, realizes that you've gone off route after being on the wrong route for about a quarter of a mile and WORST of all it has a LOT of software bugs. My garmin log is full of stack traces and the only way to get out of this pathetic situation is a soft reset of the PDA. The satellite acquisition takes forever when you are on the move... you should let it acquire satellites for atleast 10 minutes before you start moving. A very unresposive and slow tech support does not help much. I now use it only when there is no way out and to play some games on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"m5 is better","review":"the m5 has better software, and processes quickly, espcially during a wrong turns.

I got to satisfy my two needs (PDA and GPS) in one device. Plus I get to place all the software I want in the device. The device can also act as your personal entertainment center with the Pocket Media Player. Download other free software (they are all over the internet) including games and you got a complete package. I only had to reboot once and that is because of the defective software package that I uploaded into the device. But the money that I spent (relatively cheaper than those with just GPS capabilities only) is well worth it.One more important tip: buy a 2GB SD card so you can upload all of North America in the card. You will still have enough space for other things like MP3's and other games in the SD card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed- Never Buy This Product","review":"I purchased this GPS 2 years ago and was extremely thrilled to see the features that this GPS/PDA system contains. However, I was extremely disappointed with the system and would suggest nobody to consider it for purchase in future. It takes forever to connect to the satellite, responds slowly and often after the wrong turn has been taken, loses signal every now and then, hangs in the middle of the road and has even started updating maps in the middle of the drive- a huge safety hazard because you have to turn on the GPS again after the updates have been installed while driving. The GPS does not take the addresses from the address book correctly and tends to misguide you. Garmin is unhelpful on this and often unresponsive. Beware of this product and its nice looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor resource for the modern learner","review":"I ordered this book early on when I began studying Scottish Gaelic, as I wanted a resource to look up words that were not available in my textbooks. On several occasions I've found that the word I was looking for was simply not in the dictionary.This dictionary does contain interesting words which likely have cultural links to Scotland, for example instead of having the word \\"cow\\" they might have fifteen different words of variation, with meanings like \\"newborn cow with spots\\" and other very specific forms. While these translations were interesting from a cultural perspective, this book simply did not deliver when I was looking for a word that I would use in real conversation. Unfortunately this book is simply too outdated for use as a primary learner's dictionary.I recommend instead MacLennan's Pronouncing & Etymological Gaelic-English/English-Gaelic Dictionary, which also has outstanding pronunciation help, in addition to more relevant vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"opened my eyes to worship!","review":"This is an easy read, and well worth it.

I did find tidbits here and there that were useful, thus the 2 stars, but I fundamentally disagree with the premise of the book. I feel that children drift away from God because we force them to confine God-- put God in a non-teen shaped box. The focus of this book, that of the jealous nature of the God expressed in the First Testament, is not what today's youth are thirsting for. I understand the concept of worship as defined within but do not find narrowing the pathway to God to be the way to an informed, intelligent love affair with God that will grab a kid and hold him/her for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memory...","review":"I had my mother check this book out of the library many times. It is the story of an ant named Rufa (Formica rufa) who is born into a colony of wood ant. We follow her as she lives the life of an ant, from foraging for food, surviving attack from red slave-making ants, to feeding the young and preparing for winter. The Alice Hopf writes a story that seems amazing, yet is based on fact, with realistic artwork by Jean Zallinger, a naturalist artist. The book, if you can find a copy, is great for kids but be warned, Rufa's friend, Missing Claw, is killed by enemy ants so really young kids might get upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Lullaby CD","review":"Yes, kids need to go to sleep...and when all the songs start to sound the same, they can't help but fall asleep, especially when the last 5 (of 15) tracks are a repeat of 5 of the first 6 tracks sans lyrics. While these songs are \\"nice,\\" there is nothing really unique about this collection. It's the same \\"sweet, cotton-candy cloud\\" vibe that has already been done (and overdone) on other \\"lullaby\\" collections. Nothing really quirky or oustandingly original."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"My 4 and 2 yr old sons are mesmerized by this entire CD. We listen to it every morning on the drive into daycare and every afternoon on the way home. It also keeps them in bed at night listening to Melanie's soft and sweet voice.

This CD is truly awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good action/adventure romp!","review":"I have never read any of Ken Goddard's books and PREY was my first (and won't be my last) novel that I have read and liked. It was never boring and has lots of interesting characters, good and bad. The only thing I didn't like about it was the main character Lightstone, only because he has such an american indian name but no background or reference of his heritage was revealed, so I didn't really get to know the character very much except he likes sports and obviously knows something about weapons and martial arts. The weapons part I can understand since he is a cop after all, but again no explanation on how he knows all those karate moves! But I usually don't read this kind of book but I love action/adventure series, and this gave me that! So I suppose it piqued my interest to read the next installment. But according to the reviews the next two are weak, but I will give my own opinion. The author deserves it in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prey: I prey i never have to see it again.","review":"Although the story is an adventure and strictly fictional, I personally am not a hunter. I would never shoot any animal simply for the sport of it. Yet those charactizations are found throughout the story.

As a result you can't just clip it on your waist and walk around with it. You either have to use the arm band or put it in your pocket, neither of which is ideal.* Reception was tolerable but every other radio I have has better reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this radio!","review":"I previously owned this radio and was very careful with it, but it stopped working after about 1 1/2 years due to a design flaw. I babied this radio and kept it in a protective case, but it began to malfunction and ultimately stopped working. The casing and buttons do not protect the radio's circuit board. Mild pressure to either the case or the buttons began to turn it off, and it then stopped working. Panasonic is normally a very reliable brand, but not in this case. A much better alternative is the Coby CX-9 mini digital AM/FM stereo pocket radio with neck strap, also sold by Amazon. This is an awesome radio, especially for the price! The reception is great and the control buttons are easy to use. I've owned the Coby radio for several months and have been very pleased. It has a clip you can attach to your pants/shorts/shirt pocket, or you can hang it from a strap around your neck. You can't go wrong with the Coby radio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be the CIA interference","review":"These FM tuners must be quirky little things and highly dependent on local conditions.

Not on the regular or \\"city\\" sensitivity setting. Bah!

The battery life is very good. I mostly use this in the gym, and the AM reception is terrible, FM is ok, I don't get all of the local stations when I am inside. The worse part about the unit is the armband. Its made of nylon and it does not stretch at all, and its very narrow so its very uncomfortable.

Baroque music is such a delight to listen to and this is no exception. Jean Baptiste Lully here showcases why I consider this time period to be amongst the finest periods for music. Guillemette Laurens is a very accomplished mezzo-soprano and I dare say Lully himself would have been pleased with her perfomance. Harmonia Mundi have created a very nice book-let. The cover is an amazing painting from the time when the music was written. The font is easy on the eye and therefore it is a joy to read the short yet well-written essay by Skipe Sempé and Capriccio Stravagante and the three short biographies of the performers. The lyrics are presented in 4 languages, these being, i.e., French, German, English and Italian. I had never listened to Lully before and this came as a definite pleasent surprise and I would recommend this recording to affecionados of the Baroque aread and good music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really wonderful book on digital system engineering!","review":"I like this book very much, which has everything about today's high-speed digital system design.

Joan Borysenko describes seven paths to becoming a mystic that are correlated with the seven chakras. In other words, the chakra that is dominant in a person indicates the path that they will most effectively walk in becoming a mystic - one who has direct experience of God. I very much appreciated the book having reflected the truth that any one of us can become a mystic and that we don't have to lock ourselves away in a cloistered environment to do so! You will see yourself, and others close to you, in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, lame ending","review":"At the beginning you are intriged and feel yourself to be in good hands.The rest is a huge disapointment.The hero when on Lilith behaves not as a master spy, but as a stupid adolescent.To add insult to the injury at the end one learns that from the moment he's landed on Lilith he was a puppet and his admittedly stupid actions didn't matter anyway.As in the worst sort of mistery books at the end the hero is told in all boring details what a duche he was.Huge letdown!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled so who knows if it's good...","review":"I would love to review the documentary \\"Hungry for Profit\\" but I've received it twice and both times it's the wrong DVD.

If Danny Williamson aka LTJ Bukem knew how this album would turn out when he started mixing, I seriously doubt he would change anything. This is a great live mix of some amazing chill-out, \\"intelligent\\" drum & bass. The vocal intro about destroying the moon (what movie is that from?) really sets the table for the music to come, alien and unknown. The whole CD flows from start to finish, with the conclusion of the original issue about the moon. If this CD has any weakness, it's that the bass level is too high...but not necessarily a bad thing. Probably the best Mixmag Live album available, not counting anything to be released in the future. But then, \\"Do we really want to know about the future?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed not to fall into the 'old CD' pile.","review":"This CD has transformed all of my friends into drum and bass heads. Furthermore, it seldom leaves the CD-changer.

This disc would be best for the uninitiated. I would recommend looking around at a used CD store first before coughing up the Amazon price, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted paper/Wasted Reading","review":"Unless you are purchasing this book for a class, save your money. This is a lopsided and illogical book blaming the White man for all the world's ills. One author attempts to argue that the NCLB act is the reason so many Blacks and Hispanics drop out of school. This book sets back race relations into the 1950s at least. Scholarly support is scant at best. Another article author cites her own research five times as if she were an authority. Anecdotal \\"evidence\\" is rampant throughout the book. Did you know that because one high school principal was charged with racial harrassment all White principals throughout the nation are racists? If any sort of peer review was conducted on the book, I wonder which Disney character did it. However, the various authors do raise some valid points in society and education. You will not find any suggestions to \\"fix\\" things as sociologists so often fail to do after they raise an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a fictionalized account of author's \\"treatment\\"","review":"I was in the program that this book speaks of at the time the author was working on the book. Be assured, IT IS FICTION. What REALLY went on in there is now the subject of numerous court cases...two of which were recently settled for 4.5 and 6.5 million respectively. False imprisonment, beatings, starvation, sleep deprivation and the mental and emotional abuse that actually went on in there were, quite literally, unbelievable. Most kids were kept there anywhere from 1 to 5 years and more, quite often for nothing more than some minor, normal teenage behavior problems. The real motivation for the program was the money and there was LOTS of it to go around.

Unfortunately, the text fell far short of useful. Replete with typos and misspellings, the instructions are more confusing than helpful. The author frequently repeats himself and leaves out steps, and uses different terms to refer to the same body part, without ever offering a glossary or even a precise diagram. It took us longer to decipher the author's incoherent writing than it did to actually dispatch our lambs. I do not recommend this book to anyone looking for clear guidance or comprehensive information."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"clear, precise and loaded with good information. I would tell others who are interested in this kind of thing to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic and Easy","review":"This book is a classic. Very easy to understand.

You don't want this book. It is clumsy, inaccurate, and downright wrong. To list just one blatant example of his misinformation, he says a goat buck is inedible and gives a ridiculous story of how bad they stink. Completely ridiculous. And wasteful. Illustrations are minimal, not so helpful. I have yet to find a good butchering guide, illustrated with discussions of different cuts. This is a poor representative of Story's publications which are usually so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"This is an informative book for people looking into doing this. I like how it shows how to do it with pictures - not graphic but good enough to get a general idea. We got it to butcher a pig but we quickly learned we're not ready for that. I feel we could have done it with the books explanations etc. but it's just too big of a job for us. We are glad we bought it and plan on actually butchering a pig one day so it will be useful then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Step by steps easy to follow. Great for Preppers.

This book would great for Grizzly Adams or the Waltons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book has absolutely clear and pertinent pictures of everything it describes.

I think it's a good thing to know where the meat on your table comes from, and how it was raised. This book will definitely help me as I begin to raise animals. Very informative, step by step instructions with pictures to accompany them. I would recommend this to anyone looking to do what the title says."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all here","review":"Put bluntly; killing and butchering animals is not a pleasant business. Anyone who has hunted or helped slaughter on a farm can attest to this. You just have to jump in and do it.Ironically, or perhaps most fittingly, this book was written by a veterinarian. I had a couple of chuckles about that fact.This is a very \\"how to\\" book, so is really not meant to be casually read. The information provided is practical and well presented to make the process easier.The author handles what some may consider a sensitive subject with honesty and straight-forward thinking. He also provides numerous tips and how-tos when it comes to handling and butchering several different kinds of animals.While every hunter may not need this book, it sure provides a lot of help and suggestions. If you are going to be butchering a wide variety of animals (pigs, cows, deer, etc.), this is definitely the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Hunters","review":"This is an excellent book.

The headlight height adjustment requires a 40 dollar slotted socket and it's necessary to twist the turn signal to get at the hex heads for the initial install. Overall the product is poorly designed and fraught with problems, would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn signal Installation is practically impossible","review":"Almost impossible to tighten the screws for the turn signals. Very poor design, do yourself a favor and buy the Hondaline bar that uses your stock turn signals. This is a total nightmare to adjust, it has to be completely disassembled again. Totally ridiculous. I damaged the chrome turn signal mount, by trying to turn it with vice grips (covered the mount with a rag first) but it still damaged the mount. Nothing you can do about it now. This is a horribly poor design. Do not buy this one. It is very easy to pinch wires, very difficult to get wired up, and if they aren't aligned correctly you have to take all the wires out of the headlight just to adjust."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real departure (from their earlier work)","review":"The Donner party's first cd (consisting of their first 2 albums):Complete Recordings, 1987-1989is one of mt favorites. I love the ironic juxtaposition of folk/ pop and the quirky/ odd (some would say twisted) lyrics.On this CD...well their style has changed dramatically & the irony lost. It is always difficult to describe \\"alternative\\" music (because what makes it alternative is that it doesn't easily fit a genre); the best way I could describe this is as a mix of \\"Dead Kennedy's\\" era punk, and rap... with a little industrial/ synth thrown in (on a few tracks). There were a couple of interesting pieces....but, for the most part, not something I want to listen to more than once.Ah well, I wondered what had become of this band, and now I know. If you are a fan of late '80s punk you might enjoy this. I was looking for something different from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Wasteland Captured!","review":"I've never read a move revealing book. It follows the lives of troubled teens and really captures a complete picture of how these problems manifest and the problems in our society that feed them. If you ever wondered about how teens fall through the cracks this is a must read. Each chapter tells a story about another teen, then examines it socially to support his ideas. As someone just out of his teens, I appreciated the accuracy of his observations."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you talk to yourself, this book is for you.","review":"This book will teach you to speak to yourself and others in a positive manner.

It has very in-depth characterization, and characters are the best part of any novel.The plot is good. There's more to it than battles. There are loyalties and pretended loyalties and confusion and secrets. I was eager for the next one to come out. It was interesting to see the sheltered Matteo learn and grow. I don't think Tzigone changed nearly as much. But I liked her anyway.Given four stars only because the synopsis on the back is sooo far from the truth of the book that it kept me from buying it for a while.

He didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waited too long to pick this up","review":"Even though I've always been a fan of Elaine Cunningham I had resisted the urge to pick up this series.

I can't wait until her next book in this spellbinding series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh'","review":"I found this book to be pretty boring actually. I didn't think this book was original enough, and didn't feel at all attached to any of the characters. This is just another Forgotten Realms type book.

Well, I decided I was having so much fun, I shifted gears and became a children's librarian, and used this book a LOT!

After viewing the film, I did a heavy search on the Internet for artists shown in the film, and although I was pleased to see that some have had exposure in Europe, most have not and I could not find recordings (although some have video clips in various places including Utube - mainly the same ones you see in the film). Some of these folks are incredibly inspiring and talented. The focus on Jupiter/Okwess Int'l was disappointing once I began to see short clips from the other artists. These are musicians who need exposure and promotion - would love to see more. Definitely worth seeing this film on numerous fronts.

This is the second Rowenta iron that I have owned. The first didn't have any issues with leaking, but the cord burned off at the base of the iron as I was using it. Neither of my irons have lasted long, and I think they cost too much money to die so soon.I don't think that Rowenta irons are good values.

I have another Black and Decker D2020, and in comparison the D2020's soleplate edges are crooked, and the water inlet cover is quite brittle, and the D2020's soleplate is smaller than the DX-8600's.

For example, I set it down vertically to go lay the pair of shorts I was ironing on my folding table, and when I turned around, it had shut off. I had only left it for maybe 20 seconds! I have to fiddle with it to get it to come back on again and then it keeps happening even if I just set it down to turn an item of clothing over to iron the other side.

Other than that everything else falls short. I bought this game when it first came out based off all the reviews.The game play is very slow, and when I say slow I mean very very slow. Abilities are limited and not really needed. Your standard attacks become vastly more powerful and are quicker to use. The combat get overly redundant even for an RPG. The combat sounds are highly annoying and very little between characters and attacks.The story is great. The only reason I played this to the end was to see the ending (and the fact that I was to close to the end to just throw it out the window). The characters themselves are pretty well diversified with a slight amount of depth.If you are looking for an RPG that's great storyline and gameplay to keep you addicted -- this is definitely not it!.

Fresh set of batteries, good to go. Until next month. The idea that I had to keep replacing batteries once a month didn't make me happy. But I was even less happy when, at about 6 months, they started dying after 2 or 3 weeks.

I use the alarm every morning and it has been really reliable. I like the way it gradually gets louder. It definitely gets loud enough to wake you up.The only drawback to this clock is that the projection part doesn't swivel.

It is true that you cannot rotate the projection, but for me it doesn't matter as it is standing on my bed side table and the angle is perfect then.

The projection is bright and large enough (I have 9 feet ceiling), and it works constantly if the clock is plugged in (switch it off during the day with one push of a button also). The automatic time setup worked like magic, no problems there for me. It is also true that setting the alarm is very difficult (i would need to read the manual to do it and i just wouldn't bother, honestly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good","review":"It works fine as described. The disadvantage is that the projection is not flexible and the numbers on he clock are small for easy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited projection and cannot adjust display","review":"We wanted a projection clock for the bedroom that would double as a \\"normal\\" bedside clock. This model has a decent projection display but it cannot be adjusted to increase the range of the projection. Most limiting, the projection is only in one direction. So to project on the ceiling or wall while placing it across the room we have had to turn the face of the clock away from the bed. In other words, we can either see the projection at night or the regular display during the day but never both. Most projection clocks allow you to flip the projection to see both at the same time. If this model can do that we haven't figured out how. The face of the clock is okay but does not allow you to place it very far away because the numbers are so small. It does auto-update which is a nice feature and has the date on the display.We have made it work but it is quite limited in its usefulness as a day-to-day bedroom projection clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lil' clock.","review":"Turned out to be a great lil' clock.

I wished it would last longer and now thinking about a replacement. When I wake-up in the morning, I am not too sure if it's 6:09am or 6:00am due to the missing L.E.D line segments on the numbers.

Adding an option for 24hr clock is trivial, yet Oregon \\"Scientific\\" (more like Scientologist! I contacted them and they disdainfully, snidely, rebuffed me for wanting \\"Military Time\\") seems to have some agenda with actual scientific standards. They also display their dates backwards, with no option to revert to correct format (or even totally hosed format, should you like the UK version ;-). Also, there is no focus, nor rotation, allowed for the projector, so unless you put your clock on your head and lie very still it won't project the time directly overhead. Very Procrustean.The only good thing about this clock is that it's cheap, so when you throw it out it won't be that much money down the drain.Too bad the Honeywell PCR191W Atomic Projection Alarm Clock with Indoor Temperature and Moon Phase is out of stock (production?). That was the best version of what this product fails to deliver that I've seen yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish that I had bought one for myself, too!","review":"This clock is great! I bought it for my 11 year old son for a Christmas gift. He loves it. It supposedly takes 2 to 10 minutes to automatically set itself. Ours took twelve (our kids were in a small panick) but was worth the extra wait. The time shines in red on your ceiling in nice, large numbers... probably 6 inches by 15 inches and is very clear and easy to see, even when it is not completely dark in the room. I only wish that the blue back-light would stay lit. When you press the the button, it only stays lit for 5 seconds. I have to say that the red numbers on the ceiling scare our 5 year old son, but he doesn't mind it when we position the clock to shine on the wall. All in all, I wish I had thought to buy a second one for my room. It is a real bargain and definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy this clock","review":"This clock is complete junk.Here's what's wrong with this toy clock:-You can't focus the projection-You can't flip the projected image-The projected image is tiny, very tiny-You can't swivel the projection to get it where you want-The time on the clock itself is very tiny - almost unreadable-When you \\"glow\\" the clock, it buzzes awfully-The buttons on the clock are so small, you're likely to hit the wrong one.We bought this clock, and even our six year old hated it. Don't buy it!! Instead of this one, search for Amazon ID B00005NN95 - a much, much better Oregon Scientific Projection Clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one position","review":"This was my third projection clock purchase (each a different brand). I do not like this one as much, because it does not have a \\"swinging arm\\" that allows you to position the beam. Because the projection is fixed, you do not have the flexibility to point closer or further from you. Otherwise, the projection is bright, and the clock set quickly at the right time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect Alarm Clock","review":"I bought this because I needed an alarm clock that didn't light up my entire room with a bright LCD display.This clock fit the bill nicely. I like the temp. gauge, and the projection can be turned on or off, and does not light up the room when it's on.Docking half a star because the volume of the alarm is fairly soft. It wakes me up every morning, but I am a relatively light sleeper. Docking another half a star because the projection is foolishly placed--when you are looking straight at the clock, the numbers project on the ceiling backwards, not terribly helpful when you're bleary-eyed in the middle of the night and trying to figure out how much time you have left in bed.On the whole, great for the price. Not sure how the atomic adjustment works yet, my house might not be in a prime location to receive the satellite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best alarm clock","review":"I ordered one for my son and he loves it, I started borrowing his, it is so easy to use. So I ordered 2 more. AWESOME CLOCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this clock","review":"So nice that the time is on the ceiling - it is easy to see and very clear. I can check the room temperature on the display window, too. I love that. I've seen some complaints about the wake-up alarm not being loud enough but I think it's fine, starts out with soft beeping then gets louder pretty quickly if you don't turn it off. I don't know who could sleep through that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to beat the price...","review":"At first the atomic clock would not engage, so I set up the time manually. After reading the manual though, I put it close to the window and pressed the UP arrow button (as the manual suggests) to force signal hunting and that worked within 20 seconds. Prior to that successful operation though I had tried unplugging and even resetting the clock without success. The projection is quite dim, but large and clear enough to see at night without glasses. Would have been nice if it had a focus ring or that you could rotate the projection without rotating the clock, but then I suppose it would have cost far more. Overall, this is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems","review":"The biggest problem is it doesn't light up at night, so unless you hit a button you cannot see it. Also, if you are across the room you cannot see the time even with the light on. You also cannot adjust the projection. It is also very small. Overall not a great clock for what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the projection","review":"I brought this solely due to the fact that it can project time onto the wall but I was very disappointed.The projection on the wall is tiny and is barely visible at night.

The absurdity is that these thermal fuses are there to protect the motor from overheating but if you don't know about them and they blow then you're very likely to throw the unit away.Basically, Cuisinart engineers underdesigned the cooling ability of this unit and then, to protect the engine but make the unit non-functional.

I had my Oster blender for 18 years before it finally died. I almost replaced it with the upgraded generation, but this Cuisinart model was in the same price range and had a food processor attachment, so it seemed like a no brainer. The first problem I had was with the blender jar: it leaked after the first cleaning. No matter how many times or how tightly I tried to reassemble the blender, it would leak.

I was able to successfully make a number of foods using both the processor and blender functions, but there was consistently a burnt rubber smell after using the machine. Just this past weekend, I was using the blender to mix up cooked potatoes (really not a difficult material to blend) and the motor completed died. I tried to turn it on again after that, and no luck. I had wondered if the loud motor was a defect with my machine, but the complaints of other people and the fact that mine died out after a year and a half of not that much use makes me believe there's some serious faults with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I used this product twice and it started smoking and stopped working.

After 30 seconds, smoke started to pour out from the side vents. Luckily, we managed to stop it in time before it truly burst into flames.We think that the internal mechanism caught on fire as the smoke smelt of burnt rubber and fried circuitry. Smoke kept on pouring out even after we pulled the plug.It's a fire hazard and dangerous. It didn't see heavy use and the mechanism was never exposed to water.

I should have read the reviews BEFORE buying this. I used this machine about 4 or 5 times before the motor went out on me. Apparently, this is a consistent manufacturing problem that many others are having too. I think this is a machine for light mixes, not thick liquids like a shake. It's just too much for this blender.

THe burning smell when operated at high levels was always troubling to me. But the fact that it happened the first time I used it, I 'wrote it off' as just an odd issue that will not go away. No big deal, really.Of course, then motor died within the first year (like most other reviews). So I discuss the issue with the fine fols at Cuisinart. They inform me that I need to pay for all shipping, and they also need me to include a $10 check in my return to pay for the shipping BACK to me! What a joke.What good is a 3 year warranty on something that clearly wont last a year and costs you $30 every time you need it fixed? THey also informed me that I should expect 3-4 weeks for completion.At this point, Im just going to buy a new blender. I suggest everyone stay away from this product. My next blender will certainly be created by another company as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Cuisinart?","review":"I had the mistaken opinion that cuisinart meant quality.

I'm a big fan of Cuisinart. I have many things from them. I first used this thing on December 26. I was making a smoked salmon appetizer, using smoked salmon, sofetened cream cheese and some dried dill. Within moments of turning the motor on to the lowest speed above pulse, the motor started smoking profusely. I turned it off, gave it a few minutes, turned it back on, and it was dead!! I took out my old 1982 Hamilton Beach blender, transferred the contents, and voille', I had my appetizer made in a jiffy. I have let this thing sit for 5 days now, took it out today, filled it up half way with water.

Amazon refunded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out motor after two months of daily use","review":"I originally bought this product a couple years ago mostly for the food processor (which worked fine for shredding cheese the whole two times I used it). It didn't really get much use until recently. About two months ago, I started using the blender for green smoothies. I was using it every morning, blending bananas, leafy greens and small frozen berries. It started having this burning hairdryer smell a few weeks ago but seemed to be doing alright aside from that. The motor burned out this morning when i was only trying to blend liquids and a banana. Now I'm out a blender AND a food processor. Never buying one of these combo things again. Never buying Cuisinart products again (their other products could be fantastic for all I know, but I'm one to hold grudges)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This FAKE appliance won't last long","review":"When my Hamilton Blender which I've owned for years finally died, I bought the Cuisinart Power Blend Duet to make my morning smoothies. At first it worked well and I particularly liked the ice breaker feature, but a couple of weeks after use, it started to smell like it was burning. Everytime I used it I thought that it was going to be the last time because of the burning smell. Well, this morning I used the food processor component of the Cuisinart, to puree some turnips. The burning smell was particularly bad and in the middle of the food preparation, the Cuisinart died. I have owned it a total of three months. I am so disappointed but blame myself for buying it in the first place, considering the 'chrome' is nothing more than plastic! You get what you pay for and I bought this on sale for $99. It was not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out with little use - Stay Away!","review":"I didn't buy the BFP-10CH blender from amazon but am so disappointed with it, I feel compelled to post a review. The motor has burned out in only 9 months of very light use!My wife only \\"occasionally\\" used it to chop vegetables in the blender (not food processor). She did not use it a lot. I ground ice cubes about 4 times in the first month to make smoothies but it never ground all of the chunks without a lot of stopping and coaxing using a small wooden spoon. I stopped using it since it was too much work to grind ice cubes. Yesterday, my wife was chopping some vegetables and the motor started smoking really badly. Pulled out the plug and the stink lasted for quite a while since the motor smoked so badly.We paid a high price for this blender thinking that it would be a quality product. Instead, in my opinion, it is a piece of junk. Needless to say, we won't be buying any more Cuisinart products ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst blender ever","review":"We purchasted this blender and the first time we used it we made Hummis. Half way trough, the blender died. We took it back to the store and got a relacement. We tried again and guess what, the blender died again. this is the most pitiful product I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't chop well","review":"The food processor part of this combo doesn't chop evenly. It always leaves large pieces unchopped and almost liquefies some of the rest. I have used this several times each to chop onions, green peppers, and fish fillets (to make fish cakes) and every time it did a surprisingly bad job. I have to keep stopping it, taking the lid off, and pushing the large pieces to the bottom. Meanwhile the pieces already chopped just keep getting smaller until they liquefy. To get a more even chop requires chopping about 1/4 of a small onion at a time, or perhaps 1/2 or one small fish fillet. It's the worst food processor I've ever used. The blender part works pretty well though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last a year!","review":"I have had the blender for less than a year, and it no longer works. The blades spin when the pitcher is not sitting on it, but once you attach the pitcher, it barely spins. The unit also smells \\"hot.\\" I expected to get at least ten years from a Cuisinart. I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"So loud, it hurts!","review":"This may be a fine blender; I'll never know because its maiden voyage (about 30 seconds of blending) cause my ears to ring, and I was literally in pain for several minutes after the blender was off.

I tried to make a banana smoothie and I got surprised that it could never really liquidise the whole banana. There's always some pieces left intact at the bottom.

Roughly two months after I bought it, the blender cutting assembly stripped, rendering the blades useless.

However, I would not recommend purchasing it unless Cuisinart can improve the quality of parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed and not worth the money","review":"This product isn't very well designed and isn't very reliable. I've had mine just over a year and I've recently had to replace the blade unit not because the blade got dull (I don't use it that much) but because the screw that held the blade unit on got stripped. You couldn't just replace the nut/bolt thing but you had to replace the entire blade unit. A rip off. Plus, the square-bottomed jar isn't that great--unblended stuff sticks to the sides and won't drop down into where the blade is, so it doesn't blend nearly as well as an old Hamilton Beach blender I found on the curb, with the traditional funnel-shaped jar. I'd say skip Cuisinart blenders and get something that's well-designed. It also makes SO much noise it wakes up the entire house when I make my smoothies in the morning. I'm sorry I bought it and won't replace it with another Cuisinart when it finally conks out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very decent blender and food processor","review":"My wife and I are quite pleased with this blender. We have been using this blender for 2 years. We did have one issue with the cutting assembly - which locked up after 1 year of use. I am not sure whether it is our fault or a fault with the design. We were lucky that we immediately noticed that the sound from the blender is not the normal sound and immediately stopped. This saved the motor. We did buy 2 replacement cutting assembly (with an extra one just in case!). Since then it has been running like before.We do not try to run the motor continuously for a very long time. We always try to do it in intervals.We would have given 5 stars had the cutting assembly not locked up on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - save your money","review":"If I could give this thing less than 1 star I would. We registered for this and after just a couple of years and light use it went on the fritz. Here are the pros: blender / processor combo, glass blender jar.CONS: The blender lid is near impossible to fit onto the jar - after you jam it in there, good luck getting it back off.The bottom leaks no matter how much you tighten it, the food processor does not work as well as a dedicated processor.This thing is just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't holed up to lite use!","review":"We've had our blender for about 3 years and have used it only for blending salsas and sauces, used maybe total of 20-25 times. It died this past weekend while blending grilled vegetables and avacados for a sauce, nothing difficult about that but the unit didn't sound right and like it was bogging down, then just died. There wasn't any electrical smell or excessive heat that I could tell, it just sounded like it was struggling and died. I assume the motor and electronics are bad. We also have a 3-year old Cuisinart microwave which after only a year and half of use, the carousel motor went out. I was able to find a replacement on-line after getting no answers from Cuisinart othar than having to send it in. If I were Cuisinart, I'd look for a new motor supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"I paid for this with frequent flyer miles from Delta Shopping about two years ago, and used it about twice a month since then, mainly for smoothies.

Burning smell lasted only during break in. All the small electronic kitchen equipment that I've owned has been that way. Great smoothie maker. Crushes ice very well. Easy to clean. Attractive enough to leave on the counter. The shape of the jar is a bonus. The small processor is a breeze to use on small jobs, I now do not have to pull out large processor every time that I need one. [...]. Belks had the same one on sale for $[...] plus tax. One thing that helped me was to read my manual first which said to add liquid ingredients first. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blender and Processor","review":"I was totally amazed when I got this product. The Blender is huge!

I definitely will enjoy using this product and recommending it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisicrap Blender","review":"I bought this blender on Amazon about 9 months ago for smoothies. I don't remember how long the 1st one lasted before the burning smell and death of motor occurred. I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought a new one (exact same model.) I brought it home and swapped out the dead motors. I promptly brought it back to BB&BYND; and told them it didn't work and wanted a refund. My replacement lasted as long as the original, and I have since swapped out dead motors 3 more times at BB&BYND.; I paid almost $100 for this thing on Amazon and there is no way I was going to just flush that money away. When you return a defective product to the store they send it back to the manufacturer for credit. There is no reason that the retail victim (us, the customers) should have to foot the bill for repair or replacement!!!Anyway, I am now on my 5th blender in 9 months. I think the moral of this story is DO NOT BUY this blender!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super disappointed!","review":"I got this product as a wedding present and was sooo excited to start using it. Yesterday I pulled it out for the very first time to make smoothies. The first time, it didnt blend the contents as quickly as I had hoped but I wasnt going to let that bother me. The second time I tried to use it, half way through the blend it stopped working and still won't work. The light comes on and blinks like its supposed to but the blades don't spin. After this happened, I looked online at reviews and apparently this happens quite often. I'm super upset about this b/c it was only my second time using it!! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I need it to do","review":"The food processor attachment is small, but I knew that going in and wasn't disappointed. Compared to some high-end Cuisinart food processors I've used, it's delightfully simple. I would like coarser blades -- the reversible blade works well, but it slices / grates very fine, especially at the recommended speed. It's the only one supplied -- perhaps a second, coarser blade would be an improvement.The unit is plenty powerful at 600W, the blender and food processor attachments just drop into place, it's very easy to clean, and the controls are logical and easy to use. The oily smell others have complained about was present, but only for the first few minutes of use and didn't affect the food at all.The blender is flawless, the machine is sturdy, and at the price it's a really good value. It's not a top-of-the-line food processor, but it wasn't supposed to be, and for my needs it's entirely satisfactory. I'm not sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoothies, no.

Happy that is until today when this piece of plastic junk completely stopped working in the middle of my Thanksgiving dinner preparation. This is not a product I would recommend anyone buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT use to make smoothies","review":"Contrary to product description, this unit is NOT good for making smoothies.We purchased this product last December. My wife has used it primarily for making salsa and general blending (nothing frozen).Last week we decided to try making our own smoothies. I made about a 32oz smoothie the first time and noticed the unit smelled like the motor was burned out. It continued to work the second day when I made almost a full jar; the smell came back and the unit was shaking. Now after 8 uses the motor will not turn.This product had such little use that should have lasted a lot longer. The Cuisinart replaced a Hamilton Beach dispensing blender that we paid about $40.00 for over two years ago and still worked when we gave it to my mother-in-law. She still uses it today.To make things worse, we can't find the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tempermental","review":"I bought this blender with high hopes. My first one made a couple great smoothies. Then it started smoking like it was about to burst in flames. I returned it and got another thinking it was just a fluke. My second one lasted about 9 months with limited use and only using the low speeds. I was having some problems blending a smoothie and kicked it up to the higher gears and clicked the ice crusher button a couple of times and it died. After research it seems the ice crusher button is a kill switch for this blender. If you keep it in the low gears its great and who wouldn't want a food processor but if you kick it up into a higher gear make sure you have room in your trash and kiss your money good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart BFP-10CH","review":"Relying strictly on the Cuisinart name, I purchased the Cuisinart BFP-10CH. Unfortunately the package & paper work were discarded before I could register the product or I would have returned the item within two days. The pour spout is useless for pouring liquids making it necessary to use one of the corners. The machine was a failure at making basil pesto; the on button often must be pressed 3 or more times before machine is ready to process; there is no difference between the ice crush or chop when it comes to chopping ice. There are other reasons so suffice it to say I do not like the product, would not buy it again, would certainly not reccomend it!Barbara Holmes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I bought this as a replacement for another Cuisinart food processor that gave up the ghost after 18 years of regular use. It is well designed and a bit lighter than the older models.

It seems to be able to handle any blending/processing job that I give it including really thick smoothies and baby food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Well ONE TIME","review":"We bought this product because of the large carafe and the food processor attachment. The plastic 'chrome' body of the unit looked pretty 'cheap', but was not a big issue for us. We made a batch of frozen drinks and it did a great job.

TOTALLY LAME. I was really pumped about the blender/foodprocessor all-in-one feature because counter space is a limited commodity in my world, but alas Cuisinart, you did me dirty. Aside from the motor lacking the necessary skills I'm looking for in a blender/food processor (i.e. the \\"blending\\" and \\"processing\\" function) it's also a pretty cheap looking device. Black and Chrome sound swanky, but when you get it out of the box...it's just plastic. There's no finesse. It some how doesn't even match all the other black/chrome appliances I have. And it shows water marks, which drives me nuts. I do not appreciate windexing my blender. My 30-day return window has tragically come to a close, so thanks for wasting my 80 bucks Cuisinart.

It's one of just a few 'metal' albums I still listen to from around that time, two others being Rush 2112 and Van Halen's first, because it is beautiful, powerful, emotional, and intelligent. Wow. Jackson penned all but one of the songs, I think, and boy - finding music that wasn't cliche - that was actually original and smart and emotionally wrenching to boot - it was more than I could've asked for. Another reviewer said they're not quite as brainy as Rush, which is true, but I love them for it. Rush were a bit impersonal for my tastes. I just discovered that they put out a new record a few years back, just having gotten the cd version of this, so will definitely check 'er out!

The only bad thing I can say about it is Slow Down isn't good, but it's a cover, so all is forgiven.Zebra was a band clearly influenced by Led Zeppelin and the Moody Blues. An combo, but it worked. They had the hard rock adrenalin rush that guys loved and a strong sense of melody and harmony that transcended the genre.How well does it stack up today? I'm not one to judge, i heard it when it came out, but if you like 70's hard rock/metal you'll probably like this.The follow up album was awful (made up mostly of tracks that didn't make this album), but did have Bears and I believe a track called Lulaby, which were both nice.Unlike another reviewer, I highly recommend 3.v, but if you're expecting more of the same, you won't get it.

Don't expect any cliche guitar licks, or party-till-you-puke lyrics, or sleezy, juvinile sex songs here, this trio's serious about their music. Not Rush serious, but serious nontheless. All tracks are keepers with a possible low point being the rock-a-billy \\"Slow Down\\" which is the only song not written by Randy Jackson. A top five metal album from the 80's easily....Unless you dig Motley Crue's work.....please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An 80's Classic","review":"Zebra is one of the most underated bands of the late 70's and early 80's. But after you listen to their 1983 self title LP, you'll think differently about them. Zebra to me was always a mix of Led Zeppelin meets Rush mixed in with that early 80's sounds. Some of the songs on here do stand the test of time. Example \\"Tell Me What You Want\\" (great 80's radio/MTV song), \\"One More Chance\\" (great riffs on that one), \\"As I Said Before\\" (another great song), \\"Who's Behind The Door\\" (Zeppelin Influenced), \\"Take You Fingers From My Hair\\" (All Time Classic From Zebra, one of the best power-ballads of the 80's), \\"Don't Walk Away\\" (Rush Influenced) and \\"The La La Song\\" (very melodic, this is Zebra's trademark song of the 80's, sounds like something off the movie \\"Fandango\\"). This album brings back so many memories for me. This one of the greatest pop metal album of 1983 and the 80's. Get this, it's a classic to own. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are they now?","review":"I saw Zebra a number of times in the mid eighties and I was sure they would be the next super-group. In hind sight I realize that they were simply a very good rock band that didn't stand the test of time. This was probably the best album of the year when it came out . I have had this album for nearly twenty years and I still listen to it and enjoy it. I realize that this band will never be considered one of the greats but I still remember my amazement when I first heard them on the radio and when I hear them on the radio these days I still wonder what became of them.If you are a fan of the music from this era this album is a must, if not then take a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Were #1 on Long Island","review":"I too grew up on L.I., and was a teenager in Zebra's heyday. This CD takes me back to the days when the drinking age was 18, and Live Rock Clubs (such as Tuey's in Stonybrook, Good Times in Commack, Hammerhead's in West Islip, and yes, even Jimmy Byrne's Place in Woodside ) dominated the local entertainment landscape. Sadly, although Zebra was a giant locally, they just never seemed to be able to break out of the local club scene.Over the years I've seen Zebra in every venue from the LIE fair-grounds at exit 54 to Radio City Music Hall w/ Blue Oyster Cult. Most recently at the Brookhaven outdoor Amphitheatre, 2 years ago with my 7 year old son, again w/ BOC. Since their debut on the WBAB Home Grown album in 1981 nothing has changed...They're still great."},{"rating":"1","title":"second worst pill crusher I have had.","review":"Cant keep it clean it has these spikes at in it that trap the meds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Wow, what an amazing album!

Kim Rogers-Gallagher makes astrology not only fun, but captivating. Written in an informal, engaging style, the author uses examples that make sense in an every-day context and seem to hit on the kernels that help get the learner from one topic to the next without feeling overwhelmed. One thing that strikes me as making the most sense is how the book is organized, with parts of the chart explained in a sequence that fits my personal learning style. Thinking of some parts of the chart as parts of a real house helped me grasp the concepts, as did some of the phrases used in popular songs.

Most of the divas from that era do little or nothing for me, but she is a rare exception. There is a lack of pretentiousness in her. She's about the only A list female star from that era whom I find sexy. Sadly, the tunes on this cd suffer from lackluster arrangements. I agree with one reviewer about the same songs being more exciting in the films. I believe that this is so for most of the singers in film from that era. The studio recordings are never as exciting or beautiful as the arrangements on the soundtracks. Don't waste your time with this cd. If you enjoy Alice Faye, buy her movies whenever they are available on dvd. I even own the Shirley Temple one that Alice Faye is in, \\"Poor Litte Rich Girl,\\" just to watch her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every tripod should have one","review":"This is a must-have utility for any tripod.

It just attaches to a center post via a large rubber strap. You can even leave it attached if you don't mind not lowering the center post all the way.You don't have to have a Bogen tripod to use this. It should fit any tripod. Even if your center post is too small for the rubber strap to grip, you could easily come up with a make-shift way of holding it.But I have to say, get them while you can.

Army wives have a hard life and this book shows that Army wives really do have the toughest job in the Army."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Read","review":"I have to disagree with what almost everyone else said. The important thing to understand about this book is that it is journalistic non-fiction. Everything in this book actually took place. The book was written during prior to the post-deployment checklists, which spurred from the exposure of the murders at Ft. Bragg. I understand that many military spouses were offended by some of the events of the book, but these are still women. I am an Army wife myself, and though I may not have lived these experiences, I can relate to a number of the different people covered in this book. I didn't finish the book depressed. I found it rather enlightening to see into the different lives of these women.

This book was very well written, but very depressing. I'm glad that there are military women on here who have left feedback telling how happy they are, because otherwise I would have thought that all women or men who marry someone in the military are living in total fear and depression. I'm sad that these terrible things happened to these people, but as other people on here have said, it's a book based on a short amount of time in one town, and it's not a complete picture.

The people who really know Lynn Cory probably aren't surprised at the narcissistic description of the death of her husband and her army wife life. It definitely shows that it is all about Andrea Lynn and that she was the only one who suffered in the loss of a great man.If I were her I would be embarrassed for people who know her to read this because it validates what many people think about her and how she continues to showboat the death of her husband and the father of her four children.

If you're complaining that the camera is bad, then why did you buy a camera phone in the first place? One problem I noticed with this phone is the speakerphone. You can only use it in a completely silent place. It is even hard to hear the other person on very windy days. Another flaw is the fact that you can't use your recorded sounds as ringtones, and I have heard many owners of this phone complaining about this.

Significant portions of the process are glossed over: within six pages, the author has covered selecting, jointing, thicknessing the soundboard (2 pages), making and fitting the rosette (1 page), carving and installing top braces (steel string & classical 2 pages each). While some modern techniques are mentioned, such as use of a side bender, generally the information is too incomplete to be helpful to a novice. Also, throughout the book the author refers to jigs for which no instructions for assembly or use have been given. I'm not sure who the target audience of this volume is intended to be, but as an educated student, I found little need for its insights, and imagining myself without any knowledge, I was glad to have read Cumpiano's excellent book beforehand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great theory book","review":"I use this book for my design classes.

I earlier bought a number of other French language books, but still found gaps that I needed to fill in. Now that I have this book, I hardly use the others.

The graphics and audio are realistic and altogether awesome. However, as previously stated, this game is DEFINITELY not for children (too much blood, sex, and graphic language). In addition, know that you have to have a pretty fast computer to run this game smoothly. I have a Dell with a 2 ghz processor and the game occasionally skips.

I can appreciate the \\"Vampire mythos\\", but this game has a problem with execution. Overall the plot and storyline was ok, but I couldn't tolerate the bugginess.

IT shouldnt take 3 minutes to load a game,go inside a building,etc. And even with the patches a few of the quests were still bugged and couldnt be completed.

But it was still good enough for me to play through seven times, breaking the previous record (five) set by Max Payne.

I've emailed tech support, downloaded a patch, and perused their problem board all to no avail. Now Doom3 works fine on my system. I dislike their solution, though I tried it, of changing my registry. I think software companies shouldnt even dream of suggesting to customers that they edit their registry. Instead, they should put out a playable game. As it stands, Vampire: Bloodlines, not only doesn't launch, it wasted hours of my time trying their solutions (including putting my desktop in 800x600 although the game box says they support 1200x1600). What gives here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart at the End","review":"Great game, until it devolves into a mindless beat-em up with wave after wave of spawning enemies spamming you to death. It's like some other developer finished the game and turned it into a console button masher. And the switch to third person during hand-to-hand and melee combat doesn't help.It starts out great though, so if you can handle TONS of combat for the last third of this game (remember to put ALL exp. points into combat related skills during and after the much maligned sewer level) buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wont work on Windows 7","review":"This game looks fun so I gave it an extra star but if you have Windows 7 dont buy it becouse it wont work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too buggy","review":"I got this game about a year ago.

Ive heard the game is fun, but its hard to say. I suggest you think hard or wait til the price drops to invest in this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a Patch!!","review":"While this game is getting good reviews and promises to be great, it is hard to know because it seems to have been released too early. You cannot skip opening cut scenes, and the audio sync for these is extremely bad. According to the boards many others are having problems as well. With a newer computer designed for movies and games, this crashes before I ever get to game play. You will get a lot of inane suggestions like diagnose your DirectX or defragment your hard drive but the fact remains that this game is premature. If you get it good luck, there are others who can get it to work. It should be awesome, if you are one of the lucky few. I think there is a patch in the works. Save your money till then, or even wait a while till the price goes down. It should not take too long with this.

Write these down immediately when you start your real exam.4. Take Andy's practice exam and a couple of exams at PMStudy.com. Don't freak out if your practice score aren't very high.5.

Calling themselves \\"sonic folk core,\\" the talented Elbo Finn is just that. They are a folk rock foursome with hard-core punk roots and some very interesting sonic experimentation (with the lead guitarist playing an accoustic run through all sorts of effects). This tightly-meshed band has been playing together for nearly a decade and it shows. They have songs that bring U2 and Radiohead to mind, yet manage to, at the same time, sound like nothing you've ever heard before.This may very well be Elbo Finn's last album, as they are currently on hiatus after losing thier basist. I highly recommend you snatch any copies you can find of their albums, because, as hard as they are to find, the soon will be harder.The only complaint I have about this album is that it's too short. Four songs just isn't enough to get your Elbo Finn fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"Recently, I traveled to Ireland and spent 9 days in Dublin and found this guide a wealth of information. The tour of the Viking part of the city was great for also getting to know your way around. Pat lays out the guide in such a way, you soon realize how small a city Dublin really is and how easy it is to walk around. The different neighborhoods and favors they present. There is much more to Dublin than Temple Bar.I lucked into Pat Liddy a few days later. The tour was a general overview of the city which included an active Viking dig site that was gone a later in the week. Dublin has so many faces for the traveler, a intimate guide is a blessing since it helps you to see below the surface.

You can definitely pick out Edge's notorious guitar work and Bono's vocals really energize the music.

Roberston has always written great songs (see The Band) but here he out does himsef songs like, Broken Arrow and Somewhere Down the Crazy River, prove that he has lost nothing as he has aged, and has in fact gotten better with age. The only problem with Robbie is that he takes more time in between albums then Springsteen i.e. 5 to 6 years.By this album if you do not like it you have no taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant, Haunting nearly Spiritual Experience","review":"Many albums contain one or two songs which are worth listening to. This album does contain a couple of stand out songs incuding \\"American Roulette\\" and \\"Somewhere Down the Crazy River,\\" but is one of those rare gems which doesn't have a wasted note. Robertson's voice is spectral and haunting. The music is lush, driven by an insistent almost Native American drum beat and punctuated by an electric guitar which almost speaks, and leaves you breathing hard not from the notes it plays, but from the notes it doesn't play. This album is almost a spiritual experience. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie is DA MAN!!!!","review":"Robertson is a gifted songwriter and as it turns out a wonderful singer also.

But know that it is very slippery at the bottom and if you have wood floors like me, it will move constantly while dancing on it.Also, the material is plastic, and not the same kind that comes with the game, which is shiny and somewhat durable. No, this plastic is not as high quality. And it doesn't lay flat on the floor like the OEM pad. The edges peel up. This could possibly be fixed by leaving the pad unfolded for a long period of time, but I don't want to do that. And as someone mentioned before, the buttons are not at all elevated, so you can lose your orientation easily while playing.I rate this a 2/5 because it is still useable, though it is very annoying. Avoid if possible.

That is when Rhino re-released all of the Monkee albums. Some even did better on the charts. For example Changes, which only featured Micky and Davy. In 1969 the original release of Changes failed to chart, however, the re-release broke the top 100 at number 98.Then in the mid 1990s Rhino re-re-released the albums again with bonus material. After buying all of those, along with all three Missing Links albums, I had almost every song the Monkees ever recorded.Then in the 2000s Rhino re-re-re-released some of the albums again with remixes of the remixes, and missing parts to some of the missing songs, with box sets and deluxe editions... That to me is just getting completely out of hand.Rhino should just keep things simple by keeping the albums with bonus material available and call it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkees Unleashed","review":"This was the first of the Monkees albums in which they were loosened from the controls of the Don Kirshner music machine, and the results were surprisingly good. There is an energy and freshness about the album that is catching; these are creative people enjoying artistic freedom for the first time. For the first time, they are a real band, not just the manufactured TV band, and the enjoyment of the experience is impossible to miss and is just as enjoyable to hear. There are no weak songs; even Davy Jones, not my favorite, has a couple of good ones (including the vastly underrated \\"Early Morning Blues and Greens\\", in my estimation one of his best). Only \\"Pisces, Aquarius\\" and \\"Head\\" are better Monkees albums. Never again would they be this tight as a group; like the Beatles, after this album they would gradually drift apart. A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Monkees fire Donny Kirshner and the outcome is this...","review":"a kicking album with a 60s garage band feel to it.

Included was 'Headquarters'. I ordered another copy immediately. I venture to say 'Headquarters' would be labeled an indie pop masterpiece had it been released now by a bunch of no names. And, in a lot of ways it was the 'first' album by this bunch of no named musicians who happened to have a hit TV series in the bank.

Not surprisingly, the album has a garage-band feel and a refreshing sense of freedom, with Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork, Mike Nesmith and Davy Jones performing on every track. \\"No Time,\\" \\"For Pete's Sake\\" and \\"Randy Scouse Git\\" (which became a hit single in Britain) are particular standouts, along with Nesmith's \\"You Told Me\\" and \\"You Just May Be the One.\\" The overall quality of \\"Headquarters\\" proves that the Monkees were talented individuals - not bubble-gum throwaways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their first great record","review":"Although the Monkees first two LPs were good, this was their first great record -- and probably their best (It's a toss-up between this one and 'Pisces, Aquarius....').If only for the reason that this is the first Monkees record to feature the band playing their own instruments, it would always be considered a success. But they not only play capably, they actually managed to make an important record of serious music, superior to their previous efforts done with professional musicians. Nothing they had done previously compares with the likes of 'Shades of Gray' or 'For Pete's Sake'.The record is full of gems ('You Just May Be The One', \\"Randy Scouse Git', 'Early Morning Blues and Greens') and the bonus tracks are fantastic.

Peter pulls off a passable vocal on the wonderful \\"Shades Of Gray\\" and contributes the popular \\"For Pete's Sake\\", which closed the show the second season. Micky sings the establishment-bashing \\"Randy Scouse Git\\" and Davy sings the love-gone-wrong \\"Forget That Girl\\" and the mellow \\"Early Morning Blues and Greens\\".

All is well as my friend said it is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"grower\\" from Voivod","review":"I have never come close to fully appreciating a Voivod cd on the first listen. Their music is just too unorthodox and complex to grab you immediately. The payoff, though, is that I am usually blown away eventually and never get bored with the album after that, no matter how much I listen to it. This cd is different from their earlier albums, but it is still one of those cds that needs to grow on you--and it really does. When I first heard it, I actually thought it was pretty lame and not even worth keeping. Now it blows me away with the intensity in every song. It flat-out rocks. The playing, the vocals, and the lyrics are all outstanding. I definitely consider this to be an essential part of any Voivod collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What should have followed The Outer Limits.","review":"When Belanger left Voivod, so did I. When he came back, so did I. The players have matured and they sound great together.The addition of Newsted didn't spur me to buy it any faster. But he fits perfectly in the trademark sound and he's better off here. He always seemed like a replacement in Metallica and not a very happy one. He's a metal guy. Voivod is metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voivod is back!","review":"For the first time in almost 10 years, I'm excited about a Voivod album. After junk like Negraton (every song sounds the same). Kronik (throwaway) and Phobos (weird, but EF is just terrible for this band), it's great to see Snake back at the microphone. His weird style just FITS in this band and along with Jason Newsted (who has brought that BLACKY bass back!) this band seems to have more energy than ever before!!! Best tracks are:\\"Divine Sun\\" - This song has all the best elements of Voivod. Spaced out guitar, robotic vocals and that dissonance we Love Piggy for.\\"We Carry On\\" - Very catchy. It's like \\"Fix My Heart\\", but heavier.\\"Reactor\\" - For Snakes vocals alone, this track rocks. Great chugging guitar mixed with Snakes \\"I'm on serious drugs\\" vocals are pure perfection!Overall, this album is a combination of all the best elements of Dimension Hatross/Nothingface/Angel Rat and Outer Limits.Awesome stuff!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"complete loss of respect","review":"Enter Jason NuKid and gone are all of the qualities that made Vo*vod unique. Press quote him as saying their \\"comeback\\" (where did they go? Phobos was their best since Nothingface musically... very cosmic and more massive than tectonic shifting) \\"should\\" be more \\"direct\\", \\"straightforward\\" and \\"less conceptual\\"... It is definitely ALL of that, it is an even further regression into commercial retardation than the really terrible songs on Angel Rat and The Outer Limits... Goodbye to Piggy's cosmic dissonance scattered with sparkling harmonics, Away's broken robot percussion... even Snake's vocals are melodically poor and annoying... At least the new King Crimson is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pap.","review":"Too poppy. Not nearly as good as the older stuff. Where did all the dissonance go?

I totally agree with the reviewer below who mentions growing up with \\"Killing Technology\\" era Voivod. This cd may be better than most of the crap pumped out nowadays but it doesn't hold a candle to anything Voivod did with Snake on vox before. Check out any other Voivod title , in fact go get the \\"best of\\" on Amazon if you need a primer.What happened to newsted corrupting all these bands? Metallica, Echobrain, Voivod .... yeeesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you guys are nuts","review":"I recently picked this up after seeing the review on allmusic.com. Hadn't listened to Voivod for quite a while, but was really looking forward to it, fondly remembering Nothingface, Angel Rat, Hatross, etc. If this was to be a return to form, I was all for it.Unfortunately, this album is dreck. A steaming pile. Anyone who gives this over two stars is either delusional or lying. The truth? One star, for any objective listener. Two stars, if you're tied to the band emotionally and can't face reality. You're out of your mind if you spend money for this. I've already cut mine to pieces and thrown it in the trash so no one else will be subjected to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Back during the golden age of metal, I bought Nothingface on a blind purchase. It wasn't the type of metal I typically listened to, but I really liked the sound of it. Angel Rat was a little more diappointing with only a couple tracks that stood out in my mind. I sold Outer Limits a few weeks after buying it because nothing stood out at all. It just sounded like what I would label as \\"progressive rock\\".I didn't give Voivod another glance after that until I heard about this album. The return of their lead vocals was interesting enough, but I really hoped Jason Newsted would bring a new dimension to the group possibly putting his bass talents more up front. Going by memory, all I can say is this sounds the same as Outer Limits. Unless you're hardcore Voivod fan, this album may just collect dust in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I had read some of McKenna's books and liked them enough to buy this one without seeing any reviews first.

This fabulous piece is actually about 46 pieces packed in a box for you to put together. It's my guess that this is why it is one of the more affordable (of the better) projector mounts out there, as the buyer IS the laborer. -- That said, it is not difficult (just a little more time consuming than I had planned) and is a VERY GOOD mount! I think that it says something like \\"30lb capacity\\", but really, seriously, I think that you could hang a Ford Escort from the thing! It is very well designed, infinitely adabptable, and I was even able to modify it to do something (fit something) that at first I thought less than likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally inadequate screws","review":"Otherwise well-made, but suffers from a fatal flaw that makes it virtually useless. Pitch and yaw adjustment are done by loosening and tightening two small screws on each side of the mount. The screws strip very easily, so you can't tighten them with much force, and even as tight as you can get them, the slightest bump to the projector will knock it off-balance (and my PJ is well under the 25-pound weight limit). This mount would have been far better without the ability to adjust pitch and yaw at all. Go with a geared mounting system instead (PRG-UNV)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing CD","review":"I have been a Stan Kenton fan for over 40 years.The music on this CD took me really by surprise.It doesn't sound like Stan Kenton at all.The arrangements are so different from the Stan Kenton music ,I have heard and loved over the years.Stan used the best arrangers, from Russo and Holman to Niehaus and others. The only tracks worth listening to, are \\"Invitation\\", \\"This Hotel\\", \\"Interchange\\" and perhaps \\" Gloomy sunday\\".Only these tracks are reminiscent of the typical Kenton sound.Except for Stan's piano, no other instrumental solos are heard. I have always found Kenton's music unique and easily recognizable.This CD is an exception.My favorite track is \\"Invitation\\" and this will remind you of the music on \\"The Ballad Style Of Stan Kenton\\",where the piano is heard as a solo instrument amidst lush sax orchestrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"Its simple, well-illustrated explanations make understanding and implementation easy.

She was nearly 16, feeble, and fading fast, plagued by the multiple problems that come with old age. But she had such a huge heart. I believe she was staying alive for me, even though she was probably in a lot of pain (but she never complained).

This is not really made for anything beyond halves so I won't fault the product on this inability - so I was back to the razorblade for the smaller pieces.In any case, the darn thing has a flexible piece of plastic that works as some sort of \\"hinge\\" and this came loose after about the 10th use and I never was able to put it back and have it work right - this is why I must give it a low star rating as it basically fell apart quickly.

Splits pills easily, and there's a receptacle that holds the halves. I can split a 30 day supply in much, much less time that using a knife, and they are all cut evenly and cleanly.My only complaint is that the pill holding area is covered with a non-slip pad. Sounds like a good idea, but it also makes it difficult at times to position the pill properly, especially the small ones. They stick to the covering and maneuvering them into the correct position can sometimes be frustrating.The build quality is so-so - I don't expect this is something that will last for years and years.

What I mostly liked about the novel was the main character. He was a hit man with a conscience. The protagonist did a great deal of developing throughout the story. Even the main antagonist, the target of the hit had a real human element to him. The story was well conceived, but the characters are what really brought it home for me. There was a lot to like about this novel.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel for a WWII buff.....","review":"I just picked this book off the shelf, never heard of Deaver.Great writer, gets to the point quickly & keeps it interesting.This is a great book for folks who like WWII, The Mafia, Spies etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long time","review":"whoever gave this book anything three stars or below should read more books. I loved this book and it was a gateway into other Deaver novels for me (Lincoln Rhyme series).I dont really need to go into the plot because everyone else wrote it already. Schumann was a great protagonist, he's a guy you really want to root for. I liked how Deaver mixed the Fictitious characters with real people from the 30's (Ex.: Hitler, Jesse Owens). Deaver also made you like Schumanns antagonists like the Kripo officer Willi Kohl and Schumanns target, Reinhard Ernst. The plotline was just loaded with twists. The first half of the book was pretty predictable with a few twists, but in the second half when the identity of \\"Taggart\\" (those who have read the book can understand who im talkin about) is revealed, the pace of the book totally changed, and it almost seemed impossible for Schumann to win.

For all the rest of us needing some insight into how best to apply Python to problems of any complexity, there is no more appropriate book out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult reading ...","review":"It is interesting to note that the Mar. 1 review is by the author of the book, who fails to identify himself in the review and gives himself a 5 star rating.I bought this book and The Complete Python Reference at the same time, and read this book second. Some of my impressions are tainted by this order, since The Complete Python Reference is so well constructed and written.Python Programming Patterns seemed like a title looking for a book, when you get inside of it. I was hoping for an more advanced/coherent treatment of the subject, but got a jumbled-up collection of the obligatory OO discusions found everywhere, basic Python coding treated better elsewhere, and examples from fringe applications that were tedious to follow without specific knowledge of that application.I scanned it and put it on the bookshelf for one of those days when I've exhausted all other resources and have to open it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book, disappointing author","review":"I was disappointed in this book for essentially the same reasons as Stephen Ferg (see his review dated Dec. 19/2001). I find that the book does not do justice to the 'Patterns' buzzword.I suggest you read Stephen's review before you buy this book. I will not rewrite the same comments here. The reason I am writing this review is to say that I find unacceptable that the author would review his own book here, not clearly identify himself as the author, give it 5 stars, and be so vain in his review. I believe in modesty and letting the readers decide for themselves (isn't this what Amazon's review system is for?) as opposed to what the author has done here. Also, as of this writing there is only one person who voted Stephen's review to be 'not helpful' -- and I would not be surprised in the least if it was the author himself put in that vote..!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"There is a need for a decent book on Python OOP and patterns, but this is not it.

The book has chapters, but you just can't jump to them!And the maps suck! You can't zoom the maps in the book - they just pixilate from being enlarged too much for their resolution. A note at the beginning of the book gives you a Frommer's web site to go to download pdf versions of all the maps in the book (which I did), but then they are completely disconnected from the book.

I bought it anyway because I needed to fix a chain and had no tool available.)I continued to use this tool on a few more chains. The driving threads quickly stripped and both plates that brace the chain bent. This was due to the metal being too soft for the intended application, exacerbated by the improper alignment of the driving mechanism. (Probably put undue force on the plates, but whatever who cares - just know it does not work.)This tool is junk.

Great production, great songs, and a great flow, moving from strength to strength. This CD contains the best song they recorded: Roll Over Me. Back when I played the LP though, I always started at track 2, as Ready Freddy sounded awful in 1972 and still does. What a downer, and what a way to begin. Jay had a voice right in line with other vaguely sexless vocalists of that time, but here he just sounds like a eunuch. Yeech.But play Roll Over Me with that dreaded volume knob as far to the right as your aged ears (and maybe aged neighbors as well) can bear. Not just nostalgia, not just pining for a hazy past, but downright solid rock and roll. These guys could boogie.

However, at least now I have Carter the unstoppable sex machine to stay with me all night.Among all the tracks, \\"The wrong place at the wrong time\\" is my favorite.

So, my Amazon purchase of $219 got me viewings of about 10 dvds and now its a - rather crummy - cd player. I thought that the speakers were actually pretty poor quality, but figured they would do for movies, I certainly wouldn't listen to quality music on them.

Bob Villa couldn't even install this gate properly. It's designed so badly, even if it were perfectly installed, it could never operate as advertised.

The latch bolts cannot be screwed into the gate far enough because the nuts welded into the gates are not aligned properly. Additionally, plastic support hinges are too weak.

I will get a different brand instead of this one, and suggest others do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","review":"This is absolutely the WORST gate I have ever bought and wish I had never laid eyes on it! The thing falls off the wall because it is METAL and far too heavy for the PLASTIC parts used to \\"secure\\" it to the wall, it does not close and latch properly, is easily pushed or pulled open even by my little 15-month-old, and the \\"lock\\" (also plastic) snapped off after only 1 week of use, so it will not even stay locked now. The hinges used to hold it onto the wall do not stay clamped together and when you lift it to swing it open, it pops right off and the springs go flying and the gate falls to the floor.

It took my husband around two hours to properly install it and the next day the hardware came out the wall.. he fixed it again, this time putting anchors in the walls. A few hours after that my 13 month old figured out how to open it. About a week after buying and installing it, it completely fell on our brand new hardwood floors and gashed them badly!

Returning it for a refund and picking up an Evenflo Top of Stairs Gate. CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up!","review":"I bought this gate based on the metal construction, ability to screw securely to the wall and the alarm feature. Once I got it home I found that the locking mechanism is very poorly designed. The locking latch pivots on a center pin with a spring to return it to the locked position. The only problem is that the spring isn't strong enough to return the latch to it's home position which allows the gate to be opened without having to use the latch - which kind of defeats the purpose of the lock to start with.Spend the extra 5 bucks and get the Safeway gate - a friend has it and it actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible gate","review":"This is a terrible gate. It neither opens nor closes with ease. Opening the gate requires both hands and a foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"we hate it!!","review":"We purchased this gate for the top of a wide staircase- liked that it was wider than most gates and would fit securely. My husband is very handy and it still took 1 1/2 hours (and much swearing) to put it in. Now that it's in, we find that it is taking both hands and a foot to get it open- probably because it is so wide, but it is hard to use! The screws were cheap, the wall mounts are plastic, and the latch is too difficult to open with one hand (as advertised on the box!!). I wish I had read all the reviews before I purchased it- now my husband is removing the gate so that we can take another trip back to Babies R Us! Save yourself a trip and don't buy this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't purchase this gate","review":"This gate has not worked for us since we purchased it. It took us over 2 hours to install. Now that it is installed, the latch doesn't not keep the gate securely in place. The latch gets stuck and won't pop out to hold the gate in place. We have even received a 2nd latch from the company, and it still doesn't work. The alarm doesn't work very well either. It is supposed to give us 10 seconds to close the gate after opening it, it is a very fast 5 second count sometimes. I would not recommend purchasing this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself a HUGE headache and don't buy this item","review":"We purchased this safety gate for the top of our staircase last week and should have returned it the moment we opened the box. The directions were horrible, items pictured did not match what was in the box and we actually had to take apart the top latch to install it. We finally got this gate installed and 2 days later the latch broke - I couldn't even shut off the alarm! So now we're left with holes in the wall and a lot of time wasted on a product that should not be trusted to help keep your kids safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gate is terrible","review":"It was very hard to install. The alarm is annoying, especially when trying to install the gate. The attachements are flimsy. When the gate is open you have two very long metal bolts sticking out. We had company over and as he was walking past the gate the bottom bolt latch scratched his leg bad. Sometimes we like to leave the gate open but it is too dangerous with the two bolt latches sticking out. Very bad design! We have had to redo the the attachements to the walls several times because they keep coming loose. I think the gate is too heavy for them. I hate this gate and it is coming down today. I am going to try the All clear swing gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL!!!","review":"My nine month old has yet to test the durability of this gate. I just installed it last night. IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO INSTALL! Even with help from another person, it took two of us well over one hour to get the gate up and aligned. I did have to drill several holes into the wood banister before it was properly secured. My patience was nearly exhausted! It may be worth the effort in the long run, I will know soon, but I would not recommend this product to anyone short on patience or time. I cannot imagine that my son will be able to break through or climb over. I do not think I could either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply constructed","review":"Bought the gate without the alarm (but as I see it's no longer available, I'm writing about this version) with high expectations. The gate had decent reviews and it had 'free shipping!' First warning should have been the obvious 'made in China' label on the top of the gate (with all the product problems from China I'm seriously wondering if I have a product with lead paint). It went downhill from there. The instructions were difficult to follow (I've put together lots of things for my kids and these weren't very clear). The hardware to fasten it to the walls was flimsy. Screws were short and the drywall hardware pulled right out while just opening/closing it. Speaking of which, the open/close isn't that easy to do, even for an adult. I'm not bothering to return it (wouldn't be cost effective with shipping and their 50% max value return policy) and may donate it to someone with a pet -- with the warning that if they put the gate up in a high traffic area it'll be a pain to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would NEVER put this gate near stairs!!!!!","review":"I thought this gate was the perfect solution for our new house. We wanted it to block kids/dogs from the office. The dog (lab) figured out how to open it within days. The latch on the alarm broke within months of installation which not only allows for easy opening, the alarm had to be disconnected without the latch! I am very glad we just needed it for a doorway and not the top of the stairs. My recommendation, buy a different gate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Bought this gate and installed it - my husband is very mechanical and figured it out quickly. The gate seems well but does not last. It is now the third day after installation and I can tell you that the gate itself is great - the hardware to attach it is EXTREMELY inadequate - the plastic to metal does not hold up. Tonight it completely came off all its hinges because the hardware is not secure. At the same time we purchased this gate we purchased a different gate for the bottom of the stairs and it is functioning perfectly. If they would just change the hardware from plastic to metal this gate would be a winner. We wish it would have worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step Away from the Gate","review":"This gate is simply worthless. After wasting two hours of my Labor Day, I finally have it attached to the wall. Using the templates was worthless, as they didn't match up correctly. After drilling countless holes in the wall, I finally found a semi-straight alignment. Now the gate doesn't close without using significant pressure, and it takes two hands and a foot for my wife to get it open.This gate was designed by a very cruel individual who likes to make parents suffer.Stay far away from this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS!!","review":"We've had this gate for a few months now. It started out great but now the latches mounted on the wall are coming apart. the gate regularly falls off it's hinges, yesterday it landed on my 6 yr ols bare toes!!! My year old can now tug it open even when in a locked position.So not worth the $$$. Keep looking if you want a gate that will last and be safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gate - Wouldn't Buy any other Brand","review":"We love this gate so much I just bought our third one. We do not need the alarm option, but we have one at the marble entryway, one going into our kitchen, and now one at the top of our stairs. I will admit that the plastic mechanism did break on one of our gates. But, after a quick call to the manufacturer, they sent us the replacement, newly designed metal ones free of charge. They sent us enough for all of our gates. Each gate took about 30 minutes to install and the templates worked perfect. I don't know what was wrong with all of you out there that say your templates didn't work. We've used the same template on all three and it worked perfect the first time. I would refer all of my new Mom's and Dad's to purchase this gate without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this gate!! Why so many bad reviews?","review":"I don't understand why this gate has had so many bad reviews. We have several, for our many stairways, and absolutely love them. The installation does take a little while but that's the case with pretty much any hardware mounted gate. One thing I've noticed is that you MUST tighten the bolts with a wrench. If you try to do it by hand, they WILL come loose and that will compromise the function of the gate. It is also very important to use the lock on top. This prevents the gate from being \\"forced\\" open. The other thing I love is the alarm feature! It gives peace of mind, just in case somebody forgets to lock the top and a little one does get it open. To my knowledge, there is no other gate out there with an alarm. Just use the gate as the instructions say and it is wonderful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT!!!!","review":"I hate this gate!!

I'm sure the singers were thrilling to hear alive in the glorious Civil War Memorial Hall, but the sound you'll hear in your living space will be rumbly and distorted, and the interpretation falls short of professional energy and polish.If you want to get a measure of Lotti's genius, I can recommend the recent Deutsche Harmonia Mundi recordinh \\"Lotti Zelenka Bach\\" performed by the Balthasar-Neuman Choir and Ensemble.

Red marker is useful for aligning hood for quick installation. Inside petals have a matte layer to prevent internal light reflections into the lens. Cheaper aftermarket hoods may not have this additional matte layer. You will not be able to use the stock lens cap with this hood installed so think about upgrading to an aftermarket center-pinched snap-on lens cap and most will come with a very useful tether string so you don't misplace the lens cap. In addition, you will not be able to use the internal flash on the 450D/XSi with the hood attached to the 18-200mm lens because the upper petal will cast a shadow anything above 80mm zoom. Maybe the 40D/50D does not have this issue?

After purchasing it I ripped it open and popped it in my CD player for the drive home. Though it's not the catchy, pop sounds of \\"Leaving Through The Window,\\" I'm still highly impressed. This CD has so much more emotion, and is full of beautiful lyrics. While \\"Leaving Through The Window\\" remains my all time favorite, \\"North\\" is an awesome CD. If you've never heard SoCo before buy LTTW first. After you get into their sound pick up North and see what you think. My favorite songs off this would have to be their single, \\"Space,\\" and also \\"Ruthless,\\" and \\"21 and Invisible.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Corporate is back!","review":"Something Corporate's new album North is another exceptional \\"emo\\" album. Their style and their piano makes them a unique taste among the now common emo band. This CD is much lighter than Leaving Through the Window, and also much shorter (just around 40 minutes). Most of the songs have a tendency to be lighter, with more emphasis placed on the vocals. This is an interesting change for Something Corporate that comes with mixed results. Although the vocals sound better, and the lyrics are meaningful, Leaving Through the Window's heavier style brought more emotion to the vocals. The number of songs I would consider \\"amazing\\" are much less numbered in SoCo's newest. However, trying out new styles is part of a band's growth, and we can hope that SoCo will learn from this album and grow in their next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoa this is odd","review":"i was surprised, this cd was a big disapointment. comapred to leaving thru the window its really crappy. thats being generous"},{"rating":"2","title":"SoCo Should Win a Bunch of MTV Music Awards","review":"Jus' Listen!

In other words, rock filled with emotions, making it more like pop. This is a good album for whoever enjoys emo rock, however, is horrible for any who enjoys fast-paced, hard rock.The songs about lost love and girlfriends turn off many rockers. Where's the hatred and violent emotions rock was made to express? This CD is too slow, too boring. It is in no way original. They have no style that differentiates them from the rest of the pop trash.In the end, if this is your genre of music, it's worth a look at. Otherwise, I suggest you find more stylistic bands, like Alkaline Trio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barf.","review":"Repetitive. Nauseating.

But I spent like 6 dollars on the new album (it was originally like 8, but was on sale for 6 and im glad i didnt waste anymore money on it then 6) and it SUCKED. I listened to it like once through and i NEVER want to listen to it through again. the only good song on it is \\"Space\\".

Give me space so you can drown in the vomit with me.This CD is so weak and annoying. Even though the cd \\"Leaving Through the Window\\" was nothing to brag about, at least it wasn't this bad. Something Corporate is so boring to listen to. All of their songs sound the same and they all suck really bad. For that guy who said \\"they have yet to write a bad song\\" or something like that, I have yet to see them write a decent song. But nobody will listen to me.

They set the bar high, and in their sophomore album did there very best to get as far from even equalling their past effort. North is a flop of the highest order. When the band has a chorus worth shouting - the Anthem worthy \\"Space\\" - they stop after one go around and kick it back into a low gear. Not a smooth transition and not a good song. Furthermore, the entire first half of the album, with the exception of \\"She Paints Me Blue,\\" is convuluted. The best tracks come with \\"Ruthless\\" and everything after. Too bad the band decided to embody the concept of sophomore slump. Maybe they can break off into side projects and do something worthwhile, or at least try to recapture their original magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"punk chilling music\\"","review":"really like this cd, first and only cd i have heared from them. First off it is a lot easier to listen to compared to a lot of other types of music i listen to like offspring, autopilot off, or seether. None the less it is a good cd.

Check them out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful compared to their earlier work","review":"If you're looking for the SoCo sound of Ready...Break!, Leaving Through The Window, or Audioboxer, this is not for you.\\"North\\" does nothing more than predict Andrew McMahon's betrayal of SoCo's fans... it sounds like Jack's Mannequin, not SoCo.In my opinion, Andrew's vocal and piano style doesn't fit the darker, more serious mood of \\"North\\" or the Jack's Mannequin material. It sounds very forced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Their Niche","review":"On this album, Something Corporate definitely finds a blend of pop/punk beginnings and mature piano melodies. About half of the tracks are soft and reflective, while others are noticeably louder rock songs. SC does do a good job at alternating between the two styles, so that while you may drift away to the piano, you're woken up by the next song's guitars. Like \\"Leaving Through The Window\\", the radio release on \\"North\\", the second song \\"Space\\", can immediately be identified as just that, a radio release -- it is distinctly different from the rest of the album. Best songs on this CD include (1) \\"As You Sleep\\", (3) \\"Down\\", (7) \\"Ruthless\\", and (10) \\"I Won't Make You.\\" No matter what, you'll be sure to find something on this album that you'll enjoy and can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Corporate-North","review":"I also thought that this cd didn't live up to Leaving through the Window, but now that ive listened to it for on and off for about a month, I disagree.

Their newest CD, \\"North\\" is not your average rock band CD, they went beyond the normal guitar, but to a new level of using the piano. I personally think that this new CD is different, but definitely very good. Some of my favorite songs are \\"As You Sleep\\" and \\"Ruthless.\\" If they keep up their new change to rock, they will stay on top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Corporate *North*","review":"After a hard act to follow with \\"Leaving through the Window\\", Something Corporate has managed to do what many artists are unable to achieve with their sophomore album...that is they have produced something even better with more maturity and creativity than the first. \\"North\\" has proven itself to be a turning point in this band's career, leading them in nothing but a positive direction. The melodic tracks and intense lyrics truly define this album as an artist's album, and it is apparent through the emotion and feelings that are expressed in songs like \\"Me and the Moon\\" and \\"Only Ashes\\". North is undoubtedly a must have in any CD collection, as it is a refreshing dose of genuine talent and quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varied & Original","review":"\\"North\\" is an incredibly varied and original set of tunes. \\"As You Sleep\\" has a beautiful melody with Andrew McMahon's piano chiming ethereally throughout the track. \\"Balls of fire burning up the black space, falling from the landscape, exploding in the face of God,\\" McMahon sings with a repetitive tune that nevertheless builds giving a sense of both routine and expansion. \\"Ruthless\\" is also an exceptionally good track with its wistful verses and electric chorus, \\"If I built you a city, would you let me? Would you tear it down?\\" My favorite track is \\"She Paints Me Blue\\" with McMahon's piano equally beautiful and dissonant, \\"You're my good feeling.\\" \\"Break Myself\\" has a great anthematic feel to its guitar storm chorus. \\"North\\" is a great set with numerous sparkling tracks. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall cd","review":"This cd is great, dont get me wrong. i think that my views on this cd were jaded by \\"leaving through the window.\\" that cd was amazing all around and \\"north\\" isnt quite as good. im sure this cd will eventually grow on me more, but as first impressions its not as good, its diffrent. overall, this is a generally calmer and low key cd, but thats not a bad thing. my favorite songs are \\"she paints me blue,\\" \\"me and the moon,\\" and \\"ruthless.\\" something corporate has the best ballads ever by far. if you liked \\"leaving through the window\\" then i advise you to buy this one also, it may be a shock at first, but its still amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"torn & frayed","review":"Excellent.

The songs blend together a bit more, and the lyrics didn't seem as poignant. It took me a little while to realize that they just seem more mature this time around. The melodies are *gorgeous*, the lyrics take a bit more time to sink in and be interpreted, and the piano.. yum, there's nothing better. 'Only Ashes' and 'Me and the Moon' are my favorites, but there isn't one distinctly 'worst' track on the album at all. This is a *perfect* driving album."},{"rating":"2","title":"North","review":"This CD is very well made. First off I would like to say I couldn't stand punk rock music until I heard Something Corporate. I am a major Zeppelin fan and the first day I got this CD I listened to it for 9 hours straight. As you enter As You Sleep you are drawn in by the amazing piano part and the vocals are incredible. Each song flows into the next one without hesitation and keeps the listener at ease. Although in the past Something Corporate did harder music they have proved they can pull off slow songs as well. I highly reccomend this CD for anyone that is into the \\"punk rock\\" scene or even rock scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"A emo's dream","review":"Although previous reviews say this is a bad or pop cd, wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its great and the lyrics are uber deep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DSP all the way .....","review":"I had the unfortunate experiance of having this book as my first book on DSP.

Somebody in production at the publisher should be very unhappy with themselves (or an overly ambitious editor with no real grasp of reality) for ever letting this onto the shelves. It would have been nicer with small metallic stars that would twinkle in light forever instead of dead little LEDs. Sort of like dead fairies. Nice try, but ultimately a failure.

This book is a self-examination of the processes Miller underwent during the '30's and 40's in Paris that allowed him to reach such an understanding. It uses language as never before used, except by only those writers deemed true \\"masters\\" (such as St. Augustine, Anais nin, DH Lawrence), and does away with the notion that obscenity has no place in art or literature. Noted for his courage and willingness to write about an unlimited ammount of experiences and subjects, this book is a rare gift to the human race. It will be remembered alongside the greatest works of art..

There is something very charming about such blunt, spare-no-feelings honesty. Tropic of Cancer is a brave, moving book that sweeps you in and carries you along through numerous ghoulish, unpleasent and ultimately hilarious episodes of wayward life in France in the late 1920s/early 1930s. These are experiences you would generally never have (regardless of futile efforts to try and recreate them). Here is a story of promiscuous sex, over-indulgence, vice, sin, love, hatred, art and any other obsession that temporarily occupies Miller's mind. It's really a great deal of fun.The writing is sometimes stunning, although at times it seems a bit too self-consciously hard-boiled and the usual monologue quality of the narrative scatters a little, becoming overly literary and therefore undermining to the otherwise spectacular consistancy of the confession.Four and a half stars, rounded down because once upon a time I wanted to hate it . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Happiest Man Alive.","review":"There's a reason they call him the \\"Happiest Man Alive\\". Reading this book, you're gonna find out why. A confession of sorts, Miller's writing reads like your favorite (dirty) old uncle telling you a bedtime story. This, along with \\"a.k.a.

It doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with this book","review":"is not the graphic sex or the coarseness of its language. It's the tedious, rambling, self-absorbed, incoherence of it. (Possible alternative title -- Diary of a Jerk.) It is, as they say, easy to put down. In the midst of that, it's still hard to ignore the oubursts of virulent misogyny and anti-semitism, which come across as genuine rather than as some sort of literary device. The ugliness of some of it seems impossible to justify as art. Though with or without the bigotry, the book might be hard to justify as art. (I'm fine with all manner of political incorrectness if it serves some purpose.) I can't really point to any redeeming qualities that outweigh all the negatives here. Miller was right when he himself said that it wasn't a book, just an insult, a gob of spit in the face. Take him at his word and skip this.

I decided to check this out and there are two things I can definitely say about it:1) Henry Miller is a master of language2) The book is EXTREMELY BORINGMiller paints such a vivid picture with words. The only problem is there's nothing interesting to describe. People sleep around and talk about doing things but never do them. And they complain about the copious amounts of sex they have. The characters are losers who do nothing. A waste of time.Miller's writing style and use of language are worth two stars. The rest of it is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST AMAZING NOVEL!","review":"I found this book to be far more interesting than simply for its explicit content.

He writes excellent prose and has been a major influence on writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in madness","review":"Miller’s erudite -- yet absurdist -- style reached its climax in this work. It’s perhaps pointless to comment on a book that declares in its first few lines that it is not a book but “a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art�? Indeed, while Miller comments brilliantly on just about every aspect of the human condition, he implies an insult, a ridicule of the structured classic schools of philosophy that pretend to achieve the same.Read it and experience the insult for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns through its capital quickly","review":"Finishing Tropic of Cancer is hard because you can stop reading any time you want, and I wanted to stop often. If I were cornered at a party by this guy, I would initially find him interesting. Soon, however, I would start to get annoyed and would be trying desperately to ditch him. He's boorish, boring, in love with himself, in love with not seeming to be in love with himself, in love with the illusion of being an artist. His ramblings occasionally feign a different direction but ultimately lead straight back to him. I loved Boswell's London Journal, and I guess I was just expecting a more believable, more endearingly flawed protagonist like that book had. This guy, though, is just an ass.This book may be daring and honest exposition and a landmark of literature, but after a couple dozen pages I had had enough.

We read this book on a recommendation from a friend and all came to the same conclusion- NEVER TAKE THE ADVICE OF THIS FRIEND AGAIN!The book was basically a long train of thought. It takes us through the ideas and ramblings of a man living in Paris. There is no actual plot and the characters are in and out of his ramblings with no logic.I have to say that there were certain themes to the book we picked up on. There was a lot of sex, food and going to the bathroom. The author/narrator was selfish and spent a lot of the book talking about how he got out of work, but still managed to eat and sleep with women.I did not enjoy this book at all and I'm surprised that it has such high reviews on Amazon, as I usually agree with most of the stars a book is given.

I bought the two sequels (Tropic of Capricorn and Black Spring) to this book in an auction this summer and finally broke down and bought this book. An extreme disappointment. The book was initially banned by the United States until 1961. The reason for this is that Henry Miller writes a narrative about his excursions in Paris during the 30's. He adopts the life of a penurious moocher whose life rotates around finding food and having sex with prostitutes. He also expounds on anti-American philosophy on life and why his way of life is right. This book gave me a large headache. I read half of it before I threw it across the room. The writing and flow was akin to a junior high school student's. Nice vocabulary and some of his statements were worthy of reading.

The author writes whatever comes to his mind, including citing his sexual perversities and sexual fantasies. Miller is a total lunatic with no real skill as a writer. You will find yourself dumber for having read this obscene exercise in ridiculous profanity.There are books that I may not like for any number of reasons yet I would recommend them based on the fact that other people will enjoy them because of their varied tastes.

Endlessly imitated, never duplicated, Miller's \\"classic\\" resists being for the many. The self-absorbed protagonist, a horrid little man (-- Can you hear Maggie Smith saying that? --) spends his life descending into the maelstrom of his existence to hone his own sense of nihilism. As his unwitting and unwilling observer, I was not thrilled (titillated? Don't make me laugh). But, hey, if you like this stuff... Tell you what: Read the first three pages.

The magic of language is aroused, and contrary to popular myth, it is not really all that shocking.

This book is kind of like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Miller rants in a rare infectious dribbling of honesty. At times brilliant, at times a drag, but \\"a beau jeu beau retour,\\" so I kept reading. We find an entertaining fill of whores and half-wits, garnished with frozen stools, the clap, and seasoned with strangely welcomed and altogether fitting mad nonsense. Writing armed with rhythm, the mind's ear can almost hear \\"Parlez-Moi d'Amour\\" spilling from a Parisian brothel gramophone. We find sex and despair, the human condition, an artist's hunger and constipation... fitting subjects spoken in appropriate voice. All in all, a decent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"tropic of cancer","review":"For everyone who thinks this is a \\"trashy\\" book, I urge you to take a second look at it. It is very well written, and when you don't take the language and some of the material to heart, it's a great story. All I heard about this book is that it was filthy, but the people who find it filthy don't understand that it's about someone's life. Truth be told, if the average person wrote a book about their life, it would most likely be deemed \\"filthy\\".

I don't even think his stories are very interesting. If I spent years in Europe essentially being a vagrant, I would hope that I'd come home with some better stories than Miller's; all he talks about is food and women's lady parts. I think this book, like a lot of other works of \\"art\\" from the last century, simply gained notoriety because it pushed the envelope of decency. Essentially, it was the right trash at the right time. It was originally banned as obscene in the US, and I'm sure that contributed greatly to Miller's fame. It didn't hurt that he was best buds with other infamous, deadbeat, f----d up writers of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great writer that I just can't stomach.","review":"I will not argue the point - Henry Miller is a fantastic writer, more a modern poet than a memoirist or novelist, I believe. His writing is completely unabashed, unbridled, triumpantly violating every taboo. He has the same bombasticness and authoritative voice as someone like Whitman, but if Whitman is life's celebrant, Miller is its misanthrope.Reading Tropic of Cancer consistently put me in the foulest of moods. What drives this book ultimately is disgust and dissatisfaction, and all of Miller's talk of rot and vomit and stench and decay made my skin crawl. I completely understand why Miller is considered to be at the forefront of modern literature, he obliterates all known writerly conventions with this book. But while reading \\"Tropic\\" might be important, it's far, far from pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get it?","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book, and it had its good points, which escape me at this time, seeing as I read this book roughly seven months ago. I was disappointed by it and would not consider reading it again. I guess I just don't like the way Miller writes. I was not shocked or offended, just bored and annoyed most of the time. I enjoyed the bits that were in French, and it was funny when that guy (Nonentity?)[went to the bathroom] in the bidet, but overall, I could have lived without reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honesty","review":"A 5 rating borders on the realm of pretension, and this is not a pretenious book. There's little smutty, arogant, or roughly anarchistic about it unless you fail to notice that Miller is explaining honestly every five seconds why things happen. This isn't entertainment, it's a man telling about life. He may be a rather course adventurer at his roots, but never so without us understanding. This is a good book to flip open and start reading, there's always a morose, yet trying to live, bit of philosophy staring you in the face. I imagine if you don't have that traveler's spirit and try to eat the whole thing from page 1 that you'll just be too full too quick. Leave it around, jump in on a passage from time to time.

There's not much to say about the book- It says everything it needs to by saying it all.

Miller at times tries to impress everyone with his extended vocabulary, most of which unfortunately is outdated. Not many dialogs between characters but very descriptive. The book is almost like a diary of his time spent in France. Miller describes his free existence going from job to job with no money (meeting) many women and throwing back enough whisky to kill a small horse as a better life then most rich people. His usages of honesty by speaking his mind without restraints throughout this novel really give the reader insight to Miller under his protective barrier. I found that the book also contained many comments or passages written in french. I couldn't interpret these lines and I hope that I didn't miss out on key issues. I recommend not reading this book in short sittings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I'm astounded at the reputation this book has garnered. There is very little here that I would call good writing. As a novel it lacks conflict, plot, and character development.

I don't think so.It has a good love story... Not at allSo why waste time with this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read! I do like medical thrillers and picked up Patent to Kill by April Christofferson. Its jacket indicated that it deals with biopiracy, a \\"new\\" crime where pharmaceutical companies go into remote villages where the populations are \\"pure\\" to draw blood for DNA research. I'm sure that there will now be lots of other books that come out with the same subject matter.Anyway, in this one, a woman escapes the slaughter in her village in the Amazon, and, clad in native dress, with no passport, speaking no English, and using uncut diamonds as currency, makes her way to Seattle! As if that is not remarkable enough, she then makes her way back home!But, even more than that, what I could not believe was that the author had three- count 'em THREE- characters named Michael! I actually finished the book only because I wanted to see if she ever explained why she could not think up a different name! Unbelievable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't resist buying this but now regret it.","review":"Call me ignorant for not first looking into what a Pastor believes or teaches before purchasing his products.

Worked beautifully, of course with any kitchen tool the tool is only as good as the cook. The size is great, very long so you can easily make a seamless layer finished icing to write on or decorate however you see fit. The small one is the perfect size for a lot of other everyday things as well, cream cheese on bagels, butter on anything, pb & j...etc. Great buy for a set of 2, and matches all of my PINK things!

It's really ashame that this is basically the same CD as \\"Looking For Christmas\\" because I thought that original CD was pretty lame. Others apparently share this perception as well since it's available used on Amazon for less than the shipping charge! Oh- but now with this really cool (sarcasm) expanded edition with 2 new songs and a new title, you get maybe 35 minutes of music instead of just 30.

Honestly after the 6th shootout I lost interest and stopped reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"My first Elmore Leonard book and I was not impressed. \\"The Hot Kid\\" seemed to be constructed similarly to Carl Hiassen books - a lot of quirky characters (though Leonard's are not funny), multiple, tangled plots weaved together, and a big bang at the end.But, Carl Hiassen's books are funny and page-turners. \\"The Hot Kid\\" is just plain boring, the characters are uninteresting and blah, and the plot was not fun to read through. The journey I went on with the protagonist was not one I'd recommend anyone else going on.Skip this book and pick up a Hiassen gem like \\"Lucky You\\" or \\"Stormy Weather.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos is Coming","review":"Pretty Boy FloydThis novel is Elmore Leonard's \\"Pretty Boy Floyd\\", only the \\" Hot Kid\\" is U.S. Marshal Carl Webster.This story seems to be one of dogs fighting wolves in human terms. The author is a scholar who has done his homework on names and dates. This wild depression era of the popular bank robbers is told from a cop's point of view. About hard men and real people this is a very readablebook in which Elmore Leonard comes down on the diametrically opposite side he took in \\"Valdez is Coming\\"Valdez Is Comingand is probably better even than Pretty Boy Floyd in plot and content."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hot Kid","review":"What can one say about Elmore Leonard that hasn't already been said by someone else? A very good read as always with Mr. Leonard, well developed characters & the most realistic dialog you will ever read. I've been a fan of his for many years. Not everything he writes is good but it's always enjoyable. Hint: Don't necessarily read Elmore Leonard for the story, sometimes it's not there; but always, ALWAYS, pay close attention to the characters, for that is always where the fun (and story) is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Leonard","review":"Coming from one who has read all forty of Mr. Leonard's novels, The Hot Kid ranks up there with Tishomingo Blues, Get Shorty, and City Primeval my all-time favorites. As usual, the prose is lean and spare, Leonard's characters never, like Chili Palmer, saying more than they have to, if that. Capturing the essence of the 1930s in a hip and entertaining way was certainly an ambitious goal -- and Leonard nails it. As I read the book, necessarily in one sitting, I found myself reading passages out loud just to savor the dialogue. After the lackluster but still readable Mr. Paradise, it was wonderful to see the master is back in top form. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CRACKERJACK PRIZE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX","review":"It's hard not to give Elmore Leonard's THE HOT KID five stars. There is hardly a missed beat by Mr. Leonard as we follow the remarkable career of Carl Webster, FBI agent extraordinaire, as he deals with killers and bank robbers and molls who are drawn to them. Perhaps there is a little richness of character missing from THE HOT KID compared to some of Mr. Leonard's other novels, but nevertheless this is a crackerjack prize right out of the box. We have gun fights, bank robberies, oil wells gushing, father-son rivalry, gun moll sex, white-sheeted clan attacks and much bumping about on dirt roads in a 1930 Essex, two-door, green and other hot cars. Above all, THE HOT KID evokes very well a time and place: 1930's Oklahoma. That's the real star of this book. It's an era gone forever but Mr. Leonard has caught the flavor of it in THE HOT KID. Each Elmore Leonard book is a prize and this one is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Leaonard","review":"A brilliantly read classic Leonard tale repleat with quirky characters and always an unlying subtle sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, a little short on suspense","review":"Elmore Leonard is like sex and pizza - even when he's not great, he's very good. I, like a few other reviewers here, was a tad underwhelmed by the plot momentum, but enjoyed the characterizations. There were a few minor twists when what I thought would've been a good climactic scene occurred only partway through the book, but even the characters didn't always seemed interested in what was going to happen next.That said, it was Elmore Leonard, which is far better than what most writers consider their best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great read","review":"I've read many of Mr. Leonard's stories and consider this one of his best works. Its quite different from the campy books set in contemporary times, more of a classic mid-century style that's better suited to the timeframe of the story. Still, the same caliber of character development and palpable situations. I tried to make it last but it was over much too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and engaging the reader's total attention with its many peculiar real life stories","review":"Homewrecker: An Adultery Reader, deftly edited by San Francisco-based poet Daphne Gottlieb is a thoughtful and thought-provoking collection drawn from many writers contributing their personal experiences and stories of their own life's odd encounters with marriage, cheating, God, erotica, and essentially the interpretation of lovers without villains, victims or innocent bystanders. Enlightening and engaging the reader's total attention with its many peculiar real life stories, Homewrecker ultimately guides the reader through the hardships and relentless engagements of the unfaithful, unfazeable, and all-seeing mentality of the cheater. An insightful body of observations on human sexuality, Homewrecker: An Adultery Reader is very strongly recommended as reference or understanding to those in relationships which cannot end, and require some sort of relief or alternative engagement."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed!","review":"I will keep it short.

I use a small amount from the same 'single dose' applicator. TheraTears is the ONLY such applicator I've found whose twist-off does not make a cap to the applicator. This makes the applicator less sterile and safe for me for the morning dose. It also means I have to leave it under the lamp instead of putting it back in the container, which keeps it in the dark.I realize that TheraTears is trying to force me to use another applicator in the morning to move more money from my pocket into theirs, but I can't afford that, so what they HAVE done is make it less convenient and safe for me.

This cd starts right off the get go with the hard rocker \\"The Great Deceiver.\\" Just like the rest of thier other cds, there isn't a bad song on this one either.

Amazon is very nice when it comes to these plants. They usually are very nice when a plant passes away by crediting your credit card but it took so long to die that I just couldn't call them to ask for a credit because of the long period of time between the time I bought it and the time it died.

Songs like, \\"Perfect\\" and \\"One Last Time\\" are for those of us who are in love with a girl but tend to mess things up. But don't think because it is pop-punk that it is either a big name or someone relatively new. Midtown is a great band that doesn't have really anything on any of the music channels.

It seems like everytime a band goes from their independent or small label to a major label they go downhill. For example Saves The Day. This album is nothing like their first album \\"Save the World, Lose the Girl.\\" Their first album was unbelievable and they definetely chose the wrong path to go down.

It rocks just as much as Save the World, Lose the Girl, still has the perfect timed Wooo's. Gabe, Tyler, and Heathe switch off perfectly on the singing. The guitar solos are amazing. The band has matured a lot more lyrically and musically since Save the World... I would recomend this album for fans of New Found Glory, and The Movielife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Well Done!","review":"I had doubts whether or not the gang could reproduce the quality of \\"Save the World, Lose the Girl\\".... I couldn't have been more wrong. \\"Living Well...\\" is one of the best pop/melodic-punk albums out for a long time. Its the gust of fresh air that this genre is in desperate need of. Great vocals and well written solo's over strong percussion and a great rythm section are the norm, not the exception. And they lyrics actually are worth listening to. I seriously don't even know why you're still reading this and not the billing page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This cd is just amazing I've listened to other punk and heard this at a friends house and went out and got it the next day I definetly reccomend buying this"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best CD's","review":"I am a big fan for Punk Rock music, and I have found this CD vary satifying. I think this CD is better than the old one,\\"Save The World, Lose the Girl\\". Most of the songs are fast and exciting, with a nice heavy electric guitar sound. The main singer's voice is cool, and some harmonies in the songs are cool too."},{"rating":"2","title":"SECOND BEST CD EVER!","review":"This is Midtown's second full length cd and it seriously kicks some major can. I had heard a bunch of the songs that they had previously recorded for compilations and stuff, but Mark trombino really brought out the best in the band. Not quite as good as Save the world, Lose the girl, but still a really good cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it doesn't work out of the package......give up","review":"I never had to work so hard to install a \\"C\\" battery. One battery is a very tight fit and no room for your fingers.And that's just the beginning. I finally got 3 batteries in the chime and one in the button and then.....nothing, it did'nt work.After reading the manual I learned that this thing uses electronic jumpers to achieve 64 codes and stop interference. The jumpers (tiny bridges that fit over pins on the circuit board) are very hard to get to, there are a total of 14, 7 in the chime and 7 in the button. It takes experimentation to figure out what works.I eventually found the right combination and then found that the head of the supplied screw for the chime didn't fit in the keyway slot on the back. Not a biggie...just added to the hassle.Too much aggravation for a $17 product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have to press three times for it to chime once even when it's next to the receiver. No big deal, just remember to press three times. But no, the crap doesn't stop there. The receiver is right behind my apartment door. It doesn't have to go through any wall, just 3 glass doors in a row about 55 feet (it claimed 300 feet). It works behind 2 doors. \\"Works\\" meaning it chimes once every three ring. As soon as it's behind the 3rd door (front door), it chimes once about twenty rings. The distance between the 1st door and 2 second door is about 5 feet. I have tried like 10 combinations with the jumper, same result.

When the electricians installed it, it did not cover up the sides of the electicial box that is recessed into the sheetrock. That meant the drywall and paint people had to redo the wall to cover the hole that showed. Very disappointed in the product. The skimpy back ended up being costly for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet with a modern twist","review":"Jeux d'enfants is the story of the game of truth or dare - a metaphorical representation of the games people play in love. The games (jeux) begin when Julien and Sophie are children (enfants), but as they grow older they intensify and become more twisted and dangerous.Although they are very much in love with each other, they let the game dictate their future, and the dare even goes as far as hurting and tricking each other.The cinematography is fantastic and the director manages to capture the ravages of the undeclared and unconsummated love. A daring lesson of love handled the wrong way when it becomes poisonous on the protagonists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This was a wonderful love story. It drags you in by the young love of the two french children that follows them into their young adult-hood. Their conversations are witty and sarcastic but they catch your attention and you want to be there next to them while they are playing their \\"dare\\" game in the movie. The French audio and English subtitles might scare some away but once you start the movie you don't even think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a review but WOW...","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite movies EVER, and I'm in disbelief at how expensive it is now.I really love this movie, and four years ago I used to rent this movie repeatedly for weeks on end before I decided to order a copy for myself. I remember getting it for UNDER $10 back then.I've had 2 copies, which I've lent to other people and have now disappeared... I guess to join all those missing socks I keep losing too.I've never been able to find this dvd at any video stores so my best bet is to order it online but come to find out that it has well over quadrupled in price.Wow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film Fantastique","review":"An excellent film that depicts the struggle of two individuals as they try to become one. The only thing that unites them, but in turn separates them is their involvement in a series of dares. The film details their struggle to survive between two worlds: the euphoria of the game and the reality of the world around them. The film defies category in that it is a comedy, drama, romance and adventure. I highly recommend this film and you do not have to speak French to enjoy its splendor. This film is also a great conversational movie so watch it/share it with friends. The only question you must ask yourself is: are you game?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very French, very cute","review":"This is a great romantic movie, with a very French sense of quirky humor and magic. If you liked the mainstream hitAmelie, you'll love this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeux d'Enfants","review":"Wow. I just got done watching this movie in my French class and I immediately came on to Amazon to buy it. I love this movie!Although it ends like a typical Hollywood love story, it has just enough French quirkiness to make it amazing. This is an incredible story about two lovers who, since childhood, have been playing a Dare game, where they try to one-up the other. This continues into their adulthood, where things get complicated. Rather than analyze what these people might be like in real life, I simply watched and was amazed! This is an INCREDIBLE film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining, and of course, quirky","review":"The people who are over-analyzing this film need to lighten up. It's your typical quirky French comedy, and not meant to be taken seriously. The writer and director clearly have an offbeat sense of humor, and there are times you can't believe anyone would behave the way the two protagonists do, but of course, that's the point. Your jaw will likely drop as the film reaches its dénouement, but then you will cheer for them and hope for a happy ending anyway. The lead actors are so charming, you forgive them for being such, well, schmucks.I found this film highly entertaining and a nice departure from Hollywood's safe-but-dull formula for predictable \\"comedy\\". The French truly are weird.Watch it in French with the English subtitles. Foreign films are always more fun that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeux d'enfants - 2004 ---------> merveilleux","review":"Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard play Julian and Sophie.Julien is endlessly energetic and precociously brilliant, but unable to bear the heartbreak of his mother's impending death.

They begin what seems to be a child's momentary amusement. Soon, the game has become something far more larger and thrilling than the sad and disappointing world around them.Wonderfully acted.Side note couple are married today!! 2012"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie...ever.","review":"Have always loved this movie and wanted to own it. The fact that it's not a blockbuster, and foreign, makes it hard to find a good copy. I bought a used copy that was in excellent condition (inside and out). This movie has a little bit of everything for everyone one: romance, light and dark comedy and of course some quirky french flare. For those who love Amelie and Chocolat, Love Me If You Dare is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great time!","review":"This is a sick and twisted movie. I loved it! The art direction is sublime and the story is fantastic and original. The La Vie en Rose soundtrack is perfect. This is not a lighthearted film; it's rather dark and explosive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Games","review":"Yann Samuel's film \\"Love Me if you Dare\\" (\\"Jeux d'Enfants\\") charts the course of two misfits (Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard) who create a private game of Dare as children that becomes more complex and absurd as both enter into adulthood.The production is gorgeous with Samuel using light and in particular color, or the lack of them as a way of conveying mood and emotion. Also, the two leads: Canet and Cotillard are charming in a warped, out-of-kilter way. Ultimately though the hyper emotionality and the complex relationship between the two leads defeats Samuel and we walk away from the film feeling cheated and spent.Samuel tries to keep a rein on the ever-escalating action but it spins out of control into mean-spirited ugliness nonetheless. Childhood games are (remember that in France this film was called \\"Jeux d'enfants\\" or Child's Games) better left behind in childhood, carried over into adulthood they quickly turn into sadism."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ....?","review":"This movie was really good in the beginning...hence the two stars. The story revolves around two children who have a rough life, one is a cast out in school who also lives in low income housing. The boy is losing his mother to cancer. It is a very sad situation, and the children who play these characters are adorable. They were by far the best part of this movie, hence the two stars. The children dare each other to do insane things to get past their sadness, however, as they grow up, they don't mature whatsoever. They still act as though they are seven years old. The things that they do will boggle your mind, and you'll wonder how they haven't been locked away yet. The whole story itself just completely gets out of control and becomes so unbelievable, you have to watch just to see how crazy it can actually get...and take my word for it, it's nuts. The bad part about that is...it was meant to be taken seriously. This film was just not worth the hour and a half it took to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am unable to watch it","review":"It's not in USA format, which it definitely says, but I don't believe makes clear that it 's NOT POSSIBLE to watch this movie; unless you have an Australian formatted DVD player/ TV or something..... sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"94 minutes of cinematic and romantic sacrilege","review":"\\"Love Me If You Dare\\" is creative and unique, but it is also proof that sometimes originality can be very, very bad. Don't let the \\"L-word\\" in the title and the romantic cover image fool you...this movie isn't about love so much as it is about obsession. The relationship between the two main characters is strange right from the start. By the end of the movie, it is arguably quite sick and as unconventional as can be. I found the characters to be more deplorable than sympathetic, the story more pitiable than admirable. This may appeal to the very quirky and those who lean towards the darker sides of love and comedy, but viewer beware. If you loved other French-esque romances like \\"French Kiss\\" and \\"Chocolat\\", I recommend buying the remake of \\"Sabrina\\" and avoiding this farcical insult to love like the plague. If the English had showed this film to Napoleon, he would have surrendered his empire and run screaming into the night..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"This movie looked like it would be entertaining and upbeat, about two kids who play a game of dares and continue it into their young adult lives. But it was morbid and depressing. I just kept watching it amazed at how much it sucked and hoping it would get better but it sucked all the way until the end. If you like your movies totally weird and amazingly depressing, you'll love it. Otherwise don't waste an hour and a half of your time.Usually I love French movies but this one was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This movie I can honestly say is the worst movie I have ever seen. I actually got sick at the end of this move.(I am not joking!!) There are movies I dislike or think are aren't well done but this one is the worst I have ever seen.I love Amelie and other French films but this one was repulsing. The characters had no depth and were not fully developed. There were explosions and car chases just for the sake of putting them in the movie. The movie did not complete itself and was truely sickening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oversized Book Stuffed With P*I*C*S","review":"Until reading Terry Rawlings MOD: A VERY BRITISH PHENOMENON I had no idea that mod was such a big youth movement. I just knew about the style from the 80s and the cool 60s look that some kids had in school.Anyway, this book explains pretty much in detail how the Mod movement got started and all that was necessary to be a mod. Mod is short for \\"modernist\\" by the way. And even though the teenagers in Britain appropriated much of the fashion and music from America, they really turned it into a culture that was contained over there.The book is filled with photos of Mod guys and Mod bands and there's even ads for nightclubs, clothes, and of course the scooters. I found it interesting to read although some chapters seem to abruptly end, which can confuse the reader. But it's great if you want to learn more about Mods and are nostalgic for the 60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see everyone again","review":"Once again Elizabeth Peters does not disappoint.

Sorry to say I got about a quarter of the way through and I was totally bored. I found it repetitive and very slow as well. The characters were somewhat interesting but the plot just dragged on...I got as far as a loony woman disappearing. The most ridiculous thing were the 4 year old twins - they didn't come across as gifted 4 year olds but 3rd year college students! The dialogue was utterly ridiculous. I have 4 teens including a set of twins heading off to a Top 10 school in August and I guarantee you we didn't engage in those conversations. The author demonstrates a lot of her formal education throughout her novel, however, it just doesn't make for a good mystery book. I'll stick to Sherlock, Miss Marple, and Hercule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as Usual","review":"Though not the most amazing book in the series, The Serpent of the Crown is an excellent read, and Peters does an excellent job of keeping the reader in suspense down to the very last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last","review":"I had been meaning to try one of Ms. Peters' books, so when I saw this in the library I picked it up. I guess you have to read the many previous Amelia Peabody novels to appreciate this one, but I gave up after about 60 pages. Boring and confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiot Readers","review":"This is the first Elizabeth Peters book I have read. It must be that people who reviewed this book have read all of her books and so think they see something I havent seen in \\"The serpent on the crown.\\" I see it as a dumb book. She gets her facts wrong. The small figure of a servant found in many tombs is called a shawabti. The erudite dialog of her 4 year old grandchildren is boring and impossible. Readers dont say what they think is funny in the book they merely rehash the plot. I havent notice a single funny incident. People of style and affluence in the time attributed by the author of this book might have acted with some charm and thoughtfulness. However, Emerson and amelia peabody and her idiotic relatives and the inumerable characterless characters of this book are merely asinine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whimsical","review":"If you're looking for a whimsical, light and easy read, this is a funny, engaging story about a woman who fancies herself brilliant and proper. The story is set in about 1920, in the Egyptian desert, in the Valley of the Kings, amongst excavators and investigators and hourdes of tourists.This is my first book by this author, and indeed, my first 'mystery' --- it made me think of the books I read as a kid. Nancy Drew and all that. It's that easy of a read. It's nicely done, and though there are no real surprises, it IS a page-turner. The dog and cat are the funniest characters in the story.I do like the way the author writes, but this is a different genre for me, and a bit too young. Great for young adults, I think. Or for an easy read on a long plane ride, but not something I'd recommend to friends. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Serpent in the Crown","review":"As always, Elizabeth Peters does an excellent job of telling a story in the vernacular of the time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"The item arrived on time and was in great working order.

I think that it is better than several other yoga DVD's I have previewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only, but even there it lacks...","review":"This 2-disc DVD set is great for those beginning a yoga regime into their lives. Great way to introduce the viewer into strength through posture, balance, and stretching. Though, cues for poses are miscued (calling child's pose \\"frog\\" etc) if you are learning these cues and go to an actual yoga studio, you will be completely lost. Luckily I came to these DVD's with some previous experience, so I was able to recognize these issues. The 2nd DVD is the more advanced of the 2, with a \\"yoga dance\\" at the end that is more like aerobics and fun to do- but no instruction is involved, its more of a \\"just do it\\" kind of thing.All in all, best for beginners who can integrate this series with studio work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Kept Secret","review":"The Audio-Technica AE 3000 microphone is one of the best kept secrets in live sound reinforcement as well as home studio recording.

It consists of four CDs ecah with a separate program and no documentation. No menus and no way to navigate through the programs which are not integrated. The programs are progressive in that each user must start at the most basic level and progress. For a kindergartener, this may be alright but a student in a higher grade would be bored to ddath. The games are much too slow that much time is wasted. The only good program in this is the Art program which is excellent. Moreover, the installation programs do not copy the files off the CDs onto the hard disk so that the correct CD must be inserted each time the child wants to use the program. I sent the one I purchased bact to the Learning Company for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value: nice set at a reasonable price","review":"I bought one of the crane sets a while ago.

Although it's certainly better than no lube or household ones, this is actually one of the worst lubricants I've used. The only personal lubricant I've tried that I think is worse is \\"Yes\\". It's very sticky and doesn't last as long as other lubes. It has a sickeningly sweet taste. The smell is not very strong and it does feel pretty good, until it gets very, very sticky. I'd take Astroglide any day over Wet.Wet Platinum, however, is a decent silicon lubricant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and easy to follow for children","review":"Children love pictures, and learning the picture-language of Chinese is an eye-opening excercise for them.

Many thanks to Andy Crowe for such a great source to the PMP certification."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope to Pass the PMP Test Exam on the First Try!","review":"I recently purchased this book to assist with my prep work for the PMP Exam. I have heard wonderful things about this book. I took a PMP class to help prepared me for the test but I needed additional information. One of the gentlemen in the class took his test right after the class completed. He passed on the first try. He also credited him passing to the Andy Crowe book. He felt it was the PMP 101 for Dummies. He thought it really help prepare him. Maybe after I complete the book I'll write back and agree!

Some of the questions on the exam are almost as if they were taken from this book. I studied this book extensively and took the exam in the book until I passed with a 90% on the practice test. I passed the PMP with flying colors. I can not recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"I passed!","review":"I found this book to be very helpful. It highlights all the major information you will need to pass the test. It is much easier to read and understand than the PMBOK book. I would definitely recommend it. I kept asking if the sample questions were like the test, and while I found the test questions to be more wordy i.e. you had to sift through more information to get to the real question, if you can answer all the questions in the book you will definitely pass the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best on the market for the topic","review":"The best! This book is concise, to the point and covers most of the material. Has a very intuitive way of explaining how outputs from one process flow into inputs of the next process. Without this book I would have never understood the flows. The book gets the job done i.e. If you read this book and follow the author you will pass the exam on your first try. Unlike other books that are just an expansion of PMBOK or insult your intelligence this book is an easy read and covers all the material that you need to pass the exam.Why a 4 star review? There are some mistakes in this book. e.g. the author confuses PERT and 3 point estimate as the same thing. Also, the book overlooks details of Organization Process Assets and Enterprise Environment Factors as \\"common inputs\\". They are crucial to understanding the initiation and closing of a project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"This book is an exceptionally vaubale book for the PMP.

The velociteach website has lot of practice exams (again not too difficult) but the interface is good and also keeps history to track scores and weak areas. Although it might be possible to clear the PMP by using just this book, but I would not have taken the chance with so much money at stake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the real test questions are tougher","review":"I gave this 4 stars because it covers most of the subject matter that you will be tested on, but the level of difficulty is not the same as the real test. I took the 200 question Final Test at the end of this book and missed maybe 15 - it was not challenging and I was pumped about passing! However, when I logged on to Velociteach with the free week, the test questions in the Process and Process Group section were MUCH harder. MUCH MUCH MUCH. I went from scoring 90% on the 100 question practice test to 30-60% on the individual process tests. Buy this book, use the free trial at Velociteach, and take the Process, Knowledge Area, and Process Group tests. If you only study the 50, 100, and 200-question tests you are not preparing yourself for the real thing. Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"I passed!","review":"This book does an excellent job of explaining the logic involved in PMI's processes - how they relate, the iterative nature, etc. Upon completing - and passing - the exam, I can say that this book does a fantastic job of hitting the broad subject matter required. I will also add that the author does NOT talk down to you, does NOT assume to be the end all be all when it comes to PM knowledge, and is encouraging to the reader. This is in contrast to another PMP Prep book I had acquired."},{"rating":"2","title":"readable and complete","review":"I passed my PMP, basing my study with this book at the core.

I passed today on my first try and this, along with the PMBOK, and a book of test questions were all that I used for preparation. This book makes sense out of the PMBOK material in a very simple way and helps you to make the sense of the process interations. I couldn't have passed without this book.

I hardly had any math questions and all the exam questions were really lengthy with lengthy answers unlike the practice questions that appear as excercise and final exam. It was like mini reading comprehension on each question. So expect to see much harder questions that what is in the book. Good thing is that with PM experience and reading this book from begin to end, it will not be a problem to pass eventhough there will be many questions outside of this book. I don't know if the exam is getting tougher day by day or it was just my luck to see those kinds of questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU TAKE THE PMP EXAM FROM 2010 on!","review":"what a joke. read the book cover to cover. memorized, understood until I was blue in the face. took all the practice exams until I did well. did the exercises.

The material is very well organized by knowledge areas. I used this book to refresh all the material I learned in class and then used another book to go over details and the not so obvious information behind every process. I did not wanted to be overwhelmed with details on the beginning of the study process. Instead, I was looking for understanding what I took in class. That study technique helped me to pass on my first try. Very glad I purchased this book. I did not rate it with 5 starts because to pass the test you need details that you might figure them out with some analysis, but on the test, there no time for that. I finished the test with only 1:30 minutes left. Also, the questions on this book are quite easy compared to those brutal questions I faced in the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"As others have stated, it definitely lives up to it's title, and I passed on the first try. Not by a wide margin, mind you, but it's title is not \\"How to pass by a landslide on the first try\\", is it?My criticims are like most other reviews. The questions and excercises, while very good in early study, become old and repetitive. A 3rd party test application would be suggested to compliment this book. Also, I did encounter some never-before-seen material, but obviously not enough to hurt me too badly.I went in thinking I'd do better than I did, but I did pass. Overall I was satisfied with this as my only source of study, plus the PMBOK. One final suggestion -- unless the author explicitly says, \\"you will not need to calculate this...\\", learn the formulas! You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Andy","review":"This book is a valuable guide to PMBOK. I Passed after reading it along with the PMBOK. The PMBOK is of course the bible of PMP exam, but this book is extremely pleasing to read, concise, and geared to highlight important concepts from an exam view, and also relate to the overall highlevel \\"architecture\\" of the processes.The only thing to be aware is that, in certain areas, I felt topics were inadequately covered, and that is where the PMBOK comes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to move on","review":"I eagerly awaited this book, anticipating that Marcinko would give us some insights and wisdom on the new world of terrorism that we face. Instead, we get gratuitous violence, less than credible leaps between events, a silly plot and ending, and a poorly written book. It's time to move on, and if you're a fan in need of a Marcinko fix, go back and read the early classics such as Red Cell, or any of the 'color' team titles...those were great books.

I thought there would be more. First, the book was short--much shorter than the others. Second, it skipped between first and third person, which is confusing and how would the rogue know what the bad guys were doing, anyway? Third, there was a lot of familiar material--and bunches of cliches. Fourth, the writing was lame. There was none of the usual subltety or self-mocking humor. I think its time for the good captain to retire as an \\"author.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"TIRESOME AND SILLY","review":"What this book proves is not what the Rogue Warrior announces near the beginning--\\"I will not bring a terrorist back alive\\"-- no, this book proves that the Rogue Warrior has become tiresome and silly. The constant filthy language, the neverending nonsense about the Rogue's own personal ten commandments, the always present, always identical, comments on pain and winning that meander through action scenes: It has all become boring. The Rogue himself has become a cartoonish character, sort of like a mean Elmer Fudd, getting hit with brick walls and run over by trains, but magically bouncing back up and repeating pretty much the same words over and over, except the Rogue's words are mostly curses.There really isn't much in the way of plot in this short novel. There isn't even a hint of interesting dialogue. There's just the Rogue, who doesn't know it's time to retire and let someone else same the nation and write the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good moisturizing relaxer","review":"I have fine, yet very dry hair and most relaxers will strip what little moisture that I have.

To take you to a place far away from all your worries. The Book of Three is about a boy who is an assistant pig keeper and one day his pig runs away and when he sets out looking for her, he finds adventure instead. The Black Cauldron shares the adventure of Taran and his companions, as they travel to distroy the evil Black Cauldron. The Castle of Llyr tells the readers about Eilonwy Achren, and new characters as well. Taran Wanderer supplies us with the need to know who Taran really is and why he feels he needs parantage so much. The High King's story tells of Taran, and his companions, and what at last makes Annuvain fall. Also what becomes of everybody afterward. But, most of all the stories of Prydain are full of adventure, secrets, and magic. They are magnificent! And for those readers who are familiar with Prydain, the adventures may never end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic in mood and adventurous in spirit!

I ended up reading the whole series, but the last book, the High King, was the one that affected me the most by far. I was left crying at its end the fist time I read it, and I cry every time I read it even today, four years later. Before I read the series, I didn't enjoy books.

The time, setting and plot all fit together quite nicely. The story takes place in Medieval Times but it is a fantasy world. Taran, an assistant-pig-keeper, is now a great warrior and he is the leader of an army of horsemen against Arawn-Death-Lord. There is a catch though Arawn has stolen the sword of Dyrawyn- the most powerful weapon in the kingdom of Prydain. Taran and is companions have set out to claim the sword back for the diabolical Arawn. They have to go to Arawn's lair, which is at the top of Mount Dragon. After many bloody battles they are able to retrieve the sword for Arawns Lair.

Like the name Eilonwy is a diffucult name to say. This book is confusing unless you read the other books in the series. (The Prydain Chronicles) They don't descibe the setting of characters in the book. They just jump right into the story where it left off from the other book. This book is a little like The Hobbit, by J.R.R Tolkien. I like The Hobbit a lot better. The Hobbit was easier to follow and was very well written. I sugjest that you read the other books first.

The key is a little harder to separate from the tumblers, but I expect that will loosen up with time. Once it's in, though, it's locked down tight. One word of caution: when you put in the combo to open it, the \\"key\\" will be stubborn; when you go to lock it back up again, put in the key, hold it inserted in the tumblers, spin the dials, and *then* you can let go.

It is one of the few \\"stand alone\\" books that Lumley has written that has not spawned any sequels. Although it is lesser than the unparraleled books in that sequence, (much as his other \\"stand alone\\" House of Doors), it remains a good read for his die-hard fans who are willing to give a good horror novel that has no mention of vampires, a chance. Essentialy the book follows the Cary Grant-like theif who gets mixed up in a plot of the Anti-Christ's to take over the world, only to find out that... well, I had better not spoil it. The only real problem with the book was the ending which didn't quite sit right with me. I think that Lumley should try a sequel to flesh out the original ideas in Demogorgon and re-invent the judeo-christian mythos horror genre, much as he did for the vampire and Lovecraftian genres. I give it a 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad, from such an excellent author","review":"After the good work that I had come to expect of Lumley after reading some of his other works such as the Necroscope series, I was unpleasantly surprised at how bad \\"demogorgon\\" was.

Also it is advertised to use tap water. After steaming take off the tank and you will see all this sort of white sand at the bottom which clogs up the unit. Wow...another way to break the machine and then they can charge you to repair it. This is a product that is designed to continue costing you for as long as you own it. If you buy it try to keep it going by using distilled water and disassemble it and lay the hose flat after use.

After experimenting with it for a few days, I discovered it does not do shirts and pants as well as a traditional iron. It did wonders on my new bedroom valances, steamed wonderfully and it was much easier than ironing. I also used it to take the creases out of my decorative pillows and comforter on my bed. It stopped producing steam after about 12 uses, the steam comes and goes. Almost like it's clogged, but I can't unclog it. Of course the warranty is up so I can't return it.

After a week of trying to contact Rowenta customer servoice, I finally spoke with Joe, who informed me that Rowenta is aware that it is less expensive for its customers to replace their product rather than repair it. I will do just that, only I will not buy another Rowenta product. As good as their products are, they are too expensive to be replaced every couple of years. Ditto for the Rowenta iron that I have.

If you haven't experienced problems with this machine, either you haven't had it long enough or don't use it.Update: I Duck Taped the head together and continued to use it, but now the water tank cover doesn't fit properly and resulted in a laundry room flood.

Most of the clothes I would take to the dry cleaners really weren't dirty, they just needed to be freshened up (take the wrinkles out).

Was expecting better results from this more expensive model. The bottom-line is that these steamers are good for 'freshening' clothes before wearing them and removing minor wrinkles. Even the manual for this products mentions this fact. But even for this purpose, it takes more time to iron clothes than a regular iron. It is good for items that are inconvenient to be laid flat on an ironing board, e.g. drapes, upholstery etc. But how many times do you need to iron them?For regular clothes, it comes no where near replacing a regular iron.

If you are expecting this product to be one -- move on. After one year of use, I found it is best for soft knits, full skirts and the soft fabrics used in evening wear. And they should all be steamed vertically. You cannot use this product on horizontally laid items such as bedspreads. However, I found this a wonderful addition to my guest room. My house guests loved the ease of use and it quickly eliminated those pesky suitcase creases. It is not a small appliance but fits nicely in front of a tall closet.

At that time I went out and bought 3 large buckets of assorted colors which I found on sale at half price. I was glad I could also buy separate packs of colors we use a lot, like white.Two weeks ago we made Angry birds characters.Just last night I experimented with combining blue, white and pink to make purple for a model of Meta Knight.That worked out fairly well.I hadn't realized that I could make new colors if I persisted a little longer than I had in the past.I found that, for me, it is best to make some of the characters slightly flat, from front to back.It's easier to make them that way and they get flattened through use anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"Less mess than play dough & hardens quite \\"soft\\" so doesnt smash when dropped!

I thought it would be handier than a bike rack to fit in the hitch, with more verstile uses (and cheaper). I used it this weekend to haul my daughter's bicycle to my sister's. It worked out very well. I also had a cooler sitting next to it, which helped hold the bike in place better. I think I'll get some very good use out of it. My only complaint is that I feel that it wiggles a little too much in the hitch, but it is secure and won't come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I bought this after seeing it in a magazine. Had a hard time finding one, but do like it. I am sold on anything silicone. Just stick in the dishwasher, oven, skillet, or anything.The only thing I would wish is a longer handle.

Otherwise, I have no complaints at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kuhlau: The \\"Beethoven\\" of the Flute","review":"\\"The flute used here by Marten Root is a copy of nine-keyed classical flute of the early nineteenth century and sounds much more even than a baroque flute, but it is still quite different in character to a Boehm-system flute. The fortepiano played by Richard Egarr is an original of 1825 by Fritz. Both instruments have an excellent sound and suit the music well. The playing throughout the programme is also of the highest order and the recording clear and detailed.\\" (Anonymous, Amazon.co.uk)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrid CD","review":"My husband played flute professionally for 45 years. I am a pianist and we have played many of the Kuhlau sonatas together. Kuhlau's music is beautiful, but this recording is on fortepiano and a 9 keyed flute.

It is probably OK if it is just going around your ankle when you are wearing thin socks, but it is not long enough to go around pants. I had it fall off soon after I began using it. Though I found it in the road a day later, I can't trust it to do what I need for it to do. I have replaced it with an adjustable strap that clips on (instead of just relying on velcro to keep it closed) and which emits a light instead of just reflecting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbia Pictures' Oliver! in print.","review":"Lionel Bart's wonderful adaptation of the Dickens classic was put to film by Columbia Pictures Corp. with all the spleandor and majesty of a technicolor extraveganza.

I refuse to show the old Charly movie because there is an implied rape/aggressive sex scene that is entirely inappropriate for my students.I was overjoyed when this delightful movie debuted on tv and absolutely thrilled it has finally arrived in DVD, as my VHS copy was failing rapidly. My students adore this movie and usually ask me to play it again for them at the end of the year, girls and boys alike. Matthew Modine makes Charlie an incredibly endearing character and Kelli Martin is ideal in the role of Miss Kinnian.While I believe most viewers will enjoy this DVD, anyone who teaches Flowers must purchase and share this with students without delay. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes I'll never get back","review":"I will admit to being a little leery when a favorite story of mine gets adapted to the screen (be it a movie or TV), and \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is on my top five list of best short stories of all time (the novel is another matter entirely). While I understand that no story survives this transition completely intact or unaltered, this movie should be used as a case study of what not to do when making an adaptation: everything that made the original such a heart-breaking record of Charlie Gordon's rise and fall has been gutted from this script. Charlie is barely sympathetic in this rendition, and Matthew Modine's lackluster performance is just the rancid icing on the tasteless cake. Avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought","review":"I'm a middle school English teacher and teach this short story to my 8th graders.

I don't know why the movie insists on showing Charlie eavesdropping (and smiling) while listening to a young couple \\"make out\\" or why Charlie and Miss Kinnian have to sleep together. These are scenes that made me scratch my head, but the movie is simply not a good one at all. I'd rather pick and choose the better scenes in Charly than show any of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Flowers for Algernon\\"","review":"This movie was very touching, and I found it to be more enjoyable than the older version entitled \\"Charly.\\" I teach eighth grade language arts and each year we read the short story \\"Flowers for Algernon.\\" Before I close out the unit on \\"Flowers for Algernon\\",I show the movie version.

It has been consistently reliable for me and I used it successfully to conceive my son. Once I bought these test sticks off Amazon, however, the monitor isn't working properly anymore. I'm backing up my ovulation tracking with OPKs I bought at the drug store and despite the fact that they are showing an LH surge, the monitor isn't. This has never happened to me before. The ovulation tests from the drug store always coincide with the monitor. My cycle is so reliable and the monitor has been so reliable in the past that I suspect something is wrong with these sticks I bought off Amazon. I will not be using them next month. I will be buying a new box from another vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely frustrated is an understatement!!","review":"I would write this review with negative stars if possible. My product is an expired box of testing sticks. It took me testing into a second month, missing my opportunity to inseminate, bofore realizing why I was not showing a positive ovulation.

I'm truly disgusted with such a practice of this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem","review":"I have used this product for a few months. The first several boxes of testing sticks worked fine. The last box I purchased did not. There is an area on the stick that is supposed to show blue, after urinating. About 20 of the 30 sticks did not do so in this box. Now the accuracy of my monitor is incorrect, because it is not reading several of the sticks. I feel like that particular box was a waste of money, and has hindered the rest of my monitoring.

I guess seeing the cover - a great pic of Strummer, with the promise that the author will \\"kill my idol\\" - got my expectations up too high. This book is basically a few pages of quick chronology/bio/the clash ripped everyhting off from the Sex Pistols then took off for the U.S., followed by about 50 pages of discography. What the ??Let's hear more about each member, let's have interviews, let's have talk about politics, specific lyrics, influence, etc. While brevity is key to punk itself, it kinda sucks in a book about an awesome band that lasted over a decade and had a huge impact on modern music.And what makes Quantick qualified to declare humself a Clash authority is never explained - but I think that's the least of this books shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantick is a hack.","review":"One of the sad bits about Rock Journalism is the absence of journalism. Quantick can't help himself as he interjects glib opinions and drops pop-culture references that are as irrelevant as they are dated. The book is, in itself, a fair, brief chronological history of the band. What is missing is any real words from the members of the band themselves; instead we get Quantick writing about what others have written about the band and his opinions and judgements over the band in a redundantly formatted opinion piece. He belies his subject by interjecting himself into the material. There's nothing here that can't be gleamed from other sources (fansites, etc) and no original insights. The Clash were a significant collective of artists producing relevant materials. Quantick is hack who makes the material unenjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your money!","review":"I love the first three HP movie tie-in games. This one, I have sent an e-mail to EA requesting a refund. The controls are terrible (and unchangeable), the response time is beyond sluggish. It is difficult to get your character to face the correct way, I often find myself walking into fires I was just trying to head towards to put out (and talk about slow, my hands will have been off of the keyboard for several seconds when my character takes that plunge).For all practical purposes, this game is unplayable. I cannot believe that someone in testing didn't say, \\"We've got to scrap this altogether and start over.\\"I do want to make this clear: I am writing this regarding the PC version using a keyboard.

Been waiting to get it for christmas. I never knew that EA made such bad games. The big problem is that it doesn't use the mouse.

However just before those two was this one. The first three had the right idea, It might have been childish and easy to beat quickly, but at least I felt like I was at Hogwarts. This one is a pick your level and all based around a menu screen. You have to play a lot of the levels multiple times, and the reward system is pretty awful. I do like the idea of Hermione and Ron helping you but everything else about this game made it the 6th worst of the 8. Sorry GOF, thankfully the 5th one returns to the free roaming idea, and its in my opinion the best of the 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun","review":"I bought this game because I thought it would be a similar game to the first 2 Harry Potter ga enjoyed very much, but this one is much different and, in my opinion, not fun. The game can either Harry, Ron, or Hermione, which I thought would be great, but the way the camera follo difficult to see who's who. The camera only sees one angle and will not turn, so it is more frus amusing and the camera is so zoomed out that you can't tell where your character is in many casting feature is very weak in this game, as it doesn't always work and when it does, its more than an actual aimed attack. It got a little better after I got the controls down, but it wasn't wo spent on it. I haven't played it since my first few attempts to enjoy the game...I just started pla else.

The game doesn't support the mouse at all - which is almost unheard of for point of view games like this one.

It IS terrible. I finally got into it last night (after completing The Prisoner of Azkaban, and IT was great!) This one, however, is TERRIBLE. It is very hard to maneuver the characters. You cannot get them to move in a straight line. You have to remember the right letter keys to work spells, and you CANNOT use your mouse.

Better buy another game, and believe me, it's true!I have the entire collection of games from Harry Potter, and this is the worst, you don't even play quidditch, the entire game is based on levels.It has good graphics, PERFECT GRAPHICS, but they should do this game better. In my opinion, Thethird is the best, but the first has horrible graphics.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the lot","review":"I agree with other reviewers, this is definitely the worst of the four games so far!

I kept dying because i couldn't get Harry to get what i needed. I was very upset. The game was pretty confusing. I really wish i would have known it was like this before i bought.

It was horrible, I had no other task but killing weird - not Harry Potter for sure - beasts. No other...When i killed the xxxxxth beast I bored it finally. Ok, someone who is mad may like to kill and kill without any meaning in Harry Potter, but if I want to play such a game I move to other - specialized to killing - games (not mentioning I hate those games, too).

You can change options in the GOF folder. And the controls are very easy to get used to. The fact that you can play it with multiplayer makes it very fun and the graphics are incredible.

They were fun little games, secret areas to explore, colorful graphics and fun side games. This game lacks all aspects of the previous. It's not fun, the controls are difficult at best,and there is no mouse support.I can only hope that EA learns from their mistake and takes this back to it's original charm of the first three.In a few words, if you want to play a fun Harry Potter game, buy the first three games and enjoy.. avoid this one at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Change to say the least...","review":"I recently purchased the new Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire game from Electronic Arts. I would have to say that although the graphics seem more realistic, that has been at the expense of game functionality. The game no longer has mouse support for spells and the whole setup of the game is different than the first three and I find it boring and hard to function. Anyone who loved the first three games, save your money on this game-its just not worth it and if you decide to purchase it, will find yourself disappointed too. Electronic Arts-the game wasn't broke the way it was set up-why did you try and fix it! Very Disappointing Indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the \\"PC\\" version !","review":"Don't buy this game! You will be sorely disappointed. This is NOT a PC game, it's a Gamecube/etc. game that's been poorly ported over to the PC. You can't use a mouse! Let me repeat: this is a PC game in which you cannot use a mouse!I am livid with anger at having wasted my money on this. Nowhere on EA's site was there any mention of this--I HAVE a GameCube and thought that, as with the previous HP games, the experience of playing this one with my son would be better on the PC. I've been taken!I am sure that this game is fun on the platform for which it was obviously intended--but I am not about to waste my time pecking around on my keyboard to control movement when the game is so obviously designed for a Playstation or Gamecube controller.I cannot believe that EA would stoop so low. Actually, yes I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"The previous Harry Potter games captured the charm of the books, were easy to play, and are among my favorites.

I have had visions of 4 more years of great games to look forward to, but the horrible thing just broke my heart. The first three were such a pleasure, even playing the 3rd time through (yes chambers was the best). What happened to the beautifully textured walls, and the great outdoor scenery? Where's the great animated cut scenes that tell the story, and the other students you can bump into to talk? You can't even see where you are going, even when something is attacking you. And the arbitrary main menu you have to go to at every level-what happened to the flow of the story line? EA Games is just sitting back and stealing our money. I will be very surprised if I buy any Harry Potter title again. I'll just go back and play the first three a 4th and 5th time I guess. So disheartening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I completely agree with the other reviews. I loved the first three HP games, but this one is very different. It's difficult and awkward to control the character you're playing... you're just shooting jinxes at random hoping it hits whatever's coming at you.

For those thinking about purchasing this game in hopes that it'll be as much fun as the others, just be forewarned that it's nothing like them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I got it on sale because FULL price would have made me cry","review":"I was very excited to find this game on sale this morning at a local toysrus; I got it home installed it. I was nearly jumping out of my seat at the graphics but sadly that is where the excitment ended.1. I HATE the new controls, they are impossible.2. The fact you can't use the mouse to look around and change the POV makes it very hard to even see what is attacking you.3. The turning and going left and right sucks because you can't get the character where you need them to be in order to cast the spell.I own all the HP games and love all of them, even the first one that was not so wonderful but this one. Honestly I wish I could return it even though I opened it. It's a horrible game and I really hope they go back to the old gaming style on the fifth one because this one gives me a head ache it spins so much and is so confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done","review":"If you enjoyed the \\"first-person caster\\" perspective of the previous games, you'll want to avoid this one. Let me list a few of the many things wrong with it:- No mouse! You have to use the arrow keys to walk around.- No first person view! The camera is always facing north, and doesn't stay behind the characters. This means that you could be walking towards the bottom of your screen and have no idea what's there. This is probably the worst component of the whole game.- Arcade style: This is not an exploration game -- it's a PS2 game redone for the PC. You use the arrow keys to move, and the Z, X, C, and S keys to cast spells. (See the PS2 controls re-mapped to the PC keyboard?) 95% of the game is jinxing creatures that keep attacking you while you're collecting shields. It's boring after about 5 minutes.Stay away from this \\"dungbomb!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame...","review":"I have played the first three Harry Potter games on PC, and the one thing I enjoyed most was exploring Hogwarts, going on missions, and going through classes, and interacting with students. Ironically, I got to play Order of the Phoenix first which is AMAZING. Then I recieved Goblet of Fire as a gift. I was really disheartened by the game itself. It was a little difficult, but the controls were kind of confusing. The graphics are good. But you couldn't really explore, everything was a mini game. Atleast in all the other games you could explore and choose what mini games you wanted to try. Overall, graphics rocked.

I am in total agreement with most other reviews that state this is not a game developed and meant to be played on the PC. It was a huge disappointment in every way. The graphics stink, the cut scenes stink, and it is almost impossible to control your character's direction or aim. Everything is customized and confusing, you are not able to use your mouse. The angles in which you have to view your characters and the surrounding landscapes is awkward and out of focus. I tried playing it and enjoying, I tried overlooking the obvious flaws but in the end, it just wasn't enjoyable in any way. What a shame and shame on EA for making such a low quality game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muggles are RIght!","review":"I have to agree with most of my fellow reviewers. This game is the worst! There is no mouse control,like the previous games, so you have to use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to move the wizards.

This is an action Harry Potter game. I love it. It will keep the attention of anyone who has not been a fan in the past. This is because this is an action game where as the other potter games have been a hunt for and talk to collect-a-thon. Is there talking this time? Yes, but only while you are fihghting. In fact, you do not have to read anything if you do not want to. Excellent audio samples and voice acting. The game is fast, fun and creative. You will casts numerous spells. A big complaint has been that you don't pick your spells, you just always press the same button and perform whatever spell fits the situation. BUt I like it. It would slow down the action if you had to go through some menu, and it would limit the spells if they were limited to the number of buttons.Bottom line: Great action game.

It gives no freedom to explore, but instead confines the game to 'levels' more suited to a first person shooter than what should be an adventure rpg. It also plays in the style of a shooter, but with less direct control of your character. Your only real options are to shoot at things, pick things up, and make them come at you. There is hardly a story and it doesn't even pretend to give you the usual mystery to solve, it is simply attacking and running away without the small level of skill required in previous games.There is no exploration, there are no conversations, there is no skill. If you have any desire to avoid melting your brain from mindless and pointless attacking then save yourself the trouble and don't waste your money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disappointing","review":"EA managed to destroy the game for the PC.It hase absolutly no computer game \\"feel\\" unless you remember how games felt in 1984.No mouse ControlNo Volume ControlNo Screen brightness Control.The only \\"option\\" is weather or not you want subtitles.Character movement is difficult to control since x and y movement is rotated off axis with respect to the arrow keys.For a gigabyte of disk space, the graphics and cut-scenes are poor.It gets a 1 star only because zero is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not having fun playing this game","review":"Like the others I am also very disappointed with this game. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the graphics. If like me you buy both the console and PC versions because they are different games, forget it, they are completly the same game. The controls are awful and you feel like your watching everything from a tower. I feel EA should redo this game and we should all write to them and tell them so. Who ever OK'd this game for release should be sent to Azkaban for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un playable game","review":"This game is unplayable on PC's. You can't use your mouse, the perspective is very disoranting, and the main difficulty in playing is the fact it is impossible to get harry to move in a stright line. The graphics are of low quality. Don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it zero stars!","review":"This is nothing like the first three games. You can't walk around Hogwarts, you can't use the mouse, you can't talk to other students, etc. Really stupid game! The graphics are great, but who cares when all you have is pictures and no real game?! Dumb designing. I can't believe it's the same company as designed the first three. I'm so sad. I love all three of the previous games and replay them over and over again. I pre-ordered this one. Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!!!","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in this game. The controls just don't work. I checked the system requirements before I bought it, and according to the box, I have them. But the game still doesn't work well, AT ALL. I love the previous HP games, but this is a big failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok at times","review":"I enjoyed playing this game, but I think it is a little boring. And a lot of it is hard. I also think that it takes to long to advance levels. And also in a lot of ways, it is just like the other games. Of course, it is different. But the general guideline is the same. The spells are the same. Plus, if you read the instruction booklet for help, it is very poorly written, at least for 10 year olds to understand. The game is sometimes fun. But it does get boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST game I ever wasted money on!","review":"I wish there was a ZERO in the fun/overall ratings choices, because I would have given it a zero in both categories. It was a total waste of my money.I got it because I liked the other Harry Potter games so much ... MISTAKE. It is NOTHING like the other Harry Potter games. I should have read the many BAD reviews of this game first!This game is entirely linear - you cannot go wandering around the grounds and explore, as in the other Harry Potter EA games. The characters do not interact well, in fact when the three characters are supposed to be casing a spell together the other characters are often otherwise occupied. Their tasks are obscure and not well defined.This game was not made for a PC. Further it was not made for anyone who is casually gaming, or in it for the fun of exploring the Harry Potter world. The game 'mood' (environment) is dark and unpleasant. The only good thing I can say about the game is that the graphics are well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO much worse than the previous ones.","review":"I bought this game thinking it would be a fun one where you could walk around and explore Hogwarts like the previous HP games.

If you don't want to have fun, buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Goblet of Fire","review":"I am outraged at the new HP game. Below are some reasons why:* In the new HP game you can't even point Harry in the rite direction!!!!!* Also there isn't any order to the game at all!!!!!* In this game Ron and Hermione don't help Harry very much.This game is a must NOT play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks.","review":"I absolutely LOVED the first three games because the characters were easy to move and the levels were entertaining. I really was looking forward to the new one, but like so many others reviewers stated, was really disappointed at how horrible the graphics were. If you really want to buy this game, buy it for a PS2 where it was originally designed for. Movement is very difficult and it took me a lot longer than the other games to get used to. I hope they redo this one and re-release it. To the folks at EA: remember the saying \\"KISS\\".Bottom line: If you must have it, buy it and play it on PS2. The PC version is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEND IT BACK","review":"I have enjoyed all the other games but the folks on this line are correct.... it is terrible. I spent six hours trying different ways to configure it to work without success. The characters sometimes move and cast spells and then they just stand there. I have a friend who also has it and has the same problems. Since they make the money I am sure they don't care, but this game is something that should be replaced with something that works. This will be the last one that I buy and I am over 60 but young at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Please Don't Waste Your Money","review":"My daughter and I have played and replayed Harry Potter 1-3, spending hours in thorough enjoyment. This one is TERRIBLE, AWFUL and HORRIBLE! Impossible to control your character, move, cast spells, explore and all the other things that made the previous games fun.

I think they spent very little time and effort on this game and hoped the name would sell it when the quality was extremely poor.I gave up after the second Defense Against the Dark arts class. I missed being able to explore, but with the way Harry moves exploring would be rather tedious.My recommendation: Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please safe your money and don't buy!!!","review":"I'm sorry I bought it.I agree with all the other reviews.....Loved the first three games (Chamber is still my favourite!)But this.... :-(No, I got stuck right before The Maze and can't go on.... don't know why.. so I stopped playing and installed Chambers again!Worst: you can't run around Hogwarts at all.... you're stuck in a few areas that get boring after running around in them for the gazillionest time!Don't waste any money on the game, just read the book and watch the movie!regards.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame there's no Zero star rating","review":"They've got to be kidding. It isn't a PC game its an arcade game or ought to be. The user controls on this game are so unfriendly that even my husband the computer genius of the family washed his hands of it after 10 minutes. My 13 yr old daughter loved the first three games but wants her money back for this one. No one in my house wants to play it except my four year old son and he keeps expecting us to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the Horror!!","review":"Why, oh WHY did I not read all the reviews first? This game is absolutely horrible. I have played all the Harry Potter games for the PC and for the consoles. This game is nothing like the others.

I want my money back EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed","review":"I am big Harry Potter fan and i loved the previous games in the series.So naturally i thought i'd get another worthwhile fun experience with Goblet of Fire but sadly i was wrong. One thing i really hated about this game were the cut scenes, they are just a bunch of static pictures instead of a video. Plus you never get to see other Hogwarts students other than Ron, Harry and Hermione, in my opinion it makes it feel as if you're the only students in the school. Lastly there is absolutely no exploring Hogwarts castle or its grounds, the game is a very linear experience. It's obvious that EA was trying to cash into the Harry Potter craze by producing this game with the least bit of effort to make as much money a possible. DON'T BUY THIS GAME YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH THE PREVIOUS GAMES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire for PC","review":"I was very disappointed with this game and I haven't even completed all the tasks yet. I'm still stuck in the Forbidden Forest and this game is trying my patience. The makers seemed to have sacrificed ease of motion for better graphics. One minute one is running up a flight of stairs and in the next moment a tree is in the way obscuring the view. There aren't many choices to play with, with respect to keys for movement or for casting spells etc.Compared to the 3 other games Goblet of Fire seems to be a letdown. If you choose to be frustrated by buying this game then I wish you the best of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It became clear to me that this game was not meant for the pc in the first 5 minutes of playing. The perpsective is awful and charms are terribly hard to cast... the game made little sense when starting out and was hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"I was soo excited to recieve it for christmas, but it is not worth it. You have all the challenges laid out infront of you, the view is awful, and you dont get to explore, it is all action!! I like the way you can choose whether you want a charm, jinx or accio, but other than that and the amazing graphics, it is pointless. To get some of the shields no one taught you how/what to jinx to get it!! No one teaches you the spells, you need to figure them out yourself. I think the third game was the best and that EA games should use it as a template for the fifth game. The fourth is fun, but aquard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously not designed for PC gamers","review":"I am only at the second level of this game but have to confirm what other reviewers mentioned before: Getting the characters to go where you want them to go is a challenge and the fact that you cannot change the camera angle makes it even more difficult. You cannot choose what spells to cast and when you cast, aiming is a problem because the characters are so hard to control.Oh well... what did I expect... This is just another moneymaker in the Harry Potter Franchise, not a game designed by people who enjoy the books and try to bring them to life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible controls, don't buy it","review":"We have Prisoner of Azkaban for the PC. It's a much better game than this one. You are actually allowed to use the mouse, unlike in GoF! We also have the Order of the Phoenix for Wii. That's got it's problems too, but at least the game is written with that platform in mind - this game is simply a Playstation game plopped onto a PC platform. Ugh. Buy Azkaban instead, and don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall: Excellent","review":"I have studied the Luftwaffe and WWII for more than forty years. I enjoyed this work thoroughly and highly recommend it. I do not disagree that I would have enjoyed more details of the author's 50+ kills, but his humor and his experiences on both the Eastern and Western fronts were very interesting.

Also, thelayout and format of the book are horrible, it's in newsprint stylewith no color no illustrations to give better understanding of thedata contained in the book. There are a few graphs, but again,they're poorly explained. In my personal opinion, DO NOT PURCHASEthis book, it will not help you.

It is as if it were written by a completely different person. Firstly, the plot strained credibility. How can we believe that a woman's best friend's son would break into her house intending to rob her and neither one of them give any indication of recognizing each other? Other coincidences were far too facile. Then too, the writing is not nearly as tight and the characters are shallowly imagined.Heretofor, reading Karin Fossum was akin to following a skillful skier swoosh down a snowy mountain trail. What happened? That's the real mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read \\"The Indian Bride\\" and was mesmerized. Fantastic writing, and I was intrigued with the typical honest \\"dreary\\" writing of Scandinavian writers (I am from Sweden). I can see why some get tiered of Kurt Wallander in Henning Mankell's books. Or try figure out Martin Beck in Maj Showall and Per Wahloo's books. Just very Unamerican characters and much dread of the Swedish society. Geez, one has to live there to really appreciate the style of writing. Swedes are rather pessimistic and whiny compared to the average American.However, this book, \\"When the Devil Holds the Candle\\" was so gory and too much psychopathic to be enjoyable. Too much lonliness of the individual and too much weary thinking and enless questioning of the stumbles in life. This happens when a good writer who has specialized in developmental psychological characters, gets carried away....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Fossom books","review":"I loved the story of this book, great characters and unexpected twists.

The reader gets a feel that he/she is in the southern part of Norway in all of her books. Fossum has a good footing in psychology and puts the reader into the minds and emotions of her protagonists. Sejer is not Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander but Sejer is just as likable for different reasons. Skarre is the young inspector constantly learning from Sejer in all of Fossum's Sejer series. Another worthwhile, entertaining, spine-tingling Inspector Sejer adventure is at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloomy Norway Crime Story","review":"After enjoying the Stieg Larsen Millennium Trilogy, that I have read mostly on long international flights, I have been looking for more crime stories that make great reads on planes. Although the Larsen books have a fair amount of violence, they seem to offset it with the positive Swedish atmosphere and the super powers of the heroine. In this book however, there is only gloom and doom and everything is so negative that it was hard for me to read. The story is well written and I finished the book, and for people less sensitive to negativity this might be a good read, but I simply didn't like it. I don't want to go into too much detail as not to spoil the book for new readers, but I think I didn't enjoy this book because I don't like to read about people being in a helpless situation without a chance of escape or getting help."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed as well","review":"While I have been an admirer of Karin Fossum's books [the Indian Bride a particular favorite], this one was truly a disappointment. There is practically no \\"detecting\\", inspector Sejer appears, but we hear more about how he feels, his dog and his girl friend than his job. For that matter, the girl friends, a psychiatrist, is herself a little strange [phone sex to strangers for fun?].The characters never get interesting: a dumb young man, his bizarre, asocial friend, a woman you realize after a while is insane...The whole story is gloomy, depressing, and essentially pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read as usual.","review":"As usual, Inspector Sejer solves the mystery.

In most Asterix books, this would at best be a small side plot, deserving no more than a couple of frames like the pirate ship's tragedies. Uderzo stretches the 1-page plot to an entire book, and it's painful and ridiculous.

It IS THAT bad! I do NOT know what these people who gave it good reviews are on about, Uderzo died a while back and Goscinny has produced some excellent Asterix since, it is not a sudden transition!

Any serious student of the topic has to read this book. Clearly the Israeli scholars and other adherents to the \\"maximalist\\" school will find Schawrtz upsetting. On the other hand, many other serious scholars agree with Schwartz's direction, if not conclusions. This is state of the art scholarship at its best.This book is not for \\"novices\\" when it comes to Jewish history. It was written for an informed academic audience. It is heavily footnoted, makes ongoing references to debates within scholarly circles, and presents an impressive bibliography spanning many different disciplines.My personal copy barely has two pages go by without my notes and underlining.

Another year later and nothing. We bought the monitor and got pg. in 4 months -- now have an 18-month old baby boy and using the monitor to try for our second.This monitor was extremely helpful -- though consistently it shows that I'm not ovulating every 2nd month (eg no 'Peak')... Not sure how accurate that is after reading other reviews of women who got pg. when the monitor only said 'High' and not 'Peak' (aka not ovulating?)Anyway, you can't beat this product if you want to remove the guesswork.

Well, I chucked it after 4 months since two of the months it gave me premature \\"PEAK\\" readings. Had I relied solely on the monitor, I would've completely missed my fertile window. I think it's great for women who don't know a lot about their cycles or the whole TTC process but for experts like me (charting for over 4 years w/ OPKs, CM, CP, etc...) it's just confusing. Also, once it gives you your first \\"Peak\\", it will revert to autopilot and ALWAYS show another \\"Peak\\", then a \\"High\\", then all \\"Low\\"s until you press the m button again. So, if it shows you Peaking on CD13 and you don't actually have a good surge until CD 17, it will already be reading \\"Low\\" again and you will miss it.

The machine keeps saying that the testing slot is not ready. I have addressed the issue with the manufacturer, and they are not sure what the problem is. Because this is not returnable to Amazon (even though I have never performed a test of any kind with it), I am stuck shipping the monitor off to the manufacturer and hoping it can be repaired. Because Amazon will not accept these returns and the price is so high, I would recommend purchasing somewhere where you have a seller to work with if there is a problem.

The second month I got \\"high\\" reading, but not a \\"peak\\" reading. Which means no ovulation. But I got pregnant that month anyway. I was traveling in different time zones and may have used it incorrectly. You have to be dedicated to the timing, which isn't always easy. Overall, it's the best investment I have made.

So after getting different results numerous times I did an experiment...When it would say I was on the second high day or first ovulation day the next morning I would wet the stick with water instead of urine and according to the machine it would say I was ovulating. It automatically will say you are ovulating 2 days in a row whether you are or not! You hear all these stories about how it worked for the person on the first try well maybe it did but I am not convinced.

I feel it is a shame that it wants me to waste my test sticks to complete it's cycle, but since it tells me to do it, I am following the instructions thoroughly.

I did the same before I bought this product. My wife had learned of Clear Blue from a friend who had used it and was successfully pregnant. We have been trying for nine months and I was wondering whether it would ever happen. We had heard that the best time to become pregnant was ten days after the end of her menstrual cycle. Well, when using this product she was at a higher level after day 18 or 13 days after the end of her cycle. What we learned is that we were way off the mark. My wife never reached her peak level and this frustrated her, however since her last cycle she has not had any menstrual pre-symptoms that are common to her. This is a first because she is usually really regular. I'm crossing my fingers on being pregnant, if so we got it on the first month of trying. If not, we at least know when she is at her higher level of possibly being pregnant.

I must say that this is indeed the best price at $135 since most drug stores charge around $180! However, unless I missed something glaring, I was disappointed to find that after my expedited 2-day shipping the product arrived without sticks! I believe that this should be very clearly noted and all I saw was small white print on the box after I opened it. It would have helped to know that the machine is literally useless without the sticks or to have at least a \\"starter kit\\" of them for this price! I am hoping that it does work for me and while I cannot yet rate the product itself I wanted to help others avoid making the same error I did.

I am questioning this monitor because I conceived my daughter just taking tempertures in the morning and no fancy equipments. This time, I wanted to save time but I've found myself maybe wasting time and money on this product and the expensive sticks. I will still use it going forward but with other test sticks.

After 2 months (1 packet worth) I found out I was pregnant! My ovulation day came 4 days earlier than the month before. I would have never known had it not been tracking my cycle so intently. This is one reason the sticks never worked- irregularity. I would have paid double to price to recieve this reward!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No test strips included!

Coming off of the pill had made my cycles pretty irregular and I really didn't have any idea about when ovulation was happening. During the first month, the monitor was just getting to know my cycle, and I think our timing was a little bit off, so we didn't conceive. However, timing worked perfectly during the second month and now I am in my 12th week of pregnancy. The time window in the morning was never a problem, the monitor is easy to read, and though it can seem like an expensive investment, it seems like a such a small price to pay in exchange for quality, accuracy and the relief of knowing exactly what's happening with your cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken on day 17","review":"I followed the instructions religious but the unit broke on Day 17, with signs to say so and ClearBlue confirmed it. They are sending a replacement, but all the data will be lost (Now i am wondering whether the data was even accurate because on Day 17, there is no change of whatsoever). Before the final 'replacement' sign, i got other signs too, clean up when it is brand new, etc. etc. So i do not know whether I just got a bad unit or their products are always like this.

Couldn't believe after reading all the reviews that I would be one to post that it worked for me the first time around as well. Now I am 4 weeks pregnant. Seen alot of reviews on here that it doesnt work and the directions are difficult, when in fact, if you read the manual from front to back, there is nothing tricky about it.

Although my husband and I weren't \\"trying\\" for very long before trying the monitor, in my eagerness to be a mama I started using this after 3 months of trying and became pregnant on the first round. A bonus is that it was used by at least 4 other moms before me, so it seems to have a good lifespan. A friend of a friend purchased it online, used after spending at least a year trying without success. After using this for a few months she got pregnant and it was passed down several times until I inherited it. Now I am passing it to my friend in hopes that it will help her speed up the product. It's worth a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Again on the First Try!","review":"I bought this monitor in 2011, read the directions carefully and it worked within three months. We had a little girl. Our doctor discouraged us from using it saying we needed to try for 12 months before using a device or seeking any assistance. We didn't take that advice. Thanks to this device, I learned that my ovulation is on day 17/18, totally atypical. It would have taken us forever to get pregnant had we not had that information. On our second try, it worked on the first cycle! I am a planner and like to eliminate \\"luck\\" and \\"chance\\" as much as possible. I think as long as you don't have any underlying fertility problems, this monitor is the best way to help with a fast conception. It's very user friendly. Yes, it's expensive but isn't the price worth eliminating the monthly stress of reading negative pregnancy tests? I tell all my friends about this monitor and encourage everyone to buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good tool to have when trying to conceive","review":"I just found out I am pregnant after 10 cycles of trying! I started using the clear blue easy monitor after 5 cycles therefore have been using it for 5 cycles. I was a little disappointed that I didn't get pregnant after the first time using it like so many others but I still highly recommend it. I have irregular cycles but always ovulate. Trust me, there were several cycles that threw me for a curve, ones where I ovulated way earlier than previous times and others, way later. I charted my temps and was very in tune with my body but was totally off on some cycles. I would have missed my ovulation had I not had this monitor. You may not get pregnant right away like some people, but trust me, stick with it. The monitor is really good to have b/c you can try all you want, but if you are not baby dancing during the \\"fertile window\\", it is pointless. Good luck to all who are trying, I know how hard it can be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accurate","review":"This is one of the best things invented for women who wants to get pregnant.

I followed the directions to the letter. The instructions say that for the first cycle using the monitor, it will ask for the first test stick on Cycle day 6. I turned on the unit well within my testing window, but only the 6 and one bar showed up for low fertility. The monitor did not ask for a test stick on day 6 like it was supposed to. It says it might choose another first test day in subsequent cycles, but this was my first cycle using the monitor. It was as if someone had it before. It came packaged perfectly, unless when people send their defective monitors back to the company, they repackage everything to look brand new. I bought 2 packs of sticks to go along with it, so now I have over $200 worth of paperweights."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm pregnant!","review":"I used the monitor for one cycle and got pregnant.

The month it arrived, I was not able to use it because I arrived after day 5 of my cycle. The next month the readings stated \\"high fertility\\" for every day of my cycle because according to customer service it was \\"calibrating\\", so it didn't provide any useful information. The next month I think worked, but the following month everyday except for one stated that I have \\"low\\" fertility, and no day was indicated that I was ovulating. I am going to a fertility doctor so I know that in fact did ovulate. Although there is a 90 day warranty on the devise, I did not find out it is broken until after the 90 days so the company wont take it back. The customer service reps are pretty rude and unhelpful as well.

Couldn't believe it...of all the days. I wake up on day 18, the machine finally advances a day, but it's still a day behind. I was extremely disappointed considering the cost of this product.

So I ordered it and peed on sticks everdy for 20+ days, and I NEVER got more than two bars (moderate fertility) the entire month! I never got a peak with a little egg so I just assumed I wasn't ovulating like the tests at the doctor's office said. Well....I just took a pregnancy test on day 36 and got a BFP (big fat positive). I'm upset that I spent a freaking fortune on a machine that never detected my fertility even though I obviously at some point was very fertile.

Would not have bought this single small brush at this price--the company is the same as mentioned in the title, and the model number is the same as listed in the product page, but it is a completely different item than what is pictured.

Do not expect anything but the sensation of sitting on an ant mound as you await for some pacing to evolve or hair to grow. If you let your own imagination draft the script, it will surpass this agony. Draggy and inept, this film forced us to succumb to the fast-forward button for the final hour.The best three Asian films to catch: SHANGHAI TRIAD, TO LIVE, and TEMPTRESS MOON. Gong Li stars in all.

It really hit me that hard. This movie is beautifully filmed. It starts out slow but somehow manages to hold your interest in a quiet way as it silently unloads its full emotion all the way to the heartstopping end. This is not the kind of movie that blows things up in your face and hands things to you straight off the platter. It's more the exact opposite of that. The plot is simple. The actors carry the film. And they carry it well. The shots are still, but moving in their own way. The soundtrack is spare. This movie is neither oversimplistic nor overly emotional as it deals with an immensely difficult topic. I watch a lot of films and it's been a long time since any film has had such an effect on me.

Four children struggle to survive on their own in a tiny Tokyo apartment after their childlike mother abandons them. The oldest, Akira (Yya Yagira) and his sister Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) try to maintain some semblance of family life for the younger children, Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu), but ultimately tragedy befalls the four.This is a long, slowly paced, minimalist film, but it rewards the patient viewer with its tender attention to the simple beauty and minutia of the children's world as well as the utterly natural performances of the child actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies ever","review":"The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is that it arrived in a broken DVD case. I'm worried that the movie might be hurt, but the movie ITSELF (disregarding physical issues to the disc or carrier) is amazing and highly recommended.

A childish rather irritating woman selfishly abandons her kids to fend for themselves. The oldest is a 12 year old boy who then takes on responsibilities well beyond his years to help his siblings to survive and stay together. The actor portraying this boy gives a very nuanced performance. The film is in the style of almost like a documentary or reality show. It is not your normal Hollywood film and will be more appreciated by the discerning film watcher rather than someone wanting to watch something mainstream and escapist. The film also does not present any easy solutions to the problem nor does it try to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Knows","review":"A lyrical, heartbreaking story based on a scandal that shocked Japan, Kore-eda's \\"Nobody Knows\\" considers the precocious self-sufficiency of four children who band together to survive. Soulful young actor Yagira is a marvel as Akira, a kid who longs to live a normal childhood but shoulders the burden of caring for sister Kyoko (Kitaura), who handles house duties, and a toddler-age brother and sister. As conditions inside the apartment worsen, the children become more dishevelled, and their plight sadder. Kore-eda's use of natural light and wrenching images of toys gives all this pathos a poetic veneer. The result is a film of strange, disarming beauty that packs a wallop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working within 2 months","review":"This heated seat cushion worked perfectly for about a month or so.

It does have variable heating choices, so you can select, increase or decrease the heat as your comfort dictates. It conveniently works from your cigarette lighter or adapter. It does not stay in place easily, and is a bit frustrating to get in the car and have to struggle to readjust winter coat, cushion, cushion back and seat belt.

Just plug it in to the cigarette lighter socket flip the switch to either Hi or Lo setting and within a couple of minutes you can feel the heat in your seat. I would say it heats almost as good as factory installed seat warmers. The elastic straps seem to be adequate, but you will have to reposition the heater from time to time,as it is made of a lightweight nylon and foam pad and is thin and somewhat flimsey.

It worked for about 3-4 months and then just stopped working. When it did work it worked well and got pretty warm, making my backside toasty warm and happy. However, the straps that held it to the underside of the seat broke quickly and the back would always fall down and bunch behind me whereby I had to adjust it every time I sat into the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Works better than a different one I bought at Target for $25, which just heats the butt and burned my wife's car seat fabric. The 2 temperature settings are nice. (usually I keep mine on low) The only complaint I have is the straps to hold the cushion onto the car seat. I had to use a small bungee cord to hold the straps in back, and I tied the 2 straps in the front to the bar that controls the seat's back and forth motion because they were too short. But it's staying in place nice. Highly reccomended to take the chill out of a winter's morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very warm but guaranteed to break after 2 months of use","review":"2nd one of these purchased and just as expected broke after 2 months of use. When working it works great and keeps you comfortably warm. Warranty is a hassle, must send in a card. Ordered the next generation today and will send in the broken unit under warranty so passenger can have a butt warmer too. As I said, for $20 keeps you warmer than with just a heater but do not expect this to last more than two months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warms more than your heart","review":"Great for most cars that don't come with heated seats.

I used this item for about 4 months (during the winter) and then carefully packed it away for the spring & summer. I took it out of storage a few weeks ago when it started to get cold. It worked for about a week and then stopped working! The light indicator shows that there is power but NO heat came through the cushion. I contacted Amazon and less than 2 hours later they returned my email with instructions on how to return the item (they sent me a prepaid shipping label) and notification that I would receive a replacement cushion. 2 days later, I received a new cushion! This one works perfectly fine. It gets nice and hot... keeps you toasty on these cold winter days.I was very impressed with Amazon's customer service. It was very easy for me to return the defective item with the prepaid label. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Worked for a little wjhile then stopped working.

Like others mentioned, the straps are cheap and don't do much to hold it in place. After a few months it just stopped working. Tried it in my other car (which has seat warmers) and it still didn't work. It seemed like such a simple device that I was annoyed that something still broke. When it did work though I was always scared of leaving it on and running my battery dead. Not really a fault of it so much but something to think about.When it worked, it was great. High actually would get too hot most of the time. For the price, I guess I should think of it as a disposable model, good for one winter only.

Also, the cord separated from the seat with normal use. I got about five months of use from this. For comparison, I have also hadWagan IN2282 Black 12V Faux Leather Deluxe Heated Seat Cushionwhich is better design in terms of durability of material. That one lasted me the whole season, but was dead this fall after closet storage for the summer.

I did not think it would work this well for the price, very impressive. I'm going to order 1 for my wife also. The heated seat cushion looks great but the straps look really cheap. So i don't use the straps (sit on it and it's not going anywhere) plus i move it from driver seat to passenger seat as my son likes to take it for him lol.As for people who say it kills your car battery i say to them GET A REAL CAR BATTERY! love the product i gave it 4 stars only because the straps look very, very cheap but, like i said i don't use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"I bought this as a gift and my sister-in-law loves it so much that she left it plugged in overnight and had to jumpstart her car the next morning.

I even had one of the straps break as I was trying to hook it and hit came back and hit me in the eye so I would be very careful with it around children. Our daughter has been very good about unpluging it because I don't know that I would trust the auto off feature. She is happy with it so it was worth the money.

The seat heater must have developed a short and burned a 4 inch hole in the seat. It worked great for two winter seasons, but I suspect the 'bunching up' problem as mentioned in other reviews caused this failure. I now have to get the smoke smell out of the car and have the seat repaired. Was a great product as it kept me warm, but this mechanical failure was almost disastrous. A few more minutes and my car may have been completely ruined. Be careful, do not let it bunch up or it could short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Product","review":"I've bought two of these items.

Cheap and works well (for about a week...see UPDATE below).....on below zero days it takes a while to heat up but still it is so much better than my plain cloth seats in my Wrangler. My only caveat is that the wiring seems rather chabby. I already had to return one (Amazon is great for this...even pays for the shipping back) for the wiring coming loose. So pay your twenty bucks....and be careful not to tug on the cord. Oh, one more hint.....YOU MUST UNPLUG ONCE THE CAR STOPS....found this out the hard way so now I wind the cord around my leg so there is no chance I'll forget to unflug my butt warmer!

It only lasted 4 months. Having a weak back, I tend to squirm and the shoulderblade issue made me shift more. I'm also 115 lbs which adds more force on the wires. Being an engineer, I found the broken wire and repaired it only to have it fail 2 weeks later.

At this point in time, it has been between 3 & 4 weeks since I sent it back and have not heard a word from the company on my replacement.

Functionally they work, but comfort is not the strong suit of these cushions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is the gift that just keeps giving. It heats up immediately.

Its the little things in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Warm and Happy and then Greatly Disappointed","review":"Worked perfect for a little over a year - even better than the heated seat that I had in my prior Subaru - within 30 seconds my seat and back are toasty warm -HOWEVER, it failed in just over a year (one year warranty period), even though it was carefully stored and handled (I have no children, etc).E-mailed Wagan customer service, who did not reply to the first e-mail. After their initial reply which was in respone to the fact that I would post on Amazon they responded andwould not replace and said that would send a part. When I asked them how I could replace this part myself, they never responded back to me, nor sent the part. Shame on this company. Very poor customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heated Seat Cushion","review":"This thing only lasted about 5 hours, or about 2.5 trips to work. It really only had one heat setting, which was fine if it would have just worked. Also, the straps that hold it to your seat are cheap and would clearly break after a few more uses - again, fine IF IT WOULD HAVE JUST WORKED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 1 month.

Terrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"My car sits at the train station all day while I go to work in Chicago and the leather seats are very cold when I return. The seat cushion is helpful in large part just by putting something between me and the leather seat. It never gets all that warm, but then I only have about a 15 minute drive to get home. I have accidentally left it plugged in overnight with no ill effects. Make sure that you have tied all of the ties to your car seat. I missed the tie at the back (below the two elastic loops) for quite a while. I have some concern that the seat will slide if I have an accident, undermining the value the seat belt. That third tie in the back seems to help keep the seat cushion in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality!","review":"I would give this item 4 or even 5 stars if it works. It's really helpful and comfortable when it works. Unfortunately, it failed just after I used this cushion about 12-15 times for less then 1 month. BTW, this is my third purchase - initially two years ago I bought two cushions for my wife and me and after 2 seasons and the very lightly usage one of them stopped working. Assuming it's just bad luck or occasion, I ordered one more - and will never buy again. 67% failure rate looks too much. Now it's too late for the return and anyway I'd have to pay shipping fee. Shameful quality and waste of money ... Do not buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Wagan 12V heated seat cushion.","review":"AVOID THIS ITEM:During the time it works (if it does at all) it works very well.

Made the old clunker feel like a BMW. I then purchased another one for my son's 1997 Subaru Impreza and another for my husband's 1987 Ford F-150. We are all thrilled with the results. Seat cover installs best onto bucket seats. I attached a large \\"UNPLUG ME...or else\\" sign on each. If left plugged in, it will slowly drain your battery. Only thing that would be better is stronger ties to attach the under the seat. However, the price is great and I can always attach an old shoelace to serve as ties."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID This Cheap Junk","review":"I bought two of these...One for my wife and one for me. My wife's connector at the lighter melted in the car. I attributed this to a defective connecter. Amazon refunded the $$. A few days later and now mine doesn't heat at all. The lighter plug indicator light is on but no heat. I can understand one bad but both? I give it two thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"heated seat cover","review":"Nice seat. Was a gift for my husband since he has leather seats and they're awfully cold in winter (in Buffalo!). He likes it a lot.

Took off hair as it was supposed to, but i have found that this and every other product in the Magic Shave line will absolutely ruin your skin with the most excruciating burning sensation for a long time after use. I used this and it smells extremely strong, even after it is taken off. After using this I could not touch my face because it burns with even the slightest amount of contact, and i cannot wash off any residue because water makes the burning ten times worse. I would not recommend this product- even though it does what it says the aftereffects are worse than razor bumps could ever possibly be.

The mysteries are fun - perhaps not the greatest but good enough - but the settings and the characterization are terrific.

Watching Brother Cadfael balance his inner life with his life in the world about him, seeking the answers to riddles of the world of men while pursuing inner peace and perfection through a monastic life, provides the true delights of this series.Peters may not be Louise Penny, but he's awfully good and great fun to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"good to file off dead skin from hiking mountains","review":"I use it to file off dead skin from feet before it develops into painful chap that breaks and bleeds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Artemis Woman replacement tips impossible to find:(","review":"Good for rough calloused feet, however, I can no longer find any replacement tips.

All the characters were fairly one-dimensional but the clues were all there and the story moved right along. Two major flaws contributed to the low rating. First, Simon walked alone into the murderer's lair. That was just stupid. Second, the Kindleization is absolutely awful. There were paragraphs where the words were so jumbled I couldn't even figure out how it was supposed to read, and most dates had disappeared (leaving the sentences meaningless).

Nuclear power ?2. Sex, sex and more sex : I guess Ms. Auel's intensive research on that era has proved that the pre-historic man (and woman) had raging hormones and had sex an average of 10 times a day, every day.3.

My review for the third book holds for this book too, only it's worse than that:This whole book seems like filler that Jean M. Auel inflicted on us just because she decided this series should have six books in it before she started the series.

By Ayla with no memory of her own people, and Jondalar, with a hunger to return to his, are impelled by their own deep drives to continue their trek across the spectacular heart of an unmapped world to find a place that they can both call home.The book is very descriptive in many places, but I became engrossed in all of it, finding it hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoints","review":"If you read the Clan of the Cave Bear and enjoyed its sensitive protrayal of the clan of a little outsider who is forced to conform to their rules, this book will be a disappointment.

Auel does a great job in the first two books of describing the plantlife, people, and both physical and emotional feelings of each character. Unfortunately, she continues her series with more and more detailed explanations, even of things she's described before. I was curious how many times she felt I needed to be reminded what a \\"mother statuette\\" looked like. Once that has been described in a book, it should not be described again unless there are significant differences. Anyway, I love the story and would rate this book at 5 stars easily if only it weren't so long winded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plains of Passage","review":"This was an excellent book about cave people. In this book you will read about the first animals to be trained as domestic animals. You will also read about where the first cave women and the first cave man met. In this book you will learn a-lot about why they tained the animals and how. YOu will also read about what other animals their were and what they ate and how thay caught it. Also what animals they were afraid of. this is a long book for many people but its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series of books gets worse and worse...","review":"The First book, \\"clan of the Cave Bear\\" was intriguing. By the time you get to the fourth, \\"Plains of Passage\\", you are wondering, when this book will pass to an end. It is the same material, repeated over and over, and over and over, and over and over. I skipped several pages at a time, and didn't miss a step. The sex scenes (and there is one every few pages) seems like the same, not even reheated. It's almost as if Ms. Auel knew that people would be skipping over this material, and felt that if she repeated the same thing over again, not many would notice. If you feel like I have made my point several times in this short review, then, well, you get a flavour for the book!I hope \\"Shelters of Stone\\" is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves me wanting yet more","review":"Parts of this book are a bit repetitive and not so gripping as the 1st 3. But still a very good read. I have just finished reading all 4 books in the series for about the 4th time! I thought there was going to be more. The end of the edition I have states that Jean M. Auel is currently researching material for the 5th book.

Sex scenes are expected but pages and pages of detailed, explicit, sex actions is ridiculous. If I had wanted to read porn I would have gone to the local adult bookstore. Readers beware of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"I have absolutely fallen in love with the Earth's Children books. Jean Auel is a masterful story teller. She clearly has done a tremendous amount of research for these books, which adds to the enjoyment. Not only are we getting a fascinating story, but we a learning about man's evolving culture, nature, old world geography, natural healing and many other wonderful things. However, \\"Plains of Passage\\" was not quite as good as the first three books. The story line in this book seemed to be a bit repetitive. I also found myself skipping over large parts of the books because too much time was spent on describing the landscape or lifestyles of the animals around at that time. This book could easily have been half as long as it is. I have already started on \\"Shelters of Stone\\", which so far seems to show much promise of making up for the less exciting \\"Plains of Passage\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCELENTE PRIMER LIBRO, LEEENTO EL CUARTO !","review":"Un resúmen:El clan del oso cavernario: EXCELENTE, INSPIRADOR.El valle de los caballos: BUENA SECUELA, RECOMENDABLE.Los cazadores del mamut: SOLO PARA FANS.El libro de los viajes (\\"Plains\\"): REPETITIVO, LENTO Y ABURRIDO EN DOS TERCERAS PARTES (LA'ÚLTIMA PARTE, COMO EN \\"cazadores\\", PARA FANS).....LA ESPERANZA....\\"The Shelter of stone\\"...donde los que admiramos a Ayla, esperamos reencontrarnos con ella..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very absorbing book","review":"I love this series. The characters are well developed and the travel scenes are rich in detail. My only problem with Auel's writing style is she is too repetitive for me. Oh, and I wish, as a download, it had been a little cheaper for such an old book."},{"rating":"1","title":"other reviews are correct","review":"Thank goodness this wasn't the first book in the series! Other reviewers are correct: Auel spends too much time describing flora and fauna. I just skipped over these parts until I saw a character's name or quotation marks. The tedious descriptions do not add anything to the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Plains of Passage, Earth's Children Volume 4","review":"Continuing the saga of Ayla and Jondalar, Jean Auel brings to vivid life the Ice Age, its inhabitants and their way of life. Her descriptions of the vegetation and animals of the time is spell-bounding, and I absolutely love her descriptions of the people of the time. She describes their way of life, diet, and the way they interact with other groups in mesmerizing detail. If you have read the first three of the Earth's Children books, this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much repetition and gratuitous sex","review":"I enjoyed the first two books a lot but then I started noticing the repetition in the third book. Auel feels the need to completely retell the entire story in every book so the repetition gets worse with each book. Starting with the third book I got the feeling that the author decided to use graphic sex scenes to sell more books. I don't think I will read the fifth book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book!","review":"After reading some of the recent entries, its good to know that my disappointments in this book are shared by some other readers. The Plains of Passage seems to immensely lack the quality of the earlier books in the series and the 'adventures' of the main characters, Ayla and Jondalar, reminded me vividly of the reality of the 'moralizing' that so many 'explorers' have done to indigenous peoples. Even with this aside, I felt that the book was poorly written and extremely over-drawn; I often found myself skiping over entire chapters without feeling as though I had missed any of the story or character development (or, more accurately, in both cases the lack thereof)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal entry in continuing saga","review":"This book is the 4th in a series written about Ayla, a cro-magnon raised by a neanderthal tribe. While the 1st book, Clan of the Cave Bear, was an enjoyable read (I recommend it), each new installment in the series has become progressively and exponentially more disappointing. I personally found myself extremely disappointed and dismally upset by the very moral missionary type escapades of the main characters of this book, Ayla and Jondalar. The book had a very \\"You are wrong, we are morally superior, and you should be thankful we arrived at your cave for the sole purpouse of your theological edification\\" feel to it. The sex drives of the main characters were also much to strong to even approach realism, sadly debasing what could have been an excellent story line/concept for the series to the level of semi-pornographic, trashy, Hustler-type pulp fiction. I highly recommend the 1st book in the series, but don't bother spending your money on the Plains of Passage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"After finishing the book, I opened my eyes and had to find out I was still living in the year 1995. I honestly thought I had left the present. What a pitty men cannot travel into the past. What a beautiful, enthralling story. I was captivated from the beginning to the end. I really want to know what happens next to Ayla and Jondalar. Some time ago I heard that Mrs Auel was very ill. Is this true? Does anybody know if she is still alive and writing. I really hope so. This world is not ready yet to go on without Mrs Auel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly Repetitive","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book, like all of this series is entertaining. I just wish the author could cut down on the constant repetition. Also is it really necessary to completely describe every bush, tree and rock and how they associate with every other bush, tree and rock? The story carries pretty well until the end which ends quite quickly compared to the rest of the book. I still await the next book but hope Jean Auel listens to her readers and addresses the most common complaint of repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plains of Passage","review":"Does anyone know when the next book of the series will be published? I've been waiting and waiting and waiting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plains of Passage","review":"Beautiful story. Descriptions terrific. Lovely love story. Sex too explicit. Easy to turn the pages to givethe characters some privacy. Animals so interesting. Hard to put the book down. Now have the complete set of Earth's children and reading all over again.Looking forward to more sets of books like this. Have complete set of Harry Potter books that I have read over and over again. Would like more of this kind of book.I am 92 and disabled so have nothing much to do except read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the next one is better than this","review":"I have loved this series from the start, but while the last book was a little boring for me, this book really takes the boredom up a notch and fills in scenes which should be action with sex. There's very little to recommend this book, aside from the fact that it's the next in the series, and now I'm wondering if I will pick up her future books. I also felt the characters were too modern, thinking in ways that only modern people think in due to technology, which obviously didn't exist back then.Give this one a pass, unless you are desperate to continue the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here We Go Again...","review":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers of this book. It's tedious and repetitious (especially of the events in book 3). I appreciate Jean Auel's detail on plants and animals, and like a good adventure story like anyone, but she recover sthe same ground too much. Also, I thought book 2 had a lot of sex scenes, but this book reads like a Harlequin romance novel! Yes, we get it, the characters have a lot of time on their hands and no TV to be entertained. I seriously think the book could have trimmed a couple hundred pages and would work much better. I am curious what Auel will write for book 6 and when it will be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe the best in the series","review":"i know it is hard to beat the first clan of the cave bear, but i really liked this one. i did not like the 3rd and am anxious to read the 5th.read them in order and continue, this one is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"For shame...","review":"I loved the first three books, but the fourth book felt like a betrayal. To get my attention and interest and then offload a bunch of crap was a mean trick. If I want to read about animals and plants I certainly won't select a novel; Ms. Auel has a great deal of knowledge about this era, but I felt she was just showing off--and leaving her heroine in the dust.I was ready to love Jondalar, but in book three he was revealed as a whiner, a coward and a heartbreaker. Then in book four he's a hero again? I don't buy it.The story of Ayla held great promise, but I can't finish book four and I won't buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I read the word \\"node\\" one more time I might have wretched...","review":"If you want to read a book about how female anatomy looks like pink/silkly/flowerly petals for 400 pages (along with how the Auel thinks the word \\"node\\" is apparently an attractive way to reference the [...]) please do buy this book.You get a bonus 800 pages describing mammoth sex, plants and dirt formations.The remaining thousand pages of this hideously long failure all deal with superwoman Ayla's ability to do everything perfectly. [...].I only got through this book by skimming past entire chapters, which, I rarely do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did she get this from?","review":"Like most of the people that have written the previous reviews, I read all of Auel's books. And, where was this going? I found myself forgeting whole sections of the book because it was so BORING! I have to admit that many of the other ones were pretty drawn out as well, but atleast they kept you reading. This is a book I would recommend not to buy. But, honestly, if Auel wrote another one I would probably read it. So, Auel, make them better, will ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxious to get going","review":"Re-read the series recently for the umpteenth time. Sent a note of encouragement to Jean in May hinting that the next book would be a great Christmas present for all of us. Her assistant wrote back saying Jean is currently in seculsion, the book is taking longer than expected and don't expect to see it in the stores in the near future. Everytime I have written to her (3 times) I have received a personal response, not just a form letter, from her assistant Delores M. Rooney. This note left me with the idea that maybe the manuscript was closer to being completed because she mentioned it will still take several months for the publisher to process. We can only hope and keep our fingers crossed. Maybe for the new millenium (2001)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut & Paste","review":"I am re-reading the series prior to the publication of the final book. Perhaps, if I had not been reading these books one after the other, I would not have been as bothered by the endless repetition of events from previous books; but back to back, it was more than tedious. I did discover one serious problem with the Kindle while reading this book -- one cannot through it across the room in frustration after endless references to the coldest place on earth that the glacier is growing for the last time, only to be exceeded by endless repetitive sex scenes. Most romance novels don't devote as much time to any single sex encounter or have as many in a book. How did they have time to do anything else? The plot of this book could have been told in about a hundred pages rather than some 700.I am going to read the next book and buy the finale of the series. I am hoping she actually writes a new story soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"As expected","review":"I knew it was going to be repetetive, because I'd read 1,2,3 and 5.

And don't forget the ever-present frown lines for good measure.The authors description of the Ice Age animals were amazing though, especially the mammoths.The storyline was just too...well, i suppose romantic. Don't get me wrong, I love romance books, but I expected an adventure. Not to say that a Journey across a continent isn't an adventure, but there were so many aspects of the novel that were too Mills &Boon.; There were plenty of opportunities for Jondalar to prove his manliness and possessiveness, lots of petty fights- but of course they make up, kiss, have wild sex with, once again, Jondalar proving his manliness.After a while, the whole thing with Jondalar being beautiful, Ayla being gorgeous and kind and loving, it just gets too boring. Is anyone else sick if Aylas ptarmigan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I liked clan of the Cave Bear, ok, so I was 12 when I read it, but I thought it was ok.

In this book, however, I had the feeling the author was trying to \\"remind\\" herself about the characters even more so than bringing the reader up-to-date on each character.

I'm a fast reader, so they weren't to large for me. Now, both my mother and I are captivated with these books, and we cannot wait for the next one. I check for it every time I go to the bookstore, and each time I pray it's there. Jean Auel draws you into the books with her captivating words, and realistic characters. Ayla is about as real as you get. I just want to leap for joy when she descovers something new, or comfort her when she is upset. When she starts thinking about how babies are born, I just want to tell her, Yes! You're right!!! There is never a dull moment, and each part is captivating in its own way.

Unfortunately all the following volumes decrease in quality and I finished Plains of Passage just for the sake of completeness.

The first third of the book consists of sex, review, more sex, eco-lecture, still more sex. Please don't misunderstand: I am all about whatever moves the story along but there is no plot to the first half of the book and the only real action is between the furs. Ms. Auel has set Ayla as the archetype of the creative, inventive, progressive Cro-Magnon, but she has made Jondalar a caricature of the sex-obsessed, self-absorbed, take-charge-when-he-hasn't-a-clue macho caveman. It's a good thing she gave him a horse because after all of that, I doubt he could walk.Even in the second half, the narrative drags along. The frequent five-page geological history lessons begin to pall quickly and the constant rehash of the previous books reads like filler material. If you've read the series up to this point by all means check this one out from your local library and skip the first half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story.","review":"I have enjoyed this series.

The sex scenes amount to little more than caveman porn; modesty forbids quotation, but trust me it's fairly laughable, as these characters step out of their caves and remove their animal skins for a bit of explicit fun. I suppose if you're desperate for a romance this could count as a trashy beach read, though it is an unnecessarily hefty and tiresome one, burdened as it is by a labirynthine plot full of holes, stock characters, and bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost too boring for words","review":"Number 4 in the Earth Children Series, that should have stopped at number 3. This book details Ayla and Jondalar as they return to his home on the other side of Europe. The book is detailed indeed, but the days are nearly all the same: They get up, they travel, they hunt,they cook, they camp, they make love, they sleep, they get up, they travel, etc. etc. If this review is boring you, you get a glimpse of the character of this book. All the time, they travel, I think they will meet with someone who will add some interest, but no such luck.

It worked just fine, until about 2 or so months after I got it my microphone stand fell, but not very far and hit the floor (which was carpet I might add), but not very hard at all and the clip snapped incredibly easily, I couldn't really expect otherwise because before it broke it was painfully obvious to tell that any tension at all would break it in an instant, and thus you had to be careful putting your mic in.So to sum it up, if you want a cheap, fragile, and easily breakable, BUT cheap microphone clip, then that is exactly what this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I bought two of these for my 11 year old son and within 3 weeks both were broken.

I found it to be cheap insurance and much easier than taping a mic to the stand for the evening.

However, The gap for the cable to fit through should be a bit bigger, as well as the tail-end of the grip; because if you have a certain kind of XLR adapter that is wider than the microphone, you won't be able to take the microphone out of the grip without disconnecting the XLR adapter first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replaced it with another","review":"replaced it with a spring loaded clip.

It was recommended to me, but I can't pass that recommendation on. The main trouble is this: a character's identity crisis isn't compelling (or even interesting) if she wallows in the realm of the cliche. In this book the main character's thoughts and actions and expressions never leave very well-worn yet shallow paths. Whether it's about love, death, twins, mothers, Christmas, sex, men, women, art, poetry, religion, psychotherapy, teaching, etc., Terry Spera does, says and thinks the predictable. It could be that this aims at something profound, that in this culture our identity-crises are all the same, all unoriginal and very boring.

The book is so replete with annoying redundancies and cliches and clumsily written \\"erotica,\\" it probably would have been better if the author spared us and contained it to a short story.

Occasionally I will get very good foam, where I skim the surface of the milk and I will get small bubbles and good loft. However, recently I have been getting large, angry bubbles, am not able to skim the surface, and must immerse the frother to prevent the milk from splattering out of the pitcher, with the result that the milk continues to bubble furiously. At times this is accompanied by an ear-splitting noise that makes my eardrums vibrate. The machine is three months old. I have done everything right: I have decalcified the machine, which it did not need as we have soft water, kept it scrupulously clean, had a tutorial from a Starbucks employee, read countless articles on how to make foam, to no avail. I am so disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it..","review":"I was so ecstatic when I made this purchase and thought that spending more money would give better quality.

Shot is sometimes watery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard-to-find filters clog easily","review":"This machine is indeed beautiful, and I find the espresso very good indeed. The problem is that if your coffee is ground too fine, even once, the filter clogs. Due to the design of the crema filter, there is an inaccessible \\"interior\\" between the coffee-side filter holes and the bottom-side single exit hole. If this gets too clogged, there is really nothing to do except get a new filter, as the clog is not reachable with any tool.This wouldn't be too bad if you could actually GET filter baskets when you need them. The only online company that carried them seems to be out of business now. And without a filter basket, this is just so much pretty scupture.UPDATE: You can get the filters from Breville USA, for a price.

During the past few months I didn't use the machine. One month after the warranty expired, I tried to use the machine and the heating light flashes without doing anything else.Breville will not warrant the unit because it was purchased here (Amazon). The seller is unable to warrant the unit past its 1 year. Interestingly, there are other customers who have had a similar problem who posted to the Breville site. The seller was nice and had a good customer service attitude. I would buy other products from them.Although the unit seems well made and is probably a good machine, for me it is a manufacturer's problem that consumers pay for the poor design a year or so after the purchase and warranty.

After spending hours changing the grind and the pack, I could not make a decent espresso. Somehow they do a great job of creating a good looking crema but the taste was not there.

It was out of warranty at that point in the 13th month. Some of the machines have this same problem out of the box. Before you buy this machine go up to [...] and look at the reports from other owners.

Since I liked the machine, and hoping I'd just been unlucky with the first one, I purchased a second one. It has now stopped heating water after 11 months. I make about three cups a day, and maybe this machine just isn't designed to last more than a year or so at that rate. But my preference is for something that lasts a quite a bit longer than that, particularly at the price of four of five hundred dollars for an esspresso maker.

The recommendations to use either a grind from Starbucks (espresso grind) or the illy brand, fine grind are very accurate. I tried something else, and my filter was clogged and useless immediately. Starbucks does a great job, and it's only $11/lb.3) When making foam, ignore the directions. Hold the wand straight up and down and just off the bottom of the frothing jug. This yields the small bubbles necessary for good foam (I use 1% milk and it works great).That's all. If you purchase, I hope you enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee...

Do u think I'm going to replace this machine with another Breville?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breville 800ESXL","review":"Breville 800ESXL coffee espresso machine have a beautiful design, make good coffee, but make poor steam for coffee late lovers, add to much water into de milk, the same as Coffee Roma machine, just because do not have a boiler, also, it is difficult to read de water level, I have to remove the water deposit to see the water level."},{"rating":"1","title":"thermoblock is questionable","review":"Had the 800esxl for 5 years - used it frequently, say 6 times a week. The espresso was fine, inconsistent heat, triple prime occasionally watered things down (3 stars for a $400 machine) - but the big problem came 5 years in when the thermoblock started leaking at the seams. There is no 'repair' for this - you have to replace it, and this is where my 2 stars come in - Breville does not make the parts for this machine any longer! Their customer service acknowledged this and had no explanation as to why - they did offer me 20% off a new unit (That's about retail at any Brick n Mortar store, woohoo, big deal). So, buyer beware Thermoblock is a questionable design in my opinion. I figured I would get more than 5 years out of a $400 appliance that basically spits out hot water - BTW I passed on a new Breville, um, forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNRELIABLE BRAND. I bought two, both broke within one year of use.","review":"I like the design and the nice decorative look of this product. However, the first one I bought broke within one year of use. I liked in enough to buy a second one, mostly because it looked nice in my kitchen. The second one also broke within one year of use. Based on my experience and the fact that there are so many of this model being sold as refurbished, I'm convinced that this product and this brand is UNRELIABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems!","review":"This machine is messy. It drips water constantly into the pan below and has to be emptied often. The metal has started peeling off around the base exposing a very unattractive surface below and has caused me to cut myself on the exposed edges. The power switch recently went out on mine after only 3 years. I now have to unplug it to turn it off. It does not produce a quality crema the way my Saeco machine did. I will not buy Breville ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initial impression - great machine for a great price","review":"Caveat - I have only owned this machine for a couple of hours and just pulled my first couple of espresso shots.I settled for this machine after lusting after some more expensive rigs (i.e. the $600 Rancio Silvia). Espresso experts on various message boards almost convinced me that spending any less than $600 for a machine (and $300 for a grinder) was a huge mistake.I just couldn't bring myself to spend that much, so I picked up the Breville.After making a double espresso and a latte, I must say I am very satisfied with the Breville. The espresso shot looked and tasted as good as any shot that I have ordered from local restaurants. The machine is extremely easy to use and looks and feels solid as a rock. Unless you're an espresso connoisseur with an extremely refined palate, you will be very happy with this machine for all your home espresso needs. I'll update this review if I have anything to add after a few weeks of use...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"Personally, I loved the book.

However, on our first flight (an international one), we discovered the fatal flaw to these suitcases: the zippers. The latches that you pull on to open and close the zippers are made of a metal alloy that crumbles on the inside. As a result, it snaps in two easily if it gets hit (say on an airport conveyer, or even just a doorway). Once both latches snap off, you have nothing keeping the zipper closed, so the contents will just spill out. It has not been a pleasant experience being in another country and having luggage precariously close to being useless, all on account of some cheap design on the zippers. We definitely plan on using the warranty when we return to the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've come across","review":"This book is actually well put together.

The acting is downright lamentable. The editing is so bad, it would make a silent film producer from the 1930's blush.

Besides, physical examples help you better understand the mathematical concepts. On the other hand, I think it does not have enough applications about vector calculus (Frenet formulas, scalar potentials, Maxwell equations...).I would have also preffered it to contain more about general tensor theory: pseudotensors, curvilineal coordinates, and also about Riemann spaces. Despite this, it's an excellent book where you can see mathematics aplied to science; this is the important thing for physicist and engineers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service","review":"After using Webroot Window Washer for many years I have become a big fan.

I'd never heard of the author, Perry Lafferty, but decided to give it a chance. Luckily, my chance paid off as it was a worthwhile read. It wasn't too deep or technical, but a quick, fun read.The premise of the novel is a commercial airline pilot being asked by the CIA to fly a plane holding a top secret military device in its cargo hold. However, to disguise these intentions from the Russians, the pilot is asked to hijack his own plane. The plan doesn't work completed as expected and soon the pilot and his crew are fighting for their lives. Not everyone is as they initially seem and the ending has a nice twist to it.If you enjoy technothrillers, this one would be worth your time.

It is still available through Amazon, even though it was printed ten years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I purchased this product in November 2009.

I just leave it loose on the seat so I can easily move it out of the way when I don't want it.My only complaint is that it doesn't have an on/off switch so I'm forced to plug and unplug it into the power outlet.

It is a short story, at best.Totally contrived and totally forgettable.When we accept rave reviews online, we must remember that these reviews are not produced by professionals. As far as I know, they might be written by someone who has read only one or two books and is so overwhelmed by finishing one that he thinks it is the best book in the world. Well it is the best book you have read, perhaps, but the sentiment rarely travels.I think my days of relying on reader reviews to make fiction choices are over.As for this book.. it reads like the tedious composition of a young person is some writing class.Reviews here, my own included, are impressions, not fact.

I would only recommend these speakers to someone who is either going to be adding a subwoofer(150 - 300 watts will do nicely with these), or is not too concerned with thumping bass in general. The crossovers which are included do a great job in eliminating the low bass,this is by design, because no 6.5 inch speaker should be handling lows. The mid bass / mids / highs on these things are just spectacular. I originally had them hooked into the stock cd player in my 95 integra and they sucked power from that terrible head unit wonderfully. I since have amped them with a rockford prime 4x amp.

It takes longer to use than a standard paper cutter, plus you have to make sure you keep the clamp open when not in use. People forget to re-clamp it and then it doesn't cut. It is not sturdy - ours must have somehow got bent because no matter what we do it will not cut single sheets of paper. The cutting wheel won't go far enough down and there is no way to adjust it.

It was very useful for the smaller prints, but is not quite large enough for the 11x14 prints that I also sell. While the lock feature at times can be a bit laborious it also insures that the paper is cut straight-something that my last rotary printer had a problem with. In all it works well, especially for small photo trimming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trimmer","review":"I bought this to cut my kids' school pictures. It takes trial and error to find the exact cut line, but this trimmer is much better than the Fiskar rotary I bought and returned (it would not consistently cut straight).

A mistake which, from the, start, erodes credibility. It is often ambigous about wound care techniques. For example, it states that \\"they\\" don't use irrigation guns. But it doesn't tell the reader whether anyone else does. This book was written by a surgical technologist and paramedic from George Washington Medical Center. They always make reference to what they do at their facility. I think an author with an adequate width and depth of experience would not write from this perspective. The book was co-authored by a paramedic...According to a description of the book, there should have been several different BASIC suturing techiques.

What it will do is give you some startling insights on the nature of human interactions and the stifling effect of childhood education on creativity. Useful knowledge for any human being. That's not to say that this book is not useful for improvisers -- far from it. The book provides fresh, interesting concepts to incorporate into your improv, or at least to mentally chew on.

The most important lesson I took away from Johnstone's work is to remember the audience. Improv is a performance art, and by definition that requires that you perform for the audience.

That said, in the comments to another one-star, a reader says that 50 pages of this novel were left off in some printings, whether deliberately or not she could not say.

Bellman's typically dense style and leaving some proofs to the reader makes for a lot more material than its 387 pages would indicate. The main topics begin with matrix theory in maxima and minima and quickly get to dynamic programming, differential equations, and stability theory.

I actually drew on results from a number of different graduate courses (diffential equations, real analysis, etc.) to help me and still found this book difficult to learn from.Many of the sections of the book present key material in a very general way. The proofs are often very condensed and sometimes use more advanced results that can only be found with outside research.

Frankly I changed channels with that one. That one episode aside, I have really enjoyed the series as a whole. It is tense enough that you wonder what is happening next, but yet at the same time the good guy wins, so the show ends on a high note. I noted that they have even brought a Jag into the show in a recent eppisode. Reminds me of the \\"Equalizer\\" series I enjoyed as well. Thanks to the producers for including that make as a cameo.

This is a lovely delicate mint and ginger flavor. I don't like too much ginger flavor either, but this toothpaste has just enough. It makes my teeth feel squeaky clean. It only loses out on 5 stars because the fresh delicate smell doesn't last as long as I'd like it to after brushing. This is also the hardest toothpaste from Tom's for me to find locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't care for the flavor of this ...","review":"I didn't care for the flavor of this particular kind of Tom's of Maine toothpaste.

However, upon using it for the first time, I questioned why I ever strayed from my trusted Colgate and Crest. Saying the taste of this toothpaste was a disappointment would be an understatement. I don't know if it was the ginger or the baking soda, but this is the worst tasting toothpaste I've EVER tasted. Imagine that you have to taste someone's old wet socks: this is the only way I can describe the taste of this toothpaste. I couldn't use it more than once, because I was so disgusted. I also didn't notice that it did any better or worse than regular toothpaste in cleaning my teeth or freshening my breath. I would've liked to give it more than one try, but the taste of it was too revolting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outcasts - 'Live! Standing Room Only' (Collectables)","review":"Reason I'm giving this archive 'live' CD a four-star rating is because I, personally thought the sound quality is darn good (especially considering the fact) that this shindig took place in March, 1967. Outcasts may have lacked originality but they covered other band's material really quite well. Like a couple of Stones goods \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Playing With Fire\\", plus Van Morrison's \\"Gloria\\", the Leave's only hit \\"Hey Joe\\", Dylan's \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", McCoy's \\"Hang On Sloopy\\" (too many bands ALREADY play this song) and two Rascals tunes \\"Mustang Sally\\" and \\"You Better Run\\".

Like Jane Austen or George Elliot, but with fabulous diversions by Goethe on society, science, marriage, human tendencies, etc. A really weird book that opens the door on a strange long-ago society where rich people had lakes built for their viewing pleasure, divorce was common, and tableau vivant was routine entertainment. If you love gripping books about high-society and affairs, then this isa great book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"my god this book is bad","review":"I'll have to admit I didn't finish reading this book (I hope my comparative literature instructors aren't reading this).

After purchasing Mule 12 years ago, I began collecting the rest of there albums. Fuzz continues the tradition of garage rock with a flare of essence.

The story may be ok, but whats the point if you can't see anything ? Stupid, stupid, stupid. I could not enjoy it straining myself to understand what was going on, and from what I see on these reveiws I'm not alone.

Fincher has made some movies I actually liked Strause Brothers gave us R Kelly & 50 cent music videos WTF. I like Alien, Aliens & Alien 3 they were excellent Alien Resurrection was an ok action movie. Predator 1 classic survival horror Predator 2 comes pretty close. These movies shouldn't be that hard to make You have a planet overran by Aliens a space crew like the 1st movie gets a distress signal & they respond another ship with Predators responds to it too or do the same thing just have Predators result 1st then some marines go in 2nd.

I Love the Alien series, but this... I admit that much of the films story happens at night, but even with my LCD AND computer, much of the detail is washed out. Very disapointing film released by 20th Centry Fox. Sadly, it won't be apart of my collection, because you just can't see whats happening. Note: I did try a \\"second\\" disk with the same results. Hopefully, in the future it will be re-mastered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad We Bought It","review":"First of all, every time I see a film of this nature that's mostly too dark to even distinguish what's going on (remember The Relic?), I figure it's going to bite. This movie was no exception. I actually liked the first AVP. \\"Requiem,\\" however, was a burden to get through.While I didn't look for any stellar acting (and didn't get it), or deep plot (and didn't get it), I did expect at least decent special effects, and didn't get those, either. As far as violence, gore, etc...all you could see was some of the gore.Okay, so no problem though, right? Certainly the fight scenes between the Predator and the Predaliens would be more than enough to make me happy...too bad these were so difficult to make out in the near pitch-black darkness, nobody here watching it could tell who was doing what to whom for the most part.I had so been looking forward to this and was so disappointed.My recommendation, if you simply must satisfy your curiosity, rent this movie...don't bother to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie was so terrible it left a bad taste in my mouth. I actually stopped paying attention to what was happening about half way through and I'm surprised I even made it that far. The ONLY cool thing about this film is the Alien/Predator Hybrid Monster that runs around killing everybody. Everything else about the movie was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This movie is horrible; The only reason I even bought this was to complete my Blu-Ray collection of the Aliens/Predator collection (I.E. Alien, Aliens, Predator, Predator 2, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be after reading reviews","review":"Usually I stear clear of stuff with bad reviews. AVPR has some terrible reviews. But I like the other Alien movies (yeah I like Alien 3).I will admit that the lighting in this movie is a challenge. Some scenes seem darker than they should be. It is hard to make out details durring the fights. On the other hand I feel like the darkness adds to the movie in some ways. Seeing these creatures in good lighting might make them appear silly and out of character.I do feel like there are too many characters. You don't get to know anything about any of them. They seem to lack emotion. But its not the worst characters I have ever seen in a movie. They are passible.The only real plot here is the predator hunting down the aliens. If all the scenes involving people where cut from the film it would still be good.I guess its not a movie I could watch often, but maybe every once and a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one should certainly end any future AVP endeavours!","review":"If I could give it minus stars, I would. As a 42 year old who loves Alien and Predator and who thought AVP had a very good story line (but not as much gore as previous Alien and Predator movies), I found this very disappointing. There was no real gore here, definitely no story line whatsoever, and you could not really tell which THING was the Predalien. Plus, there was never really any big scenes between the Predalien and the Predator. Do not waste your time or your money on this. (Especially your time.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought there was no way the sequel could be worse than the first","review":"I went into this movie with high hopes. The first movie was horrible. One of the worst movies ever made.When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew that the mess that was Paul W.S. Anderson's Alien vs. Predator was redeemed. Unfortunately, the trailer was highly deceptive.The real title should have been Alien vs. Predator: The Hills because it seems as though you're watching The Hills, but with blood (and just about the same amount of fighting). It's pretty people with problems with gratuitous action and fighting.This movie was actually WORSE than the first movie and shame on 20th Century Fox for allowing Shane Salerno to pen the script.Shame on me as well --- what else should I have expected from the guy who wrote the script for Armageddon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"avp=suckiem","review":"the first Predator was great, the second was good.

This one, Alien vs Predator Requiem.....the absolute worst. The usual horror flick cliches I could have lived with, even the teenage love triangle subplot I could have tolerated but nuclear powerplant...please that was one cliche to far.But the thing that really pi**ed me off, to the point I turned the movie off after 30 minutes was the crappy filming....darkness when artfully used and not overdone is great, as in the first Alien movie. But thi piece of junk....you could never actually see what was going on, it was so dark that t the odd bits of action one was able to make out made no sense, very disjointed...very very frustrateing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever and not just on DVD","review":"Just starting to write this review makes me think am wasting a few more minutes of my life on thinking about a movie that i would definitely not want even my worst enemy to watch with a gun to his head.If you absolutely want to waste 95 mins of your time, then head to the local library or just watch a free On-Demand Movie on Comcast.This is one movie which would make you hate ALL the original Alien and Predator Movies.Imagine this movie as a genetic experiment gone wrong when mating the original Alien and original Predator movie. Now add the acting of Doom Movie into this mix. You get the picture.The director and producer should have their licenses revoked for life and made to do penance for inflicting such a horrible movie on the public.I have watched Made-for-TV movies from sci-fi channel a lot.

And the plot was boring anyway.Who in the hell commissioned this dark pos for release?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEST MOVIE I NEVER SAW","review":"Watching 'Aliens vs Predator' is like walking through a cave blindfolded. Nearly 85% of the movie is in complete darkness with only flashes of light and the other 15% is dimly lit. And if that isn't bad enough the predator blows up a power station shutting down the towns electricity. In any other movie this would be a disaster but these townfolk apparently only use 15 watt lightbulbs and the funny thing is after the electricity goes out the darkness stays the same-it doesn't get darker. Strange.From what I could see the movie is unrelenting with the aliens and the predator killing everyone in sight-men, women,children and even newborns in a hospital maternity ward.The overall movie I heard is probably worth four stars-but I gave it two stars for audio and someday maybe 20th Century Fox will release a special edition--Special because you can actually see what you're watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I listened to it!!!","review":"The movie sounded good, too bad you couldn't see it! It still could be a good AVP movie if they somehow lighten up the film so you can see what the hell is going on! But as I was sitting thru it, it made me think of an audio book! Very frustrating indeed! I'd say this is one movie you could turn up your speakers and turn off the tube to! Don't buy this unrated version, just wait until they come out with another revised version of it which will probably be titled \\"AVP-Requiem Light!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely crossed a line that should not have been crossed","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Alien series and even liked AVP. I think they couldve continued the AVP series with that movie.But this movie was just chaos.I could barely make sense of the battle scenes. I couldnt tell who was who?And that labor scene was just too much.There are certain lines you just done cross and that crossed it.It is a slap in the face to any woman who has gone through labor waiting to hold thier precious baby.It was unbearable for me to watch.I really wanted to like this movie and if it werent for that scene I mightve purchased it but unless I can delete that scene from the movie I wont be buying it.PITY."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVP???

There was absolutely no scare factor that Aliens is known for. Nothing new that you didn't already know about Predators.If you remember from the last movie, at the end, an alien spawn burst out of a deceased Predator. Thus, an alien/Predator hybrid and made its way to Earth and attacking on humanity. Another Predator investigates and learns of a hybrid and takes off to hunt it down.That pretty much it. Humans are just in the way of the hybrid and the Predator is doing its best to track it down and kill it.Like I said, no scare factor. No build-up of suspense. The whole thing just felt rushed. Just plain disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dark Chapter in the Series","review":"I would like to tell you what this movie is about but I can't.

What an utter disappointment! Much like Saw II was to Saw I ... it was a cheap, low budget, campy version of the first. Seemingly thrown together in a hurry with hopes of cashing in on the popularity of the first one. Complete with your gratuitous T & A, dumb frat kids (easy victims, I suppose), and weak character development that didn't even seem necessary or connected to the basic storyline except as 'filler' to occupy the majority of the time in between a the few monster scenes which were so dark they could barely be seen. No special effects, nothing imaginative or creative, and certainly not anything that could be considered suspenseful or scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lights are off, but someone is home","review":"They really should have saved themselves the effort of recording this and just done an audio book. While i understand that they would want to make this dark (in terms of lighting), its just too dark that you can't see what is going on. They should supply you with some night vision goggles to see this movie.The movie had potential, but whoever directed it needs to get their eyes tested."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:The good news is that AVPR is mildly less ridiculous and annoying than the original (which seemed to think people in Antartica run around in t-shirts) but the bad news is that this is still a pointless and senseless exercise in gross violence that will make fans of the original franchises want to cry--if you fancy yourself a fan of Alien or Predator (or good movies) do not see this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad Sequel!!!","review":"I saw this on 1-1-08 and I thought it would be cool to start off the year with an AVP movie. I was highly disappointed. Mostly the ending pissed me off with the Government killing all the suvivors in the town and the Aliens and Predators. I was cool that it started where the first one ended, but it's just that ending that really gets me.

It was outstanding on many levels, especially the strong female lead. I had expected more of the same as far as energy, adrenaline and characters you find yourself invested in. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. It was formulaic and easily anticipated. Teenage \\"B\\" horror movie is a more apt description of a movie sequel that leaves you feeling hollow and awaiting the \\"real\\" sequel, that couldn't possibly be this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I know lots of people thought the first movie in this series (Alien vs. Predator) had a lot lacking, but I still ended up enjoying it. Sure, it couldn't compare to the first Alien or Aliens by any means, but it held some merit nonetheless. But this film is a complete horror to a decent predecessor. The story line lacks direction and it appears that the director just chose to include as much horror as possible to shock value. So while it may have some moments, this is one movie you can avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable, both literally and figuratively","review":"'AvP:Requiem' represents the low watermark of modern cinema. Taking what were previously two great franchises and turning them completely on their head.

The ship should not crash back to the earth. If it's another ship, after the crash, only aliens can survive?!

AVP was great, but REQUIEM is really really unbearable, I just fast-forwarded to the end of the movie. Really a huge insult to any Aliens and Predators fans out-there.I give one Star for the beautiful Blue-Ray formats : the picture,the colors, the sounds were excellent ... but for the movie itself, sorry to say this, definitely one of the worst in the history of Sci-Fic movie ever made. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of all the Alien films and I enjoyed Alien VS. Predator, but this film was atrocious. The acting was supremely bad and the scene where the aliens burst out of the pregnant woman was absolutely sickening. It turned me off to the point of wanting to vomit. I can handle some blood and gore, but that was just plain wrong. I agree with other reviewers that the entire film was WAY too dark and you could barely see a thing. I guess that was done purposely to disguise this pathetic excuse of a movie. I won't ever watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dark its not worth it.","review":"I liked the idea of the first one and it was OK, but this one was just a waste of money. I guess that budgets in Hollywood have gotten so bad that they can pay for lighting. I could not see anything that would make this film even the least bit worth owning. I am sorry that I even rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humans v Aliens","review":"I went to see AVP Requiem in the theatre when it first came out as my son and I are huge Predator fans. Other than the first scene on the ship, this movie is predominately about the humans -- big disappointment. The script, dialog and lighting were horrible. In most of the scenes, you cannot even see either the aliens or the predator. The movie did not follow the AVP lore which also caused great consternation. I purchased the movie simply because I am such a huge fan of the Predator series and watched it with my daughter and her boyfriend to show how very bad it was. Although, there is the scene when the blonde gets pinned to the wall that was certainly entertaining -- all in all it is just terribly predictable. This AVP is along the lines of the later Star Wars flicks. Blech. Until they bring back the magic of the first AVP, I'll stick with reading the Alien v Predator and Predator series books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn on the Lights!!!","review":"Rubbish, is how I would review this dvd.Its all in the dark, I couldn't see who was who or what was what.Too much night time stuff and too much rain.The first Predator had all the rain but we could see everything so clearly.Here the directors talk about how great they are, well the just aren't.It would have been better if we could see what was going on. Or would we??No good, very disappointing.I'm sure when I saw it at the movies it wasn't this dark, maybe it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"This movie was Horrible!! The first one was much better and had a better story line. This time around it was so stupid that I could hardly believe my eyes.

I wouldn't waste my time seeing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever due to light levels","review":"Trust the legion squinting amazon reviewers...My God this movie is dark. Light level dark that is. It's like trying to watch a movie through a welding shield. The special effects were wasted because....YOU CAN'T SEE THEM! Daylight scenes in the movie are hard to make out but the indoor and night scenes were just too blasted dark to make out. I WANT MY MONEY BACK! The movie was also stupidly edited. Hard to see a plot. Heck, hard to see ANYTHING. Just don't waste your time or money. Let it pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an insult to the awesomness that is Alien","review":"Oh, my, how I hated this movie. I love me some scifi horror, particularly the Alien series. The first Alien VS Predator wasnt bad-it at least felt like a movie meant to be released at a theater. But this mess felt like a second-rate SciFi channel movie of the week. All of the scenes were so dark that I could barely make anything out on screen. The teenage/town folk storylines were cliche and pointless-you dont give a rip about anybody in this movie, unlike the others where you care that Ripley lives. The Alien was barely used, and the Predator was also rarely seen. Bad all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark","review":"Even if this was the most significant movie of all time, you couldn't see it. This movie was far too dark to discern any of the action scenes.

There is no plot and the acting is terrible. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I like sci-fi. This movie is beyond B movie material. Apparently they were trying to save money on the special effects by making it so dark you cannot even see what is going on. It looks like a total amature was running the camera.

I Can't See!!! Ridiculously Dark...","review":"How in the world was this movie able to be released from Fox Sudios? Why was there not anything mentioned by the almighty studio execs for the quality control of this movie? All of the action scenes are too dark. The majority of AVP appeared black & orange/red which made it hard to see what was going on. The lack of lighting ruined the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on the DVD.","review":"I don't know if the story was any good or not, I simply couldn't see it.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien freak but omg! This SUCKS!!","review":"This movie was awful. I was bored the entire time. The plot sucked. The actors were horrid and half the lines were forced. And I honestly think both the creaters of the origional AVP and this one pretty much ignored Alien and Pedator lore. Might as well as made up 2 new alien species to have this movie. Don't even get me started on the first one.The Hybrid was silly, and that entire thing where it just spit little embryos into people was stupid. Not to mention the negligible gestation time. They could have atleast made it semi-realistic..... ooo 5 minutes and you have hundreds of full grown aliens ooooo.Hmmmm 1 hybrid alien took out what was supposed to be a ship full of uber predators....wtf. I am so sorry for you mr. predators, they made you lame.This movie was a complete waste of my time. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay to see it.

And I can occasionally watch my AVP dvd. However, this movies has to be the worst monster movie sequel I've ever seen in the theatre. The plot is great but when you get into the details and the flow of the movie you realize that this movie was better left unmade.Now that the AVP franchise has been destroyed (the first i'd give 3 stars to) My hope is that they'll salvage the Predator franchise however i'm not so sure i'll go to the theatre to see it at this point.Watch this one while you're cleaning the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I've seen all of the Alien movies, as well as the Predator flicks. They were good products, like a Bentley or a Corvette. This junkpile is like a broken down rusted Yugo. The plot is disjointed, the lighting is terrible (another review said it looked like it was filmed through an oil filter) and it doesn't resemble anything you would expect from watching the previous movies. The effects are decent (when you can make out what you're trying to see) but in all, it's just a stupid teen slasher flick with a sci-fi undertone. If you want to see it, fine, but take my advice and rent it. The best use I found for my copy is to use the disc as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for the Hills","review":"Be afraid, be very afraid.

The trend in contemporary horror films to show all the blood and guts doesn't frighten me, just nausiates me. I think there is a difference between suspense and nausea, and film makers need to learn the difference again. The movie has a cruel tone, which starts at the beginning when a father and sun have aleins burst out of their chest in a rather unsympathetic way. The cruelty doesn' stop and culmintates with a grotesque scene in a materiny ward. The wooden actors of the small town are so annoying I was rooting for the aleins to eat them. The Predator anit-hero has no redeeming qualities as it exhibits no compassion and is just fixated on destroying everything in it's path.If you like the early Alein movies spare yourself this film, if you like blood and gore knock yourself out. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A V P 2 LITTLE TOO LATE","review":"Too little of them and too much of us.We needed a battle royal between Alien and Predator instead of the brief glimpses we were afforded.A more sinister sub plot with government interventions in Alien tecnology would have been good.A more detailed developement of the Predalien would have formed a more detailed storyline.I am not a screen writer but considering the hype i don\`t think they got it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Requiem indeed","review":"What a sad requiem too. It's so hard to empathise with characters in whose best light look like they've been photographed in an eclipse.

The end really was not worth staying awake for. This franchise has overstayed its welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooo Dark","review":"I wonder what they were thinking. The film is way too dark. One has to strain their eyes to make out what is happening. True the Alien films used low lighting but this was overdone for this film. The actors in this movie make the last film AvP look like a masterpiece. Lance Henricksen was in the original Alien franchise and returned as a different character in AvP. To sum up the obvious:1) Use higher lighting.2) Don't use teen actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVP Requiem","review":"I thought that the first AVP was an excellent movies. Great acting, great story line and great special effects. It is my opinion that AVP Requiem is a lame attempt to capitalize on the successes of the past. The movies is really dark, special effects suck at best, the acting was \\"B\\" movie grade besides the story line was written by an idiot.

I don't even remember what I watched or almost anything I saw because I guess, technically...I didn't see it! Everything, all the effects, the actors, everything was wasted because of the unbelievably bad lighting job here. I've never seen anything this terrible.There was no plot, no story, the characters were completely cliche and forgettable. There was just no one to care about in this movie.

Just like Aliens vs. Predator, it compresses the breeding cycle of the Aliens which makes the timelines completely out of sync with the original Alien series.

( Limited action figures, the works) Both movies were a major disappointment but at least the first AVP you could actually get a good look at the Aliens.

This is one of those instances where I was right. I did not like this movie at all. The plot wasn't as confusing as it was in the first one, so I suppose that's a step up, however the characters were even worse except for maybe one. And once again, I felt no suspesne at all throughout the entire film. And, everything was really dark. And I don't mean anything like the plot was dark, I mean it was literally dark. It was too dark to see what was going on. The action could have been a good point of the movie, but the extremely dark environment just held it back so much.

There are slight references to the first Alien, like the name of one of the characteres, Dallas (played by Tom skerrit, in the first movie), the military girl , obviously an allusion to lt.Ripley,the population of the small town is expendable like the crew of Nostromo...but what for?

I am a big fan of both the \\"Alien\\" and \\"Predator\\" series of movies but I think maybe they should stop here. Even the original \\"Alien vs Predator\\", as bad as it was, was much better than this sequel.

I have never in my life seen those characters 150 million times before in a movie, thank you for that. The only thing that saved this movie from being a total joke was of course, the fight scenes and the Predalien, which I thought looked really cool. At least that's one thing they usually get right, the costumes and effects.

The inane plot, what there is of it, is reminiscent of one of those idiotic B movies of the fifties or of the more modern dead teenager flick. Though the theatrical version may have been at least watchable, the DVD version is not. The screen is so dark and dimly lit that not even frantic adjustments on your flat screen TV will make this viewable. It is like searching for treasure on the ocean floor without a flashlight.

If you haven't seen the first AvP I suggest you don't get this one as it will spoil the ending of the first movie. Good movie though overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVPR is totally great movie! I loved it!","review":"I thought Aliens Vs Predator Requiem was an awesome movie. I thought it was the best movie of the year! Very entertaining. I don't care what the reviews were given, I totally give it 5/5 stars. Great non-stop action, scary movie, excellent special effects!

THE CHARACTERS ARE THE WORST, THE STORY IS VERY LAME, AND THE R RATING OR LACK OF RATING DIDNT DO ANYTHING FOR THE ACTION SEQUENCES IN THE MOVIE.I SAW THIS ON BLU-RAY AND I COULDN'T EVEN APPRECIATE THE PICTURE QUALITY DUE TO HOW BAD THIS MOVIE WAS. MOST OF THE SCENES WERE NIGHT SCENES AND EVEN THOSE FILMED IN THE DAY WERE DARK.IT IS RARE I WRITE A REVIEW BUT IN THIS CASE I HAD TO MAKE AN ACCEPTION. DON'T EVEN BOTHER RENTING IT.

THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IS EXCELLENT QUALITY. THE DVD IS DEFECTIVE. IN THE THEATRE THE TREES AND PLANTS IN THE FOREST ARE GREEN AND BEAUTIFUL. THE SUNLIGHT IS BEAUTIFUL. THE BLOOD IS RED. THE CREATURES AND ACTION ARE SUSPENSEFUL AND EXCITING TO WATCH. THE DVD IS HORRIBLE. THE TREES AND PLANTS ARE BLACK, THE BLOOD IS BLACK. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK MANY TIMES. YOU CAN'T SEE THE ALIENS OR THE PREDATOR DETAILS. YOU SIMPLY ONLY HEAR THE MOVIE BUT CANNOT WATCH IT. IT IS AN OBVIOUS FACTORY PRODUCTION FAILURE. I ENJOYED IT AT THE THEATRE.

AVP Requiem is a great movie for any fans of the orginal movies. This movie is much better than the first AVP movie, and not as corny. It is much better than the stupid AVP Books as well, which are also pretty bad. Well worth the money when it comes out!!!

I bought this movie and it won't play properly on my Samsung BD-P1000 player, with the latest update. I also have the same problem with 3 other new releases on blu-ray. If you talk to Samsungs tech dept., they will tell you it's because the studios are changing the data on EACH new release and not getting the info for an update to them, yes, it sounds like a big \\"it's not me\\" to me too.I am returning this to Amazon and not buying any other blu-rays for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remakrs to the 1 stars","review":"I saw it in theatres, the lighting was perfect...not sure about the dvd yet, but I do believe I'll be somewhat disappointed (lots of negatives=possibility). The people who complain that the \\"humans\\" had no story and were a waste of time...who cares? I sat in there and laughed as every human died, that's the point, we aren't supposed to want them to live. The movie is based on seeing how they try to live, and fail miserably. Thats the entertainment of alien movies and predator movies, human survival tactics fail due to \\"emotion\\". I personally loved the movie, and hope the DVD isn't as horrible as everyone says. I wouldn't blame the producers if it is, I'd blame whoever converted it to DVD lazily and didn't think \\"maybe we should edit the lights a bit.\\"As an edit: I watched the DVD and I agree, there seems to be \\"darker than other\\" spots in the film. Waiting until nighttime and turning off the lights seemed to help a ton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad. Save Your Money","review":"Being a fan of the Alien series, I had looked forward to this.What a waste.It's the old slasher movie formula, but with Aliens and a Predator. Get the teens together, the bad ones get killed, the good one survives. It was all so clichéd, it was tough to watch through. No innovation at all in this story.Most of the movie is so dark (as in no lighting) I couldn't tell what was going on. These idiot directors might have saved a lot of money, and just released a sound track."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of gore, but a terrible bore...","review":"Only check out this sequel if you are a fan of gore. They really amp up the blood and guts in this one. Unfortunately, as is oft-mentioned in these reviews, it looks like The Brothers Strause made a final digital adjustment to the film and darkened all the imagery. So, the gore is there, but it's hardly discernible. A very weak script with laughable lines doesn't help either. I enjoyed the first AVP and was looking forward to this one. But it only left me hoping the next chapter would be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There seemed to be sound bites stollen from the previous Alien movies, such as the little girl screaming sounded the same as Alien 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawing the line","review":"I draw the line with pregnat(sp) in labor being injected with an alien baby. I stopped the movie right after that. I'm a mother and I went through labor twice. Sorry I'm drawing the line with that. I will not watch that movie again. Luckly I got it OnDemand so I don't have to have the DVD to worry about. I'll be sticking with the first Alien vs Predator from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated means it;'s porn","review":"And it may as well be. Even if you watch the R-rated version, this film looked more like it was made for the Sci-Fi cable network as it is incredibly bad and it siganls the death of the two monster movie francises. I do not think Fox ever cared about either series anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could have seen the movie","review":"This movie was pathetically dark. In some scenes, you couldn't see anything but black movements on a black background; frustrating when the scene is supposed to be crucial to the plot. Even the few daylight scenes seem poorly lighted, as if in a dream state. Once the plot settles to night and the cities power goes out, good luck trying to figure out whats going on.The plot was decent, but the fight scenes everyone buys the movie for were impossible to see :-\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulnd't watch the whole movie, the image is TOO DARK!","review":"I don't know if the movie's good or bad, I could only watch it like 20 or 25 minutes because the image is TOO DARK. At some parts, I couldn't see what was going on in the movie. Is it the DVD transfer? Was it like this in the theatres?I've written to amazon asking for a refund. I couldn't watch the whole movie! I had to turn off the TV because the screen was too painful to look at. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a bad movie","review":"Everyone keeps complaining about the darkness of the movie, but I have no problem with it. If you have the Blu-ray version, and your actually viewing true high-def, then it shouldn't be a problem for you, either. A lot of people don't realize that to have true high-def you need more than just a Blu-ray player or PS3 and a high-def tv..You need the cables, too. Classics like the Halloween series, Friday the 13th, Predator 2, Alien/Aliens all had their climatic moments in dark lighting, and no one complained about them..So why is it such a problem now? Grow up, people. AVP-R has a great transfer onto Blu-ray that gives reference quality(best of the best in high-def) almost throughout the whole movie. It is a great step up from the first movie, and has an extremely large amount of special features..Including a huge database of Alien and Predator info that most people don't know about. It is well worth the buy for fans of Alien or Predator movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for better","review":"Some movies are worth a thousand word treatise.The lighting, for whatever reason, is too dark to be enjoyable and the movie is difficult to watch for that reason alone.When you can make them out the graphics and special effects show this to be a big budget production. Unfortunately the script writing is a pretty fair match for the grade B acting and none of the characters are convincing enough to give a damn about when they meet a predictably tasteless and gruesome end.Because neither of the villainous reptilian monsters (good guy/ bad guy... maybe but who knows) have any lines it's not so easy to understand any real motive behind the wholesale slaughter. Being an action adventure I guess you're not supposed to care. I didn't...Some movies are worth making it to the theater, the popcorn and anticipation ... others are worth the price of the DVD. If you decide to rent it go ahead but personally I thought the download was a waste of bandwidth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame...","review":"Two of Hollywood's most famous Sci-fi creatures totally disgraced. This second movie was even worst than the first one. The stupid teenage drama and terrible acting is soo disappointing and completely ruins the movie. The visual effects were good...which is about the only good thing but the producers of AVP:R probably watched the original Aliens and Predator movies once or twice and completely destroyed what Ridley Scott, James Cameron and John McTiernan created. Terrible movie...i hope they're done after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally Unwatchable","review":"This film, as the title states, is almost literally unwatchable. It is the most technically incompetent film I have ever seen from a big studio; there is so little light in some scenes that you can't make out any of the \\"action\\" that's supposed to be the touchstone of the piece. Other reviewers have complained that the only bad reviews are from people who are expecting \\"ground-breaking\\" or \\"thought-provoking\\" cinema. I don't care if it's not as intelligent or doesn't carry the emotional resonance of the earlier films; \\"Alien Resurrection\\" is neither of these things, but it's still enjoyable, for the most part. This is the most disappointing film I've ever seen; people who were disappointed by the franchise being laid low thanks to \\"Alien 3\\" had no idea what was in store down the line. I wish I could have given this zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"I watched this crap about 40 minutes and couldnt take any more. I own all the Preditor and Alien disks and I cant figure out how this made the platform. First of all, the movie must have been done on the night shift. No light at all. I didnt see anything but dark things or whatever. Even the somewhat lit sceens were dark and dim. The coryogrophy or whatever may have been fine but I couldnt see it so I dont know. The 40 minutes I seen of it sucked, so what ever. The actors did there job. Too bad I couldnt see them. Common guys, light, depth of field, contrast, animation, simulation but not this.The sad thing is they have most likely made $40 mill on this crap alredy.ED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would've been good - if I could've seen anything.","review":"Seriously, this dvd is way too dark. I couldn't make out any details on either the predator or the alien. The only way I could distinguish the hybrid was the dreadlocks and tail combination in silhouette. Maybe there was some light reflection off the hybrid's alien face but that was it. Could anybody actually see anything in this movie??"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here???!!!","review":"What happened. I have been a Alien and Predator fan since I was able to remember. After reading all the comics and playing al the games I could not wait for the movie. AvP 1 wasn't bad but completely unfullfilling. I figured round 2 they would improve the action with a decent story-line but no. AvP Requim has awesome action but awful story. I brought 5 friends and they all hated life after. How hard is it to make a decent plot? The action is awesome, the original soundtrack and sfx are all there, new weapons, tons of killings, but the plot is a teenage drama, A TEENAGE DRAMA!!! What the hell where these guys thinking. I finally get the action I wanted, a Predalien, tons of aliens, still only 1 predator (which is another screw up) and then they gave us this plot, I felt cheated in life. I hope Fox realizes they messed up big time and sell the franchise to a company (WB, Paramount, MGM even Disney!!!) they wont ruin this anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and distasteful.","review":"I think it's safe to say that the AvP crossover is not Hollywood's thing. This movie sucked. it had decent action scenes, but it was too dark to ever get a good sense of what was going on. Acting and storyline were sub=par at best. The deal with the hybrid impregnating pregnant women was distasteful and offensive. I guess the Strause Brothers and their mom didn't get along too well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please feed The Brothers Strauss to the Aliens.","review":"It might have been a LITTLE fun if you could have SEEN anything. It's almost unbelievable that anyone could spent $40 million dollars on a film that is so DARKLY LIT that you can't see a f#$%ing thing!I guess these film makers forget that peaple actually want to WATCH a film. I was pleasantly surprised with AVP (my first reaction on seeing the title was \\"god that's stupid\\") but it was actually pretty cool. Unfortunately, this one goes on the trash heap. What a shameful waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even for mindless slasher fun! Can't see a thing!!!","review":"This is going to be really quick. This is literally the worst lighting (or lack thereof) I have ever seen! Light is one of the most basic aspects of film and this has none of it! I'm watching it as I write this review and I can barely make out a face and I NEVER see the Alien or Predator fully. Many hunting scenes were lost of any suspense for me because i couldn't see anything!! I hear it's different on Blu-Ray if you have 1080p and a decent television but after this I don't even care anymore. I will never watch a film by these directors again. I put them in the Uwe Boll caliber of directing, with a slight nod to Uwe becuase at least i could SEE his films--I just wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling very sorry for itself","review":"What a sad and tired old franchise this has become! Without even a pretence of a story-line, \\"Alien vs Predator 2\\" is simply a string of gory set scenes about as entertaining to watch as a highway pile-up. I suppose that fans of the classic originals could amuse themselves during the 94 minutes of this movie by trying to count just how many iconic storyboard pages (and even lines of dialog) have been lifted entire and strung together to form this mess. But only if they were really, really, bored..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful... useless... one of the worst movies ever!","review":"I could not believe it. This os simply one of the worst movies ever. IT's cheap, sickening, useless. IT does not serve even as mindless fun. evn if your turn off your brain, your senses will alert you how the intentions of the producers are fake, from the absurd lack of lightning (where you can't see the fights), to fast editing, through horrible \\"acting\\" and obnoxious directing (by two guys!)It's onet of the worst movies ever, where producers thought: \\"This is trash, but some people will enjoy it\\". It's the worst that Hollywwod can offer.Yes, I'm a sucker, because I've watched it. I did not even rent it, or downloaded it, I BOUGHT the DVD!

The studio has got to be pretty cycnical to release such garbage technically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien vs Predator 2","review":"I enjoyed the first Alien vs Predator movie. This current movie made no logical sense. Predators would just automatically appear to create drama in the location of the main actors. I would compare this to Jurassic Park II.

It's not worth the money watching it even once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, Low budget, Poorly Filmed....","review":"If you were barely able to sit through AVP, This one isn't what you'd expect at all. Opening night I went with all my buddies, and suprisingly it was a packed theater until 30 min into the film.This movie Lacked everything... acting, character development, story.. it was just a CGI production show that still didn't shine at its greatest yet inconcieved moments....These new movies will never be able to be in the same ranks as the original Predator 1-2 and Alien 1-2 series due to amatuer Directors.

Actually, if they had died, the whole thing would have sooner come to a merciful end.Selleck is OK, Elliot scowls a lot, and (forgive me) Ross does the worst acting of a commendable career.As others have said -- see Monte Walsh or Riders of the Purple Sage.

John Wayne was king for me when it came to the western genre. I believe two new stars have risen on the frontier; Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott. They both have made several movies and everyone of them John Wayne would watch, if he could, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great production","review":"I was totally unimpressed with this movie. I am a huge L'Amour fan, but the movie that resulted was slow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as you would think!","review":"I'm sorry to have to say this movie was slow moving & boring at times. The story line was good, but not filled in with enough action, as you would expect a western to have. I think this story would have been better served as a hour TV special, removing all the useless parts that made it boring at times. This review is not against the actors, they did a good job with what they had... they didn't have much to work with is all. Buy another Tom Selleck western, he has made many other good ones. Quigley Down Under... one of his best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK -But Not What I expected","review":"I was caught up in the advertising hype which mentioned \\"Lonesome Dove\\"and I thought it was a sequel by the same author, not Louis Lamour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent if you're curious; Don't buy this dog!","review":"I like both Selleck and Elliot in most of their westerns, but this is the exception that makes the rule. It does have its moments, particularly, in the final showdown. But, for the most part, it plods along with terrible dialog, huge lapses in logistical logic, and a ridiculous musical score that must have been barrowed from anything but a western. I can't blame the actors since they had to contend with a script that seemed like a 12 year old had written. Rent this or, better yet, Tivo it when it's on the late, late, late movie where it belongs. If the prequel, \`The Sacketts,' is anything like this dog, I'll have to pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation","review":"This is one which I did not even get to see. it is described as an all-regions DVD but is probably an Region 1 coded DVD.

Riders of the Purple Sage (1996) with Ed Harris is for instance, much, much better; also Open Range which should be released soon on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"This is the movie that soured Louis L'Amour on Hollywood. According to an interview, L'Amour so wished that they would have the screenplay follow his stories. This movie doesn't come close and suffers for it.The book was pure Western drama, while the film is tongue in cheek humor.One of the best characters in the book is no where to be found in the move, that being Kate's uncle. He is incredibly interesting in the book, and is the reason the girls never are taken from the shore as they are in the movie.Kate's character is strong in the movie, but much stronger and more plausible in the book. Lastly, Uncle Jack is made into a scalawag in the movie, while in the book is much more a true uncle.The movie does have a great cast, exceptional costuming, and some funny one liners, but if you have read the book you will find the movie very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I chose this rating because the movie was really great.I recommend this movie to whomever likes westerns and Sam Elliott and Tom Selleck.

The colors are extremely dull and washed out, and it's clear that the print did not come from a film source.This is quite surprising considering the transfer used on the Trimark DVD released way back in 1998 did come from a good looking film print! That is still the version to get if you're seeking the best looking transfer available on DVD.The 5.1 audio mix used is also quite generic. It has no extra depth over the original 2.0 mix, and even sounds \\"tinny\\" in a fake sort of way.They've also shoved all of the bonus material onto a single-layer disc, and thus compression artifacts are often very noticeable.The bonus features on the disc are interesting, but nothing to scream home about. And you can find all of these features on the previous \\"Collector's Edition\\" that this same DVD studio released in 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"This is an excellent western film. You should consider watching it for Ben Johnson's role, alone. Mr. Johnson is a great western film actor, and his role as \\"Uncle Jack\\" is superb. If you enjoy western genre, I suggest you consider adding this film to your collection. The team of Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott, and Jeff Osterhage is an excellent mix. I hope Hollywood will take advantage of this talented team and put these guys together again soon. Buy the DVD; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dukes of Hazzard?","review":"I purchased this DVD and just finished watching it. It not often you can go wrong with either Tom Selleck or Sam Elliott. Well this is one case where the directing and the script was so poor that even these two couldn't pull it off. When everyone stinks, it is appropriate to blame the director. The acting by Selleck, Elliot, and the venerable Ben Johnson--was stilted and put on. At the end it struck me that I had been watching an extended version of Dukes of Hazzard, but without cars. Unless you have the opportunity to see this film first, I would highly recommend you not risk your money on it. If you have seen it and this is your cup of tea, then by all means go for it. To each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the bored and lonely.","review":"If you can enjoy this production you've got too much time on your hands - get out and discover the world and life God created for you.Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot are not expected to act in the movie, just be. Elliot is supposed to bowl over the women by his mere presence and phony, deeply-intoned half-hillbilly voice. Selleck is like a walking Gentleman's Quarterly cover. This is one of those productions made to give certain actors a format to be seen rather than a format in which to labor to give the audience something of enduring value. The plot is credible but the execution of the story-line is for morons. For example, Selleck and Elliot sneaking up on alert sentries from behind; breaking Ben Johnson out of jail and the guards arriving just a moment too late to intervene. This is drivel for imbeciles. Look elsewhere for entertainment. This production should be relegated to the ash bin of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea but Not Thought Entirely Through","review":"This cutting board is great except for two things: the basket isn't very durable and the brackets on the sides are not \\"rubberized\\" to prevent sliding.

Although there is a religious journey underlying the story, the story itself is always front and center -- this is no sermon. As do many of its successors, this book uses the story-within-a-story format to shift narrators and to expand the plot possibilities. In addition to stories of banditry, barratry and bestiality, because the fantasy world of the stories is set in the real world of Romanized Greece, reading this story will take you to strange places indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Edition","review":"Amazon really screwed up when they lumped all editions/translations of this story together.

Until I purchased one for myself, they had all been supplied at work. When I received mine 'new' I was surprised to find that October 2010 was the 'shelf life' or 'use by' date. The radioactive component of the brush decays as it emits the alpha particles that make it so effective in eliminating static electricity from negatives. Unfortunately, there was no information online to indicate what the 'use by' date on the item was. I look carefully afterward and could not find anything. With the cost of the product, I was chagrined to find that my $ 60+ purchase was going to \\"expire\\" in less than 9 months.It would be more honest of the seller to indicate during the purchasing process what the shelf life of the product is. I would hope that for the price, you could get at least a year or two of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible for scanning slides","review":"After careful observation, this product is amazing at removing dust, particularly loose dust, from the surface of a slide.

This product does not remove fingerprints, scratches, or spots caused by something other than dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"No noticeable difference (except the price)","review":"I used a new Static-Master brush for cleaning slides prior to scanning. I tried several different techniques for cleaning my slides, including using a plain soft brush (no polonium). Honestly, I could not tell a difference in the effectiveness of the various cleaning strategies I used. Definitely not worth the extra cost for StaticMaster.Like any brush, this one cleans off loose dust and lint, but does not remove years-old specks that are stuck to the film.

They're also a good size and a sturdy cardstock, so you can slip them in places, put them on the fridge, or use them as bookmarks.

I say the affirmations several times a day, but at least once a day, I look at myself in a mirror while saying the affirmations. Looking yourself in the eyes while saying the affirmations are powerful and really seem to reach the part of your self that needs to hear those positive affirming words.

It doesn't even deserve the single star I was forced to give under this rating scale.Rap is about spoken word, and in the absence of vocal melody, the performer should hope to have at least tone and/or diction - Nitty has neither, and in the parts of this track where he attempts to sing, you soon realise that he isn't up to scratch on that skill either.This isn't art, not even entertainment. It merely serves as an ad for ostentatious bling-bling toting slack jaws without the merest slice of original thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Enron is a perfect model for getting rich","review":"The book is more like the current rightwing media in that like the media that continuously lies about the economy looking good and Bush supposedly bringing democracy to the middle east, Trump wants you too feel good. Half the book is filled with nonsense on how to look cute but nowhere does he address the real issues on how to face the reality which is that CEOs, especially the Ken Lays in Corporate America, earn 500 times the salary of their employees. At no point does this book provide any honest advice on how to save to be rich. There are better books and articles on the net than this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GIANT INNER OFFICE MEMO","review":"This book doesn't give any usefull techniques to anyone who owns their own business. All the book does is tell you how not to piss off Donald Trump. He frequently uses employees names so much that it turns out to be a 200 page office memo."},{"rating":"1","title":"ODE TO A POMPOUS WIND BAG","review":"Jesus, what a narcassist, I mean is this guy for real. Why do people buy into this idiot with the ridiculous comb over; the emperor has no clothes, people! The only reason he has any money is because the banks could not afford to call in his notes, he had such staggering debt, he would have sunk the bank..id love to know what his net worth really is..but you have to give the guy credit he does know how to get press, and his spawn seen to be a chip off the old comb over, they are as arrogant and frankly unattractive as he is, though i must admit his new child is a really cute kid...maybe a paternity test is in order. How to get rich...drive up ur debt to such a level, and owe so many creditors that they cannot afford to call in your debt..priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo for Donald.","review":"I wasted my money and, more importantly, my time with this book. It is not about how to get rich and it really has nothing to do with the reader making money or even learning about making money. Donald literally talks...oops, brags about who he knows on every single page of the book. I was very disappointed in his efforts to give any constructive knowledge on \\"how to get rich.\\" I agree with the other critic talking about the book.......How do you give zero stars???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trump's view of things","review":"The book is interested, but the title is misleading. It provides you with vivid information about Donald Trump's views, beliefs and values, but tells little how to get rich. The best books that I've read about getting rich are Robert Kiyosaki's \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" by Thomas Stanley and \\"Transforming debt into wealth\\" by John Cummuta. Both of three works above mentioned, although are written in completely different manner, style and by different people, share the same main goal: the importance of assets and the burden of liabilities. This is the essence of getting rich. It's always easier to create assets than to purchase them. How would you create assets then? There are many ways. There is a book \\"The Ten Roads to Riches\\" by Ken Fisher that I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trump Forgets a Basic Rule of Economics","review":"The fact that he doesn't read his own work takes a star off. Barry Bostwick is good, but no one can deliver like the author. I like the CD, I like his edge; though he drops names like a socialite. It's gets pretty dumb after awhile.The last 1 1/2 CDs are just a week in the life... Back by popular demand??? At the suggestion of Mark Brunell (sp?) the Apprentice drama farce. Thought it was a good show until the little \\"manipulation\\" where the guy \\"magically\\" comes in to rent the space 5 minutes before the deadline and beats the other team. I hope the show dies the death it deserves. Donald use to be about integrity, now he's mixed up with hollywood and it won't do him any good.The more you're out there Donald, the less we want to see. We like it when you came out, once in a great while. We valued the time with you. Now you're everywhere and yawn.....zzz...Don't waste your money... Buy mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a complete waste of money","review":"I have enjoyed the \\"Donald's\\" previous books and was able to learn a few key pointers.

I like to read mental candy as much as anyone.. kind of clears the palate and relaxes the mind, but this is poor even in the Mental Candy category.It should be titled.. \\"How I shamefully made a few bucks.\\"I loved the chapter on How to Invest Wisely. 1 page that said, essentially, .. \\"be vewy, vewy careful.\\"Trumps name is associated with quality enterprises and beautiful buildings.

Donald has in this great book. Thank you Donald for sharing. Great book and you have had a great year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time if you are not already rich.","review":"If you have 10 million dollars and you are losing 100 thousand dollars a day, then this book might be helpful. If you are not a millionaire, then this book is not for you. I can give you better advice on how to get rich than Trump. I understand he knows more than i do, however, he does not share a damn thing with you in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get focused, Donald...","review":"Despite the \\"How to...\\" title, I couldn't find a coherent theme or useful information in this book. He spends a lot of time bragging about his TV appearance, personal helicopter, and attacking his enemies - who cares?Sections on money & business - the reason I bought this - only contained general, uninspiring advices.I feel that he (or his staff) scribbled this book without much thoughts.If you want to learn how to get rich, I'd rather recommend the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" over this. Kiyosaki is not a triumphant celeb-billionaire like Trump, but at least he gave me newer insights into several business matters.Unless Trump's narcissistic stories fascinate you, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was forced to give at least 1 star","review":"I would have given 0 stars if given the opportunity. This book should not be titled \\"How To Get Rich\\", because the buyer may actually think that is what the book is about. Instead the book should be titled \\"How a Rich Man Feels About Himself\\" Trump's only advise is really common sense. He does not tell the reader how to get rich but more so how he (an already rich man) doesn't shake hands to avoid germs, drinks diet cokes, talks on the phone all day (making deals - which of course is not elaborated on)and reads newspapers and magazines. If you want to know a little bit about Trump's life, this book is for you. If you want to know how to get rich, find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definition of narcissism -A good laugh-but self serving","review":"The title is misleading. The title made me think, I would learn how to grow my networth. Trump should have more appropriately called it; How I was rich, and leveraged myself to more wealth, for now. Trump is a huge risk taker. The average person could easily lose all with employing the same risk taking that Trump does.Trump is SO egotistical that he doesn't tune into the average reader at all.It's quite self serving that he says you could make as much money on the roulette wheel as the stock market. Both are risky, but investing in companies is much different than gambling on a roulette wheel.His advice about a prenup may have worked for his lifestyle, but hopefully most people want a real partnership.His advice about screaming expletives on the phone is odd.I did laugh out loud. That has some value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful book","review":"This book isn't going to be useful for someone looking to use it as a guide to get rich. I doubt Donald Trump even wrote this book. It reads like a book written by a ghost writer giving out simple cliches with no actual substance behind them. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless!","review":"If your looking for advice, this is not the place to get it. This book is a rambling collection of brag after brag after brag. You would think that someone with so much financial success would have a bit more going on upstairs and actually have some useful advice.What is the secret to Trump's success? Rich daddy and narcissistic personality disorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything for a buck","review":"This book is not a how to book, nor is it an autobiography--its an expensive advertisement. Donald probably spent an hour writing this. Reading this book one could see re-writes from his previouis books \\"how to make a deal\\"--Endorsements for his friends like Tony Robbins(who paid him millions to do speeches), and the apprentice.Thoroughly worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to get rich by selling yourself","review":"No one does a better job than \\"the Donald\\" on self-promotion. He'll certainly try to make you believe in his bluster by the end of the day. And that's his big secret to getting rich in a nutshell. Create a false illusion and get people to buy into it. This book was inconsistent, awkward and too self-involved to be of use to anyone seriously interested in making money. I thought I would be getting a manual of sorts and instead ended up with a name-dropping, self-stroking autobiography that half-attempts to justify ruthless and shameless business tactics. Donald Trump is also hardly self-made and for me that fact detracts from his 'acclaimed' business savvy. I would be more interested in reading accounts of his father's business ventures. The only saving grace to this book is Donald's sense of humor which makes for somewhat entertaining reading. But how to get rich? Not with this book! I guess I didn't buy into the illusion this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rosetta Stone...not","review":"I have to give Donald Trump credit for making a 'comeback' in the current media culture where contempt for the audience is the number one prerequisite. And to top it off, he gives us another impressive tome to add to his collection of 'work'.You can get a good chuckle and also pick up amazing, hitherto unmentioned business advice from 'The Donald', who appears to have forgotten the first step to getting rich: being born rich, of course.Donald also pokes fun at himself by writing about that copper-hued thing on his head, then waxing on further about points so profound I forgot them on my way to the door of the bookstore.Recommended if you think being on TV is a sign of great success in your life, or if you believe that getting rich can be learned from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the title suggests.....","review":"The simplistic title of the book and knowing who the author is, should have been a tip-off that this was not what I was buying. I actually bought it out of curiosity and interest in a very unique and accomplished man. The book, however, is primarily about his organization, his (very general) principles of management and his (also very general) history of his career. It is an interesting read only if you like chatty, superficial books about someone else and their business empire. I will say, however, that if you haven't read any of his other books, it does give the reader an insight into how Trump thinks, his family, and in general, an overview of his lifestyle. The two stars is partly because I do not like misleading titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mere form of self-promotion","review":"I enjoyed The Apprentice and admire Donald Trump very much, but How to Get Rich is really just a bragging account of how wealthy Donald Trump really is and how many material things he possesses. Trump is one smart cookie. The publisher paid him lavishly for the book and Trump gives common sense tips that anyone in business could have given. The thing I enjoyed most about the book is that although he can be aggressive and blunt, his feelings can be hurt easily. I wouldn't mind having Trump as a personal friend, but I'd certainly wouldn't want to be his enemy. There's honesty in the book, and I give him that credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The book does not tell you how to get rich. It is just a promotional tool for Donald Trump. The writing is weak and the book seems like it was thrown together. A rushed job like this should not be in print!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top in Real Estate","review":"Every time this guy comes back from the dead, you can bet on a top in real estate. Look, I know this guy came back from being down 9 billion or so, but guess what? He got lucky. The banks didn't call in his loans because they couldn't!This time, the bursting of the American real estate bubble will take him out for good, and it's going to be ugly. His casinos are already going down the tubes. Time for a haircut Mr. Trump, literally and figuratively.Art of the Deal was a great book. Unfortunately, this one is 90% hot air. When he schleps a stupid spot for Verizon, you know it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"income=human worth?","review":"Yes, of course this book is better than all the other books out there, because DONALD MAKES MORE MONEY! Donald Trump is obviously a better writer than Shakespeare and God put together! (They obviously needed better agents) Just like Jay Leno is a better artist than Van Gogh and Michaelangelo, because money is always the ultimate indicator of quality! And needless to say, Donald is a better person than a million 9-11 firefighters any day! Get a clue, morons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to get $15 richer: don't buy this book!","review":"If you've read *any* of Donald Trump's previous books (especially \\"The Art of the Deal\\" and \\"The Art of the Comeback\\") which were surprisingly fascinating, you're going to HATE this book. It's not worth your money, especially if you've read \\"The Art of the Comeback\\", which was an excellent book.If you've never read a book by Donald Trump before, I would recommend his book, titled \\"The Art of the Deal\\" (which is coincidentally available on Amazon.com right now).I gave this book two stars because there are a few things in this book that can't be found in his earlier editions: updated pics of his children; info on his new girlfriend Melania; and a new section on \\"The Apprentice.\\" Otherwise, everything else in the book is material that is regurgitated from his previous books.For someone who values high quality work, I'm shocked that he placed his name on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining","review":"Donald Trump, more than being a businessman, is an entartainer and a very capable one-product marketing machine, where the product is Donald Trump.This books offers some common sense business advice on how to deal with employees, competitors etc. but is completely lacking any specifics on his real estate deals.The only thing which I thound mildly entertaining is his constant bragging in regards to his achievements, his friends in high places (Melanie griffith, Regis Philbin) and his hate for doctors. The only memorable advice was in regards to marriage where \\"The Donald\\" states: \\"Get a prenuptial agreement\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're fired!","review":"Yes Donald, you're fired! This book is endless parade of Donald Trump, the Donald Trump, the Great Donald Trump and his shenanigans. You will learn more about the Donald Trump persona, the Donald Trump attitude. Which is a plus for every millionaire in the making and wanna-be billionaire. The Donald Trump's larger than life multi billionaire attitude and view of life is great. But what about the original purpose of this book:\\"How to get rich!\\"; nothing or very least. A lot about his personal hatred and his awful trademark hair. But nothing about his beginning and about what he did to become the mainstream billionaire that he is.Unfortunately for us, this book is just a parade of shameless self-promotion. Nothing we can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak on content, strong on empty advice","review":"I love success stories, and I've read a lot of business books. As a fan of the Apprentice show, I was really hoping for a decent book. However, I was very disappointed with a book that appears to have been conceived, written, and published within the last 6 weeks.The book is filled with empty quotes that make even the worst feel-good spam email seem deep. Halfway through the book, I realized that I hadn't learned a thing beyond \\"do your best\\" or \\"hire qualified people\\".If you are a small business owners or an entrepreneur, spend the same money on \\"E-Myth\\" instead. If you want a book on The Donald, I liked \\"The Art of the Deal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King of the Blowhards...","review":"There is not one word about how one gets \\"rich.\\" He seems to write a book every so often to launch into more self admiration and promotion. Trump has so be the biggest blowhard of the century. Inheriting a huge sum of money with real estate attached is certainly a great way to get rich.It will be interesting to watch what happens with his financially troubled casinos.I have admired many great business people during my life who have done amazing things. I do not admire nor aspire to be anything like Donald Trump. I will never waste another dime on one of his \\"books\\". I would imagine that his greatest piece of advice should be \\"pick your parents well\\".What would Trump have done just starting from scratch like anyone else? My guess is that we wouldn't be reading any of his worthless books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I expected","review":"Picked this off a book shelf and read the first 20 pages and flipped through the rest. Snore... Not surprising that it's not really some get rich bible to have on your desk. Donald has never intrigued me much and it didn't shock me that his book didn't either. If you need practical advice at how to manage your finances and improve your people skills you won't find it from a guy who was $9 billion in debt and is one of the most unpleasant people to listen to. He most likely dictated 30 pages of this book to his \\"two beautiful assistants\\" one afternoon and they filled in the rest when he left for Europe to find another wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trump's memoirs - not a guide to get rich","review":"I was deceived by the title of this book. The first four parts are somewhat interesting. The later half was more about Trump, his family, his weekly routine etc., (Hmmm... Who wants to know all these?!)If you are looking for some good tips to get rich, don't waste your time in reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of this book is very misleading!","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book does not give me any real insight in how to do better real estate deals. The book would have been brilliant if the title was simply \\"My Ego\\". It's like a mini-autobiography that just covers his prime. Then by the end it turns into an infomercial for his TV show. I don't know if I want to even consider reading \\"The Art of the Deal\\" because if it anything at all like this book, it is mislabeled and will not truly help me make better real estate decisions. The only thing this book gives me is leverage in a Trump watercooler/dinner discussion. That's about it. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Total BS from a celebrity buffoon","review":"This book will not teach you how to get rich, but it will definitely add more change to Trump's pockets. If you want to make him even richer, buy this book and then waste some more of your hard-earned cash at one of his real estate seminars that he's been doing lately. He has several partners in tow who are also snake-oil salesman, infomercial, real estate \\"investors\\" like Carlton Sheets, etc.His book, his seminars, and his BS Real Estate partners will pump you full of adrenalin about how to make millions, all of which is great until reality hits, and you learn, as everyone does, that wealth comes only from hard work, savings, running your own business, dedication, etc.Do yourself a favor and buy a hard-core book on real estate investing, save your money, work hard, and give yourself a chance to retire -- perhaps not rich, but in comfort.

But I have serious concerns about the message he is sending to Americans. We Americans seem to equate \\"success\\" as \\"making lots of money,\\" even though the \\"successful\\" person may be a poor citizen and morally reprehensible. There are many ways to be successful: good citizen, good craftsman, good parent, and so on. This book is little more than a collection of poorly reasoned platitudes and egocentric opinions.

Don't spend money on this book!","review":"There's one way that Trump didn't menion in his book that can make you more money...don't waste yours on this book! What a waste of time to read. Trump does 3 things in this book: 1) Stoke his own massive ego; 2) advertise, advertise, advertise(for himself); and 3) enact vengance against those he dislikes (holding grudges is actually listed in the book as one of his secrets to getting rich. Sure. Whatever.) Nothing in here will help anyone make a dime of money.I'm a huge fan of the show, which is why I bought this book. But it's a waste of time and money. Don't bother.There was one humorous thing I found in the book. He must discuss 5 times in the book the attention he pays to detail, even so far as if the door handles in his building are polished. He must not have done the same for the book itself though as there is a typo on page 217! Gimme a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and entertaining..","review":"I have to admit I was never a fan or follower of Donald Trump. I knew he has made a fortune in real estate and had his ups and downs. So I picked this book solely because I liked \\"Apprentice\\". I was very impressed, and couldn't put it down until I finished it. Very easy read! You can definitely pick up Trump's personality from the writing of this book - straight forward, concise and to the point. The book is not a get quick rich manual, but is more of a collection of stories and their effect on success. Make sure to read a part about \\"Typical Week of Donald Trump\\", it will put things in perspective on what kind of character and traits you need to become successfull. Also, Trump is not urging everyone to make money in real estate, like many other books these days, moreover he focuses on personal happiness, you should do what you are good at and what makes you happy.I would definitely recommend the book to everyone as it is very intersting and very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Get Rich by Misleading Your Readers....","review":"One word: Marketing.

If you want a minute by minute account of a week in his life, buy it. If you want to hear how he bullies contractors at his businesses, buy it.

Each chapter named something off like pertaining to business in his world like \\"Having Patience for the Deal\\" and \\"Always Have Them By the Balls.\\" Nonsense like that. He even had a chapter at the end about his hair style. I was very disappointed and felt cheated.

It was interesting to get a peek into how a billionaire lives. However, the book is very shallow, more of \\"who I love and who I hate\\" than a real dispenser of knowledge. The font is huge and this book could have easily been fitted into a third of the number of pages that it actually uses. I felt like he was meeting some publisher's requirement of pages by using a huge font.Trump strikes me as a really shallow person in this book. And his advice is also very shallow. It is sort of an interesting, amusing and quick read, but certainly not worth the money it costs as the advice is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"Donald Trump should've told the truth that he sold his soul to Satan.

He doesn't tell you what to invest in or how to do it. If you want to learn how to get rich, one is better off buying a book by Suze Orman, because this one fails completely.

I suspect no body will get rich reading this book either.The content is mostly self-promoting, lacks any cohesion and sometimes not worth remembering for one minute. Mr. Trump takes a whole \\"chapter\\" advising people to stop shaking hands because he doesn't like it. How will that advice make anybody rich? That is just an example of how silly this book is.

Trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title. Seriously, if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich, why would he tell you? This book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of The Apprentice. There is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality! The advice is so mundane. Half of the book is memoirs of a week as Trump - boooring.

And of course the most important part, the saw is powerful and true.I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great saw.","review":"This is my first saw with a laser. In concept it is a great idea, but in practice it is a bit gimmicky. There is nothing like watching the saw blade cut your pencil mark in half.The digital readouts are nice, a definite improvement over a scale.My unit does not swivel easily. It is binding for some reason, and I havn't had a chance to fix it.I bought the saw with Hitachi's mitre box stand, which is a great companion to the saw. Well engineered and sturdy.The saw has an annoying kick when it starts. A soft start feature should have been standard fare.My unit did not come damaged. As for adjusting things, everything I buy gets adjusted anyways. The guys putting the machinery togther are not fine craftsmen, and if you want to be a fine craftsman you need to know how to fine tune your own machinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use right out of the box","review":"I must admit I was concerned about the condition the saw would arrive in based on some of the reviews I read and the bad rating the packaging got but it did arrive in perfect condition in spite of the packaging. The saw cut perfectly right out of the box. I did have to adjust the laser which was very easy, in fact the hardest part was the binder for the tilt angle until I realized it was a left handed thread. The blade that was supplied is good for framing lumber but that's all. To cut trim the blade has to be replaced. If it had a good blade I would have given one more star. If you like gadgets like lasers and digital and don't mind spending a few extra dollars then this is the saw for you. It appears to be well built and accurate. As for the longevity only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but very nice","review":"While I thought that this book might just focus on some basic checkmates, it surprised me by including some seldom-seen tactical sections. One of them was on proper defensive moves and another was on pattern recognition. I've seen a lot of books on tactics and rarely does defense play a role at all. It was nice to see. The pattern recognition section was great and really did a nice job showing how the same theme could apply to a 1,2,3,4 or 5 move checkmate. My only complaint is that I wish there was more! The book is simplistic and I think my review is a little biased because the book won't be of much use to anyone rated over, maybe,1400. It's a stellar book for those under though and would be great gift for a young budding chess player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Second Book as it isn't really a smiple book to learn from scratch","review":"If you have already finished reading a good introductory beginners book (I like: Learn Chess: A complete Course for example for an adult or teenage reader) and are ready to move on, then Polgar's \\"A World Champions Guilde to Chess: Step-by-step...\\" makes for a good book.

However, despite being very careful about routing the temperature probe cord away from the grill grates and up/away from the flames, the probe immediately died when I tried to use it on some thick steaks. I assume the heat (550 degrees inside the grill) was too much for it.

That didn't work either. I spent time looking at the instruction. Of course it's multi-lingual manual. Finally on the very bottom of the instruction sheet in tiny fine print says that there is no \\"on/off\\" switch in this unit. No explanation what to proceed.

I wasn't sure how much I would use it at first, now I can't be without it! My friends love it, and I have ordered 3 more for them. The timer is loud, which helps is I'm out of the kitchen, I can hear it.

I highly recommend this product, the only improvement would be that it should have 2 timers vs. one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not for Induction","review":"The thermometer works well enough at the beginning. Nothing has gone wrong yet. One major problem for those with induction cooktops is evidently the electronics have absolutely no shielding. That means when you are using an induction cooktop, even from a meter away, it freaks out with every slight motion. If you leave it in place, then it doesn't freak out as much. So far, so good, just great deals of trouble with induction stovetops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thermometer but it has its ups and downs","review":"Its great. I bought it for school for making sponge cakes, Italian Meringue, and cooking sugar. I haven't regretted spending the money on it yet. The timer on it is also conveniently useful. However The cord does burn easily and when it does the temperature reading doesnt work very well so you must be careful when using near an open flame. Also This doesnt have an on and off switch so I have to continually take the battery out when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timer/Thermometer","review":"This tool has proven to be quite versatile (oven, stovetop) and the \\"set to\\" temperature feature is perfect for sugar work.

The replacements and new probes on recent shipments of thermometers all have a heat-resistant plastic-like coating over the probe wire much like a heavy guage coated wire rather than the prior successful metal mesh exteriors. Those with mesh occasionally kinked if abused by the user, but they never totally failed to give a reading with such short life. The mesh ones were good for one or more seasons. I am thoroughly dissapointed with Polder's \\"new and improved\\" probes. This, of course applies to any of the Polder products shipped with the new worthless probes. Another disturbing thing is that the photos of the probes appear to be the old mesh covered good ones and nothing in product description says anything about a different probe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great easy to use timer","review":"This is a great timer. Very easy to use. It's the second time we've purchased this timer. The first one finally stopped working after about 2 years heavy use. We kept the probe, which is fine, as a spare. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it would be nice if the alarm was a little louder. It is hard to hear over the sound of frothing milk. Still a great timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!

Never the less, the first sensor failed in about 6 months and Polder very kindly replaced it without charge. After another 6 months the second sensor has failed.

I have had two separate occasions where at room temp the thermometer reads way out of whack (120 - 160F).This is far from scientific, but I think it has to do with moisture in the probe somewhere. Both times I threw the probe (not jack end) into a 400 deg oven for a few minutes, removed the probe and did a ice water/boiling water check, 32 degrees and 213 F. Not bad. Maybe some can rejuvenate their probes by hot air drying in the oven.

Just this week (December) I got it out and stuck it in the freezer, as we had some heavy whipping cream leftover from a recipe, so I thought I would whip up some ice cream the next day. When I went to retrieve the bowl the next day, it was sitting in my freezer in a pool of Blue. It seems the seal had broken and it was leaking the freezing fluid.So we got about 10 uses out of it, but for the price, I wasn't expecting it to break so quickly.In the end, it is more expensive than most stand alone units and the product, while easy to clean isn't durable enough to warrant the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit ALL Kitchen Aid mixers","review":"Contrary to what is advertised on Amazon and on the Kitchen Aid site, this attachment does not work with ALL Kitchen Aid mixers.

The drive assembly from the ice cream maker does not fit some Kitchen Aid equipment sold in Europe and Asia because these machines have a different motor head.Which the sites neglect to tell you.

I have googled this as I wasn't sure if mine was faulty and it seems that many other people have the same problem.

It actually makes a fairly small serving of ice cream and you can only do about 1 batch a day with how long it takes to freeze the bowl. The way the mixer portion is set up it will jump teeth and get stuck if you are mixinf a heavier ice cream. It is just a lot of extra parts to keep track of when there are better options out there with a bowl youhave to freeze.

I now find that I have to make comment on the sole individual's unsatisfactory review of this item and that is that I can't fathom what she is getting at as the design of the ice cream maker does not lend itself to the description of the problem she speaks of. As I don't know which mixer she has (the bowl is made for both the tilt or lever models) if it is a tilt head are we utilizing the lock? Anyway, I sure hope she figures out how to make use of it because it really makes an excellent ice cream. My first batch didn't last very long what with two boys and a chocolate cake to go with it.

I had all the toppings...all the goodies....well...20 minutes later I go back to the blender and the batter is still the same as when I poured it...I am not completely blaming the product...HOWEVER......Im just hoping that you read this...to warn you that this product is better to use maybe in the cooler months...then it may work fine. =]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Drive Coupler","review":"The drive mechanism is REALLY cheap.

Really wrong!!!Cook on stove, let cool, mix items with mixer, cook some more, let cool, wait 8 hours, add to mixer. And that was for vanilla only. Soft serve is great when it is first done. But after you put it in the freezer for a few days. It was like ice milk.For the price of the ingredients - I could have bought the best ice cream out there for less and not had to waste a day making it.What a mistake buying this.P.S. I does make a great drink, just like a 7/11 Slurpee. Just freeze bowl and add any soft drink (Carbonated or not), let run for 15 to 20 minutes. Comes out great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit European models!!!","review":"I bought my KitchenAid mixer from Turkey and bought the ice cream maker attachment from USA. The attachment that is advertised as \\"converts any KitchenAid stand mixer into an ice cream maker\\" wouldn't fit my mixer. A closer look at the photos in the booklet shows that my beating shaft was actually different than the ones shown. My dasher had a huge round spring that wouldn't allow the dasher to be pressed upward. This should have been mentioned in the product description section. I am very disappointed. I had to mix with a wooden spoon. I am giving it two stars because even with a wooden spoon (after 30 minutes of mixing) the result was perfect texture. I would have given it 5 stars if it had fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with European stand mixers.

Do NOT buy this if you plan to hook it to a European model mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not buy again","review":"My free standing ice cream maker went kaput this summer, after 25 years. I decided to try the kitchen aid attachment. It is easy to assemble but adding fruit, etc. near the end of freezing is very difficult. Also, it is awkward to disassemble to serve the ice cream. I have been very disappointed by the firmness of the icecream, but it does say soft serve. It is just VERY soft (more like a melting milkshake)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"After reading some of the reviews of this attchment, I thought it would be more difficult to figure out.

It has made wonderful ice cream and I love not having to deal with the old ice and salt game. This attachment is way easier to use! The only gripe that I have is that it is kind of difficult to pour in your ingredients. It gets akward when you have to pour because it can sometimes get all over the bowl. You have to start the mixer and then pour your ice cream mix so that it doesn't freeze on you. If only the bowl were a bit more wider so that there would be more access for pouring. But I'm sure with practice I will be able to perfect my technique! Overall, this is a fabulous invention and I give it high regards!!! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A better way to freeze","review":"I had been looking for a means of making smaller batches of frozen deserts and with less mess than ice, salt,and spills. After my daughter told me about her freezer I ordered this unit for my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. Frankly, I was amazed at the result. The family ice cream recipe was smoother and creamier than I've ever tasted it. There is only one thing to be careful about: there is a plastic sleeve that fits over the beater attachment. It can fit two ways, depending on the mixer model. Just be sure that when attached it aligns with the beater head in the bowl. Using this device, it is very easy and convenient to make a variety of ice creams, sorbets, and gelatos, among other treats. It doesn't hurt my feelings to have another good use for the mixer either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic attachment","review":"I was looking for an ice cream maker to try some of the really fantastic recipes I've read.

For one thing it takes an extensive amount of time to prepare the unit to use it. You have to put the bowl in the freezer (if you have room that is) for at least 12 hours to allow the liquid in the bowl to be frozen and than you can put it on your Kitchen Aid and you let it run for about 15 min with the ice cream mixture than its back into the freezer with the bowl to allow the ice cream to harden. Although it looks nice to me it was a waste of money. I would have been better off buying a Ice Cream Maker for half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible DONT BUY","review":"it does not work. ive tried it at least 5 times now thinking i did something wrong but no.

Mine lives in our freezer. We've made many rounds of gelato with it and it is so simple to use. Just turn on and leave alone until done!I definitely recommend this ice cream machine. It is easy to clean, no bigger than a bowl, and fits right in the appliance I already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I preferred the Lumina ice cream machine that Aldi supermarket sold for $30- seriously it was amazing (while it lasted- 1.5 years). Unfortunately the KitchenAid ice cream bowl is uncovered so doesn't seal the cold in like others do. The paddle isn't great. I have used both plenty of times to make the same custard based Baci ice cream recipe by Nigella and the Lumina aerated the mixture, the KitchenAid did not. In other words, I used to get a lot more ice cream out of the same recipe with the Lumina machine. Kitchenaid makes it flat (like melted and refrozen ice cream). Damn. Im going to get a compressor machine next, hopefully that will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great & Tastes Great","review":"We bought this because we thought it would be fun for the kids.

Still a work in progress but the bottom line is ---- Kids love it - We love it --- Win/Win situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"I had no idea what to expect. I had ice cream recipes I wanted to try and didn't know how to even begin researching ice cream machines. I stumbled upon the attachment by accident. Amazon had it for the best price.

We tried to exchange it at the local store but the same part was broken in every box we opened. We stopped looking after four and bought a different ice cream maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reccomended with reservations","review":"I've had rather good results with this ice cream maker so far (only made 5 batches to date). The only issues I've had have already been raised by others- namely the plastic connector is poorly constructed and often shifts in ways that could cause future breakage. Additionally, I've had some problems getting the attachment to engage if it isn't perfectly aligned (which isn't as easy as it sounds). I have not, however, had issues with the ice cream freezing, and was able to freeze two batches successively.As a more general recommendation for homemade ice cream success, I would suggest sticking to custard-style ice cream rather than Philadelphia-style ice cream (which contains no eggs). This ice cream maker (as is the case with most non-commercial ice cream makers)does not have the power to whip the necessary amount of air into the ice cream to keep Philadelphia-style ice creams from getting icy. I've had MUCH better results with custard-style ice creams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad news for my waistline.","review":"This attachment makes, simply put, great ice cream. I've made watermelon sorbet, blueberry frozen yogurt, dark chocolate ice cream, Nutella brownie ice cream, and dark chocolate peanut butter ice cream. (Get the book \\"Perfect Scoop.\\") It's easy to use, easy to clean, and makes wonderful ice cream in 15-30 minutes. I've only once needed to past 25 minutes, and most products were done at 15 minutes.The only improvement I would make is adding a pour shield. Getting the mix into the bowl while the beater is moving can be a bit tricky."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy, but must have plenty of freezer room.","review":"You get the bowl, the paddle and a recipe/instruction booklet. The bowl must be frozen for a day before you want to make the ice cream so it helps if you have a large freezer that you can just keep the bowl in so it's ready whenever you want to use it. When I first purchased this I only had the freezer that is on the top of my refrigerator and in order to fit the bowl in I'd have to rearrange everything and hope I could squeeze it. The paddle is made of plastic, but you will only be using it to stir cream so not much stress going on it.I have made chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream, cheesecake, mint chocolate chip and strawberries and cream flavored ice creams with this (cookies n cream being my personal fav!). It is great and so much simpler than the old way with rock salt and ice all over the place. Definitely recommend to any ice cream lover that has a kitchenaid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Homemade Ice Cream!","review":"If you have a KitchenAid mixer, this is no doubt a great addition to the machine. Works great. It leaves the ice cream in a soft-serve consistency but putting it in the freezer will harden it to the usual hard ice-cream.There's plenty of online and book recipes that work with this. Any flavor of ice cream you can think of, you can make.I'd recommend it to anyone who likes ice cream, pretty much. Can't go wrong with it.

Everything remained like milk (thought I made the custard too thin, used a half recipe, 3rd time bought a thermometer to get the custard up to the correct temp). With much sadness I had to return it.I was given a cuisinart ice cream maker over a year ago. I hadn't attempted to make ice cream out of fear that the results would still stink!

I made a single batch of vanilla without any problems shortly after receiving it. Attempts to churn/freeze ice cream the following summer were unsuccessful, however, as the temperature of the bowl was not sufficiently low to freeze the pre-chilled mixture. In addition, a hairline crack is visible adjacent to the alignment tab on the bowl, and blue fluid seeps from the crack during temperature changes. Since I have owned this bowl for longer than 1 year KitchenAid doesn't cover warranty replacement, even though I have only used it 3 times. While I have previously been very loyal to the KitchenAid product line, this negative experience comes shortly after a catastrophic blender failure. In addition, having owned several bad hand tools from this manufacturer including pastry brushes, cheese graters, and cookware, I think this may be the end of the line for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"If you are purchasing this product for use on a mixer outside the U.S. it will not work as you will need an International drive assembly and an international dasher.

The blue freezing liquid inside the bowl begins to leak, and in addition to being a mess in your cupboard and freezer, it won't properly freeze the ice cream any more. A friend of mine had the exact same freezer attachment for his Kitchen Aid and the same thing happened, so it is not an isolated incident.

After 30 minutes, the recommended time in the mixer, the ice cream was still pretty liquid, not even soft serve yet. I took it out and put it in a container in the freezer.

Allows you to get more out of your mixer. Cleanup is fairly easy.Cons: You either need to plan way ahead to make ice cream or keep this thing in your freezer at all times. Most of our batches have had some ice crystals. I think this is because it doesn't get cold enough to really freeze the batter, so a lot of the freezing happens after I put it in a container in the freezer. If you're serious about making ice cream at home, get a machine with a real refrigeration unit built in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"I really like this addition to my kitchenaid mixer. You can find cheaper ice cream makers, but this takes up less cupboard space. Really worth the price if you own a kithenaid mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it!!!","review":"My husband bought this for me for Xmas and insisted I open it early...like two weeks early. I'm glad he did! It's wonderful. It took me about 1 minute to figure out how to assemble it and even though the directions say let the machine freeze for a minimum of 15 hours, it made a delicious batch of ice cream for us after 8 hours. I was a little concerned that it would be loud, but since you only use the lowest speed you barely notice it's going. Best Christmas gift ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ice cream","review":"I got this ice cream maker for my dad's b-day in july. Then my aunts came up and I made some vanilla ice cream, and it turned out phenomenal. Everyone loved the ice cream.(yum) It only took about 20 minutes to freeze, and it was a perfect texture. It was really fluffy and creamy. It was the easiest thing to do, and it was fun to use, too. Everybody wants me to make some more because it was so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked and Leaked Blue Anti-Freeze Liquid","review":"I've bought two of these freezers before, and they've both cracked in the same place. I took very good care of them, following the cleaning & storage instructions, but there's a seam that is not well formed and broke on both. I do not recommend this product, even though I love my kitchen aid. I'm going to try one of the stand-alone ice cream makers that does not have the same seams on the side to see if that one works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK FOR AUSTRALIAN MIXER MODEL","review":"BUYER BEWARE! This item does not fit Australia/New Zealand models. You must buy additional parts to make this product work. WARNING!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better options out there","review":"I'm an engineer and can fix just about anything. I know machines. While I love my Kitchen Aid mixer this ice cream attachment is a rather poor implementation. The method KA uses to attach the mixer is just a poor design. The attachment bracket is pressure fit to the head of the mixer that relies on little friction pads to keep it in place. The set up works if you're willing to putz with it continuously, but I found it's just WAY too much hassle. It will work if you're making ice cream and don't let it get too hard. Forget it if you're making frozen yogurt, which gets harder faster. By the end of the process my hands were all sticky from stopping the machine repeatedly to push the attachment bracket back on. My 4 year old however really enjoyed getting dirty! I eventually returned this to Target as there are much better options out there for less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"one of the components of the attachments broke during the use, but the kitchenaid customer support service was great, they sent me a new part to replace the broken one very fast.The ice cream is very good.

I love my Kitchenaid mixer so I saw the ice cream maker as a natural progression.

Now I am having to replace my 6 qt, 575W Kitchenaid stand mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cream Maker attachment","review":"Easy to use. Kitchen-Aid provided an attachment that made it easier to use with my older model KA mixer.Would have rated this a 5-star but I have not discovered the correct freezer temperature for the bowl to work best, yet.

Now I keep this attachment in the freezer all the time so it is ready to use at any time. If you don't have the unit frozen, you need to allow 15 hours in the freezer before using. The only thing that the instructions were unclear about was the use of the attachment and paddle since they don't securely lock in place. It is easy to figure out through trial and error. After the first time use, it is a breeze to make home made ice cream and you won't buy store bought any more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I received this item as a gift, but didn't try to use it until the next summer. When I put it into the freezer I noticed blue leaking down the sides of the bowl. When I contacted Kitchenaid they offered me a discount to re-purchase the same attachment at a higher price than available at Amazon. Since I wasn't even able to use the original attachment once, I'm not wasting my money on getting the same thing again and will choose a different brand. Do not recommend (or at the very least try it right away so that you can get your money back while it is under warranty)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its ok","review":"I have a swivel head Kitchen Aid, and the way this unit connects is kind of strange. I wasn't always sure I had everything just right. I don't like the fact that I have to freeze the bowl for 18+ hours before using it. I found that if everything is super chilled and the bowl has been in the freezer, then everything works. But if you have more milk/cream, it doesn't aways freeze to what it should be. Its a Kitchen Aid product so I'm happy with it, but I still went out and bought a unit that has a self contained freezer compressor in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We make all kind of ice creams and frozen yogurts.

For for the kids as well as us adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes poor consistency ice cream","review":"The slowest speed on the Kitchenaid mixer is much too fast for making ice cream. At over 60 rpm, the dasher injects so much air into the mixture that the finished product has the consistency of whipped cream after only 15 minutes. Churning for a shorter time produces a soupy, half-frozen mixture that freezes into a solid block in the freezer. I have tried many recipes and flavors with this device and the result is the same every time. There are many fine uses for a Kitchenaid mixer but making ice cream is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker Attachment","review":"Absolutely wonderful. Best purchase ever made! Honestly, I was so afraid at first, afraid the manual wouldn't be there and I wouldn't know how to use the ice cream maker or the recipes for ice cream - but it has turned out to be wonderful! Any one who owns a KitchenAid Mixer really, really should purchase the attachment of the ice cream maker --it fits each and every single type of the KitchenAid Mixer made since 1990!!! You cannot beat that!! Wonderful. Best purchase ever. Thank you so much for selling this item. It will make my and my husband's life so much more enjoyable and yummy! Again - THANK YOU - also this is a wonderful deal money wise. I had searched at different stores in my area (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, NC) and this was a good $20 to $30 different and still brand new with everything in it. Worth the purchase!

There is some mention on the Kitchenaid site that there is an adapter piece that you can buy somewhere overseas, but I have not been able to locate it. This attachment looks amazing, and I'd love to have the convenience of making ice cream with my stand mixer, but alas, it is not meant to be.If you live overseas and have stand mixer model 5K5SS, do NOT buy this attachment--it will NOT work with your mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy in your tummy!","review":"We already love our kitchenaid and only having to order an attachment to have Ice cream in our bellies makes us wonder how one could love a kitchen appliance so much more!

It is so fast and eliminates the need for ice or salt. And, you can control the fat, calories, etc. Just keep it in your freezer all the time and you can make ice cream on the spot! The only drawback is that it makes only 2 quarts -- make sure you read the directions and only use 46 oz of batter (and not 2 quarts) as it will expand when it freezes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent , silky ice cream!","review":"We just got this ice cream maker and, while the \\"dasher\\" was a bit tricky to attach, we're VERY glad we purchased this. There are two reasons why we like it.First, the ice cream was EXCELLENT: truly \\"silky\\", much like the texture of gelato that you buy in Italy. No ice crystals and FAR superior to any purchased premium ice creams and custards we've ever tried.Second, since this attaches to a Kitchen Aid mixer, there is no bulky electronic housing or motor to store. Basically put the beater & dasher into bowl and \\"store\\"it in the freezer. Then, you're ready to go, whenever you want. What could be more convenient?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR K45SS!","review":"This ice cream maker attachment may work well with other mixers, but it is a disaster with the 4 1/2 quart mixer. Page 13 of the K45SS mixer owners manual states that you \\"4. Turn bowl gently in clockwise direction.\\" to attach it to the mixer. After the ice cream maker bowl came loose during the mixing process and jammed my mixer, I realized that the ice cream maker attachment tightens in the counterclockwise direction and so states in its owners' manual. A recipe for disaster. I will now need to replace the gear head assembly in my mixer. Do not use with the K45SS mixer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Product - cooling fluid leaks after 2 uses","review":"Received the ice cream maker as a Christmas gift 2 years ago to go with a Kitchen Aid Professional 6 mixer. It made 2 batches of great ice cream. Recently, a few hours after putting the unit in the freezer to prepare for making a batch, we noticed a cooling fluid leak from the unit into the freezer. Contacting Kitchen Aid got the response that since the unit is out of warranty, we have to buy a new one. They seemed to have no interest in what might be a major safety flaw with the cooling fluid leaking from the unit. So, a report to the Consumer Product Safety Commission is in order. Other Kitchen Aid products have functioned satisfactorily over the years. But, after only two uses and absolutely no abuse of this product, for the company not to stand behind the product makes me reluctant to buy Kitchen Aid in the future. I certainly will not replace this ice cream maker with another from Kitchen Aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homemade Ice Cream","review":"This product has taken all the work out of making ice cream.

The bowl and mixer made good ice cream, but I just wasn't impressed that after only a few uses it broke.

However, here's something that I feel should be at the top of the review section so worldwide buyers will be aware of this glaring irregularity: The mixer is certainly NOT compatible with all Kitchenaid stand mixers.For those stand mixer owners outside of the USA, if you have a metal cup thing on your motor beater, it won't fit as it needs a different \\"dasher\\" than the one in this model.Just FYI, so you don't waste craploads of money on shipment like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money better elsewhere","review":"I bought this as an addition to the kitchen aid mixer. I was really excited to make my first batch of ice cream after leaving the bowl in the freezer for two days. I put my ice cream mixture in and let it mix and mix... never getting to the consistency I'd expect. Its good at making slushies, but not good thick and creamy ice cream. I felt that the bowl never stayed cold long enough. I returned it and bought the cheaper, but far better Cuisinart ICE-30BCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Makerwhich makes ice cream and gelato without a hitch.I expected more and better from a kitchen aid product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best attachment ever","review":"I got this over Christmas and it is now mid-January.

This purchase did not turn out to be the bargain I thought it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"Kitchen Aid (KA)Ice Cream maker attachment does not work well--big disappointment. The drive assembly that should slip onto the motor head doesn't really fit, and when ice cream begins to firm up after less than 10 minutes of churning time, it flies off in a scary way. User is left with an ice cream mixture that is only slightly beginning to harden. At that point the only option is to put mixture in the freezer, even though it is not ready, and consequently the mixture freezes into a hard block. I have the KA bowl-lift stand mixer (4.5 quart) and checked/re-checked assembly instructions so I'm sure I put it on correctly. Maybe it works well with other KA mixers, but it definitely does not work well with the KA bowl-lift stand mixer 4.5 quart. KA customer assistance was no help--they just want to review the assembly instructions as if somehow it's been done wrong (=customer must be wrong/stupid). I'm going to buy another ice cream maker because this one cannot be used safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates an unacceptable product","review":"I am a professional pastry chef, this was purchased for home use. I am not using the product incorrectly. Due to a fatal design flaw, the dasher stops churning the ice cream well before even a soft serve consistency is reached. That means you must freeze the ice cream before it is fully churned which creates large undesirable ice crystals. Furthermore, in spite of the \\"Hassle Free Guarantee\\" I was hassled for a good forty five minutes, told I was using it wrong and I didn't know what I was talking about. Ultimately had to speak to two supervisors to return the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked after a handful of uses","review":"Unlike some of the other 1-star reviewers, I managed to make some rather amazing ice cream with this product. The problem is, after just over 2 years with only a handful of uses (less than 10, probably closer to 6) I noticed that the inside of the bowl was leaking blue fluid. For an $80 product, especially from KitchenAid, that's just unacceptable quality. The included warranty is only 1 year, so I'm out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't buy store bought ice cream again","review":"Once you've made home made ice cream you won't bother with the store bought versions.

They turned out perfect in the wooden one so I know it isnt the recipes that are the problem. Does anyone have good info on how to keep from getting airy, fluffy ice cream? I have it on the stir setting, I keep my bowl in the freezer 24/7. I dont think I am doing anything wrong. Is this just how everyones ice cream comes out?

You have to keep the bowl frozen for 12-15 hours before you want to make ice cream so you have to plan out ahead or leave it in the freezer taking up space. There is no lid on the bowl so alot of air gets whipped in and anything can fall in. As well, when I add solid ingredients (cho. chips, nuts) the paddle gets knocked loose and I have to stop down and line it back up. Overall, I would have rather bought a tradiational style ice cream maker. I'll probably give this thing away and buy a real ice cream maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great icecream maker, but a little small","review":"This is a great device for making frozen treats fast! I've made ice cream several times already, and it is always delicious. The only drawback is that the freezer container is a little small.

I also refrigerated my ice cream mixture (non dairy) overnight before trying to make ice cream in this thing. I ended up with slush both times I tried. I also had to have my first bowl replaced by Kitchenaid because the blue liquid in the bowl must have leaked at the store I purchased this from.

Due to being underweight they do not fly on a stable path and do not have enough momentum to stick in the board. Their plastic fins are easily bent because they bounce off the board causing them not to fly straight as well. They are also not the typical length so it is awkward to grip them.

She was so mean and hateful to her, but when I learned why Emily's mother hated her so much my heart went out to them both!I fell in love with Emily's best friend Annette she was definitely a work of art! Emily's daughter Lisa was TWO handfuls at the beginning, but she slowly came around.Written In Red Ink gets five starts no doubt! I LOVED this book! I highly recommend it to others! Read it slowly and you will understand what is written in red ink! Kudos to Kieja Shapodee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Captivating","review":"This book was very well written and the storyline was really good. I wish that there had been more in the novel about Emily and Leora's relationship and more about her, Emily's, childhood. It would have given more insight to why Lisa, her eldest daughter, behaved the way she did.If I had a best friend like Annette, I would have to reevaluate my friends! Annette could have added more to the explanation of Emily and Leora since she and Emily were childhood friends. Annette's appetite for men, was a bit much for me, but quite entertaining. What was up with her man's outfits? They sounded outrageous!Overall, I was glad that Emily had a positive family image and she had the baby that she always wanted. I really enjoyed reading this book and it was very easy to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was different","review":"Written in red Ink is the story of Emily, who's mother for some strange reason hate her.

True, Saul didn't have to kill himself to think this one up, but it's a good story that will keep you entertained. I didn't think fiction had to be believable, isn't that what makes it a fiction? The story of Angel and Seth is good, and I only wish the revenge went on for longer, it almost seemed as if Saul got bored and said 'we'll just end it here' I've read a few of his books and the ending is never final and never clear so by now I'm used to it. If you pick up John Saul there will be loose ends when you finally close it, it's just what he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I thought this book was great. It gets you on the very first page & is really hard to put down. It is a typical John Saul book. Really good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"This is the first (and will be the last) John Saul novel that I've read. I picked it up at a used book store primarily because I couldn't find anything else that I hadn't already read that looked interesting. There is a quote on the outside cover of the paperback edition that compares the book to \\"Stephen King in his prime.\\" John Saul is no Stephen King in his prime. Stephen King's better books are ambitious in their scope, and explore old themes in unpredictable ways. This book brings nothing new to the genre, but instead rehashes the same tired themes that any horror novel about alienated teens are required to cover, and lacks ambition. I just couldn't seem to care what happened, because I felt like I had read about it all before, but in much more appealing packages."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are over 14 years old - pass on this one","review":"Not remembering that I had a read a book by John Saul many years ago (possibly as a teenager) and disliked it, I ordered this audio book. This author seems to have a penchant for writing storylines about dead prepubescent girls who are now ghosts, influencing subsequent tenants of their previous homes (also young girls) to somehow follow them to their untimely deaths. This pattern is overdone and very tired. I find it odd that this author can't be more creative. Doesn't he think we notice that his stories are repeating themselves, just with the names changed? The story reads like it was written by a 13-year old rather than a seasoned author and it is NOT scary. For example, a recurring theme in this book is children picking on each other in school. I can't imagine many adults would find this entertaining. The climax of the book was short-lived and it left me greiving the hours that I had wasted. Thus, if you are over 14 years old, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative, Boring, Predicatable, Incomplete","review":"This was my first reading of John Saul and it will be my last. The old haunted house story is admittedly old hat but I have read authors who have brought new spices to the tale. This story, I couldn't wait to finish, not becuase it was good but I just felt obliged to finish, hoping that ,in the end, it would be worth the read, well... WRONG! Seth and Angle were so helpless and abysmal that I could work up no sympathy for them. Angle's mother was ineffectual, Seth's mother was inffectual. Both fathers were sadistic bullies and why did the priest even exist. The characters were formulaic, The plot was predictable and shallow. The ending was dissapointing with no real reason why it ended the way it did. This book will go in the box with all the other losers I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story has been done to death!","review":"I was very disappointed with the book for many reasons. First, the story is cliche and has been done to death - black cat, haunted house, witches and magic. Secondly, I didn't feel that the characters were believable. An example is the Marty Sullivan character, a loser and a drunkard with an attitude - the guy you love to hate. His wife is very religious and very proper. Towards the end of the book there are a couple of times where she yells at him and he shrinks like a raisin and takes it from her. This is just not believable in a character like Marty Sullivan. The end was surprising and very abrupt - but also not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off well but..............","review":"didn't know how to end it so the author took the easy way out. You've got 2 kids who are different so this makes them targets. They find a hidden book that provides them with \\"recipes\\" that allows them to get even with their peers. Interesting so far, right? Well, instead of developing the characters and allowing them to find out for themselves that retaliation can end up hurting you, the author kills them off. It's almost like two different authors wrote this. You get this wonderful build up of a possible haunting in the first 3/4 of the book and then it ends very abrubtly. I usually get sucked in by the author because of the premise of the story but always end up disappointed. I always hope that the author will improve but so far I've only wasted my time. Thank goodness I didn't buy this book - libraries are wonderful places."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with Saul's endings?","review":"Seriously, this is the 4th or so book I have read of John Saul's. What is with this man and endings? I was so completely bored of the lengthy descriptions of bullying and child abuse and the nauseating drunken or uncaring parents. Not to mention the helpless, unsympathetic main characters and their \\"burning tears of shame\\". The best character in the book is the cat Houdini. Of course it made me want the many villains to get theirs and three of the worst ones didn't. What gives? It seems like his books are trying to build to some sort of epic battle, then completely fizzled out. In this case, I was completely stunned by the absolutely unsatisfying hokiness of the ending. And what was with the long, boring detailed descriptions of GOLF?!! This book made me feel like anyone could be a published horror writer. I felt cheated BIG TIME. Avoid this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Creek Crossing - disappointed","review":"This book started out really good - I loved the setting, and the characters, but when the \\"magic cat\\" came into the story, I totally lost interest.

I was not happy with the way this book ended. I've never read a John Saul book, is this the way things always end? I may not be picking up a book of his again. I can think of so many ways in which the book could have ended that would have left readers satisfied, or at least not sorry to have read the book. Very dissapointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The first few pages kept your attention. I have read better books from Mr. Saul than this one.

But as you keep reading it gets long, boring, ineffectual and of course not eerie. At first I have to tell you that's spooky but after you get inside the book instead of eerie it gets jesty.For example:In this book you'll learn how to play golf and pool. But if you want to learn that you'll buy other kind of books.You'll get spooky at first. But all the eerie things are dreams so after three or four you'll laugh at them.And the worst of all is the end. Why? Because after all the struggling and scrambling of the kids to stay cool and away of their foes they just loose everything they've done just because. Why didn't they go to the concealed shed?And just to keep going don't read the epilogue it's really wimp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Creek Crossing","review":"This book read more like a short story. The character development of the families was totally inadequate. I would like to know more about the Wynton family and why they were burned as witches? What about the father of Forbearance? There was so little background that it was hard to get into the story. If John Saul would write a sequel and explain the history more; I would really enjoy that. Perhaps a hidden diary? I was very dissapointed. This could have been an excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best one","review":"As other reviewers mentioned, the first 100 sides are thrilling. After that it becomes slowly and boring.You know what will happen that's what made the whole book very long-winded.Maybe because I've seen a few movies which had the same story line.J. Saul tells a true story about young people outstanding which made them to outsiders, teased by classmates. That's a true message. ;-)The other part was fiction, boring and not on his usual high level of fascinating readers like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to be scared or satisfied","review":"I've never written a book review before but just had to warn people away from this one. This book was a gift from my son and still, if I hadn't been sick on a rainy day, I would have never finished it. The language, as others have mentioned, is tired and the story is juvenile. I had no sympathy for any of the characters. The ending is a HUGE disappointment and totally anti-climactic.The worst part is that Saul actually skips over all the parts that might actually be interesting. There's no color or flavor in the story and only once did I even get a tingle of suspense. That's pretty bad considering it's supposed to be a horror book. Other reviews summarize the novel better that I could and give you some idea of the plot, but do yourself a favor and find another book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps your interest, but then disappoints at the end.","review":"I found this book to be interesting until the last few chapters.

The writing style and plot seemed very juvenile to me, along the lines of an R.L. Stine book. Younger fans might enjoy this book, but it didn't hold my interest at all. Toward the end of the book, I was scanning through paragraphs quickly just to filter out the main plot and get it over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story was much better when Stephen King wrote it and called it \\"Carrie\\"","review":"This a horror story without much horror. The hauntings are strictly pro forma, as are the obligatory abusive parents and school bullies. \\"Black Creek Crossing\\" has few original story elements, and even the spirit-infested house has few descriptions worthy of even a tingle.The two teenaged protagonists are your typical picked-on outcasts who spend most of the book being tormented alternately at school and at home, until they discover witchcraft and start dishing out payback. The rest of the story proceeds in utterly predictable fashion.No thrills, no chills, and it was hard to feel sorry for any of the characters. The ending was straight out of any Hollywood made-for-sequels horror movie. I can't recommend this book unless you're looking for a lightweight and completely forgettable horror novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a YA for sure","review":"i agree with another observer that wrote a review. i am a librarian and it found this a great story. i couldn't recommend it to too many of my patrons, but it was a interesting story for a young adult. i enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from Jamian Snow, author SHROUDED INSANITY","review":"I have been a John Saul fan since the 80's.

The teenagers were not realistic in their actions and characterization, and the main protagonist was mopey and annoying. Just about all the adults were hateful in some way -- in reality, the real \\"evil\\" in this book is not the spirit haunting the house, but the alive people within the community...and the sad thing is, I don't think Saul wrote it to be that way.The ending is abrupt and not satisfying; some things don't make sense within the story and are never explained; the teenagers act and speak in a way that modern teens don't; and the \\"scares\\" really aren't all that scary and have been done by other, better writers.

Presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate Watkins' chops as a picker, yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of Nickel Creek that it doesn't do much to differentiate his work from theirs. The album opens with \\"Neo's Song,\\" which sounds like a watered-down version of Tony Rice's note-bending flatpicking style; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and Windham Hill-ish. Watkins has lots of technical facility, but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This CD is terrific, surprising, WONDERFUL!!!

But if you love the guitar (or blugrass in general) then this album will be a pleasure to own. It hasn't left my CD player for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive talent","review":"Sean's talent is undeniable. Here is a well crafted album, a very nice listen at the end of the day. It's mellow for the most part, but filled with intricate instrumentation. My only complaint is that there is just one vocal track... and it isn't Sean singing!

I'm still trying to figure it out and sitting here frustrated after an HOUR of velcroing these pieces to the frame to have it look weird...its not fitting right. My kids have knocked over my attempts, putting it together a few times and for the moment while i sit here and type this out of sheer frustration the annoyingness of it all, I threw a sheet over the thing and they are just as happy with that.

Now, I have half a cottage and it sits in her room full of all her stuffed animals. I think they played nicely in it once before it got totally trashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart fast!","review":"I bought this Cottage as a birthday gift for my 3-year old daughter. It was NOT EASY to assemble. You have to essentially \\"build\\" the frame with dozens of pipes and connectors then you have to pull the fabric cover pretty tight over the frame while zipping it up at the same time. Kind of annoying.My high-energy daughter was quickly bored with it except for using it to hide in during tag. After some rowdy play in and around the Cottage with friends, half of it was eventually ruined. The connector pieces for the frame broke and the fabric lining collapsed. We had to toss it out in the trash. (The other half sits in the basement and no one seems remotely interested in playing in it.)If you have a rough and tough, energetic kid, then this toy is definitely not for them. If you have a sweet, gentle kid who likes to sit quietly and play tea party with her dolls, then it is.

Hasbro knows what kids love, and have created a great product. I mean, even down to the small details like the curtains, the mail slot in the door, and the SUPER cute fabric used, this toy gets a 10 in my book. I also bought the nursery set to go with it and my kids have spent the majority of the morning playing with it. I bought this on Amazon for 30 and the nursery set for less than 20, and FREE shipping! My kids have even preferred this to the train table we bought! As for assembly, I recommend laying out all the pieces according to the numbers so its less confusing.

Beware!","review":"The 1970 TV version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of my favorites, not the least of which for John Williams' early and exceedingly haunting score.There are at least seven different DVD packages of this film on Amazon. As a test, I ordered seven of them. Although they have not all arrived, the ones that have without a doubt all outshine the Collector's Choice version by far. \\"Digitally remastered\\" is proclaimed on the box but it is a lie. The print appears to be third generation at best and the sound is muddy. My rating, however, refers to the fact that several scenes are included in the other (and more watchable) versions I've received. I estimate that about 10 minutes has been excised from the print. Judging from all the varied releases on many labels out there, my guess is that this is somehow in public domain. I highly recommend \\"Jane Eyre\\" on DVD -- except for this one! I'm using it as mini-Frisbee for polishing up my dog's catching ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the movie but not his DVD","review":"If this is the same one that I got from Barnes and Nobles, and I don't doubt that it is\\", do not waste your money. I returned it because the quality was horrible. I love this version with GC Scott but there are scenes missing, the audio skips and cuts out and the video looks like it's being taken off of a worn out 8MM. Lines down the sides at times, jumping around and just plain horrible picture. The supplier should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Ya Hadda Be There","review":"As a Jane Eyre fan, I thought it would be fun to watch an earlier version of this film. But there may be a generation gap at work here. Not only was the film dark and hard to \\"see,\\" but for me, Joan Fontaine (or perhaps more particularly, her hair) reminded me of the women who used to go to the beauty parlor for a weekly set and style \\"way back when.\\" George C. Scott looked like (pardon me) a portly retired sea captain. The early scenes of Lowood School capture the horror of Jane's childhood well, but Joan Fontaine and George C. Scott seem far too geriatric to play these particular romantic roles. Perhaps in thirty years, our \\"contemporary\\" version may look as goofy to the next generation, but for now, I'd recommend the current version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens in the lead roles. Although that version has its own sillinesses, it seems to capture the overall psychology of the characters and atmosphere of the book quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea that needs a lot of work!","review":"First, I blame the editor for the typos and poor grammer. Second the author has a great idea for the story, but it is never fully developed.

Six toothpastes is a -lot-. I have barely used half a bottle in about a year, and I have five more to go. I don't know if they go bad, but I'd rather not have to worry about it.The actual toothpaste however, is great. The flavor is overbearing at first, but I quickly got used to it. It was so bad it made my toes curl, however if you are used to licorice and anise flavors, you will not have such a hard time acclimating. I bought the toothpaste thinking that the Natural flavor was some sort of flavorless variety, to cut out additives, so if you are thinking this as well, think again. Although the taste does not affect me whatsoever now, I would pick a different flavor if I knew beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I brought this product because I was concerned about the flouride in toothpaste. Unfortunately the ingredients are not listed in the product description. I thought Tom's of Maine was a good healthy brand and that's why I was very surprised when I recieved the product and noted that it contained Carrageenan,which is a natural additive used to thicken foods. It is derived from seaweed. The problem is it has been shown to irritate bowel lining in people who have IBS, Crohns disease and Ulcerative Colitis. It can suppress Immune function and cause inflammation. It has also been shown to be a carcinogenic. So do your own research on this substance and be aware before buying products that contain Carageenan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom's WAS great.","review":"Most minty toothpastes feel like they burn my mouth. This one doesn't do that, and the flavor is pleasant. Also, no yucky fluoride.My local stores rarely carry this, opting instead to stock the \\"burn your mouth with mint or cinnamon\\" varieties. I've been using Tom's un-fluoridated toothpaste for over ten years.These tubes are 5.5 ounces, not 6 ounces as the listing shows. The truth about fluoride [...]Well, this used to be a good toothpaste, but the Tom's brand was bought out,and now it tastes like mush,and has ingredients in it that interfere with what a good natural toothpaste is supposed to do. At least it doesn't have fluoride.I've now switched to EcoDent tooth powder."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Life of Elijah","review":"This is a well loved book of long standing popularity.

I recently obtained a new copy and find it's still a great science fiction story, well worth the $5 or $6 monetary outlay and two or three evening investment in time. If you like unweird, believable (within obvious parameters) science fiction you'll probably like Janissaries. P.S.

Humans are part of the Confederacy as slave soldiers and administrators, bred for loyalty. Earth is used by the Confederacy as a source of strains of wild humans to crossbreed with their Janissaries. The story is about the fate of the soldiers, fighting against and with the local humans, working against a deadline, and of course for the survival of the human race, on and off planet.The greatest flaw however is as only too frequently that the story is far too short.

The whole time I subscribed to this garbage, there has only been two or three stories I enjoyed, but most of them were stupid.Basically, this magazine does not inspire girls. It just dumbs them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Girl Magazine","review":"I would like to give you a review of this magazine, but I ordered it July 13, 2008, and am told I will not receive it until NOVEMBER 2008!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PERFECT For 6-11 year olds","review":"When i wuz 9 and just started getting this mag i loooooved it BECAUSE it was perfect (age-appropriate) for my age and my parents liked it because of that. But now i'm 13 and i still have a subscription to AG but i know that as soon as this subscription ends i'm NOT renewing because i feel waaaaaaay too old for this magazine it seems very pointless and boring to me now,so i think that this mag is perfect for 6-11 year olds.

They are not obsessd with bimonthly issues, and they are not making poor and middle-class people want to be rich. Maybe I am just not boy obsessed and that is why I like American Girl. I read girls life only because it is sooo stupid. American Girl is age-appropriate and is what girls SHOULD be reading. It has great articles, and does not care about style. Although the models do dress in clothes that are regular, well who doesn't? Really, American Girl fits my taste. I don't know if it fits yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome AG Magazine!","review":"I have the Dec. Issue (awesome!).

People always say that this is the perfect magazine for pre-teen girls, but they are so wrong.

Girls will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic magazeen for any age.","review":"Im twelve years old and I simply enjoy AG magazeen. I love how compared to other girls magazeens it dosn't give you tips on what you should do if a boy likes you or how you should wear your hair. It makes you feel as though you are good enogh as you are and that is how every girl should feel when they read this magazeen. I pearsnally recomend this opposed to Discovery Girls although a great magazeen, I do read it and I modeld in the issue currently out, Ag girls dosn't make you feel quit so judged so your young girls should feel good about them selves after reading this page turner magazeen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice for Young Girls","review":"I am happy that there is a good magazine out there for young girls like my 8 year old sister. She loves this magazine, for the fun stories and games and all the cool ideas. I am just glad that she still wants to be a kid and isnt in a hurry to grow up. So many girls get sucked into the insane world of spending a lot of money on latest fashions, obsessing over you hair not being perfect every single second, covering your face in make up that you wont need for another 10 years, and of course, constantly worrying about boys. Little kids deserve to be little kids. And I thank AG for trying to preserve childhood for its young readers.P.S. The reason for the 4 stars is that AG could be just a little longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good magazine for all girls above 8 years old","review":"I must say, this is a very good magazine!

There's games, contests, advice, recipes, and crafts. At the back of the magazine, there's a section called \\"Shining Star\\", where American Girl talks about a girl who did something extremely special to help other people that are in more need than her. American Girl donates $500 to that girl's charity, too. American Girl is an awesome magazine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But....","review":"It's a great magazine but it's not really about American Girl Dolls which I love.

It doesn't have any realistic advice about school, boys, etc. It is a lot of stuff you usually aren't interested in at this age, like crafts, etc. Only a few articles are good.

I recommend GL or Teen instead of American Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for 12 year olds!","review":"American Girl says it is for ages 8-12. I seriously think it should be ages 7-9 or 10. First of all, the magazine is only 6 issues a year for $23! I don't know about you, but I think that's a waste! Plus, the magazine only has 49 pages! Also, American Girl doesn't really have things girls in the older age range care about- fashion, quizzes with real meaning, and stuff like that. It seems all we ever do is make crafts, make parties, cook, look through the magazine in less than half an hour, and so on. If you have a daughter who thinks she wants this magazine, think again! It's like throwing away money and this magazine has no form of education in it. Basically the staff is trying to make sure that 7 year olds enjoy it without adding in the stuff 12 year olds like. NOT for 12 year olds, and NOT a good combination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ORDERED ON JUNE 7TH AND STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED FIRST ISSUE, NO RESPONSE FROM COMPANY!","review":"I ordered this subscription for my niece on June 7th and it's now October 31st and she still hasn't received her first issue and there has been no response from the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, haven't received product","review":"This product has a freakishly long shipping time for some unexplainable reason because the magazine industry exists on another planet FAR FAR away and even though they charge you shipping, sending you the magazine is NOT really their priority.

Since everyone said it was good, I got it and HATED IT! American Girl was no help to any of my problems! If all of life was based on AG, it would just be having fun parties and making crafts. It has absolutely no advice on puberty, and yet this is a magazine targeted for girls who are just starting to change and are probably scared about it. There are a few Heart-to-Hearts, but those are mostly things like the most unique gift you ever got and isn't helpful. For all fun and games and no substance, turn to AG. For substance and help for your real life problems, turn to New Moon, which is the same age group and is very helpful. DON'T GET THIS MAGAZINE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever American Girl is ah-mazing!!!!","review":"I am 13 years old and hav been getting American Girl science I was 8.

LOOK NO MORE!!","review":"American Girl is the best magazine ever for girls ages 8-13! Whenever I'm feeling bad I just reread a magazine and I feel better. There are fun craft and gift ideas, like room crafts or crafts to make during the holiday season. There's also Girls Express, which is just short articles and polls and interviews. Heart to Heart is a place where you can write in on a certain topic. There are also game ideas. There are special articles on fun games to play, but there's also a regular feauture called the Giggle Gang, which is puzzles and games. There are true stories about girls, too, and Behind the Scenes, which descibes itself. There's also something extra in every issue, like mini posters or a free board game.

I thought the magazine was okay because you only get it once every two months (6 per year) and theres only about 50 pages! But, if you like advice on boys and make-up look at ym, twist or seventeen! This magazine does have great stories, and advice from girls from age 6-13! I think march/April issue is the best because if you like animals pick it up NOW its ALL about animals! I recommend this for ages 6-13 and maybe older than 6 if you need help reading or if you read with your mom this is the magazine for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Younger Kids","review":"I used to be subscribed to this magazine when I was about 11 years old. Back then it was really interesting but after I turned 12 I wanted to read magazines that had more stuff about things like celebrities and make up, and American Girl doesn't have that. They do, however, have a lot of different crafts and recipies that younger kids under 12 will enjoy. I think that after your kid turns 12 you should subscribe them to a different magazine like Discovery Girls which will be more suitable for them, and have more things directed at their age group, and things that will probably interest them more. Either way, American Girl is still a good magazine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good for younger kids","review":"I have grown out of this magazine, but it is still really good.

I happen to be pregnant with my second child, but it will have been 4 1/2 years since my first was born, so I was looking for a book with some refreshers about the little nuances of pregnancy (so many of which i have forgotten)! But rather than focusing on body changes, physical feelings, and helpful suggestions, it is more of a focus on navigating your way through your corporate job while being pregnant.If you fit the first-time-mom-with-corporate-job description, i bet you'll love this book!But as for me, I am disappointed that I spent the money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of useless information but cutesy","review":"To be completely honest, I found this book to be worthless. It's a tiny book filled with seemingly useless advice... some of which is the same advice that you will have already heard from your friends or family. The rest is common sense.

The story begins with a chance event in a parking lot. A man so drunk his foot holds the car door open as it hangs down below the running board, falls to the pavement when the door is opened by the parking attendant. The man's wife drives off, leaving her husband in the parking lot. Marlowe feels sorry for the guy and takes him in and sobers him up. This act of kindness draws Marlowe into a complex murder that has him harassed and accused by the police, and silenced by a very rich man, close to the deceased. It's 40s LA and the only moral person in the whole town is Phillip Marlowe. A great book that kept me guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Chandler classic","review":"If you you love this genre, this book will not disappoint. The writing style and plotting are classic Philip Marlowe."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest pieces of American fiction","review":"I try to read The Long Goodbye once a year, and each time I do it becomes remarkably better. This is more than a detective story, it's a healthy dose of humanity poured into a tumbler-If words can intoxicate, Chandler ran the distillery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Goodbye","review":"Marlowe is leaving a meeting at a high end hotel and sees a drunk that needs help named Terry Lennox. Lennox's wife won't help him so Marlowe takes him back to his place til he can leave on his own. Eventually the two see each other once in a while and one night Terry appears on Marlowes doorstep asking for a ride to a plane. He needs to leave town and Marlowe learns its do to a murder that has been commited and Terry is the prime suspect. So the detective get tangeled in this murder along with helping a rich writer stop drinking long enough to finish some book thats getting close to a deadline. All of this is connected in typical Philip Marlowe fashion and it still is my favorite novel by the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Idle Valley","review":"Private Investigator Philip Marlowe is at the top of his game in this novel. It is the longest book that Raymond Chandler ever wrote and, sadly, it is his last completed manuscript. Subsequent books were cobbled together from fragments of unfinished books (\\"Poodle Springs\\") or screenplays (\\"Playback\\").Chandler is one of my favorite writers and this is one of his best books. I was sorry to finish it, knowing that there was not another Philip Marlowe mystery to look forward to. I give high marks to \\"The Long Goodbye.\\" I rate it as the equal of \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" or \\"The Big Sleep.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps American's greatest prose stylist...","review":"A beautiful but unpleasant woman appears, and before long Marlowe finds himself downing gimlets at Victor's with an odd fellow he finds in a parking lot. Marlowe senses something needs his attention, and he finds himself caught up in a whirlpool of murder, infidelity and drugs. He knows that his newfound gimletting companion is somehow an essential piece the puzzle. Who is really responsible for the violence which ensues? Marlowe follows his instincts to uncover the truth behind the nightmare of corruption, and downs a few more gimlets in the bargain.I think this is probably Chandlers' strongest work in terms of plotting. For long stretches, I know exactly what is happening, but, as always, it it his sublime use of the English language that thrills, enthralls and entraps us. I am caught in the web of words that he spins so smoothly, and I thank God that he gave us the gift of his hard-won art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the finest novel by arguably the finest crime writer","review":"Not Chandler's best known novel, but clearly his best, in it Philip Marlowe confronts a pair of complex, ultimately linked mysteries while also confronting his own sense of honor and mortality. I've read it probably 15 times, and still get chills from the scene where he confronts the murderer. If you like mysteries it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mystery attempting to break the boundaries","review":"The Long Goodbye is not considered one of the \\"classic\\" Raymond Chandler Philip Marlowe novels. Such a title is usually reserved for the first four novels. It does deserve to be counted among the classics, however, not the least of which is the fact that this is the book where Philip Marlowe, the knight in tarnished armor, finally gets the princess. More sentimental, perhaps, and less gritty than the first four, The Long Goodbye shows that Philip Marlowe is a character that is human, and not just an embodiment of modern-day \\"chivalric\\" ideals. I consider this my favourite of all his books, and recommend it highly"},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"AN oldie (from the 1950's), ran into it by accident.

I really think so.","review":"I first read \\"The Long Goodbye\\" in 1976, before I had read any other Raymond Chandler novels. The book practically set off an explosion in my brain -- I have been fascinated by Chandler ever since. No other book by Chandler matches this one's emotional tone.This isn't a mystery novel, it is a great piece of literature. It is about friendship, love and betrayal. And the plot is complex and satisfying. Marlowe is defeated and in pain, and very, very alone.I have read \\"Goodbye\\" three times since 1977 -- most recently last year -- and every time I am just amazed at the effect the book has on me. It possibly just touches me personally, but I really believe it deserves a rating among the great books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably Chandler's Best","review":"You don't read Raymond Chandler for the plots--you read him for the magnificent \\"hard boiled\\" prose. The Long Goodbye is probably his most complex work, full of world-weary insights and a somewhat more \\"tender\\" Marlowe. The great pleasure of The Long Goodbye is seeing how the main character, Philip Marlowe, reconciles his cynical view of humanity with a genuine desire to help a few unfortunates in life. The best Marlowe... classic....Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I love Howard Hawks, and his version of THE BIG SLEEP is one of my favorite not just movies, but works of art. And I even enjoyed reading the Chandler source material (despite being firmly convinced that Hawks and Leigh Brackett performed that rare trick and improved on the book in their film version).I even liked FAREWELL MY LOVELY on it's own, literary, terms.But LONG GOODBYE, despite pretty good parts is a real loser of a novel. Unbelievably boring, especially in the last half of the novel. Did Chandler have an editor during his late career? This book actually started to piss me off--I had invested so much time into it...for zip. I don't understand all of these raves. It was very obvious after like page fifty what had happened.....this is a murder-mystery in slow motion..........Terrible. Do not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Long on atmosphere but short on plot and character development (save for the character of Marlowe himself), I couldn't wait to finish this novel and move on to something else.The surprise ending isn't much of a surprise, and Chandler's heavy-handed misogyny is distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong Goodbye","review":"I found the book tedious. I wasn't interested in the characters and I wasn't able to finish it. I realize that the genre style of detective novel was more or less created by Raymond Chandler and has inspired many, mostly second rank authors today. He does, of course, have an undeniable gift for description and he doesn't insult your intelligence, but the plotting of this book is dense, hard to follow and ,in general, is disappointing. The clicheed, dated wisecracking is hard to take, but that's just me, I guess. I just don't like the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than 50 years later, still entertaining and relevant.","review":"Yes, some of the language dates this, yet it is easily his greatest work and at risk of offending most literary types who disdain mystery novels, one of my choices as the \\"Great American Novel.\\"It has all the essential elements; lust, greed, guilt, corruption, the insularity of the idle rich and the abuses of friendship and loyalty, all pricelessly narrated by the cynically observant Philip Marlowe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mezmerizing storytelling.","review":"Raymond Chandler is such an talented story teller that one can spend days in his writing and not notice the passage of time.

In a world where celebrities demean women, I do love how Sylvester Stallone has respect for women and what their bodies go through physically to bear children.

During quiet passages you can hear the device activating or de-activating itself every time the volume reaches a certain threshold. When it kicks in during a quiet passage, it not only creates a sudden jump in the audio level (and sometimes a pop/thump noise), it also causes a change in the left-right balance of the stereo sound, which is a nuisance.So, it's not bad for an inexpensive device, but you will probably want to use the bypass switch when viewing movies or concerts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money -- this thing sucks","review":"Bought 2 units, one for me, one for my parents.

AGC (automatic gain control) is an old concept, but when broadcast audio modualtion index get's mixed in it becomes more complicated. Broadcasters say they want to reserve some volume for certain parts of movies, etc.. That's all BS. This all could be stopped if we all demand it. If you're on cable or satellite you're paying for it (and the public broadcast frequencies belong to all of us as well). Demand results, contact yioyr Congressman.

You hear a loud pop when it adjusts to a new volume input (when the music or something gets louder). It pops just about every scene change, and sometimes multiple times within the same scene. It's just a piece of garbage.Also, when watching a recorded lecture, (poor quality recording), I could not make out some of the details/words when running through this thing. Had to unplug, and go straight into the tv to be able to understand the lecture (which had bad sound quality to begin with). Basically, it made bad into worse.

Nothing else on the market does the job - so each time I buy one I hope maybe this time it will last for more than a few months.The only competition to this unit I could find (\\"TV Volume Regulator\\") is a complete waste of money since it raises the background noise to the same level as bombs dropping.

I intend to put signal into it from an adjustable signal generator and measure what it does on an oscilloscope!I called the manufacturer and they couldn't give me any help on how to adjust the components internally to give the input more gain -- something that could easily be done.

It works just as well as any other mouthwash and has the extra fluoride protection my family needs. It's perfect for those of us who don't have fluoride in our water. I also really like the measuring device. It allowed us to get the exact amount needed every time."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const P=d(N,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-b563f65e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/59.md","filePath":"library/59.md"}'),R={name:"library/59.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
