I'll not be buying it, nor reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"stereotypical and just plain wrong","review":"I was VERY offended by this book, and so would 99% of Asian people be. It's stereotypical and racist. Just because it's over 70 years old does not make it right. Those who are not part of a minority will never understand how cruel this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love your kids, don't buy this book","review":"I was the only Chinese kid in my class when we read this book. There were precious few children's books that focused on Chinese people, and when the teacher read this to us, all of a sudden the other kids realized how intensely different and wierd I was.30 years later, I have my own kids. They think they're the kids next door, and so did their friends - until it's pointed out to them that they are, in fact, Chinese, and that is a strange thing. Now it's Chinese people this, Chinese people that. What has changed from yesterday to today?I am not scarred by this book as an adult. I understand it's 70 years old. But my kids, and yours, won't understand what that means. My kids may be the victim of innocent stereotyping based on this book, but as victims they are blameless. Please, don't make your kids the innocent perpetrators of racial ignorance, by setting them up with this book. There are so many better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornerstone of my Childhood","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite children's stories. I would always make my mother get it from our public library. I know the story by heart, and I haven't heard it or read it in over 10 years!! The story is simple but so entertaining. I remember being amazed at the 'special powers' each brother had. I also thought it was nice how the brother would always ask for permission to say goodbye to his mother and brothers before each new execution attempt. This is a great folk tale that easily captivates the attention and imagination of young children. The illustrations are wonderful as well, and make this book great for story time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"As a child I loved it and as a 50 year old woman I love it still. It was a Christmas gift from my husband that I will forever cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"My five-year-old loves this. Fortunately, kids don't care about what's politically correct or if someone, somewhere, somehow, might be offended by something. They just like a fun story.

When I was given this book as a kid, I didn't find it particularly violent or think that all Chinese people looked that way. Of course, I was also given folktales from other countries - Russia, England, Japan, America, etc. Folktales have their own way of delivering a message, and kids pick up on that. And if you read the book to your child, and answer their questions, they won't take anything away from the book except the moral...and any other lesson you would want to insert about stereotypes and acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story but best for older children","review":"I loved this story as a child and after reading the reviews I purchased it thinking that I would add it to my Nursery School library. Unfortunately I forgot that it discusses execution which is not appropiate for children under 7 years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happen Again!","review":"I used to go to the public library to read htis book while growing up.

But I loved it agin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Chinese Brothers","review":"I ordered this book for my granddaughter because I remember enjoying it when I was young. The story is still a good one--having the wisdom of a folktale. However, upon reading it in the context of this age of ethnic sensitivity, I realized that it subtlely conveys the notion that all Chinese people look alike (thus the brothers were able to \\"fool\\" the executioner), which is definitely a racial slur. The illustrations also portray the villagers in \\"crowd scenes\\" as cookie cutter cutouts of the same image...no fat, no thin, no short, no tall...all the same. As charming a story this is, we must all take a good look at ways that we pass on \\"racist\\" notions to the next generation...even in seemingly innocent ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a CHILDREN'S book ?????","review":"I will strongly diagree with most of the reviews here. This is not a classic, this is a horrific book for a child. Let's see, the story starts with a boy drowning just because he did not obey. Then FIVE times we see a death sentence attempted to be carried out on an innocent person. And the moral of the story seems to be that if you are found guilty, try to trick the judge. Sorry, this is not something that will be in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deals with Execution -- To Graphic for Some Children","review":"I am trying to expose my children to many cultures and I thought this would be a good book.I did not realize that the main plot deals with the execution of one of the five identical brothers, and how the other four brothers switch places with him to prevent the execution. It discusses execution by beheading, burning, and drowning. Just TOO graphic. How do you explain that to a 4-year-old.We stopped reading this book and sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not age appropriate","review":"Leaving the racism issue aside, this is not a book for small children. Even if everything turns out OK in the end, I'm not prepared to expose my children to issues of capital punishment and the drowning death of a small boy. Small children forget the ending and focus on the scary parts in between. Perhaps I'm a softie, but let's allow them to be children and not worry about being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by beheading. Just because it's a classic doesn't make it appropriate reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Covers","review":"I was looking for a specific edition of the book I ordered. Although I clicked on the illustration for the edition (1974) I wanted showing the correct blue cover, another one was sent (white cover). Since it was a sentimental purchase, the book I received was very disappointing.And, when asked to write this review, the illustration of the book cover was, once again (you guessed it) blue!! Very misleading, very confusing, very time consuming, very diappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you say \\"Wait!, I have a phrase book.\\" in croatian?","review":"This book was indispensable. Between this and Pimsler's Learn Croatian 1 we managed to get by fairly well. There were definitely a few frustrating moments though. The book fell through on such things as \\"Wait, I have a phrasebook\\" and \\"Sandwich\\" in the dictionary. If you want to talk about how your sex life or drug use is going however, you'll be well equipped. I definitely recommend it. I also recommend a guidebook. Between lonely planet, frommer's and DK I would rank frommer's as the most useful, DK with the best pictures, and lonely planet as acceptable.

It also includes phonetic pronounciations which are really great. The only thing is that it is published by an Australian company. As such, the phonetic pronounciations \\"aw\\" should really be pronounced \\"oh\\" for any American English speaker. Also, it's not obvious in the text, but Croatians roll their R's. It might help to also pick up a Croatian Language CD (I like Pimsleur) to help with the R's and some basic phrase pronouciations/reading. I think after listening to a basic CD like that, this book becomes really helpful. Good luck!Also, just as a note, Montenegran is Serbo-Croatian which is also Croatian. Serbian is the same spoken language with a different written alphabet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bottle and my bunnies like it","review":"It has a nice holder that helps to keep proper position of the bottle on the cage and it doesn't leak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning lazer copies with excellent durability.","review":"Purchased this to create our own water bottle labels for a wedding reception.

This album was released only in Australia, most of the material being released to the rest of the world on High Voltage. Rocker would later be released on the Dirty Deeds album, while School Days, a true classic, would not appear until the box set Bonfire was released. Songs like Live Wire, High Voltage, and the title track, have set the tone for what was to come in the next few years that Bon Scott was to be with the band. Angus Young lays down some of his best guitar work here. A must for any hardcore ACDC fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is a mix of classic hard-blues and AC/DC tipical","review":"Young, Scott & C. plays their music at the best.

WOW? another odditiy about this Amazon offer is that it offers at a discount the Int'l version of High Voltage, which as I said has all but two of these EXACT SAME SONGS... oh kay...... hope no one is slow enough or stubbornly determined enough to buy the thing anyway, but if you are, Why not download the Aussie version tracks [School Days, a so-so cover of the Chuck Berry standard; and 'Rocker', which was featured on the Int'l version of Dirty Deeds] and be out 2$ instead of 42$?.....just trying to help...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but try to find the 1986 CD release","review":"I bought this thinking it would have the Full Version of High Voltage (the 1986 CD has the full veresion the 1995 CD has the edited version)and the product discription said the 1995 CD wasnt available but this 2002 release is actually the 1995 CD (as it says on the back) so High Voltage fades out at 4:03 Rocker at 2:50(where only missing 5 seconds it doesnt matter) but originally High Voltage ended with a sustainde guitar note followed by Phill Rudd hitting the drum but at least here Can I Sit Next To You Girl fages out at 4:12 do unless you dont care about High Voltage get the 1986 CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page-Turner Especially for Lovers of Spain","review":"In A Handful of Kings, Mark Jacobs combines a taut thriller plot with a love story, and fleshes it out with a wealth of detail about Spain and the American Foreign Service. I was engaged by the three-dimensional characters and caught up in the action as the story unfolded.Living in Madrid, I was doubly delighted to see this city feature so prominently in the novel (even though the action takes place also in Colombia and the United States). As Jacobs writes about an encounter in Madrid's El Retiro Park, for example, I could picture the scene vividly in my mind. He also does a great job of capturing the intangible things that make Madrid Madrid, even down to the Ducados cigarette smoke filling up one's favorite Spanish bar. Jacobs, who was a former Foreign Service Officer, does a wonderful job of opening a window onto the environment of a U.S. embassy and the people who run it for the general reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fare....","review":"to whom corresponds...iam upset to say iam not satisfied with my order because i did not recieve the two cds that were supposed to come, and now i find my self with a very complex book that requieres of the cd for a better course of study....please if possible, to send me the cds...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is better..","review":"Rarely do I think a movie adaptation is better than the book, well that is not the case with this book. I actually enjoyed the movie far more than the book. Cee Cee was a little too crass for my taste, Michael was indeed a heartless bastard and Bertie was always wallowing in self-pity for not being able to be with the heartless swine of Michael. I wish the ending would have been more emotional, I felt the writer rushed Bertie's death. Overall, I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less similar to the film than I'd expected","review":"The first and last chapters mirror the film almost precisely, but everything in between is incredibly divergent. I'm having a hard time reviewing the book as an entity of it's own without comparing it to the film. I kept hearing Bette Midler's voice in my head while reading it. I have to go watch it again, I think. I did enjoy reading it. I can't really even say which is better. I sort of wish I'd read the book first. Ah, well. Even if you've seen the film a thousand times, this is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"**Spoiler Alert**Ok, I much prefer the movie to the book. I thought Cee Cee was much too into herself, and wasn't interested in Bertie or what was going on in her life.I'm no prude, but I was EXTREMELY surprised at the language and sexuality the book had.The writer gave Bertie a lot of bad luck. The chick couldn't catch a break. I felt bad for Bertie to have the life she did, and to have a \\"friend\\" like Cee Cee. Sure, she was there when she was dying, but what about the other times she needed her? I also thought the ending was anti-climatic.I hope I'm able to enjoy the movie (in the future) without thinking of the mess of the book.

Maybe it's because I watched the movie first and then I read the book. I love the movie, it's one of my favorites, that's the reason I decided to read the book in the first place.

The canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them. Just imagine the UPS guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard.

One canister was completely smashed on one side.I purchased these on sale, and Amazon would not exchange them even though it was entirely their fault. Instead, I was given the options of being refunded for the price of one canister and keeping the other three or returning all four and repurchasing them at the non-sale price.

I would not even rate this transaction with one star if there was an option to do so. Listen to your customers when they tell you something. Develope better customer service and start packaging fragile items better and marking them fragile.

Heavy on the concept, and the occasional instrumental section have that feel to them. The assorted vocalists; Ritchie Havens, Elizabeth Frazier, the vocalist from The Blue Nile... Do an outstanding job.The toughest part of this is, if you read the story and try to go along with the basic message, those parts which are the most impressive, (and probably the most accessible to those friends theat only know from Sledgehammer) -is \\"The Tower that Ate People\\" AKA music that interprets the low point of the overall story.Lots of stuff on these that will almost certainly have you looking for a video of the actual show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Son","review":"This is yet another recording that is sort of a soundtrack... in a way. yet, the music in places sounds very backgroundish, but let me tell you what, the song FATHER SON is so powerful. makes the purchase of this recording worth the experience in itself.Downside up is another song that is just great. I feel as though this cd is a mood piece that has two really outstanding songs on it.If you don't mind mood music or quiet music with odd tempo's and some glorious songs here and there.. this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Gabriel's Millennium Show","review":"Despite not hearing his distinctively soulful voice on most tracks, Ovo still sounds like a Peter Gabriel album. In fact, Peter sings lead vocal on only two songs (Father, Son and Make Tomorrow). The rest of the songs are sung by guests. But, all the tracks on this CD were written by Peter and convey his highly-personal vision of cross-cultural soundscapes.Ovo sounds like a blend between Security and his last album Us (1992). It contains similar rhythmic patterns found on songs like San Jacinto and The Rhythm Of The Heat (from Security) as well as lyrical content along the lines of Washing Of The Water or Come Talk To Me (from Us).Ultimately, Ovo is for Peter Gabriel and world-hybrid music fans. There are no attempts at hit singles like Steam (although Downside-Up could be just as popular as any Dave Matthews song.) But all the themes are instantly memorable.Get Ovo today.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time coming.","review":"Is there anyone out there who starves his fans like Gabriel does? After waiting years for new material I can say it was worth the wait as always. Gabriel has a way of reaching places inside of you that few can and like all of his work nothing really jumps out at you in the first listening but the more you listen the more you discover how brilliant the man really is. I only hope we do not have to wait another 8 years for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PG's best work to date","review":"This is an exquisite album. Its important to remember when listening that the album tells a story. Its more akin to listening to opera, where each piece is a part of a continuous tale. It will sound very different to fans accustomed to his more traditional rock albums, but if listen to it with an open ear, you'll love it. When I first got it, it didn't leave my CD player for 4 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel returns to roots and advances at the same time!","review":"In terms of songwriting and conceptual work, this is the closest Gabriel has ever come to \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", which, after listening to \\"OVO\\", brings a new and tremendous appreciation to that earlier work. In terms of sheer force of production, Gabriel's work since \\"Security\\" has grown exponentially with every release, and \\"OVO\\" is no exception. Giving \\"Security\\" a 5 on the Richter scale (take it from a Californian, that's noticable), \\"So\\" being a 6, \\"Us\\" being a 7, \\"OVO\\" is an easy 8, and that's ROCKIN'. If \\"The Lamb\\" were recreated today (now wouldn't THAT be a great idea), I would only hope it would sound like this. Put another way, this is incredible music, incredibly done. The closer you listen, the more you'll enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year and the new millenium!","review":"Mr. Gabriel has outdone himself yet again with Ovo. Not only has he created a musical, but he has created a musical like no other before it. He mixes rock, pop, world, classical, and rap (just to name a few) into a beautiful story of love. Only featured vocally on two songs, Peter delivers an excellent performance as always. At first, this disappointed me, but then the other voices grew on me and made sense being that each vocalist plays the part of a different character in the story. On top of wonderful melodies are incredible arrangements of various instruments, rhythyms, and effects. Just for the track \\"Time of the Turning\\" alone this album is worth the import price. Hopefully, it won't be an import for long. If you love music and you're interested in where it is heading in the future, Ovo is a must. Gabriel is lightyears ahead of us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought I knew Gabriel","review":"But not quite. While I consider his latest album _Up_ to be his crowning achievement, I'd overlooked this side project at my peril. As a stage show, anyone can tell you that this thing flopped. The storyline's a mess, and you're probably better off not troubling yourself with it too much. But the music...ah, the music. That's what we're here for, right?In addition to the three Big Tracks that have gotten the most well-justified attention -- namely \\"The Tower That Ate People\\" (which turns up in a much-improved rendition on the _Red Planet_ soundtrack), \\"Father, Son,\\" and \\"Downside Up\\" -- it just so happens that Gabriel also had the phenomenal \\"Make Tomorrow\\" in his system. The combined effect tips the scales from take-or-leave into must-own territory for fans of this unnaturally gifted and important artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album for a underreated artist","review":"Peter Gabriels newest release OVO is really a excellent album and shows that gabreil is still a musical force.

Its also very refreshing to see a artist of his age always trying new things in succeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVO is not ONLY Peter Gabriel","review":"If you ever hear it, you will be surprised of all the music that surrounds Peter Gabriel and from who he inspires, and a huge difference between PG and many other composers is that he doesn't hide his inspirational sources, in fact he helps them to reach notability. I write this review because I read over an over that this album is a \\"mix\\", \\"evolution\\", \\"good moments\\", \\"what is PG doing\\" and so on. If you read the booklet you will understand that PG was invited to create a show to be presented at the Millennium Dome, he invited for that occasion all the musicians who's music he enjoys to create between all of them a special event, that is why you will find, among others, Nene Cherry or The Afro Celt Sound System in this album. For everyone information PG's next album will be UP."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I found this album a real dissapointer. There are some good musical moments there; there are some good performances from PG and Richie Havens- But if you are expecting a follow-up to any of his other albums- you will find this to be a let down. There is no depth musically or lyrically like on his past albums- and as being the millennium show the music already seems dated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt","review":"After seeing the Millennium dome show I hoped that this video CD would be better and more insightful. Sadly its unashamedly biased \\"green\\" fairytale coupled with simplistic graphics and a music soundtrack that was less rich and varied than the original show make this video CD only suitable for small children of \\"Guardian\\" newspaper readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Fast and Cheap","review":"As a PR professional and former journalist, I've heard the old adage good, fast, cheap -- pick any two, many times. With this book, you can get all three. The beauty of these tips is that the author has managed to condense what would normally take years to learn through experience and gives a consise and well written summary of pr fundementals. Not only would I encourage business people to read it, but for students interested in pursuing a pr career, it could help put you on the fast track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys & Girls will love this!","review":"This book is a wonderful way for children to build new friendships, learn new things about old friendships, and to stay in touch with friends should they move. The owner of the book gets to enter his/her own personal information and pass the book onto others to read, who then, in turn, write about themselves. There are some rather funny fact-finding questions which will make kids laugh. What a wonderful idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious references are inappropriate","review":"I was very excited at the idea of giving this book to my stepdaughters when they went to camp so they could easily exchange address information with new friends and get to know each other better.Each entry (to be added by their friends) ends with \\"I know God loves me because\\"... I know that my stepdaughters have friends of varying religions and backgrounds and personally, I find that offensive. There is also an entry near the back all about Jesus and how much he loves you and the different ways you can allow him into your heart. There is a handy dandy address where you can order your own Bible too!This is an ADDRESS BOOK. I am returning this because it is inappropriate and as a child, not exactly a way to show your new friend that you are open and accepting of them no matter who they are, now is it?The description of this book is misleading and hopefully this review will be helpful to others either seeking out religious-based materials, or hoping to avoid them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to paint, but not that functional","review":"This is a cute, complete kit, fun for kids to use. We first covered ours with outdoor acrylic paint (bought separately), then used the included paints on top.Unfortunately, the opening at the bottom of the birdseed hopper is so large that all the birdseed spills out of the tray. We tried several varieties of birdseed, including sunflower seeds, but the opening is just too large.I suppose you could nail a large gauge mesh screen to the bottom of the hopper...but it would be easier to just purchase a more functional, ready-to-paint birdfeeder from a craft store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move album rocks","review":"This album is for the true fan who really loves the Move.

As to the review that states you can't find the items that are needed in the book, there is only one project that you would need to do some work to find the items needed and that is for a kaleidoscope pendant, which while interesting is not something that I will be making anytime soon.

There is! If you like detail, Sutekh goes out of his way to pay attention to the smallest parts and portions of his tracks almost to an ideal sense that each sound has it's own life. While some tracks may hint towards a Detroit influence, there is no shortage of inventiveness and creativity...even dementia at times. A very satisfying listen which (to me) defies any textual categorization outside of electronic.

Despite its' peppy overtones and Martin's dreary attempts to spice things up, it slumps midway and never really recovers (the same can be said of his new album as well).Perhaps Martin needs different songs and different songwriters, for this CD single lacks creativity and is utterly uninspiring. Naturally, this will also find buyers galore as Ricky has built up a solid fanbase, but in terms of musical content, 'She Bangs' is half-dead, and ultimately boring. And thats certainly something that we didn't expect from Ricky Martin.This is the Import version of the CD single, and it costs a bunch. I wouldn't buy this unless I were a true blue fan, as the version thats on the radio is quite sufficient, thank you. Not at all recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I wonder if those people who rate this song so highly have actually really, really listened to it. The music is no bad, and that's the reason I guess that it's so popular, but the lyrics are so banal and shallow. \\"She walks like she talks and she talks like she walks\\"...what's that supposed to mean? Doh! If these are the types of lyrics that Ricky likes to sing, then I dread to think what his next song will be like. But so many people, they really do not let lyrics of songs sink in, so they miss the real meaning of them. I would state the other lyrics in the song, but I am afraid Amazon will censor my review. It wouldn't be the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST SERVICE EVER EXPERIENCED","review":"After completing two orders with My Frame Store, I will NEVER do business with them again.

Unfortunately, no one returned our phone calls or was receptive to our problem at all.

It's very frustrating to build with these blocks because the tiny blocks don't have any spanning capability. The slanted pieces are only useful to top off. The blocks are soft, so they don't lock like a hard plastic lego. These blocks don't join well, and there are too few bricks, so it almost impossible to make anything creative.

The music doesn't stink, but it is melodramatic, not memorable ... as, basically the storyline is. Yes, it must have been rather horrible to live in the USSR during the 1930's, but the utter lack of any insight into more underlying causes leaves me feeling like a Marxist film critic. Pretty simple story of good vs. bad, pretty simple use of supporting characters. Pretty simple husband and wife romantic and ideological conflict. Simple + easy = popular. And isn't it a little unrealistic how many of the Russians speak in what sounds to me like fluent impeccable french? Anyway, it could be worst, I don't find anything hillariously bad, the film is worked out fine for me as I used it to improve my knowledge of Russian and French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of nonsense","review":"This movie deals with the complex issue of postwar repatriation of immigrants from France to Russia with a 'healthy' charge of ignorance. All stalinist nightmares for some reason affect mainly a \`poor French woman' and she suffers at length and endlessly through the movie. Brilliant actor Menshikov (Prisoner of the Mountains, Burnt by the Sun), rising star Bodrov (Brother, Brother 2) and episodic appearance by Catherine Deneuve can not save this cold-war style propaganda flick. Even a potentially strong theme of sacrifice made by the Menshikov's character is lost in the incoherent fable. The result is a farce. See it for curious historic bloopers and senseless dialogues."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional, beautiful story of love, and deception.","review":"This beautiful movie is about a couple and their child's experience living in and trying to escape from Stalinist Russia. The husband (Alexei, played by Oleg Menshikov) is Russian, and his wife Marie is French. When the Soviet Union decides to call back its emigrees, they return to Russia with their little child, As soon as they return, they realize that it is not as they had thought it would be. They are immediately interogated, terrorized, and threatened by the state. In the poverty of Kiev, they befriend Sasha (Sergei Bodrov Jr.), a swimmer, who is full of potential, and who wants out of Russia too. As the story progresses, they realize that they have a chance to escape... The ensueing drama is intense, and great sacrifices are made... Suspenseful, and emotional, this movie is a must see. The Russian background is beautiful, the acting superb, and the story touching. A must see for anyone who appreciates foreign films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-war Brilliant","review":"If purely seen as a period piece, this film is extraordinary. The very real prospects of returning to Kiev in 1946 are shown masterfully in this volume. The acting is convincing and the story line works.

Great line up of actors. Most are wasted on two-dimensional characters. You know these actors from their previous and subsequent work - so you expect excellence. Unfortunately, their presence distracts from the story. I love Steven Colbert, but I only enjoyed his presence once he started to crack off one-liners. I think the 9-11 subtext is a red haring. After reflecting a few hours, I think the moral of at least one story line is - get rid of your mentally disturbed kid if you ever want any sanity/sex life.

One man is driven to madness, a child that has anger problems,a man obsessed with cheating on his wife, and a woman trying to be the best at her job.

Neville and Lily's LOVE is pure and passionate, and Mary Balogh brings that across with every longing glance, every sensitive touch, and every whispered endearment these two characters utter. If you're in the mood to read a story about people who love to the depth of their souls, this book is for you.Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing (spoilers)","review":"This is well written and the characters are believable, as are all Balogh's books.But it is pretty depressing. A lot of it is about rape. So forget the idea that this is light, entertaining reading. Also, we never learn whether the heroine's idea that she is unable to have children is true. Ditto the secondary female character.The ending is also drawn out unnecessarily for no apparent reason. It can't be that the author had a word quota to fill.Like most kindle books, there are OCR errors. It doesn't even look like they ran it through a spelling corrector. At $7.99 a copy, they could have done that.Knowing what I know now, I would not have bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"Spare me. This one was just too predictable. I could have told you what was going to happen from the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a breath of fresh air.","review":"Reading this book brought me back to what I really like about romance. That is, acutal love and romance and the impossibility of it all. The plot is a bit far fetched, but so what, isn't that why we read romance to escape from reality for a little while. It is all about happy endings in which this delivers and the introduction of other characters that could make great stories on their own. I havn't read a summer to remember but am sure to track it down straight away. Sometimes stories have too much detail and too much back story, this I would say isn't one of them. I would recommend this book as a story that would make a reader laugh, cry and smile at the end. The only drawback I found, which is a small one was the repeating of similar interanl dialogue that Lily expresses. This did get a little tiresome, but was quickly read through and the story moved on. Oh and Neville even though not a really romantic name sounds like a dream, pity the story ended so soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Kindle Edition Only","review":"This review has nothing to do with the quality of the story itself, although I did like it. This is about the Kindle version. It is filled with typos and formatting errors. It is distracting. A few times I had to reread a sentence multiple times to understand what it was supposed to mean. Hopefully, a better version can be created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Balogh knows how to touch your heart.","review":"Like all of Balogh's books, this one takes the traditional Regency romance and gives it an original twist. She allows you to feel the heroes pain as he struggles between following his heart and doing what society regards as right and honorable. Although this book does not quite reach the heartbreaking heights of many of her other novels, it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night for Love","review":"Like all Mary Balogh's books this one is a page turner. I can't wait for her newest one to be available because I will buy it and read it immediately.Super author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely as always.","review":"Mary Balogh does it again with this ugly-duckling story that has a lot more depth that that implies. These characters have to work for their happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read any other Mary Balogh book but this one!","review":"This book was pretty bad. Granted, it's probably still much better than many other romances because it was written by Mary Balogh, and I have not been disappointed by any other book she's ever written, so my expectations were very high.Several other reviews detail why this book doesn't work, but mostly I found it a very frustrating read and hard to see why Lily would continue to like her 'husband'. Even though this is now part of a series, I would recommend skipping it. Get \\"A Summer to Remember\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I liked the book though a bit too descriptive. I would like to see a follow-up with Lauren, I found her to be the more likeable character. Hopefully this author will be writing it in the near future, I will keep a check on her book listings. Lauren was a complicated character who was extremely suppressed emotionally and the book, if written, would be a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.","review":"I am a big Mary Balogh fan and I loved her other books. But this one was very dissappointing. I was more than a little surprised that her other books were so good that I couldn't put them down, and this one just seems to be dragging along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I orderd this book because it has good ratings but i am so disappointed.The best word to discribe it is BORING.I had the feeling the author didn't have so many ideas for her story so she filled the book up with endless scene discribtion and monologes.Sometimes I could scip a page or two and I didn't really miss anything.I didn't read the book to the end (read about three quaters). I didn't like that the main characters loved each other from the beginning so there was no tension at all for me.I prefer if the characters argue and fight and then realise they love each other (but thats my opinion) That defenitly didn't happen in that book!steph(sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes I am german)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Music in Hell","review":"Blizzard used to give this music away for free after Diablo II came out, and I was fortunate to download all of it. Not just the tracks on this CD, but also the ones from the expansion pack. But the ones they offered for free download are actually longer than the ones listed on Itunes and for sale on this CD, so it seems difficult to now get even the complete version of what they once offered for free.As for the music itself, obviously it's the same music you'll hear in the game, great stuff and certainly worth having for those who enjoy this type of stuff. As for this actual CD, if you can't find the complete tracks, including outtakes, that were once available for free, getting the CD or downloading it from Itunes would be the last resort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gun control racist and sexist, Quigley says","review":"Ms. Quigley, writer and firearms trainer for women, makes a case I've seen nowhere else that gun control has its most pernicious effect on women and poor blacks. Poor blacks are disproportionately affected by violent crime since bad neighborhoods are the only ones they can afford to live in, and they are least able to recover from property or violent crime. Women in unfortunate relationships with unstable men are likely to suffer assault or murder owing to being physically less able to repel an attacker -- unless they have an equalizer.These, Quigley writes, are two population groups desperately in need of access to firearms, yet gun-control laws work to systematically deny them this kind of emergency protection.Much of the rest of the book covers the basics of firearms, their use, and their ownership. Some of the basics are very basic indeed, so I recommend this book to firearms novices of _any_ gender, not just women!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Armed and Female","review":"InformativeGreat to give your lady if you would like her to consider arming herself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Armed and Female by Paxton Quigley","review":"This is a must read for all women in this modern age.

She now owns two handguns and we go to the range together. This book is a must read for every woman. Paxton opens up the eyes of people who may be in denial about firearms and their effective defensive capabilities. The stories of real women who also made the decision to refuse to be a victim will empower you. Excellent read and I highly recommend every gun owner read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any beginner","review":"Not just for women only and don't let the publication date fool you either. The book is still very informative and an excellant guide for anyone curious about handguns and their lawful use in self defense. Geared towards women and therefore very informative leaving nothing to chance. Though it wouldn't hurt to be updated to include some of new calibers out in the market now, e.g. 357 SIG, 10mm, etc., it still provides all the necessary basics for anyone interested in handgun selection, safety, ownership, and lawful use. A good reference book in anyone's library on this subject. Definitely worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wife Read It","review":"I bought it for her and she thought it was worthwhile.

Unfortunately, though this friendship is clearly pretty important to both of them, their parents and some of their other friends don't approve.

More importantly, it is geared to specific textbooks and has learning tips and directions to help kids who are confused, a review of chapter material, new problems to practice, etc.I found this worked best (at first) with parental supervision but a highly motivated student could use it himself or herself.What IS wonderful about the Flyware system is how it can be used for either fun OR education, so that kids are likely to play with it, even if they aren't crazy about practicing schoolwork.Is it a pen or a mini-computer?

Perfect for unwinding after work with some candles and incense burning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft,Peacefull Music .","review":"I've heard \\"Only time\\" all summer long.I really enjoyed the single,but not enought to buy Enya's CD,\\"A Day without Rain.\\" After 9-11,and what we have all been through,\\"Only time\\" really has special meaning.Its a song to heal,and bring peace to everyone who wants peace.Even the opening Instrumental,\\"A Day without Rain,\\" brings confert to our souls.You can't stop thinking about the people who lost there lives,and the loved one's they left behind when you play this song and \\"Only time\\"for some reason,but we know there at a better place.My other favorites,\\"Deora ar mo chroi.\\"(This one is outstanding)\\"Fallen embers,\\"(A beutifull love ballad)and \\"Pilgrim.\\" The last number,\\"Lazy Day,\\" would be another fantastic single.If anyone is having trouble getting back to listening to music,\\"A Day without Rain\\" is a great begining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure and angelic as always!","review":"Enya has one of the most angelic voices I have ever heard in music today. I know whenever I feel stressed out that a spin of Enya will calm my nerves. It is not the kind of music to clean house by as it will not get your blood pumping. However, it is the most calming music out there and it is safer than Protzac, with no side effects. All of the songs are excellent and there are a few that have a little spunk to them. I rated this a four because my favorite one is \\"Paint The Sky With Stars.\\" Whenever I played this c.d. at work all my customers would come up and ask if they could buy a copy, unfortunately I only sold books. But there is a quality about Enya's music that captures your soul and takes you away to a gentler place. Look out \\"Calgon\\" you've been replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"angel, where art thou?","review":"music just doesn't get any better than this album. The instrumentals and the sweet angelic voice of Enya is all one could hope for. If you don\\"t have it yet, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's 'chill out' time!","review":"A wonderful blend of relaxing, soul inspiring music. With the exception of Tempus Vernum (a bit on the 'dark' side), I loved all the numbers. Enya's crystal clear angelic voice can't help but take one to another dimension...another time...another place. \\"Fallen Embers\\" is my favorite. As I listen to the poignant lyrics, I never fail to get tears in my eyes and feel chills running through my body. Anyway, this is a perfect CD to pop in the stereo after a long stressful day. Open the windows, put on some candles, pour a glass of wine, AND....listen to \\"A Day Without Rain.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful....but pretty short length","review":"This is a great cd. I just wish it was more than 34 min. long. I like every single song on it. They're all really well done. If you are a fan of Enya, or just somebody who likes something that is relaxing and always nice to listen to, get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Anyone who is a fan of Enya will appreciate this CD, it's well worth the wait. My only regret is that it is a mere 35 or 40 minutes long. Listen and relax and enjoy her unique style. What a talent...every song is great. How many CDs end up having just one or two good cuts? Enya doesn't disappoint with \\"A Day Without Rain\\". Every cut is, as usual, a pleasure hear. Enya, give us more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is one of entertainments number one c.d.s. out there. Enya's lyrics may not be in all english but they are beautiful. She sings great on lord of the Rings too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enya'wn'","review":"After thoroughly enjoying her previous releases, I found this cd a little tiring and not as imaginative. Obviously, a cd you like you keep nearby and at-hand. Unfortunately, this cd has been banished to that big tall cd tower in my living room after less than a dozen listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Boring! Boring!","review":"I can't believe this album is actually selling. I'll admit it, I'm an Enya fan but A DAY WITHOUT RAIN is her WORST album yet. It's the same chanting, plucking strings, more chanting. After that 5 year break she took, I was expecting something new, innovative and exciting. But all you have here it seems, is b-side material. The only exception is \\"only time\\" which is actually a decent song. If you want Enya at her best then PAINT THE SKY WITH STARS is your best bet. It's got all of her best works on there. A DAY WITHOUT RAIN is a big dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I love Enya's music, but it seems she has every cd with the same formation. Every cd has an instrumental, every cd starts with her ethereal voices and every cd has one song in Gaelic. It's as if you know what she'll do on every cd, it lacks real surprises. She needs to loosen up a little bit and add some new stuff. It's okay when its 2 or 3 cd's, does it have to be on every one of them. Enya seek more influences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE ENYA FANS BUY THIS NOW!","review":"All Enya fans will love this album which was release in late 2000. Her voice is gentle and relaxing compared to those other terrible singers like britney spears, cristina aguleria, jessica simpson etc etc, all those artist who songs are pointless and insignificant. Enya music is high above those artist all her music is soothing and relaxing, and especially in this album with only time which is a big hit since last september's tradegy. And I totally love the other's like a day without rain is the intro which is a nice blend of piano and other instruments which is so relaxing. Second of my favourites is wild child, Flora's secret and Lazy days which is the last track on the CD. Listen to lazy days and after when the CD is finish you will still hear that song in your mind listen to it and you will see. This is a must buy for Enya's fans if you are a Enya fan and you haven't bought this please do now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Crafted and Worth the Wait","review":"After five long years, enya has a new alblum... \\" A Day Without Rain\\" and it is just as satisfying as all her other alblums.Unlike her previous alblums like \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Sheperd Moon\\" which had the distinct ancient Celtic tunes, \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is different from her previous release because her new songs does have a modern touch to it ! One fine example of one of these \\"modern\\" tracks is \\"Lazy Days\\".There are a total of eleven tracks in this alblum, each one more soothing than the last.This alblum is great for anyone under great stress as somehow, as always, her music has a calming effect. This alblum is also great for kids as I have seen youngsters being enchanted by enya's music and have become more creative!On a final note, I would like to thank enya for all the joy and peace that her music has brought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal","review":"I don't agree with those who say this album sounds tired, with nothing new. Of course Enya still has her same style and sound, but why shouldn't she? Aren't most artists recognized and liked for a certain sound and style? I am certainly glad she hasn't changed her ethereal sound. Enya has such a gift for melody that the songs on this album sound new and fresh, not at all worn-out. With the exception of Tempus Vernum, I love the sound and melody of every song. Had my sister not gotten it for me for Christmas first, I surely would have gotten it myself. Hearing each song was like finding a new melodic treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic - as can be expected","review":"another well-made CD from one of the most familar names in New Age. The first three tracks in this CD offers a good glimpse of the creative talent in Enya. well composed, well rendered, and well written. The fourth track is more hanuting than the others and is a nice change of tempo. The other tracks are vintage-Enya. nothing extra, nothing new..but the usual slow tempo any Enya fan will expect. Overall, a nice collection of tracks..Not much new ground is broken in this CD..but the first four tracks in itself makes it worthwhile to purchase the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is Like Reading A Novel","review":"Gothic,Mystic, Nostalgic,Refreshing...mumbling with Tempus Vernus as background music. Gees, I got this CD purely by accident not influenced though charts whatsoever. It was after I bought this I knew that Only Time is her current chart hit. To me listening to this album is like reading a novel say, Jane Austin's Sense and Sensitivity, Thomas Hardyfs Tess of DfUbervilles or Harry Potter series. My #1 favorite is One by One the most well-written song. It didn't take long to become one of my all time favorites. Music fans irrespective of his/her favorite genre will love this album for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful!","review":"This was my second Enya album. I had heard the song \\"Only Time\\" on the radio and wanted to try it out, and I'm certainly glad I did! This CD has a very nostalgic, soft, airy feel to it, and the layered vocals and instrumentals are absolutely astounding! The only exception to the soft, airy feel is \\"Tempus Vernum,\\" which, although dramatically different from the rest of the album, is enjoyably so. \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is in Latin, and I do have a complete, unofficial translation in case anyone's interested. Just email me ... and I'd be glad to send it to you.To all who have never heard Enya before: this album is a terrific place to start! If you enjoy nostalgic, dreamy New Age music, this is definitely for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"I don't know about you, but it's tough for me to find music this relaxing that has real musical value, so I'm thrilled with this release. I know everybody says it's short, but that's the way it goes. i'd rather short with quality than long with junk.The only other stuff I've found that's as relaxing is W h i s per by some girl named Genie."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificant","review":"Almost a hypnotic voice, very ethnic, yet universal if you might Enya as New Age. Through beautiful music, imparts the message that the human heart is universally the same. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENYA IS BEAUTIFUL","review":"ENYA IS LIKE BEYOND WORDS. This cd was the first cd I ever bought and is still 1 of my favorites to this day. you will love it. no wonder her cds take 5 years 2 make. all of enya music is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop goes Enya","review":"For all her mystical etherial talent, this recorcing is all-American pop at its poorest...Cliche lyrics, choppy tempos, flat artistry. Perhaps she finds it novel to sing in english, but this cd is nothing like her earlier beautiful work... If you're an original Enya fan, this isnt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENYA","review":"I bought this album not long after it came out in 2000 and I listen to it all the time, its soothing and very melodic. Enyas voice is without a doubt one of the most soothing voices ever! this CD is perfect for sitting down and relaxing too... i used to listen to it when i would go tanning, thats how relaxing this CD is.I recommend it for anyone who likes instrumental melodic hymn like songs.....recommend \\"a day without rain, only time, fallen embers, floras secret and the radio played wildchild\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Woman","review":"Loved this woman! This CD is the best. Very melodic and hypnotic. When I saw her on this years (2002) Acadamy awards (for The Lord Of The Rings) I was hooked. I had purchased all her other CD before, but this one stands out. I had never seen her perform before. A real tret!I also like the fact she is now being playe don more contemporary stations so to get more exposure to the younger crowd. New Age music could be well represented by her.This CD is charming and has an underling message that is pretty obvious when you listen to all the songs and their meaning. Buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day Without Rain","review":"I totally enjoy this album... Lots of English Lyrics to be able to learn and I also love the music itself. My daughter loves every song she has ever written. She is only 7 years old(by the way) We love every piece of her albums she has out so far. So far the only one we don't have is the one about Silent Night. We hope to find it in a store eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal.....","review":"I was really expecting something extra ordinary and instead was confronted with watered down Vangelis/Clanaad. Yeah, the keyboards provide a decent texture and the vocals have that dreamy quality. I think other artists have done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Song Remains the Same...","review":"I'll keep this brief. While Enya's sound is certainly melodic, lush and layered - the 35 minutes on this CD seemed like an eternity to me of the same song playing over and over. I couldn't wait for it to end. I would stick to her earlier work with Clannad instead of this example of homogeneous, blended muzak."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is uninspiring at best.","review":"This CD was a major disappointment - nothing new or memorable. Enya's voice is as clear as always, but the music here is a third rate repetition of other CDs that she has made."},{"rating":"2","title":"4,5 stars - Beautiful, yet not too innovative","review":"Enya's music has the ability to captivate anyone with her beautiful voice and new age harmonies, a unique style that derived largely from her time with celtic band Clannad. This album, the first original one she put in the market in five years, is no exception to the rule.Although I loved it, I'm not giving it five stars, because the sound seems to have got a bit stuck within the same style. Don't get me wrong: it's a great album (a little short too, but well...) If you've already heard Enya material before (such as \\"Watermark\\" of \\"Shepherd Moons,\\" both of which I highly recommend), it brings nothing new. However it's beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First ENYA Purchase","review":"I am mainly a fan of Country Western music, but have other tastes as well. I found myself drawn to the songs \\"A Day Without Rain\\" and \\"Only Time\\" when hearing them on television. I just HAD to see if I could locate the Artist. I read a few of the reviews and I'm VERY happy with this CD. It is a wonderful collection which I would describe as a perfect companion to a relaxing candlelit evening. Share it with someone you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"I had never heard of Enya before I first heard \\"Only Time\\" play in the theatre as I waited for the movie to start. I'd never heard that before, and it was such lovely music. It reminded me of \\"Orinico Flow\\" (I didn't know that it was called Orinico Flow at the time), or at least the instruments sounded like it. After the song was done playing, I heard them say it was \\"Only Time\\" from the CD \\"A Day Without Rain\\" by Enya. After that I immediately bought the CD, and listened to the other great songs! This is the first CD of Enya I've ever bought and actually heard, and now it's making me buy more of Enya's work. I really love this CD, the music is so peaceful and calming, and it shows how nice a voice Enya has and her and the Ryans' talent with creating this music. I recommend getting this CD if you are just getting into Celtic music, or if you are curious about Enya's music, because I'm sure you'll be pleased with it. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enya rocks!","review":"As a first-time listener (and now, fan) of Enya, I can say without conviction that this is a great CD. At first I bought it only to to hear Only Time (and c'mon, I wasn't the only one)and gradually became a big fan of all her music.The way Tempus Vernum flows into Deora Ar Mo Chroi is simply magic. When first listening, I could swear they were one song. Only Time is beautiful as it is simple (not like that radio-remix stuff). And unlike an earlier CD, this one includes the words to all her songs except A Day Without Rain and Silver Inches (as they are wordless).In additon to this CD I would strongly recommend Paint the Sky with Stars. Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very beautiful and relaxing music","review":"Every song on this CD is great. It is well worth the price. This is the first Enya CD I have purchased and I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"I bought it mostly for \\"Only Time\\". The others are also well done, but it is the signature song. Very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earlier Songs Recycled","review":"I am a huge Enya fan, but this new release sounds to me like a basic re-working of her previous melodies. Before I listen to it a hundred times and it sinks in, this is my first impression. Not that Enya needs to change anything, but there just isn't anything fundamentally new here. Her three previous releases, on the other hand, were very exploratory each in themselves. But this new one sounds like a re-hash of \\"In Memory of Trees\\". Enya is now in a rut, but at least it is a pleasant one. The last song \\"Lazy Days\\" almost redeems the CD, but not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It seems like Enya has repeated her formula one too many times - every song on this album sounds an awful lot like things she's already done in the recent past. The worst part is that it leans so heavily on the \\"pop\\" sounding tunes that seem designed to be radio-friendly, and all but abandons the mystical, other-worldly style that made \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepherd Moons\\" so great. Maybe it's time for her to dump her long-time collaborators and finally move in a new direction; she's capable of so much more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Way too Short!! Very Disappionted","review":"I have always like Enya and was excited to get this album when I heard the \\"only time\\" song. But when I played it despite some lovely songs, it was so short! Really I have to say not my money's worth. I think it is only 38 minutes or so, just enough time to get into the mood and then it stops on YOU! I think it is much more worthwhile to listen to her other albums. Enya, I know you have more songs in there! Add a few more next time. I dont even usally write reviews, so this had to really bother me to get on the computer and do so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Longtime Enya Fan Disappointed","review":"First of all there's only 11 short tracks on this CD that only amount to 35 minutes, which is ridiculous considering it's her first work in 5 years. And a few of the songs barely even feature her voice on them. If you are new to Enya and want to try her out, don't bother with this crock, and pick up the far superior \\"Watermark\\" instead. Enya's definitely dragging her feet with this uninspired dreck. I kept thinking I had already heard these songs before the whole time I was listening to it. That incomprehensible angellic warbling gets old pretty quick. Take the track \\"Wild Child\\", for example. It has that same ethereal music, and some mumbly words you can make out, then the last words are the songs title. Why it's even titled that is a mystery to me, she should have called it \\"Prozac Child.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Be A Flatter Platter","review":"Enya has explored new territory on each of her successive recordings. Likewise, each recording has borne the unmistakable hallmark of passion and power. This CD lacks both. Enya was never boring until this release, and it's not because we want someting radically new. She simply has failed to preserve her inner-delight on this CD, and believe me...human beings can tell when music is forced, or when an artist is boring themselves. Enya basically recycles all of her old tricks without bothering to recycle her conviction. I sensed the lack of verve in this CD after only a couple of songs. Her only triumph on this work is the 'Flora' song. This one piece leaves us with at least a thread of hope that she is not burned out entirely by her own mystique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enya's musical shines through, as usual","review":"I am a fussy, discriminating, not-easy-to please musician who has played professional jazz trumpet for years. But Enya's music never fails to bring me a sense of euphoria that I don't find even with my favorite jazz or other tracks on a consistent basis. Her music is without a doubt, a gift of the spirit, and her kindred soul always permeates her music. What's truly unique here is that the music of Enya---while so pleasing and universal to an obviously wide audience---somehow escapes commercialism or banality. I suppose when a soul truly and earnestly speaks, it does so without having to rely on gimmickry or superficiality, nor on the primal scream of the banging drum. It speaks deeply, quietly and beautifully to anyone who will listen. Listen to this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great any day (rainy or not)","review":"I've listened to this CD many times, and I do not get bored with it. I have all her other titles, and enjoy this as much as the others. My two year old daughter will stop what ever she is doing when the CD begins playing. She is intrigued by the music, as am I. Her instrumental, composition, and vocal talents are amazing. If you want something to help you slow your world down for a few minutes, put in this CD (or any of her others), sit down, close your eyes and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Enya returns!","review":"After the disappointment of the Trees album, it was a long wait for Enya's latest offering \\"A Day Without Rain\\". But what a delight! With Rain, Enya does what Enya does best - beautiful piano and catchy melodies supported with soaring vocals and strings. While the early albums contained an equal balance in the mood between both uplifting and darker minor chords, Rain tends to favor the more upbeat and lighter sounds. If you know Enya, you'll like this one. And, if you're a new fan, this is a good introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly simple and unchallenging","review":"All of Enya's previous albums have been great works of amazingly complexity, unusual harmonies, and strikingly beautiful melodies.Her previous album \\"The Memory of Trees\\" features breathtakingly innovative sounds and compositions of significant depth and innovation (such as \\"Pax Deorum\\").Unfortunately, this new album has virtually none of this. She takes some of her previous melodies and recycles them into simple, repetitive pop songs. From the other reviews, it is clear that there are many fans of her vocal style and beautiful melodies. These fans seem oblivious to what greater elements are missing from her latest effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very special one.","review":"This CD have a meaning to me, the song Only Time have a healing message for everyone. Is like having someone who is giving you an advice in trouble times. You have to get this CD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day without Rain","review":"Our first Enya CD. Love it as it is very relaxing. Ordering a copy for or Daughter stationed in Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music.","review":"I love this tape. Almost all the songs are lovely, soothing and great to relax with. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched my soul","review":"This CD is absolutely beautiful. The words and music touched my soul. I take dance lessons adnd danced to TEMPUS VERNUM and another person danced to WILD CHILD. A member of the audience loved the music and took the tape I had. I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"XXI Century's Beethoven","review":"I think Enya is an amazing singer, who's voice is sweet and powerfull at the same time.While I listen to her music I feel as if all my worries were gone, she draws you into a \\"state of mind\\" were you feel relaxed and peaceful. And when I'm in trouble or I've got angry with somebody, I've got exams coming; I simply go to my room and listen to her , to dream awake hearing what she says in each of her songs and after that,I can assure I feel much better.I compare her music with classical one and say: She is the XXI century's Beethoven! So if you like classical music, or you are stressed and you desperately want a bit of a break at the end of the day, spend a bit of your time with Enya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous...","review":"How can I possibly describe it? I grew up listening to Enya. You're probably wondering how, as her first cd came out in 1988. Well, I'm twelve. So that answers your question. But, anyway, I love her music. Enya makes the kind of music where, when you listen to it, with no distractions, and close your eyes, everything else kind of dissolves and you're caught in this silken web of ecstasy. Okay, you prabably think i'm insane. If you've listened to it, you understand. If you haven't, listen to it and you will. That's enough for now. (look out for siver inches and wild child.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled \\"Running Out of Steam\\".","review":"The first thing I noticed about this CD was that no track times are listed with the track titles, not that unusual I'll admit, but then when I put the disc in my player total play time is less than 35 minutes! Not much value for the high end price tag, especially when discs with play times of 60 and 70 minutes can be found in the $10 to $12 range. But my major disappointment came with listening to this over produced and formulaic collection of tunes. Now don't get me wrong, I have been an Enya fan ever since hearing her lush, multi-layered vocals while watching \\"The Celts\\" on PBS many years ago, and I own every CD and music video that she has released. But, in my opinion the only tracks of any merit on this disc are \\"tempus vernum\\" and \\"deora ar mo chroi\\", sung in latin and gaelic respectively. I expect to start seeing this title in the \\"previously owned\\" bins right away, and if you absolutely must have it in your collection, wait to buy it from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Doesn't Overwhelm & Awe You - Like Enya's Music Should","review":"First, if this were any artist but Enya, this CD would have gotten 4 stars. But I expect more from Enya. I expect to be overwhelmed and awed and inspired by her music. Almost everything she's created in the past has done that to me at some level, usually on the first or second listen. Unfortunately, \\"A Day Without Rain\\", after 4 or 5 plays, just doesn't have that same power.The track \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is easily the best, and really the only memorable, song on the CD. The rest is mostly in English, and much of it almost sounds more like pop than like Enya.It's been a long wait, and it's unfortunately a big disappointment. I hope that it's not another five years before we see more from Enya, and I hope that the next release brings back the magic that only Enya's music can bring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day Without Rain","review":"This was the first Enya Cd I heard, and I love it, I would love to get this Cd for my birthday or some other, day because it is calm, relaxing, and to me enjoyable at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enya likes us Canadians","review":"Well apparently Enya decided to give us Canadians (and a few other countries besides the US) one extra track on our cut of ADWR. How nice of her. If any of you in America live near the border I'd recommend taking one afternoon to just drive up here and pick up the 12 track copy if you're that much of a die hard fan, otherwise you're not missing much. I like the extra track \\"The First of Autumn\\" though, it's nice. Still I can't give this album a perfect score because it should have been a little bit longer. My question is: Why didn't she put ALL of the new tracks she made onto her album? She could have added \\"The Promise\\", \\"Isobella\\" and \\"The First of Autumn\\" to make a total of 14 tracks. That would have been more respectable. I love the album though."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"This album would get 3 stars on its own, but it gets 2 for a few reasons. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere for one. Don't get me wrong, I love Enya's music, but sometimes I wish she would make an album that wasn't \\"Watermark...part whatever.\\" The songs are well crafted and beautifully sung, but they all sound like they could belong on any of her previous albums. If you like Enya and don't want her to change or evolve, then you'll love this album, but if you want to see a new direction or more influences, you might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Originally breathtaking...","review":"Enya's work has always left me feeling intrigued and wanting more. This album ends a long waiting period, within which I satisfy my hunger by listening to different varieties of celtic music. When I bought it, I did not have any expectation other than the believe I will enjoy it as I have enjoyed Memory of Trees, the Celts, Shepherd Moon, Watermark and her compilation. Although Enya has not ventured too far away from her concept, she still emphasizes originality in her work, which is something I respect in an artist. My favorite of this album are Flora's Secret, Pilgrim and Silver Inches. A Day without Rain thoroughly shines through..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had CD for 2 days and listened to it 8+ times!","review":"I have all of Enya's CD's and this is her most refreshing album yet! I am in the midst of final exam studying and have enjoyed her relaxing new sound. Track #2 is wonderful!! This would be a great Christmas present for anyone you know that is experiencing stress in their life. (that would include all of us most likely!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've ever bought","review":"I have a ton of CD's. Most of them get tossed in a bin after listening to them three or four times. I have played this CD over and over and over again. This is the BEST CD I have bought. I definitely suggest that you at least give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling beauty","review":"Enya, with her collaborators, is a trinity, and by doing less on this album, they have done more. By holding back on the production, Enya has released a masterpiece. Her choir technique of singing many parts is also more restrained, allowing the songs themselves to breathe in a new way. If this is a dry day for Enya, may she have more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and Trite","review":"This CD is a complete disappointment. Every song sounds like a copy of previous songs. There is a lack of true feeling in the compositions, everything sounds like a factory-churned out Enya product. Someone gave it to me as a gift and I listened to it at a coffeehouse as my friend studied. I wondered why I got through the CD in such a quick amount of time. Was I so spaced out that an hour went by that quickly?? Then I read the other reviews on here and realized, it's only 34 minutes!! Anyone who would rip off fans like that has lost my respect. I'm heading for the used CD store to sell this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Enya I came to love","review":"Where's the beautiful and timeless music of _The Celts_, _Watermark_ (my favorite album ever), and _Shepherd Moons_? Definitely nowhere to be found on _A Day Without Rain_. I had been disappointed with _The Memory Of Trees_, but at least that album still showed a spark of originality on songs like the title track, \\"Tea-House Moon\\", and a couple others. Though _A Day Without Rain_ has a few beautiful songs like \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Fallen Embers\\", most of the album follows a totally predictable pattern.

That's how it came to me. I can't say this is terrible music because it isn't. However, I feel as if I'm underwater in Atlantis while listening to it. Is this New Age music? If it is, I don't think I'm going to be a fan of it. Another reviewer mentioned that if you were an artist, you might like painting to this. I AM an artist and I can't imagine painting to this as it is too blah. I'd worry my art work would come out too blah, or maybe soggy. This just isn't me. I notice there are 3 used ones already for sale on this page which doesn't hugely surprise me. What age person likes this music? It might be good in a hospital or nursing home setting as it is restful is my only thought. You could carry parts of it right over to your funeral too because sections sound like underwater dirges. Thank God a Sade album was included in the gift package along with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative to the Extreme","review":"I must disagree with the preponderance of positive reviews of this latest by Enya. I believe she peaked with her first work, when she burst onto the scene with \\"Shepherds Moon,\\" which I thought was exceptional in every respect. This album is just the latest in a very minor variation of the thematic core established years ago by Enya, in terms of the synthesized music that seems to force her admittedly beautiful voice into the background along with the lyrics. Listening to the mere 34 minutes was an exercise akin to staying to see how a bad movie ends. Enya should take an emotional cue from her sister, Maire Brennan, and her other relatives in Clannad. \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is flat, monotonous, repetitive, and a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bravo!","review":"This is a wonderful CD to own if you've recently lost your soul or are trying to keep interesting music from entering your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back on top","review":"It's been a long wait for her album but, in my estimation, worth it. Enya is back at the top of her form. Everything that I fell in love to begin with is here once again. It's another album that I can listen to over and again (much to my wife's chagrin). Perhaps it's the familiar opening piano solo reminiscent of Watermark which opens the album, but I feel that it is much more than that. To me, it is a continuation of a body of work that is near perfect. She soothes my soul and bathes me in comfort..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the weak hearted....","review":"This album is for the weak. The main audience compromises of people with mid life crisis. Its just boring and not uplifting. Also, as someone else pointed out, seems like every song uses the same formula. There is no variety in this one. Only Time is one of the most depressing songs, that could seriously drive a person to suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Loreena McKennitt","review":"Please don't buy any of this overproduced fluff.

I thought it was poetic, even sad, and downright unbearable as some of the songs. when it started out the first song i could barely stand the loneliness of the feeling of the song. but i wanted to hear how she sound LIVE without the benefit of the voice overs and studio sound enhancement. i dont think that she would sound very good live. The cd was short but it fit into the context i guess sort of like a mini play or a project. it did work together with the placement of songs. But i dont think she would sound very good live. Celine Dion needs to show her a lesson in singing live. She needs to open up her throat-hole and EMOTE EMOTE EMOTE. Thats the secret of Celine's success.

I found it so foreign to my liking that I could not even listen to all the tracks.The music seemed so repetitive and unsettling, nothing soothing about this music at all.

I disliked this CD so strongly I listened to it a second time recently just to see if I had been too harsh, too quick to condemm. I wasn't. It's horrible music that has strange sound effects on several tracks that sounded similar to turning the Dolby on and off when playing a cassette tape.

If too many people start playing this during daylight hours, entire city blocks could be sent to sleep, with catastrophic results. Drivers would zonk out at the wheel, nuclear power workers would doze through developing meltdowns, office workers would fall asleep and fail to do any meaningful work all day - okay, that last one's pretty much normal.

The rythemic patterns are extremely uneven, only to disturb the brain waves. Truly entertaining pieces of works are done by Linkin Park and Disturbed. Secondly, Enya's lyrics have no meaning at all.

Anyway, buy it you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five years for a half hours time?","review":"Let me make this clear. I love Enya. But this album is a very poor offering. The songs are unremarkable and sound like leftovers that she hadn't been able to record previously. Nothing very original here. I had been anticipating a new from Enya for several months and sadly, was very disappointed. This is a good addition for rabid Enya fans or for those who'd like to make their collection complete, but if you give it a pass, you really won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"I've been listening to Enya for years and it just keeps getting better! Since The Celts way back when...she just keeps cranking out quality music. The tunes are haunting, as usual. The lyrics are thoughtful and thought-provoking, also as usual. Every song is deeply layered with soft, sweet, mind-bending harmonies. It's not a terribly long CD, but the length doesn't stand out as a bad thing. What's there is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"....I'm not complaining....","review":"After listening to this CD for the first time, I find myself asking one question. How is it possible to create a sound that is so unbelievably beautiful, haunting and ethereal all at the same time? The answer is quite simple. Because it's Enya. Need I say more? From the upbeat track Wild Child to the instrumental Silver Inches, this work is vintage Enya. The formula may be the same, but why mess with success? True, it is shorter then most which is somewhat disappointing, but after having waited for five years since her release of The Memory of Trees, I'm not complaining. If you are bothered by the CD's relatively short length, place it in your player on repeat. That should more then make up for it. How sweet it is......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I have heard, and own, all of Eithne's music and find A Day without Rain a welcome addition. It isn't the best album she's released because, to me, they all rank equal (except maybe The Celts which is a bit lower). My two favorites from this one are the lively Wild Child and the flowing Flora's Secret. FS is a really fun piece to play on the piano, too, along with One by One. I would hardly call this album unoriginal. Same style, yes, but Eithne has a wonderful way of evoking a certain emotion that is unsurpassed and she continues to live up to my expectations. This album is the only album I have ever bought without knowing anything about the tracks it contains, and I would only do so with Eithne. I'm sorry that there are avid fans who feel let down, but I for one would be upset if she were to change her current course. I would though, being half-Scot, like to hear a little more bagpipes in her music. :)I would hope that no one misses this album because of others' reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"\\"A Day Without Rain\\" is my favourite Enya album. Filled with plenty tranquil classic enya pieces including the smash first single, \\"Only Time\\". Also includes the awesome instrumental title track \\"A Day Without Rain\\". A must buy, you won't be disappointed. If you loved \\"The Memory of Trees\\", this will be ten times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home","review":"I've really liked Enya over the years and have all her CD's, so I was looking forward to this one.Unfortunately, there's really nothing new here. All the songs sound the same -- they sound like Enya, but they're all the same. You can't tell from this album if you're listening to \\"A Day W/O Rain\\" or someother previous album. Actually, since the songs are all the same, it's easy to tell the album.So if you're starting out, do yourself a favor and start with an earlier (and much more interesting) album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift","review":"I don't actually have the album yet, but I plan to have it for the holidays so my family can enjoy Enya's angelic recordings. I have all of her previous US releases (from \\"The Celts\\" to \\"Paint The Sky With Stars\\") and have eagerly awaited this new album.After previewing the tracks online, the album creates an elegant and lush soundscape that is absolutely spellbinding - especially \\"Only Time\\" and \\"Lazy Days.\\"Though one can hear some faint echoes of her past work in this new CD, she has certainly built on a solid foundation and created a work that is at once familiar and yet fascinatingly new at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Heaven!","review":"This CD was well worth the five year wait, although I hope it doesn't take that long for another CD to come out from Enya. The songs from this one are as incredible as always, and the melodies stick in your head all day. My favorite song on the CD is \\"Wild Child\\" - which is what inspiration would sound like if translated into music. My only gripe with this CD is that I wish it were longer - you can't get enough Enya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENCHANTING AND SUBLIME!","review":"ENYA is in a league of her own. A DAY WITHOUT RAIN stirs the soul as few musical accomplishments can. Put on her CD, wear headphones, and you'll be transported to heaven. There is no other way to say it. Since ENYA puts out a new CD only every few years, fans will absolutely enjoy a CD from an unknown but superb ENYA-like artist: Caroline Peyton. SHe has one CD, \\"Celtic Christmas Spirit\\" (greenhillmusic.com)and her voice and layered harmonies are hauntingly beautiful. The songs are unfamiliar yet gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is definitly worth a listen","review":"I absolutly love this CD. It has a heavenly fresh sound to it that brings serinity to my mind when I listen to it. It brings peaceful thoughts to my head such as looking at clouds or laying in flowers. This CD is a great de-stresser, and it's especially ideal for things such as practicing yoga or for playing in your car during rush hour traffic. It's also musical enough that you could listen to it and get some musical enrichment from it. The only thing that kept me from giving the album a fifth star is the fact that her album is layed down just like some of her others, beggining with a beautiful piano ballad, and well, if you listen to Enya, you know the rest. However, in this album, Enya experiments with more sounds wrapped in her music, making it richer than usual. Definitly a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Even though I'm a hard-core Parrot Head, the first time I heard this, I had to have it!

This one is, with only one or two exceptions, incredibly bland. Add to that the fact that it's short on playing time, and I can only conclude that it's not worth getting unless you're determined to have a complete Enya collection. Or you want some extremely inoffensive background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY STALE SOUND","review":"This is simply a rehash of very other lame Enya CD that you have ever heard. I liked Shepard moons and Watermark, but this CD offers absolutely nothing new. Its the same sound, recipe, formula that she has doled out to us countless times now. I think she is either incredibly lazy, cares only about profits, or is creatively bankrupt, maybe a combination of the three. Her last two CDs are the last Enya CDs I will purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ever of Enya, go for Loreena","review":"If your looking for celtic insported music like Enya used to make, hunt for the artist Loreena McKennitt. A day without rain is Enyas definitively worst album ever. She was one of my favoirites, and I can't really forgive her for putting out something as dreadful as this CD.

I was wondering what was so special about it until I heard it. I thought that this CD was great, uplifting, and well just great. I knew God/ddess knew that people were going to need something to rejuvanate them and that's why this CD was made. The only problem is that two songs aren't as uplifting as the rest, that is 4 and 5. It sounds like it predicted that Sept. 11 would happen and I didn't like that. Well, the only other thing I like to mention is that this CD is not short, it has 12 songs in them. I don't think a CD has to have 16 or more songs to be known as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful ethereal sound","review":"I love the new age, ethereal sound of Enya. She has beautiful words to say in her songs and just listening to this album can make that headache go away. From the carefree mood of \\"Wild Child\\" to the serious \\"Pilgrim\\" to the all instrumental title track \\"A Day Without Rain\\" to the somberness of \\"Only Time,\\" this album was evidently made with deep thought. Enya does not disappoint on her new releases; she took 5 years to roll out this one and it's worth giving a listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mood music","review":"Its a great CD to have in the office. It has a little bit of pick me up attitude but is mellow enough not to distract the guy next door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to soothe your soul.","review":"'A Day Without Rain', is simply put, the best of the best in terms of Enya's various albums. A good sampling of her hit songs are on Paint the Sky With Stars, but if you are truly in love with her music after buying this album, get the 3 CD 'Box of Dreams' set. 'Only Time' is yes the most popular song hands down, but 'Flora's Secret' is also a standout single on its own merits. Happy sailing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I bought this CD for Only Time, but it didn't take more than one playing to realize this is a wonderful collection. A Day Without Rain is beautiful and Only Time well worth the purchase, but a sleeper is Pilgrim. I could listen to that all day and not get tired of it. A very listenable grouping that will be played very often and replaced if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit short but enthralling","review":"I see that others complain about the CD being short, which it is.

It is extremely relaxing and the melodies and vocals are beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brevity is the soul of wit? Errr...","review":"I have been an Enya fan for over six years, but I must say, I was sorely disappointed by her newest release. Not only was I stunned when my CD player quickly ran through the album and began anew (the 11 song description is deceiving), but the songs are, shall we say... edited versions of her previous albums? Seriously, every melody reminds me of either Watermark or the Memory of Trees. If you enjoy getting your money's worth, don't buy this album. Yes, the sounds are \\"pretty,\\" but they lack the normal breathtaking quality of Enya's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite more of the same","review":"At first listen, this album sounds pretty much just like the albums that have come before it, only, because it's all so familiar, one might feel cheated that there is really nothing new. Every song on it instantly reminds me of a similar song on a previous CD. And yet, even though I felt that way, I put it on constant repeat for about three days after I brought it home. Enya has abandoned a lot of her synthesized experiments and here is relying on simple chording and her own voice, ably enhanced by production technique. The result, as always, is restful but not boring. The melodies sound familiar to anyone accustomed to her style, but they will not let you go, and they are new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same thing done less well","review":"I was a real fan of Enya and Celtic/New Age music in general, but Enya needs to mature. She needs to bring her voice down out of la-la land and sing in that rich lower register that is heard on some of the selections. Otherwise it is the same old thing, but not as good. Her themes don't seem as clear as earlier albums either. Don't know what's going on exactly. A shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of Providence","review":"Enya's \\"Only Time\\" was the closing music on Providence (2-16-01) and it provided the most haunting and poignant background for what were very emotional scenes. That alone has convinced me to get to know Enya's music better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enya CD, but lean on playing time","review":"Prior to getting this album, I felt that quality and quantity of each of Enya's albums were \\"just right.\\" They did not leave me feeling that there could be more that could have been included. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent album to get. It's just that I thought it was on the short side time-wise. Maybe I'm too picky in this case or maybe one can never get enough of Enya."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful sounds","review":"Enya's music is so very good, I wish everyone could hear it. It is different. It has her unique personal sound in every piece. There is a flowing, almost solemn majesty and there is a deep rich joy. It is music for a person of wide and varied tastes, who makes their own decisions. The sheer beauty of her voice carries much of it, but the words and orchestration are also excellent. Only little problem, sometimes I wish there were a few more instruments in the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too big and bulky","review":"My son is nine, and thought the idea of a vibrating watch would be great to remind him to check his blood sugar while at summer camp.

If there was, you wouldnt be shelling out more to get this import edition.That said, the import edition is wonderful, with 4 tracks, including the original that was on the soundtrack. 'Try again' is a song with excellent beats and Aaliyah's voice is much better than her contemporaries such as Brandy and Monica, but the song suffers due to its repetitive nature. 'If at first you dont succeed...' is about the only line here, and its a wonder that the song ,managed to reach No. 1 in the US solely based on airplay.

But it really doesn't belong in any genre at all. It has no plot, at least none that makes any sense or will keep you interested. The filmmakers try desperately to create stylish sets and lighting, but it only feels really pretentious, just like most of the long, pointless scenes with dialogue that make no sense and that add nothing to the non-existing plot.

People who legitimately do animal chiropractic have to be licensed, and must first be either DVMs or DCs with 180+ hours of additional training, and pass rigorous testing before practicing. The very idea that laypeople are encouraged to do their own adjustments is frightening. You can't learn this from a single book! Yikes!You can do tremendous damage with an improper adjustment.

Who can swashbuckling warrior queen and her tortured warrior-turned-priest hostage husband all flung against the backdrop of Scotland's isle? Not me. I fell for this couple instantly. She's my kind of girl--stuck halfway between her breastplate and her role as a bride. Instead of a broom for her part of the hearth and home at the wedding, eighteen-year-old upstart Maire, whose been training for her role as queen for the last nine years with two foster brothers, throws down her sword on top of her husbands.The spiritual thread here is well woven and very authentic, describing the often overlooked struggles and questions of God's character and how He relates to us. I know Mrs. Windsor is writing more contemporaries now, but she definitely hit her groove on this one. This was an awesome read."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt about it- This is a five star rating!","review":"I was very surprised at this book by Linda Windsor because i think she should write more like this one! Right from the beginning it held my interest with the exciting story of Maire, queen of Glennmarra and Rowan ap emerys who is taken hostage. In the beginning of the story Maire and Rowan fight against each other in a duel. Rowan- who believes in God, doesnt want to kill her, so he lets her win. In that he becomes her hostage and her husband. With time the people of Glennmara learn to respect Rowan and his God as he and Maire fight to overcome the evil that is plagueing the land.

It is a great read, and very inspiring in seeing that people of all times have stuggles in their Christian walk, and yet can prevail with God's strength.

Hard to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful heroine who combines strength and femininity","review":"Maire is a captivating tale of a pagan warrior queen and a Christian warrior who wants to be a priest. Maire's spiritual journey is inextricably intertwined with her journey as a woman and a queen; the spiritual content isn't forced, and it definitely isn't holier-than-thou! The characters feel authentic and fully developed; there's nothing stereotypical about them.Maire herself is a wonderful character, presented warts and all, figuratively speaking. And the historical insight into Christianity's beginnings in Ireland is enthralling. I will definitely be reading the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loonnngggg","review":"I am sorry to say, but I was dreading to finish it.

The quality of picture was good but the sound was a bit muffled on my computer. I prefer to rent movies but had to buy this one because the online rent option was not available. I'm happy with the purchase though. Good for a Saturday at home or anytime you need a good laugh and some relaxing moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting","review":"The movie was very boring. Mostly, because of SJ Parker. She can't act. She was so fake that I hardly made myself to finish watching it.

This is the movie when she looked the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Was this a comedy? I mean there was nothing funny, and every moment was predictable.

He has no chemistry with Sarah Jessica Parker, and she is not funny here. Bad script. Completely unrealistic. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"SJP is a very bad actress","review":"Wasnt the best-overly predictable and overdone at times. Hugh Grant was shown as a funny character and succeeded at times but not others. SJPs character was like almost all of her roles in that she is overly dramatic and frets over the dumbest things.

If it had been especially funny it would have been ok, but this movie was nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper","review":"Don't waste your time with this movie unless you want something to put you to sleep. Yet another lame attempt for SJP to come across as an actor"},{"rating":"1","title":"They needed the money","review":"It's sad to think that Huge Grant matched up with the over rated Sarah Jessica Parker in this poorly written and blandly acted comedy. And of course, typical of the Left-wing minded Hollywood, the statement from Parker about Sarah Palin was stupid propaganda. It would have been contemporarily funny and comically controversial if the screen writers had interjected an antidote or gag about Nancy Pelosi, Biden, or Obama into the movie.

How in the world does she continue to get roles? I'm also not much of a Hugh Grant fan but he looked like Richard Burton compared to Parker.To be fair, they didn't have a lot to work with. The dialogue was trite and hokey. I think that with some effort this could have been a decent movie but, as it was, it was just sad.I read the reviews and was warned to stay away from this movie but I didn't listen.

Life presents plenty of issues to deal with, so a light-hearted way of looking at your situation and be able to laugh at yourself is just what is needed to help pull through what sometimes may seem as unbearable situation.I wouldn't judge the acting too harshly.

Hugh Grant can't make movies in the UK any more because the British seem to make only about one movie every couple of years. So, to pay for the fuel for his Aston Martin, Grant has to accept scripts that seem to have been written by machines. Everything is totally predictable, the humor - despite stalwart performances by Grant and Sam Elliott - is unfunny, the situations pathetic and the resolution is obvious from the opening voice-over. This is dishwater of the thinnest kind and should be avoided by anyone who wants not to lapse into a catatonic state.

It is also more accessible and easier to get into than 'Slanted & Enchanted'. Stephen Malkamus's songwriting skills (aswell as his vocals) have improved, and the songs are consequently more memorable. The guitars are consistenly brilliant, whether rocking out (so to speak) on 'Unfair' to more mellow, introspective stuff like 'Stop Breathin'. The best cuts from 'Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain' are 'Silence Kit', 'Cut Your Hair'(Pavements first 'hit', even though it wasn't really a hit) and 'Unfair'. But there are no weak links on this album; this is a brilliant alternative rock record from one of the best alternative/indie bands around. It is 'Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain', and not 'Terror Twilight' or 'Slanted & Enchanted', that is Pavements best record."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds like gold","review":"I've got this cd in my collection since it was released about six years ago.

That's the beauty of Pavement: They turn ordinary sound into totally unique and entertaining music. And they do it all with a smart-a** attitude.

This is the best band ever from Stockton, CA."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is What The Pave Really Meant","review":"I consider Crooked Rain to be my generations Blonde On Blonde. The album is a celebration of rock and its endless possibilities and frustrations. The band is on fire and unconscious; plowing their way to brilliance with uncanny edginess and execution. Its all right there from post college boredom to the rock-n-roll dreams suburban kids fantasize about. There is a sense of urgency from the opening track to the glorious burnt out beauty of \\"Fillmore Jive.\\" The songs are alive and loose; a soundtrack for the bummer of a summer you always seem to have once in a while.

I've heard her in at least 6 live concerts and they were all fantastic - she has a lot to offer the world of music.However, this disc is extremely annoying. Now, Nadja has always had tons of musical spunk, and she has made it work well interpretively for big concertos and sonatas and other showpieces. But it simply does not work here. \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" with tons of glissandi and other various centuries-old carols with 'nouveau' jazz effects just isn't appealing. The vocal soloists on a couple of the tracks are pretty bad too. Anyhow, I highly recommend Nadja's other recordings. Not this one, though.

It has a pretty thin plot, not especially interesting characters, and the writing style is fairly dull. If I weren't stuck on a transcontinental plane ride, I don't think I would have bothered to read it through."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shake my head...","review":"as I try to understand what all the rave reviews are about this book. I literally had to force myself to read it thinking I must be missing something or that that something will come along eventually and make me say, \\"Great book, great story!!\\" NOT!! I found this story to be very non-engaging and no where near the page turner I thought it was going to be. I was glad when it was over but then am forcing myself to read another Lehane book just to make sure I'm not being over reactive. I did not enjoy this book, or the writing, the characters were annoying. Oh well... I guess I can give it one star for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book That Introduces A Great Series","review":"This first novel in the Patrick Kenzie/Angela Gennaro series gives the series a great start. Many novels either do not do a good job of fleshing out its characters, or take too long to do it, but Lehane succeeds where many fail by introducing Kenzie and Gennaro in a way that allows the reader to know where their relationship lies. The plot of the book itself is entertaining, but for my money, the thing that keeps me coming back to this series is the continuing development of the Kenzie/Gennaro relationship. I love how the relationship goes through peaks & valleys, instead of being a stationary entity. Not only would I recommend this book, but I recommend the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the right stuff!","review":"With the introduction of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, Dennis Lehane takes on Robert Parker in his own turf...and gives Parker a real run for his money. Kenzie and Gennaro are great macho/macho-ess characters and Bubba the animal is an inspired foil. Add to that mix a full array of Irish, blacks, politicians, and a range moral and economic lowlife created with a skilled writer's touch: it's a strong beginning to a series of mystery novels. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improper Bostonians","review":"My next key-strokes after finishing this review will be to order the other Lehanes. This is his first. A crooked hypocritical Massachussets politician hires Patrick Kenzie to look for a cleaning woman who has disappeared. Kenzie is an idealistic but cynical child abuse survivor, divorced, crossed in love,hard-drinking, and torn between his liberal convictions and the harsh realities of crime. Boston is vividly described.It is a page-turner but is not light entertainment and is somewhat depressing.I'd recommend it for a long flight rather than beach or bed reading. The humor is sardonic and bitter, and there are seriously treated themes of racism,and corruption. Many violent and horrible deaths are graphically described. Children are tortured and sodomized. Policemen are emotionally burnt-out and alcoholic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Lehane novel","review":"I was first introduced to Lehane in his book Gone Baby Gone and then read Prayers For Rain. He was so good I decided to see what he had written previously. I thought A Drink Before The War and Sacred were as good if not better than his two newest books. If you like yhis gendre A Drink Before The War and Sacred are a must Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"uses every over used hard boiled detective cliche there is","review":"my title says it all ... 5 cliches per page minimum and pretty much every cliched character to ever grace this genre .... which isn't a bad thing except that here it takes a simple story and triples its size and i got tired of it. the good guys ... patrick and angie ... continuously do dumb things that put them in terrrrible situations but there is no drama since it is clear that the bad guys will screw up and our heroes will come out clean. no, this is not great writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read......Great Story","review":"I must say that I enjoyed how Lehane made his characters so down to earth. That is what made that book. The plot is soild and with the colorful characters it adds such an outstanding twist to the book. I felt as if I could have sat down with Patrick Kenzie and had a beer..lol.Kenzie and his partner Angela Gennaro are private investators, hired by a senator to find a cleaning woman. Lehane did a masterful job in adding new drama and a by adding a sexual tension between Kenzie and Gennaro(whom herself has her own problems). I am looking forward to reading more from these to, Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is gifted!","review":"I started in the middle of the series then went back to the beginning, which helps. What a good writer he is! All the characters (and they are characters) in his books are well described and their interactions are superb. Love Bubba! The mysteries are all good and the relationships are poignant. The aura of Boston neighborhoods were vivid. I read all of them except Mystic River. I am sure it is good, but I am not up to that yet. Well done, Dennis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"If I had read Lehanes's books in the order that they were written, I would never have continued beyond this first effort. His stories never tap dance around the darkness and decay that is increasingly closer to the surface of civility but this was too bleak to recommend to anyone. While it is true that every person is capable of both great goodness and great evil, life is cheap and violence the way of much of the world, this seemed too far over the edge for even a cynical realist like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I hate be the lone dissenter here, but I honestly hated this book and cannot figure out why it is so highly praised. The storyline is boring, the characters are one-dimensional, unrealistic and annoying, and the violence in this book is overwhelming. Gruesome shootings and beatings occur at regular intervals, and one particularly awful torture scene is enough to turn one's stomach. It seems like the author, instead of wanting to write a decent story with realistic and engaging dialogue, instead decided that it would be much easier to simply pen scenes where everyone gets blown to smithereens, while our heroic duo emerge with barely a scratch. And yes, I do realize the book centers around gang warfare, but all the guns, snipers and grenades seemed a bit much a times. Perhaps I'm naive.I'm certainly glad that I checked this book out at the library and did not waste money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm in the minority....","review":"....because I didn't really care for this book. Although it's a somewhat fast read, it felt like it took forever to get through it because the story was unoriginal and uninteresting.Dennis Lehane knows how to write a good sentence, but all of those sentences didn't amount to much in this book. Honestly, I thought the story was quite boring and although I desperately wanted to get into it, I couldn't. The story was plodding and the book was filled with so much extra filler that it seemingly could have been cut in half.Cliches and stereotypes abound and it felt like Lehane used them to makeup for his lack of \\"street\\" knowledge. It was like watching a poorly made TV show or a made-for-TV movie on USA.I'm forced to scratch my head to figure out why so many people have favorable reviews for this book. I thought it was pedestrian and bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy little novel","review":"Boy, I don't know where to start... I picked this up as an alternative to 'The Given Day' which came highly recommended. I didn't have time to finish the 600 page novel so tried 'A Drink' instead. I didn't like it at all. A hackneyed tale of racist Boston area thugs and druggies abusing and killing each other... The characters were typical; the writing childish; the story line silly. If they ever make a movie out of this novel it should be set in Mexico where a very REAL and SCARY drug war is happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a taste.","review":"Start here and let Lehane take you on a thrill ride you won't want to get off. I dare anyone to read just one of his books, once bitten, you're hooked! This, the first in his Kenzie/Gennaro stories sets up characters and personalities you'll want to spend your evenings with. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Read Just One","review":"Wow! If you decide to read this book, and you should, I recommend that you immediately purchase all five Kenzie/Gennaro books by Dennis Lehane. You will not be able to put them down until you've finished the entire series, and then you'll wish there were more. Lehane's dialogue is crisp and clever; his plots though dark are always hopeful and well crafted. Ultimately its the relationship between the protagonists that makes this novel unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I first read Dennis Lehane in Gone Baby Gone recommended to me by a book shop in Martha's Vineyard. I immediately bought his next book Prayers for Rain, and recommend both highly. While in Prague over Xmas, and out of books, I found a shop that sold a few dated English books, A Drink before The War was unexpectedly superb. When I returned to the US I immediately bought Sacred and, Darkness, Take My Hand. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denis Lehane at his best","review":"Mr Lehane is simply one of the best roman noir writers out there, no contest. A drink before the war is the first in his Kenzie/Gennaro series and also one of the best. It's witty, dark and such a ride to read. I put his books way up at the top of my absolutely must read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy, unlikeable hero","review":"This book, as others have said, is quite a bit preachy-- but not high and mighty, holier-than-thou preachy, but the world sucks and we're all going to hell-in-a-hand-basket preachy. So defeatist and negative --no hope whatsoever. I can't figure why the main character doesn't just shoot himself in the head and put us all out of his misery -- the book is written first person and all the demoralized, defeatist soap-box preaching is really just the internal thoughts of the main character. The guy is sad -- but not sad enough that you actually feel for him or sympathize with him. In fact, he's not likeable at all, even though he tries to undo a great injustice. If you're looking for a likeable detective who's righting wrong, I'd recommend the Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais heads and tails above this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Introduction to Kenzie & Angie","review":"Having already read later Lehane novels, this was an incredible introduction to the characters and an intriguing story weaving Boston politics and gangs. It is so much more than a mystery or thriller--Lehane really makes you care about all of the characters--including Bubba!The violence has repercussions--Patrick and Angie do what is necessary but not without being haunted by their actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Went Out and Bought 4 More","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Even with books I like these days I feel a certain distance between the characters and the reader. In this one I really liked the gang and wanted to get to know them better. I especially like the protaganist, he is a lot of fun, warts and all. I am glad the female lead drops her rotten hubby as the series progresses. That sad relationship just didn't seem to fit with the general mood. I can't wait to read the others. I think the South Florida/Key West genre has ran out of ideas and interesting tales but I am finding a couple of series that have stepped in to fill the void. This is one of them. Give it a try. I don't grade on a curve, 4 stars is a very good book to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous first novel!","review":"Dennis Lehane has given the PI genre a much needed shot in the arm with A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR, the first book of the Kenzie/Gennaro series. A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR reads like hip film noir, the characters of Patrick and Angie are both likeable and believable and manage to hold on to their morality despite dealing with Boston's lowest thugs. This book is just terrific...don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOPE, NOPE---DIDN'T LIKE IT","review":"There were some things wrong with this book. First, did the authorwrite this while standing at a pulpit??? One sermon after another afteranother. The whole KENSIE / GENNARO thing got tiring. And the dialogue was?? supposed ?? to be witty / funny, , , it was not !!Might be, , , the author was trying for a SPENSER kinda thing, , ,it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"After finishing the book, and not really enjoying it at all, I read the amazon reviews. All of the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews are spot on and no need to repeat those criticisms again. But I will say, it was particularly annoying to have the author \\"explain\\" the book to you in the last few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Heavy-Duty Enough","review":"Not strong enough. Bent the very first day. I've since learned you need a training wheel that is reinforced with another bar that makes a triangle and does not allow the main bar to flare out. These were a piece of junk and certainly no better than you can buy at the big box stores. Wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Understand","review":"This book was assigned to me in a History class in college... I expected it to be fairly interesting, as the Holocaust is certainly worth studying, and this book has a good reputation.I think I can speak for my fellow students, as well as myself. What's all the hype? This book was one of the dryest works I've ever been assigned in school, and I struggled to finish it. Levi seems to offer nothing new on the topic, and in fact seems to get lost in half-remembered, or at least half-told, stories of his times in the camps that illuminated nothing.Despite Levi's supposed \\"respect\\" for each individual word, I cannot say that a single one in this book left me with any deeper understanding of the concentration camps or his struggles. And in saying this, I do not mean to belittle his experience, because I can only imagine what it was like.Unfortunately, this book didn't bring me any close to that imagining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"This is the most thought-provoking and informative book I've ever read about life in the Death Camps. Levi's honesty and compassion are on every page. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Based Parenting","review":"Amazing. I have read a number of parenting books and this one is by far the most helpful, the most hopeful. I have already shared my amazement of this book with my friends and also with other new moms and moms groups. How would anyone parent without this grace based perspective? This book has caused me to reflect on my own childhood as well as clarify the way I would like to raise our children. Kids are all different and we cannot parent them on a basis of fear. I am very grateful for Dr. Tim Kimmel and his willingness to share this hopeful and helpful perspective on parenting. If you are a parent or have ever been a parent, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT parenting book","review":"This needs to be on your parenting shelf and shared with all your friends! It will make you rethink discipline and how you rear your children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Perspective","review":"We heard Tim Kimmel at Pine Cove Family camp and knew it was about Grace Based Parenting. My first thought was no discipline, unruly kids. BOY WAS I WRONG. Grace based parenting is all about showing our kiddos grace like our Father shows us Grace. Whew...this is harder then just punishment but matters of the heart, and really dealing with the issues that are going inside them rather then behavior problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Reading-Great Book!","review":"I am still in the process of reading this book, but from what I have read so far, it is a great book and resource for Parenting. I look forward to putting what I have read so far, into practice. This book as is much for the Parent's relationship with God, as it is for the Parent's relationship with the children. Shows how GRACE can change lives and relationships, and how it is the best way to Parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible concept I never paid much attention to before","review":"i loved the book. it's helped me so much parenting my 6 year old son. thank God for grace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Bible?","review":"Seems like the author used verses to back up his own ideas and claiming it's a Biblical perspective. Not much practical advice is included and the book seems to stem from the authors own bad parenting experience. Skip this book...waste of time. Some of our church members started claiming their parenting by it and soon realized there is no one book that covers parenting better than the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"This book has really great info. It is Bible-based parenting instruction without being too literal, taking into account we are in the 21st century but still honoring God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it so far","review":"I haven't finished reading the whole book, but I like what I have read so far. This is not one of those books that tells you how to deal with misbehaviors like I thought it would be, but it is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot compete with the many great recordings out there","review":"I feel that one cannot have too many versions of the Bach Cello Suites because each performer brings a unique sound and interpretation to these wonderful pieces, so I am always on the lookout for any new ones. This one by Martin Zeller (volume one only) just cannot compete with the likes of Queyras, Klinger, Isserlis, Wispelwey, Pergamenschikov, Mork, Thedeen or the legendary Casals. His tempos are too agogic and the microphone sounds as if it was placed inside his cello (way too close). Most importantly, there's not much poetry here. I won't be looking out for volume 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I got this disc, excited to that I could replace CD's I'd lost at one fell swoop. I was sorely disappointed. Torien's voice isn't what it used to be; and it all sounds live, rough, and unfinished. That's fine if you want a live album, but not what I was looking for. Had I known it was re-recorded, I probably wouldn't have bought it. If you like live albums, go for it; if you're looking for the sound quality, and in particular the vocals, of the original songs, go buy the original CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good stuff","review":"It's true that these are just re-recordings and Marq's voice isn't as good as it was, but this is a great CD for those who have all the B-Boys CD's and want something new. The band sounds tight despite the barebones production and the remakes are often heavier and looser than the Templeman produced tracks of old. If you are a true Bulletboys fan then this is a must, trust me. If you are just curious by hearsay, then pick up the self titled CD first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a comeback album","review":"Don't get me wrong, I've liked the Bulletboys since I first saw their video for \\"Smooth Up In Ya\\" in 1988 on MTV. But this album is poorly done. Why not just make a compilation of greatest hits and be done with it? The songs do not sound the same as Torien's voice has gone to crap, and the music itself sounds like it was done in an oversized trashcan.I'd suggest to others not to buy this album, and instead purchase a good one like \\"Freak Show\\" or their self-titled masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cheap music","review":"You cant beat the price of this album and the amount of song selections. Everything from Hedningarna to Wimme, Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track 2 - \\"Toadeater\\" is worth the entire CD and more.","review":"I am a complete novice to this style of music (Nordic), although I have a distinct international taste.I heard \\"Toadeater\\" (track 2) on a Georgia University station (88.5) and knew I had to buy the album. I was not disappointed. This is the most interesting music I have heard since \\"Muqabala\\" or \\"Ipi Tombi\\"...My kids call track 12 \\"the pagan song.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"hardcore folk","review":"I bought this but was disappointed to find it was focussed entirely on down-to-the-bone hardcore folk. Some tracks are pretty harsh on the ear and overall there is not much variety of sound. However I do recommend the 3CDBeginner's Guide to Scandinaviawhich presents a much broader variety of styles and artists and countries! It has one disc devoted to folk & roots which is fantastic. The other two discs also have a strong folk flavour. As a whole, it's the perfect introduction to the music of the Nordic world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Transaction","review":"Product arrived in time for a Swedish dinner that I was throwing.

About little less than a month ago I gave this one 4 STARS. It deserves nowhere near that many. I've since listened to more of the BBD catalogue and can safely say that this is easily the worst album these guys ever released. The only real standout is 'Adventures' and even that one can be bland. 'Rocket Cathedrals' and the title track are two of the STUPIDEST songs I've ever heard! Pathetic attempts at 'rocking out' by then-amateurs. There's nothing original or unique on this album; Nelson (thankfully) saved that for the later albums. Save your money on this and buy Sunburst Finish, Futurama, and Live in the Air Age instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature debut.","review":"This is by far the weakest effort within the brilliant Be Bop Deluxe catologue. At this point, in his career Bill Nelson had yet to develop an original style and voice. This \\"glam\\" recording pays homage to Ziggy era Bowie, at the cost of surrendering originality.

We were deeply saddened and disturbed to find that God's Holy Word had been placed within the pages of such immature chatter.Our society has become so dependent upon the visually stimulating that now even Christians aren't satisfied with the pure Words of the Bible without being entertained and pampered while reading it.It's not our place to attempt to \\"bring God down to the level of the world.\\" God is God and He is holy and just. When we try to paste beads, feathers...or fashion models on the sufficient Word of God, then we make a mockery of His power and the purity of His Word.

When I got this New Testament version of Becoming I found it much easier to read. I've made a goal to read the entire Bible starting with using Becoming. It's much easier to understand and apply to my life with the examples given throughout the text. By no means does it stray from traditional scripture, it just makes it an easier read by using fun facts, modern day stories, and other things that are interesting. I'd highly recommend getting this, or any other version of the Bible put out by the company for yourself, family, or friends.

Recently I was looking for something fun to re-energize my desire to spend time reading the bible and I remembered Biblezines. It was so worth it! They are inexpensive and really fun. Since it looks like a regular magazine I feel really comfortable tucking it into my purse and taking it to work with me (...I don't mind bringing my regular bible, but the Biblezine has the plus of a totally casual/cool persona!). I am in my early/mid 30s and I bought the original \\"becoming\\" version. It seems to fit my life stage well, but I'm sure it would have in my early 20s, too-- the fun little extras are about being a woman, not a \\"mommy\\".

Definitely worth the purchase :)","review":"If you know of anyone that has a hard time reading the bible or understanding the verbiage this is the perfect book. It is NOT a fashion magazine like a past review stated. (Apparently she did not even read any of the articles in this magazine.) This magazine is the New Testament in its entirety. It adds a very positive and encouraging view about the importance of reading God's word everyday. This \\"magazine\\" helps explain the time period for why things were written and even explains to you \\"What's the Point\\" of a certain passage or chapter in the Bible. It also compares the Old Testament with the New Testament and gives you points on how to apply that to today. I hope they come out with an Old Testament version of the bible soon.

Both books provide TONS of resources but you will need time to sift through them to determine your eligbility. However the books are HUGE let downs in that they have duplicate information, not only on the pages of each book itself, but both of them carry identical programs or information. They simply changed the print and layout of the books. My best advice is to buy whichever of Mr. Lesko's books you beleive is best suited to your own situation, and save your money, don't purchase any others. You will only get repeat information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Although I fit the catagory of being a \\"busy mom\\", I had a very hard time finding anything in this book that I could benefit from.

For people in that situation, this book would be a wonderful resource - and is well researched. Between the asssistance for low-income families, senior citizens, those seeking lovers and cheap abortions I found little I could apply to my life. The book also could be organized better.

In this \\"sequel\\" the author chooses to discard or ignore characters from the first novel, and instead focuses on extremely unrealistic magic. It almost made me ill to see such wonderful characters brought so low. And be warned: it was written to allow for at least one more book. I certainly will not read another book based on this rubbish. (I will however read River God again. And again.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warlock:Wilbur Smith","review":"Having read and enjoyed almost all of Wilbur Smith's adventure stories, I must confess that his latest proved to be disappointing. Sustained, almost unbearable suspense, and excellent historical material has contributed to the success of all of the many books I've read by him. The author failed to keep up the excitement and interest about halfway through. Although Smith has always included violence, it has been appropriately used. Here, I'm afraid, it was overdone to the extreme. The action was slow and, at times, boring. I'm sorry to see one of my favorite adventure authors lose the touch by trying to revive a sequel to a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible & Graphic Perversion","review":"Never even finished the book. I made it through the first half and was so disgusted with the graphic violence, torture,* etc. that I had no desire to read on. The story was alright, though slow moving. If you have any aversion to the above mentioned, don't waste your time or money. I'll never consider another Wilbur Smith book after my experience with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"certainly not his best work","review":"he likes to write long books, but this one is too much. The magic is too much, the boring conversation is too much & the constant references to an aging eunuch are especially too much.His series on the Ballyntynes is much better in all regards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, stank, stunk","review":"River God ranks on my list of all time favorite novels. But Warlock is not only a bad book - it cheapens the legacy Smith created in River God and Seventh Scroll.Several errors of judgement have been made in crafting this novel. River God, through it's first person narrative, and the conceit of being an epic translated from ancient scrolls had truly mythic depth. It completely worked, and arrogant as Taita was, he was also deeply endearing. Warlock's 3rd person narrative never comes together, and makes Taita both irritating and unsympathetic as a character. As well, making Taita a caster of magic spells actually takes away from the magic that existed in River God. Wilbur Smith has no clue how to write fantasy.A sad addition to what was a brilliant pair of novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could a book with this premise be SOOO boring? Read on!","review":"Is it possible to write a potboiler about sex and conquest in Ancient Egypt and have it be boring? This book eloquently demonstrates how possible this is.I was stupid enough to take this tome on a cruise where there was little else to read and sheer desperation for something to read carried me through to page 400(of the 641 pages) before I abandoned it in favor of playing shuffleboard.This tome combines a trivial amount of plot with an overwhelming amount of poorly presented and over-described 'graphic' detail (the sex is of the 'she caressed his bulging manhood' variety and the blood and gore, whilst plentiful, is similarly handled).The action, plot and character development could be summarized in about two pages.My summation? Even shuffleboard is more interesting. Save your money, buy something else or do something productive like cleaning out the garage instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not reach the level of previous books","review":"Wilbur Smith is one of my favourits fiction writers since 20 years ago I read Sunbird. This is, from my point of view, the worst book of Mr. Smith I've ever read.The book has the usual Mr. Smith plot: male to male solid friendship, male to woman love beyond barriers and the most evil enemies he can invent but there are too many unnecessary sex and violence scenes and the plot is not so carefully crafted as were previous novels. The Taita character is transformed from a wise person that uses his wisdom to a kind of wizzard that uses magic tricks.If you read the two previous novels of Mr. Smith Egypt trilogy (by the moment) you can safely skip this one.Is there too much editor's contract pressure?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great","review":"I bought this book for my birthday and fromthe first page I was hooked. This book is a real page turner, but I recommended for people that have read River God, only because of the characters. I love all Wilbur Smith books. I started reading them last year when I was 15. One of my mum's friends was astonished to find that I had read River God, and the Seventh Scroll, which he only just heard about, and had just started reading river god.Wilbur Smiths books are full of action adventure romance death and much much more. This book is a must for all Wilbur Smith fans, Plus anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be made into the next movie block buster","review":"I agree entirely with the reviewer below who mentioned the only reason they only gave this 4 stars, and not 5, was how it made them feel after reading it. Basically after finishing this around mid evening, I had trouble falling to sleep. The harsh reality of life in ancient Egypt is somewhat disturbing and hard to comprehend when living in todays society. But overall it was a very enjoyable experience, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone. One small point however, I did notice a few typo errors for the first time ever in reading a Wilbur Smith novel, which was a little dissapointing and not in keeping with the high standard of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read his early work","review":"Read \\"The Warlock \\" in two days. I was dissapointed. The only reason I was not utterly dissapointed is because judging from his last couple of books I have lowered my expectation significantly, and yet still I was dissapointed. To be fair, it is probably not that bad of a book.. but only if you have not read River God and Seventh Scroll. Smith reduced Taita from a clever and cunning strategist to a Harry Potter wannabe.I miss the Wilbur Smith of \\"River God\\", \\"Seventh Scroll\\", early Courtney Saga. I am sad that the same person who wrote those wonderful books is now writing Warlock and Monsoon (which is a good book by itself, but in terms of plot is nothing more than a poor imitation of his earlier work. This is the third time in the same family that there are two brothers who used to love each other and ended up as mortal enemy, the second time that the weaker brother's son is actually the illegitimate son of the stronger one )"},{"rating":"1","title":"River God meets Lord of the Rings","review":"After reading RIVER GOD, it became one of my all time favorite novels, and made me discover the great story telling capabilities of Wilbur Smith. But WARLOCK takes Taita, the wonderfully developed character from RIVER GOD, and turns him into an all powerful sorcerer. This would not have been a problem if Smith had started the series with magic in mind. One of RIVER GOD's best qualities was the realism of the characters. But all of a sudden Taita is casting spells and magical webs. On a literary note, Smith composed RIVER GOD in the 1st person, giving Taita's charcter an astounding sense of depth and believability. But WARLOCK jumps into the minds of all the characters and doesn't allow the reader to truly understand Taita. It was as if someone else wrote this novel, and Smith attached his name. The bottom line: If you enjoyed RIVER GOD, steer away from this novel, as it will disturb the wonderful story that Smith left us with his first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"rollicking good read!","review":"Ok, if you haven't read river god - read that first, and then warlock. Warlock speaks of the tale of nefer seti - Tanus' grandson. The book is fast paced, violent and terrific to read. Wilbur smith has a way with his words and paints the pictures of ancient egypt.This book is in the third person unlike River God which was like a story narrated by taita - I preferred that but it doesn't hurt the narrative in any way. The book is pretty violent, and can gross out some people. If you are squeamish about blood and torture then this book isn't for you. But if you're looking for a rollocking adventure - you shouldn't miss this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little too graphic for me","review":"I fall in the category of those turned off by the vivid descriptions of death, torture and cruelty to animals. When Mr. Smith wants to, the story could be extremely interesting. His description of a sandstorm was magnificent. His descriptions of different forms of death and violence are also magnificent, but just a big turnoff for me. A particularly gruesome chapter was the one about \\"running the red road\\". I can only assume that the \\"red road\\" is named for the amount of blood spilled along the way. I found that the only way I could finish the book was to skip all the parts where he started describing war strategy and skimming the really bloody parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"What happened to the magic of River God and the suspense and intrigue of The Seventh Scroll? Reading this book was like watching paint dry. Wilbur's heart and passion in not to be found in his latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Let Down","review":"River Gods is one of my all time favorite books - first I read the book and then I listened to it on tape. The Seventh Scroll was okay, but I am more interested in stories staged in ancient Egypt so when I heard that Wilbur Smith had released Worlock I couldn't wait to read it. What a let down! The character of Taita was the staple of River Gods - you felt his pain and you cheered for him - he was strong, smart & clever, yet very human. In Worlock Taita is a wizard of sorts - and not a very deep one at that. It is not that I am against tales of scorcery, it is just that Taita was such a fantastic character \\"as is\\" - he doesn't need all that mumbo-jumbo. I also felt there was too much war and fighting with too predicatable outcomes. I would like to have seen a little more behind the scene storylines and more clever and cunning acts by Taita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn off.","review":"I'm relieved to see I'm not the only one disappointed in Warlock, because it's only the second Wilbur Smith I've read, and the other was much better. I was very uncomfortable with the soft porn relating to children in Warlock, which was completely unnecessary, and also the description of the suffering of animals. I actually found myself covering up the offensive text with a pen as I went so that nobody else would have to see it. Mr. Smith's descriptive talent was used much more effectively in Sunbird. I'm relieved that Warlock is the exception, rather than Sunbird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear oh Dear...","review":"I expected more from this writer than the fetishism and objectificaton of race and gender I have just had to endure to complete this novel. Historical inaccuracies aside, I counted no less than 20 different examples of blatant racism and representations of otherness that frankly,have no place in a book by a writer of Wilbur Smiths supposed calibre.This novel reads like the Orientalist rantings of an aging Imperialist!.Incongruous inclusions of bestiality (p.200),peodophilia(p.146 young breasts in first bud like ripened mulberries..soft fluff etc etc),bodification(p.143) and blatant rascism throughout(note esp the black Nubian slaves with big oiled genitals..)tsk tsk..C'mon Mr Smith, surely just because the story is set 3000 years ago doesn't mean such reductionism and misogyny is acceptable? Deeply disappointing read,especially as the action scenes are fantastic and detail of the country near perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak story full of Smith's sexual fantasies","review":"I hate novels where authors take a plot with interesting possibilities and ruin it with mind vomit. Literary license does not include dumping every boring fantasy that enters your thoughts. There's so much focus on sex that he wastes the reader's time with it. Smith is busted to private for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"I loved this book. I spent all summer reading it when I was supposed to do my required reading of A Tale of Two Cities and A Raisin in the Sun for school. I couldn't put down Warlock because the other two couldn't hold a candle to Warlock! I enjoyed the new characters and the great plot. It was just as good as River God, even though Warlock is more graphic. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilbur is losing it.","review":"As one who has read all of Wilbur Smith's novels through the years, this one is a real disappointment. Most of Smiths novels weave a great story, while giving us insight into Africa, it's history, culture and traditions. Warlock, unfortunately, doesn't come close to doing this. Instead, it reads like some kind of teenybopper romance novel, filled with gore and sexual escapades. There is little suspense and you can usually see the story unfolding pages ahead...."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor picture quality","review":"Small dots appeared on the screen that looked like bad pixels.

I put off purchasing this book many times because although I like true crime, I am really not enthusiastic about reading stories where innocent babies are murdered, by their own mother nonetheless. It was pitiful the way this woman snuffed out the lives of her innocent children, and for no obvious reason. Hard to believe that when her babies were dying one by one in the 1960's, no one thought it peculiar. If this were happening to someone I know now, I would certainly think something was up. This woman makes you very angry. Being in her seventies now, her age seems to have played a part in her punishment. I have no pity for her, 27 or 70, it makes no difference. She is a murderer, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marie Noe should be in prison!","review":"I don't think I'm alone when I say that Marie Noe got away with a mother's most unthinkable crime, killing 8 of her 10 children without anybody ever detecting something the matter with this sick woman. Of course, there is some strange sympathy for mothers who kill their children. Marie's case is no exception. She is living with a slap on the wrist while her eight children are buried. I feel sympathetic toward her husband because I can't imagine how he handled Marie's crimes. There were signs all along and suspicions but nothing until it was way too late. Marie is living not in a prison but at home. I can't imagine a crime murder more disturbing than a mother killing her children. The book does give an explanation as to why she probably did it. There are no easy explanations because Marie Noe is a very ill person and that's probably why her husband stays with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important & underrated study of human nature & sociability.","review":"Illustrating the necessity of social behavior as a means of survival, Kropotkin traces social interaction of from that of insects, through larger animals, primitive humans, barbarians, the Middle Ages, and modern man.

What's worse is that the play has been modified with a happy 1940s ending in which Emily Webb wakes up from a Patrick Duffy in DALLAS-style dream and doesn't really die. The play is about mortality and the understanding of each day as a gift by understanding that we all will die. Contrary to popular belief the play is a very unsentimental wake up call to live each day fully because we really \\"don't have time to look at one another.\\" The movie was the best it could be for its time, but I urge you to just go see your local theatre do the play and get the full experience of the un-modified script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Town","review":"The quality of this movie is very poor.

I had seen the play with Robbie Benson on TV so I wanted to see how this older version compared. Well, they changed the ending in this version which spoils the whole point of the story. So if you have not seen any version, stop reading this review. Anyway, Emily doesn't die in this version. It's a dream. The whole point of this great Thornton Wilder play (I read it in high school, too.) is that people don't appreciate life, they don't stop and smell the roses. They don't savor every moment of their lives. It's not really a happy ending since one of the main characters dies young, but the play is supposed to make you think and look at your life and enjoy every precious moment. I think since Emily doesn't die in this version, it lessens the effectiveness of the message of the play. Find another version that is true to the original is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drat","review":"I could not believe that anyone would have the right to change the ending of the wonderful play \\"Our Town!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Track","review":"The audio of this DVD is muddy, bassy, boomy, from the bottom of a well.

I would reccomend him to anyone regardless regardless if you understand spanish ot not. He us my favorite singer. All of his songs are fantastic. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky music, tipical and overused sound, melodies, and production.","review":"His voice is unbearable, and the choice of songs is truly hideous. If you like typical Latin Pop with no soul or reason to be other than commercialism, if you like Da Buzz, Britney Spears, Thalia, and so on, give this a shot, as it is as empty and I HAVE TO ADMIT - FUN, as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miami Sound Manchine Discovers Andalusia!","review":"Operacion Triunfo's baby, Bisbal builds upon his screen charm to pose as an artist. He believes, and the record company as well, that canned music is just what music is all about. His voice, an immitation of Luis Miguel --hero or not-- is not as potent as the first. (Hopefully, David does learn how to find his own style as LuisMi did. Who can forget 'Directo al corazon'?)The labeled 'dance' numbers, are just an uptempo song with all the dated regalia of Miami. There is more bounce in his curls, than actually on the dance floor. His balads, are weak in meaning and execution, and the attempts at colouring them with Spanish guitars are not at all congruent. I have heard Gypsies beg for money at the Avenida de Hercules, than what he claims to represent. Spanish by nationality only, but never moves beyond being a payo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Music","review":"I love the first cd and the bonus dvd was phenomenal. This cd however is very different in so many ways. it is brilliantly produced, david's voice has grown into a mature artist and i love the direction that he has taken...he takes me where he is with his music. Thank you for an intelligent musical experience...keep it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a great album! It's equally divided between ballads and dance music. Bisbal's distinctive blend of his native music from Southern Spain with pop and salsa is addictive. His ballads are mature and memorable, and his upbeat songs will have the stiffest dancers swinging. Every selection is a hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've been waiting for it but wait longer","review":"This is a great opportunity for those of you who like to hear some live recordings of the Sex Pistols with Sid Vicious but you're going to be dissapointed. The first disc is a compilation of studio recordings, a few of them are from Nevermind the Bollock's but some of them from older recordings and also a new version of Submission. There are also some excerpt from a radio interview in San Francisco. The second disc is of course, the Winterland Concert of January 14, 1978. Unfortunately, God Save the Queen is cut and all the dialogues with the audience too. Rotten wasn't in good shape that night and with all that's missing, it isn't worth it. I expect better from the Sex Files I."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"Ok lets start off by saying I love SYFY but only if the acting is good, and OMG my nephews act better than these people( note i didn't call them actors).

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $1.99 back!","review":"This movie is terrible. A big hint is the overly long monologue at the start, which I found hard to follow. The acting is terrible, so bad that I thought that I, with not 1 minute of acting experience, could have done a better job. The action and plot is so stupid, I could not even watch it all the way through. Avoid this, it is definitely not worth the rental price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund Please!","review":"OMG!

It's healthy too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Goods","review":"I purchased this item several times, and at first the product was well within its expiration date and tasty. On the last order, however, the product was shipped AFTER its expiration date and was stale and inedible. Very disappointing inattention to detail and I had to throw away the entire shipment. Won't be ordering food products from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearing expiration","review":"I really expected to like these from the description and ingredients, but it turns out that they're not all that great. They're too sweet (and I'm the kind of person who usually likes sweet trail mix) and the peanut-butter candies have a strange taste. Also, they were only about a month away from the expiration date when I received them. Overall, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemonade anyone?","review":"This unit just died on me within three months. The charger works (I bought it separately) but I cannot hotsync anymore - what's the point of having a iPAQ that does not sync? It's either the connector to the cradle or the connector to the base of the handheld that's not connecting. For the high $$$ that I had to pay for this flimsy product, it's really a pity that HP will not provide a good product. It's poor design makes the iPAQ rock back and forth without a firm connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended as a textbook","review":"We used this as the textbook for a graduate course I took last fall semester (Fall, 2003) on multiple scales and singular perturbation methods. What a mistake. It is impossible to learn the subject from this book. In the course we started with regular expansions, which is part of Chapter 1. The style of presentation is: here is a complicated problem and so let's assume this expansion. This is made worse by the use of hard to read notation (superscripts on top of superscripts, the overuse of * and + in the super-superscript position, etc). Moreover there is little explanation as to why choices are made and this made doing homework very difficult. It was fortunate we were able to find other books that did explain how to use perturbation methods otherwise many of us would have dropped the course. I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Perturbations","review":"This is an expanded version of an earlier text by the second author (Cole). The latter was clearly written, to the point, and a useful resource. The same cannot be said of this book. It obscures the ideas underlying perturbation methods with excessive detail on problems of marginal interest. It also, oddly, fails to adequately explain a fundamental method such as multiple scales. Their explanation of how and why scales are selected misses the point completely. This is odd as the authors made contributions to the early development of this method and, as pointed out by the other reviewer, this is the main focus of the book. I would not recommend this book, even as a second or third text on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever you do, get this book & read it!","review":"I have read a bunch of other reviews on this site & I cannot add much. \\"Four Arguments\\" is simply excellent and fascinating. Get it. Read it. Buy a copy for each of your friends. It has totally changed the way I view and think about television. Check out his other books: \\"The Case Against the Global Economy\\" (a collection of essays by Mander & other great writers and thinkers) and \\"In the Absense of the Sacred.\\" Both are very, very good. And while you're at it, get yourself a copy of E.F. Schumacher's \\"Small is Beautiful.\\" Look for books by people like Jeremy Rifkin & Kirkpatrick Sale too. If we want a better, saner world we have to begin by educating ourselves. We must train our minds to look beyond the hype and BS. The truth is out there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mander's Arguments More Relevant Than Ever","review":"Yes, we seem to agree that his arguments against TV are valid, true, and not merely thought provoking, but action provoking. However, also bear in mind that we are coming into an age where everyone is staring at a computer monitor. If you read this book and think of the now and tomorrow, you come to realize that we are falling dangerously close to worshipping artificial light. Where else can we apply Mander's arguments? The workplace, the education system, home, government . . the list goes on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"If capitalism means blind acceptance ...","review":"If capitalism means we should blindly accept everything that's put up for our consumption, then this book is anti-capitalist.Mander's analysis of the mediated experience is especially valuable. It is a good perspective for examining everything we do to try to understand our world and enjoy ourselves. That is, do we accept a pre-chewed reality that somebody sells to us, or do we discover it for ourselves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"APOLOGIES FOR ENTERING A 2nd COMMENT","review":"The reviewer \\"thecodingmonkey\\" says in her review below that she depends on the TV to keep her children quiet.My wife's sister Helen also uses the TV to baby-sit her children. At age 11, her oldest boy Edward was diagnosed as dyslexic.After examinations and tests, they found there was nothing physically wrong with him. It turned out that his dyslexia was induced. He had watched so much TV that the part of his brain that processes written words and sentences had not developed.Edward's years from ages 12 through 15 were awful because he had to learn to read and write while his classmates zoomed ahead of him.PS. This happened 10 years ago, and Helen is still using the TV as a control device to keep her younger kids quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television","review":"This book will forever change how you view television. He persuasively makes you ponder aspects of t.v. viewing that are so accurate and yet often ignored in our t.v worshipping culture. His words will strike a cord in all those people who feel like zombies while watching t.v., but continue anyway and berate themsleves for the addiction. If you aren't persuaded to stop watching all television after you read this book, you never wanted to to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"TURN OFF THE TUBE","review":"An intresting look into the history of the t.v. and advertising.

Unfortunately this 350 page book is a complete waste of time.From the title I expected to see Four ARGUMENTS. Instead each argument turned out to be nothing more than pointless rants.After drudging through the first two sections, I really had my hopes up for the third, \\"Effects of Television on the Human Being.\\" Again, I was sadly mistaken. I found myself laughing out loud as the author dictates his adventures in researching this topic only to find out that there is no evidence relating to TV!Don't get me wrong TV [is bad], but this is definitely not the book to reaffirm you're beliefs or ARGUE for the removal of television. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissenting voice: it's not REALLY about television","review":"Jerry Mander has a lot of convincing arguments in this book. However, most of them are not really about the harmfulness of TV. The real title of this book should be _Four Arguments for the Elimination of Capitalism_. Most of the specific anti-TV arguments are spurious and fantastic. I hear that David Bianculli's _Teleliteracy_ presents the other side effectively (unfortunately, it's out of print)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Mander","review":"Although I read this book many years ago, I referred to it when I wrote my recently published book, HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD by Joseph Francione. In fact, it is listed in the bibliography. Mr. Mander got me thinking about things that led to my taking a more active approach to every facet of my life from what I view on TV to how I think about what I view. If you read this book and agree with his central thesis, you might want to check out my book. I look at more than just this one issue. Great job Mr. Mander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes one want to sue the author for the wasted time","review":"Despite its promising title and back cover content, this book is worthy of a Fox TV special. The so-called four arguments are sloppy and incoherent and whenever the author calls upon \\"real research\\" to make his case, he ends up abusing science and exposing his complete scientific illiteracy (the section on light \\"emanations\\" is especially poor). His socio-political arguments border on the extreme and in many cases take a dip into paranoia (e.g. positing that TV conditions for \\"autocratic control\\"). At the occasional point where the author was on the verge of making a very good point, he ruins it by going beyond what his premises warrant and into the pit of unqualified speculation. Overall, this book is saddening to read not only for what it is, but also for what it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, shallow book","review":"It actually presents many examples of lousy television. It presents no arguments or compelling facts that indicate television should be eliminated. The title is great, the arguments are poor to non-existent. Should TV be done better? Sure. Would it be helpful to put the emphasis on quality instead of profit? Sure. Eliminated? This book isn't going to convert anybody but may be comforting to people who already feel that way.

While I agree that there are alot of problems with watching television the arguements he gave were insane. Half of the book didn't appear to have anything to do with television. He blames things such as people commiting crimes and mental health problems to watching television. He also said something about people substituting telelvision light for real, natural light. He also talks about evolution and, as a christian, I don't buy into that and don't want to read a book that teaches that as a fact. It's definately a book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eliminating television, thought provoking","review":"i bought this book due to a reference to chapter 9 about \\"ingestion of artificial light\\" (from an astronomer friend). however, as i read through the rest of the book, i got hooked.i agree with one poster, some arguements against TV are in reality an arguement against capitalism. however, i grew up with 3-4 hours of TV per day, and as i think back through my childhood, and performance in school (high school and college) i can apply much of what mander says to my problems back then (lack of attention, lack of motivation, poor grades), and can even see remnants of the effects today (at 33 years).the logic is not bullet proof here but test some of mander's theories with your childer and i think you'll see some truth. TV truly is a wasteland, and i think \\"quality television\\" is really an oxymoron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectual View Of The Idiot Box","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Everyone who owns a television set should read this book. (Except maybe Ted Turner)After I finished the book and watched TV, I started looking at what Jerry brought up in the book, instead of what was actually on the screen. Everything fell into place.This book may have been published 30 years ago, but everything he says is applicable in today's television reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superlative work","review":"I bought this book decades ago, and continue to read and recommend it.

Attempting to follow the instructions I quickly realized Carr's measurements were wrong. I did my own measuring and found the correct measurements and had no problem after that. Sent Carr an e-mail about the wrong measurements, but never heard back. I also called and talked to the mexican kid that puts them on for them and he said he hadn't seen a 2012 Sierra yet, which was probably the problem. Anyway, now that they are on they are sturdy and look nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fords: A personal look","review":"The uniqueness of this book is that it focuses on the personalities of Henry Ford, his son Edsel and his granson, Henry II. The history of Ford Motor Company is presented as an outgrowth of these porsonalities. As a career Ford employee, it is my opinion that Ford Motor Co. has always reflected the personalities of those in charge to a somewhat greater extent than other large corporations. So the author's approach is particularly appropriate. And it works well. This is an absorbing book for anyone with an interest in the Ford family in relation to the growth and decline of Ford Motor Company and, motre widely, the business in the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT music","review":"I bought this CD and love it.

The majority of the songs on this CD are remixed to sound more \\"electric\\", I guess so they'll sound more palatable to folks who only know his music from his mid- to late-80s phase. Classic songs like \\"Clues\\" and \\"Sneakin' Sally...\\" should not be tampered with. Don't be fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many remixes","review":"I bought this CD for the older tracks such as Johnny and Mary and Clues not the newer tired hits.To my disapointment, it sounds as if these tracks and others have been remixed.

He moves like he drank too much Red Bull. At least Bigfoot movies from years ago that were bad, tried to have a story that kept your interest.

Upon reading some reviews of others on Youtube and Amazon, I see that the movie also starred a couple of youtube video reviewers by the name of MJ Kelly, and Shawn Phillips. Okay, well that pretty much says it all. What normal person cast youtube personalities to star in a film? These 2 guys tried their best, which is all good and well....but you can see that they have no originality to their style. MJ Kelly has an acting style of Andy Dick and Shawn Philips, tries really hard to imitate Chris Farley. They gave it a shot, but I really dont forsee any actors in this movie, having any career.

Here on one cd, the listener hears hip hop, reggae, house, techno, and trip hop all from one group. The guest appearances from Curve's Toni Halliday and ex-Sex Pistol's frontman John Lydon assist the duo make a classic album although it is only six years old. Even Dido has listed \\"Leftism\\" as one of her favorite albums. \\"Leftism\\" would make for a perfect soundtrack to a futuristic thriller like \\"Blade Runner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great, solid dance album","review":"This is definetly a unique techno album.

Other reviewers have talked about its remarkable content. Ingeniously consistent with the matchbook-cover-art it presents are the small, square format and box-like binding. Rather than in traditional signatures, the publisher had Matchibako bound accordion style (in heavy stock), so the first part of the book is read from front to back while the second part moves from back to front. Or the pages can be spread out in a panoply, a traditional Asian style. And such a tactile delight to \\"play\\" it, just like I play my real accordion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Europe in Our Time\\" by Walter Laqueur","review":"Interested in Europe?

My daughter and her 4-year-old-cousin agree on very few things, but both have Gullah Gullah at the top of their request list. The music, songs, and dance are very engaging. The characters are very appealing and have a certain sweetness that is not often in today's children's videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big No-No!","review":"I reccomended this movie to help my younger sisters stop fighting. It didn't help because it showed two cousins named Vanessa and Shaina who were fighting in the first episode and the girls thought they were role-models. Vanessa kept saying that Shaina was copying her when she really wasn't. Anyway, the girls tried to divide the room to show each other which side of the room belonged to who. In like just a half hour later, Vanessa packs all her toys and favorite things and moves to the garage. The second episode about Binyah Binyah's parade was not a problem. I don't know what happened then, but I still do not reccomend this video to kids who are three up to the end of kindergarten. We watched this movie up until the ages of nine, eight, and seven years old and then we got rid of it, thank goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Optima 34R RedTop Battery 2003 MINI app","review":"I installed the 34R on my 2003 MINI Cooper S. It took a bit of creativity to make the battery hold-down work. The supplied adapters were not usable for this car. The terminal connectors had to be spread to fit the battery posts. I have a special set of pliers for that, but you probably don't!The installation was straightforward, but not a drop-in.The battery has amazing cranking ability!

The OPTIMA went over six hours and the car started with no problems.From now on its OPTIMA for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Battery for Mini Cooper S","review":"Fits nicely in my 2004 Mini Cooper S. Only thing to look out for is you need to manually spread the clamp for the positive terminal. Will not slide on without doing so. And of course bend the extra wire up and out of the way as the terminal is farther in on the battery than it is on the stock oem battery but that information I found all over the net. I have only had it in for a couple weeks so I cannot speak to its longevity.

Had it on a recommended trickle charger & disconnected when not in use. Vehicles charging system was confirmed as being fine. Contacted seller at Bluegrass & they were very helpful but Optima demands that I spend $50 to ship back to seller when there is a local dealer near my house. I complained to Optima, they suggested I do a 10A fast charge to resucitate , which I did, & the case split within 15 minutes even though the battery never got hot. Then they have the gall to say that a split case is not covered under warranty. The el cheepo Walmart battery I'm using as a replacement has already outperformed the Optima piece of junk.

Optima will not honor the warranty, and Amazon will not stand behind this product either. Amazon is being very dishonest by selling this battery knowing there is NO warranty.

What else on this site isn't Amazon telling you doesn't have a warranty? I have been a loyal Amazon/Prime customer for years, but not after getting off the phone with Amazon about this battery.

Amazon said it fits the 2004 Suzuki XL7, but it doesn't. I would have to make some modifications to the cables, which I might or might not do. Thinking of ordering the D35 yellow top from Blue Grass. I can tell from the picture of the D35 that the posts are closer to the edge, which means it will fit my ride. I'm very scared of Amazon's packaging. I got real lucky as there was no damage.

Aaron Naparstek transformed his own breakdown experience into a new poetic paradigm of honku,a true evolution of the Japanese haiku. For innovation and ingenuity alone, this book adds to reading lists about emotional intelligence, creativity and the evolution of possibiity. But, more than that, this gentle, easy to fit into your pocket or glove compartment book, works to make us laugh at the everyday nonsense of our lives.

Bicycling Science, 3rd edition, is that book for this decade. I originally purchased the book for the physics, specifically the stability discussions, but I absolutely love the physiology section where it seems that a well rounded and up to date review of the research literature has been included. It has truly made me a better cyclist. Thanks to the authors for writing the book and taking the time to update it 20 years after the previous edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpardonable Error","review":"Unfortunately, my copy of edition 3 fell open to page 81, in which the author compares forces from a piston engine to forces generated by living tissue. Unfortunately, this type of comparison is often completely invalid, particularly when the force is accompanied by zero motion in the direction of the force. For example, if the combustion force is replaced by a highly compressed spring, and if the crank is balanced exactly at top dead center, the spring will never \\"get tired\\" of exerting its force. In contrast, a human leg WILL get tired, even though no motion occurs. This is because chemical energy is consumed to exert the force even in the absence of motion.Unfortunately, with this single unreasoned comparison that drives to the core of bicycling science, the author has shot himself in the credibility foot, leaving all else he has to say in question."},{"rating":"2","title":"too much for me","review":"I like science.

If you build bikes and/or are a physicist or engineer and like biking then you will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This book is written in very simplistic and straightforward style. The graphic abuse is often portrayed as emotionally understated,, providing a feeling of numbness and mental withdrawal for Tasha. I hope this. book will provide support and comfort to others who are in anyway involved in sexual abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated by this book","review":"This book is a lot like A child called it which is frustrating for me because the subject matter is so serious. It is difficult to take away an enduring message when a book reads like the manuscript of a teenager.When you have a story to tell and you are not a writer, the thing to do is have someone else write it for you.I am choosing my words carefully because I don't want to diminish the importance of the subject matter.Obviously, this book was therapeutic for Matthews, but I don't know if it should have been published in its current state.As a reader, I felt the same way about Peltzer's book. As a teacher, I am torn about such heavy subject matter written on a fourth grade reading level. If the target audience is teens, that is fine. If the audience is adults, then it should be written in a more appropriate style.With subject matter like this, I'm afraid you can't have it both ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to give it 10 stars!","review":"This is a truly great book. A true eye opener, there are so many Tasha's in the world. This is a must read for anyone who has children.

I laughed and smiled and cried and cringed. Such deep emotions stirred as I read this book that at times, I had to stop reading--just to get my bearings. But I found it nearly impossible not to return to the book. Many of us can identify with Tasha, having suffered our own abuse, some worse, others less traumatic. Whichever the case, this is a must read for EVERYONE. Parents especially need to read this book and then take a good look at themselves. Child abuse needs to stop and our children need to be protected. They should never believe it's okay NOT to tell. Yes, there were a few editing errors, but they honestly did not interrupt the flow of the story. If you have not read this book, please add it to your reading list.

This story alternates points of view many times through out the story from Batman to Penguin and everyone in between. Action and adventure fill the story with few dull moments through out it.This story isn't a tough read and once you get into it its hard to put it down. The book can be confusing at times with all the different points of view but than again that is also what makes the story so interesting. The story is told from the first person by all of the many characters. Batman along with Batgirl and what is left of the Gotham Police Deparment fight villians such as Two Face, Penguin, Poisen Ivy and many more. It is a great read and i higly suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A World Without Batman","review":"With the modern love of all things batty this story from Gotham brings some of the finest characters of the cities elite together in the aftermath of a terrible tragedy. An earthquake has split the city, the world has abandoned it, and so to, has Gotham's pointy eared defender. Joining heroes, villains, and the citizens of Gotham Greg Rucka takes us on a wonderful story about the triumph of the human spirit, the strength of a city, and the power of who we place our trust in. A stunning read in both comic and novelization and well worth an addition to any fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over, use, of, commas!","review":"Holy commas, Batman!Rucka has this tendency of overusing commas to the point that you feel you might want to reread his text just in case you missed something, that can be tiresome, after reading the 'No Man's Land' saga in comic book form, I had to force myself to finish this novelization, on a side note, the binding exploded mid-read, and that has never happened to me, ever before.Does my comma usage annoy you? At least Rucka's usage is grammatically sound, but nevertheless, this, novel, will, grate, on, every, last, nerve, that, you, possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I was very pleased with Mr. Rucka's adaptation of the No Man's Land Saga. He pulled together a lot of story elements and created a wonderful narrative. I particularly enjoyed the \\"excerpts\\" from Barbara Gordon's journal.

No Way!","review":"Batman has always had a fair share of chaotic developments that definitely make it a point, if a lesser man attempted to tackle them, he'd fail. Given, Batman isn't alone in the progressions of No Man's Land, but it's not like the city hasn't been wrenched in such terrific internal and destructive decay.This is an anything goes storyline. Batman no longer has to work within the confines of the law, no one does because they create their own. This volume as well as the following ones will definitely keep your attention until each page is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2 stars...","review":"I was very impressed with this book...I am not going to bore you with an evaluation of the book because I would simply be restating things that you've already read (provided you actually read other reviews).All I will say is if you are a Batman fan (think the movies and the newer animated version) or just an adventure fan wanting a new title to read... read this.I know other reviewers didn't like this book but I think they were way too critical. Guys... this is Batman... not Shakespear. The story is exciting and makes you want to turn the page to see what happens next... what else do you want.Plus, the character development is pretty good... you get a feeling for the emotions of each character and being that you care about these characters anyway (it's Batman) it makes the story better.Bottom line... if your looking for something interesting to read... read Batman: No Man's Land."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this unless your a big batman fan.","review":"Rucka has trouble adapting the epic No Man's Land down to novel length. If he'd written a colosal book in the style of David Wingrove's Chung Kuo with numerous story threads it might have worked better. Instead he focuses almost solely on Batman and the story is reduced substantially. Why does Rucka emphasize Batman's realization that he can't save Gotham alone when the fellow heros that he calls upon for help seem to do almost nothing. Also Rucka actually adds a number of new ideas which are less interesting than the ideas he had to eliminate from the comics to shorten the book. Rucka had a difficult task here: condensing a comic crossover that was made up of almost 100 comic books down to a single volume, so I don't fault him for not living up to the challenge, but this book is for die hard Batman fans only. And if you've already read the comics I wouldn't waste time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Man's Land, not just a comic anymore...","review":"Having read both NML in comic and novel forms,I'd say that Batman is no stranger to both. I enjoyed the novel a little more then the comic, because the Comic's Code let the author do more, and because you get _inside_ the characters like the comic couldn't. I felt the Joker's struggling, and enjoyed Two-Face's wrestling back and forth with his good side. An enjoyable tale, not light reading as any would think."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Book","review":"This book as to be perhaps one of the best i've read. If you love batman or super heroes then get it. I read it in 2 days probably the fastest i've read a 400 page book. The characters are realistic and the story unfolds perfectly. NML if short rules. I lent it to a friend the day after i read it. And he loves it. It takes place after Gotham is hit by a massage earth quake and totally destroyed. After 3/4 the population leaves its condsidered No Man's Land and is illegal to enter and so the bridges to gotham are cut off. Batman is missing. Its complete anarchy and it really is a story of Survival of teh Fittest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for the package","review":"When I first heard about the No Man's Land storyline in the Batman comics, I was intrigued. I knew that I wouldn't be able to buy every issue to get the full story, but I did get some. I was glad that they decided to do a complete novel of the storyline. I had never read anything by Greg Rucka before, but I can now say that I think he is one of the best new comic book writers to come out of last year. And he writes novels too! I enjoyed this book and story quite a bit. It focused nicely on the human characters as well as Gotham City itself (a most important character in the comics). I was disappointed that one particular part was left out, but I understand why... I'll be keeping an eye out for other Greg Rucka books, as well as his comic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Comic Becomes Very Good Novel","review":"The \\"No Man's Land\\" were better than they had a right to be (the idea behind them is still absurd), in part because Rucka wrote comics as though they were novels. Now he has written a novel that doesn't try to be a comic in disguise. He brings the characters to life, brings the hyperbole of the comics under control, and provides a textbook on how to turn comics into novels.The question is, who's going to read this? Rucka's fans certainly should, as should Bat-fans of all stripes. If you like good SF or good crime fiction, give this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective construction...","review":"I purchased this bag for its versitility and rugged construction. It worked great for my limited travel until my last trip. The metal shaft of one clip broke while I was walking through the airport. To me, this is an obvious defect. I was wearing it as a backpack at the time and had to carry it by the bag's top handle. It's still usable that way, but as a woman, I want a strap and prefer the backpack configuration for even weight distribution.Although the bag is roomy and has lots of compartments, it's not light even when empty, so I didn't load it down. Without the use of the strap, it's now useless and Amazon's return policy for defective products is really bad once you pass the 30 day return policy window. I've had the bag 4 months and used it during 4 business trips to carry my laptop, iPad and miscellaneous cords and connectors.I would not recommend this bag.

Songs about broken hearts and missing somebody and Bubblegum-Pop. But there are at least a few songs that are not that bad (\\"Everybody\\", \\"Like a child\\", \\"If I don't have you\\" and \\"As long as you love me\\"). I mean that melody is not that bad so that the songs aren't boring but the lyrics are just stupid.So if you like the five cuuute guys you'll love this album. If not: Stay away and don't touch it.

I'll go now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlights a great British band","review":"Rockers Be Bop Deluxe may not have lasted as long as other stalwarts from England such as Genesis, Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, but they still carved out a distinctive niche in the musical world. This compilation of more than a dozen tracks is a good primer for the uninitiated and a worthy addition for the long-time fan looking for a compact disc featuring this band. There's a good range of cuts here from Be Bop Deluxe albums, but unfortunately no live tracks or unreleased or alternative versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawaiian music, the real thing!","review":"A friend who had livedin Hawaii for many years was sad because it was so difficult to find \\"real Hawaiian music\\".

The basic and core message is simple and timeless: nothing can ever sever the relationship of God's love for us and that each of us are directly and personally invited to experience God's love and base our very life upon that spiritual and emotional foundation regardless of our secular circumstances. The God Who Won't Let Go is devoutly recommended to all students of spirituality within a Christian context."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is such a wonderful book!","review":"This book is a real inspiration as to how much God loves each of us and how the knowledge of that impacts are lives in every way.

I loved the hero character. He was take charge man with a gentle side to him when it came to his estranged wife. I cannot recommend this book more highly to all. If there was a possible higher score than 5 I would have used it. It's the favorite story book on my shelf of which there are many as I keep all my Harlequins. If you read this book you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as a chocolate chip cookie","review":"This was a delightful book. We received it as a gift about 10 plus years ago. It is one of the books you and your child will never forget. My 16 year old son still smiles and makes reference to this book when he eats a chocolate chip cookie. It features lighthearted interactions with an exasperating mouse, who never seems to be satisfied. No sooner is one request completed than a new one takes its place. The love and attention this little boy shows the mouse is heart warming. The addition of some actual warm chocolate chips for munching, while reading this book, truly makes for a memorable read. The illustrations are charming and bring the cute little story to visual life. The exhausted mouse napping with the powder puff was one of my favorites. Not overly wordy...........just the kind of read to make you giggle and bring a smile to young faces. We still pull it off the shelf from time to time, and read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie","review":"If you give a mouse a cookie is a fabulous book from the mouth watering food pictures, to the non-stop hilerious literature. I love the cute little mouse shown in every fantastic image. I would recommend this for ages 1 to 100. It starts out as a tiny mouse wanting a cookie, then wants more and more. A fun picture book, estatic is a great way to describe this grand piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mouse doll.","review":"The product details said this mini book came with a small plush mouse, it does not.

My name is Michelle and I am going to write a review for \\"If You Give A Mouse A Cookie.\\" I thought that this book is a very good book. Some of the reasons to why I like this book is as follows. This book is cute. What I mean by cute is that this book is about a little mouse and a cookie. Well this whole book is cute because it is a happy kind of book. Also I like this book because I like the content. The content of this book is easily understandable and a little kid can read this book very easily. The last reasons to why I like this book is that the pictures are cool. The pictures in this book are cool because they are small and cute. Well thats all the time that I have left. I hope that whoever reads my review reads this book and then reads the story:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of series","review":"This is the first of several of this type and clearly the best of the group. the rhythm and flow of the pages are wonderful.

I love this story, my kids want to hear it over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, But get the full size one","review":"I love this series of books and so do my kids (2 & 4 yo). Unfortunately I didn't read the product description very well because I didn't know it was a mini-book. The book is so small I can barely read the words myself and we have no use for the CD.

My own grandchildren are beyond the age where this book would be read to them, but it fits perfectly in my collection of children's books. Any Mom or Dad with a small child should pick up this series of stories. They are classic and delightful. The illustrations are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"We had to buy it after we read it in the library :)","review":"And it's still a favorite around here two years later!It amazes me that this book is almost as old as I am, is of course considered a very popular classic, and yet - I never read it until I was an adult!Given its age, I'm sure everybody *else* here knows the plot, but just in case, this is a book about a (very logical, I'm sure) series of misadventures that happens after you give something to a mouse. Every request leads to another thing, and another, and another, until the poor boy in the story falls dead asleep.This book is too cute, and it's funny, too, in a way that both adults and kids will appreciate.Plus, it's short, which is great for those \\"Oh dear, go to BED already!\\" kind of nights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie","review":"This is the story that captivated by interest in this author's storytelling. My students love the books! Plus, the book came in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cutest Story!","review":"The Greatest childrens book i have ever read and one of my favorites. It has wonderful pictures of the cute little mouse. It is about a mouse that goes nad a big edventure and ends up getting into lots of things. This little mouse has a big imangination. As you turn the pages you will start to chuckle at all the different things he thinks of. This mouse is definetly never bored! He has a little boy that helps him when he thinks of things to do and by the end of the story he is all worn out. This book is sure to put a smile on your face. It would be a great book to read to a child when he/she says there is nothing to do and they are bored. Every time i read this story i seem to get a laugh at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVIL SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE","review":"I hate to be a party poop, but I do believe there is a very evil subliminal message in this book.The point seems to be that it is bad to do kindness for people, since they invariably will end up taking advantage of you.Not surprising the author is not Christian.This book is very anti-Christian and anti-Biblical.Compare this with the parable of the Good Samaritan.BEWARE THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaganomics for Kids!","review":"This story revolves around a mouse who demands ever-increasing amounts of consumer items from an ever-increasingly exasperated boy. Cute pictures hide a terrible message of selfishness and class warfare boiling beneath American society. The whole book devolves into a crude political cartoon, where the boy symbolizes an innocent and hard-working tax payer while the mouse typifies a vile depiction of how the wealthy (or at least those who perceive themselves as wealthy) view the poor and needy. While the boy gives more and more to the mouse the mouse in turn asks more and more of the boy. It paints the situation as unjust and the mouse having little reason to ask for these handouts.Terrible book. Don't read it to your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong, just wrong","review":"Everyone knows if you give a mouse a cookie, its little stomach will swell up, and cause terrible pain and suffering. What kind of parent would buy their child a book that condones that? Not mine, that's for certain. Give a mouse some cheese, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright book too overrated","review":"I may be in the minority here but as a child, though I loved the illustrations of this book and still do till this day, the story was funny but kind of silly and senseless humor at the same time. Who would let a mouse into their house by bribing them with a cookie. If your kid did that in real life and you ended up with mice everywhere and feces it's not going to be a good experience. Keep the mouse outside and let him run off with his cookie next time around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"Looking for a large e the book was didn't realize the book was small since I didn't choose any mini books"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read over and over again..","review":"My own children love this book, as do my kindergarten students.

Even as I read it now, there is wisdom for adults and material to relate to (ie when I'm cleaning, one thing leads to another, childcare, etc). Great story, and it is part of a series of similarly-messaged books (If You Give a Cat a Cupcake, etc). Depending upon your child's interests, you can select the topic most enticing and enjoy reading right along with them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different than what I expected...","review":"The item was shipped promptly. When it arrived, I was a little disappointed... The book I received has a smaller, solid green hardcover, without the cover art displayed on Amazon (not that this is necessarily the seller's fault).

The drawings are very well done and the story is charming and care free - my son knows all the words without reading.

I just ordered two more of the series for Christmas presents. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Pictures","review":"My daughter isn't reading, but she loves being read to and pictures are important in the books we read.

T. Coakely, band leader and songwriter, was a great lyriscist who knew how to get you dancing and, as this CD proves, new how get you feeling cool. Great tracks for a summer evening cruise with the top down or a stroll on the beach with someone special. If you are not familiar with them think Earth Wind and Fire with cooler lyrics. Check out \\"Heaven in your Eyes\\" and \\"Best of my Love\\" Play them once and I think you may get some heavy rotation out of them especially if you have some wooing to do.

I had a terrible time trying to get it to fit on my Vision:M; the M is quite thick, and the skin is just a hair too tight. This would be forgiveable if the effect was simply cosmetic, but the with it being just slightly too tight keeps the four large buttons on the front stuck in their pressed positions. Therefore, My daughter cannot use the cover at all because the Zen will not turn on while in the cover. Also, the two nodes at the top corners of the screen opening are pulled away from one another very slightly, just enough to make it impossible to attach the plastic cover. I struggled and stretched and pulled and pushed to try to get enough slack around the front of the device, I had no luck.The chargers work fine, keeps me from having to boot up computer to charget the Zen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful package!","review":"Just having bought a Creative Zen M, mainly so I could walk laps on my driveway with it, I needed someway to clip it to my clothes.

Well worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I loved the case when I first got it. It fit well, seemed to protect it very well.

The product image is slightly different from the actual product, and the description isn't very...well...descriptive, but I received exactly what I wanted. These are Bones Ceramic Labyrinth bearings, eight in a pack. I've used Bones bearings for a while, and I have always been impressed with them. They hold up to abuse much better than other bearings I've used. I would highly recommend a set of these bearings to anyone looking for excellent high quality skate bearings.*It is also important to note that these bearings are designed for 608 axles (8mm) and not for 627 axles (7mm). They can be used on 7mm axles with the proper axle upsizing shims, but without the shims, they will not fit a 7mm axle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still better than the rest!","review":"Hard-core Hiatt fans seem to consider this disk something of a throwaway - not getting near the emotional depth of Bring the Family or Walk On. This disk is fun, mostly upbeat, and showcases, once again, the remarkable raw talent of John Hiatt. (Several of the cuts, too, seemed to foreshadow our President's problems - Little Head and Sure Pinocchio). This guy has matured through his music and only seems to get better. He's as clever with the phrase as Elvis Costello and can really touch your heart like Van Morrison. Stand-out cuts include Woman Sawed in Half, Runaway, and Pirate Radio (a real sing-along, if there ever was one). Buy this - but don't make it your only Hiatt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Simply the Best......","review":"Thanks to an on-line friend in Chicago, I discovered John Hiatt this year and I haven't been the same since!! I've never listened to the lyrics of anyone's music like I do his -- his songs contain some of the most memorable lyrics I've ever heard. They're romantic, sad, witty, insightful and just plain awesome. I just purchased Little Head and I've been playing it like crazy -- it's lots of fun. I love the title track (while in the car my 14 yr old daughter commented \\"mom is he talking about what I think he's talking about...\\" (she was right). Pirate Radio is a great sing-a-long tune and Sure Pinocchio cracks me up. I may not have listened to him for long but I'm making up for it now!!! The only thing better would be to see him live and I can hardly wait for that day......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the detractors","review":"I've dug Hiatt since Riding with the King, and let me tell you: Regardless of what anybody sez, Little Head is a rip-roaring good time. Buy it, stick it in the CD player, and go crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Hiatt's best efforts","review":"After the brilliant Walk On, this record was a letdown. The songs are just weak. Not up to John's usual standards. The lyrics are rather generic and musically, it's kind of dull. Does not leave the lasting impression that his best work can. Really did nothing for me and I sold it back because I never played it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but I've heard much better songs from John Hiatt","review":"This CD disappoints after years of listening to his other works. The songs are enjoyable enough (for a while) but on the whole, the CD just doesn't connect and stay with you unlike many of his other CDs. The title song is a one trick pony. I sold my copy and now I'm waiting for some new material from Mr. Hiatt (please no more \\"best of\\" CDs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a HUGE fan, but this album ain't no good","review":"Walk On, Hiatt's previous album, evokes all the emotive, lyrical power of JH at his best. An absolute must have. This, its successor, is a waste. A few great hooks in some catchy songs and a lot of filler. Brainless for the most part as Hiatt trades in his characteristic raw, brilliant, knifing songwriting for dull sentimentality. Get Walk On, get Two-Bit Monsters, discover Hiatt when he was a crazed hellion, not a derrivative reminiscent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it is the same as the one that came with my pool then don't waste your money(I think it is)","review":"I have a cover that came with my pool and it had holes for water to drain(and all the crap on the cover went right into the pool).

The same thing happened with the original cover. For a month we could not get it to stay on the pool. We tried several different solutions, even clamped it on the frame. It blew off three times, then tore to shreds last night. I emailed Intex for suggestions on how to keep the cover on the frame but received no reply. Now we have two useless covers and will have to drain the pool for the winter.

That was a terrible mistake!! This is no fault of the sellers'. This is a horrible cover!! It's impossible to tighten, won't stay off the water, sinks in the pool at the smallest breeze or sprinkle and instantly tore on the first use(tightening)! The cover is better left off!

He speaks of all his miseries and his deepest feelings that trap you inside the book and leaves you thinking as if you were Tom himself. I found my self resisting putting the novel down. Truly an amazing work and must be read by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"the story of a life","review":"Thomas P.

Muhl is an artists and he opens up showing us how he saw everything, since the revolution of Hungary to his life as an artist in the United States; his loves, his family, his aspirations. I recommend this book and even if I found the time changes to drastic, it is excellent written and very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaction to \\"Retouching Stalin's Moustache\\"","review":"In a time where anything about World War II and the Holocaust are over done and unoriginal, Thomas Muhl creates a spin on the terror-ridden era by writing a memoir of his experiences as a painter in Stalin's army in \\"Retouching Stalin's Moustache\\", a very solid debut from a promising writer. This book helps to give a greater insight about living in this time period in Europe. This is what \\"The Pianist\\" was hoping to be, a moving story about survival and one man's struggle to keep his life. Hopefully Mr. Muhl will continue to write more, giving us other great stories about his time in Europe. This is a man with true talent, who knows how to keep the focus of his readers, both with his gut-wrenching action and his ability to spark intellect in a person's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"\\"Retouching Stalin's Moustache\\" is a story about a young brave man who's life was falling apart before his eyes.

After surviving life in Hungary he goes to America and has to cope with adjusting and surviving there. This novel has many flashbacks to present time and sometimes can get rather confusing, but if you read it well and pay attention you should be ableto understand it fine. This novel also tells about his wives and love life, and how he cam through after his first marriage. I enjoyed this book alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This was a good book. The author, Thomas P. Muhl really lets the reader into his life. The book is mainly about his time in the army and the Hungarian Holocaust. This book was good because Thomas P.

And most of these things that you read will leave you in shock."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Thomas P. Muhl who wrote this book is what you would call a survivor, maybe even a hero in his own way. You can call him this because of all the things he went through in his long event filled life.

The book to me shows how you never know wher life can take you, so you just have to ride out and play with what your given. in this case thomas muhl was not given much and still managed to live an extraordinary life which ended up being an extraordinary book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Retouching Stalin's Moustache is truly an inspirational story by Thomas P.

Once I picked up this book I couldn't put it down because it was so beautifully written. As you read this book, you get the feeling as if you're there; it is so well detailed that readers can get a picture of what he is writing about. It takes a strong person to go through everything Thomas P. Muhl did. Knowing that everything that is in the book really happened to him is truthfully admirable. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile reading","review":"Thomas Muhl escaped from the tyrannical government of Hungary and decided to write a spectacular novel about his experiences that forever sullied his soul. It's very interesting how one event can lead to the opening of many doors to destiny. This novel tells us the story of a young man who encounters this curious turn of fate. We see the process of it all and what becomes of Muhl after this event. In turn, the novel ends up being the story about a hero in the sense that he survives many obstacles. Adjustment, suicide, a divorce, and depression are some to name. He is truly someone to look up to. His great sense of detail elevates his novel.To anyone who, like Muhl, has fled a country because of politcal problems, this book is highly great to relate to. Many people will never find peace with themselves because adjusting to a new country with completely different customs. Leaving behind your home land will never be replaced.

It must be difficult to write with any depth about a ho-hum man doing extraordinary things with his only 'claim to fame'.

This is a early reader for 1-3 grades but my 3.5 year-old son loves it. It tells the story of Medusa and and how Perseus slayed her and killed the sea serpent to save Andromeda. The Greek names have instructions on how they are pronounced. The illustrations are particularly appealling - photographed paper collages that give them a 3-dimensional look. Medusa's hair is made of multi-colored, multi-patterned paper snakes! This is good little book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Snake Hair\\"...a great book","review":"This book, illustrated brilliantly in an amazing form, follows the Greek Myth of the snaked-haired Gorgon, 'Medusa'.

The young man Perseus then sets out to find the Gorgon and kill her, this is their story - in a form that young children can follow.

I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now. I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco.

Well done. I agree. I too felt that she was trying to impress with her knowledge of history and art. I also felt that she was a bit focused on issues of size and weight and her frustration to lose 12 pounds. Her continual comments on girth was a bit much. What was also a bit curious was her lack of empathy for Ed when he nearly died in Fez. It was a bit odd to have her discuss shopping when he was back in the room sounding gravely ill. Her other books were far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not edited!","review":"Frances Mayes has had so much success as a writer. No doubt she never dreamed that her adventures in Tuscany would bring her best-selling books and a film based on the first book. That must have been very exciting and gratifying--beyond words. We all can't wait to read what she has to say next. I think that's why there is so much disappointment about this book. I mean why is it that once a writer had so much success the editors no longer cut as much as they should? She is so full of herself in this book, whereas in her other books her writing was delicate and poetic.It's not to say that this book doesn't have it's moments. In fact, I am inspired by some of her perceptions of her destinations and many of them are similar to ours. But some of her perceptions are way over the top. That last chapter is some sort of fantasy that, frankly, I wish she had kept to herself! Her inflated self-image needs to calm down a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This is my first ever review. I bought this book without having read any of Mayes' other books because I love all the places she writes about and I thought the cover design was gorgeous! I am so disappinted by the content of the book, however, and see that I am not alone. I find it self-indulgent and boring. Mayes sounds nothing like the well-informed writer I expected her to be. I grew up in Spain and she does not do this country justice by any stretch of the imagination. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought it was just me....","review":"I've read her other books, several times, listened to her on tape, been to the Pienza cheese shop, although I didn't know it till we came home with wheels of Pecorino. I just happened to see A Year in the World bought it and saved it for a time when I could savor it, so looking forward to enjoying it. So sorry to say, this one truly missed and I have to agree with the other reviewers. I struggled through the first 50 - 60 pages and starting jumping to other chapters and locale, hoping to engage. I really thought it was just me. Now that I've read the reviews I will have to finish the book, just to see how really bad it is...and how money has turned this woman. She certainly isn't Diane Lane and if this is evidence of her current work..Frances...retire! I've had enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored and Disappointed","review":"Wallowing through this book I found myself checking other readers reviews and found the same sentiments I had been having since the end of the second chapter. This book offers very little and seems to serve as a pulpit for Mayes to look down on the rest of us with scathing detail. After reading Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany I looked forward to the genuine, gushing details that Mayes is famous for. However, this book was dry and lackluster at best. Rent it from the library if you must and put it down when you feel like taking a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Year In the World - a big letdown","review":"I was really looking forward to reading A Year In The World. Unfortunately, it was completely disappointing. Frances Mayes' bestseller Under the Tuscan Sun did what this book did not. It employed a great story, new experiences in a foreign country, and the reader got to know several new people by reading this memoir. In this travel journal, Mayes seems to forget the most important rule when writing a book: have a good story to tell. A Year In The World reads more like a simple diary, embellished in poetic words. Beautiful, yet utterly boring.Check out my other reviews at [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID the AUDIO VERSION","review":"I am a big fan of Frances Mayes' prose...and thoroughly enjoyed the audio version of Under the Tuscan Sun on Recorded Books so I was looking forward to listening to this new book. Unfortunately, the reader chosen for A Year in the World is unbearable...droning on in a near monotone her voice is nearly lifeless. I could not get past the first 30 minutes! It seems as though the reader was told: \\"be somber, be serious...and never, NEVER let any light into your voice!\\" A total antithesis to Mayes' writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title...","review":"I'm sorry, but this book was ultra boring. I couldn't muster up enough energy or interest to even finish it.I myself, suffer from wanderlust. My extensive travels have taken me to some of the same locales as Mayes, so I was looking forward to reading about them from her perspective.However, I'm a writer myself--and while I haven't published a book about my travels I do keep a popular travel blog and write editorials for my local papers upon my return. But, trust me I've written more interesting narratives on a postcard home to my family than Mayes manages to do in 20+ pages.My advice--skip the book, and opt for a nice program on the Travel Channel instead. I guarantee it will be more fascinating and informative and you get the pleasure of avoiding Mayes's pretentious ramblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring snob","review":"This book is okay - not great. I love travel books but the author's snobbish attitude got on my nerves. She deigns to go on a cruise and then cruelly mocks the tacky fat vacationers. She is constantly writing with disdain about tours and group travel and pointing out the superiority of her way of travel, renting houses. Near the end, she sees a group of tacky ppl and she and her husband run away, afraid that they will be Americans. Sounds like she went on some great trips, but I don't care to travel with such an obnoxious brat."},{"rating":"2","title":"What An Album!!!!","review":"What A Life is, in my opinion, the best of The Divinyls releases. Much better than their breakthrough self titled 1991 effort. Christina Amphlett's angry and demonic voice blazes through this disc like a bat out of hell. From her schoolgirl confessions on \\"In My Life\\" to her pleadings with an abusive lover in \\"Pleasure And Pain\\", her vocals are downright saucy. At her best, she sounds like an angel with hell scorched wings on the haunting \\"Dear Diary\\". To put it plainly, there is NO voice today like Christina Amphlett's. This cd is out of print in the US, so snap it up before it becomes unavailable forever!!! A great price, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a record.","review":"WHAT A LIFE is the most sonically diverse Divinyls record. It ranges from the sleek Pleasure and Pain, to the raw guitar rock of Guillotine Day and also includes some more experimental sounds on Dear Diary. This is partly due to the number of producers who worked on it - including Mark Chapman (Blondie) and Gary Langan (Art of Noise). It's definitely worth a listen - Pleasure and Pain and Sleeping Beauty are two of their best ever songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving it a 4....","review":"I've had this album (now on CD) since it came out and the first three songs are worth the purchase. After this release they were in it for the $$$ so this is the one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre - o.k. at best. They have better.","review":"What A Life (released mid 80s)is by far their least enjoyable album. Kind of rough around the edges and not as well written, it is a mediocre 2nd effort (as is usual with artists). The one great track is \\"Pleasure and Pain\\". Their debut \\"Desperate\\"('83 or so),\\"Temperamental\\"(1988)and the self titled \\"Divinyls\\"(1990)(that had that interesting Masturbations song) were far more superior works. So if you want a good album try this - but if you want a good Divinyls album try elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"phrases are spoken too fast!","review":"The audio with this book has useful phrases that would be great to learn before your trip, however the phrases are spoken to quickly for a beginner to learn. Also, the format is inconsistent. In the beginning they start off first giving you the word/phrases in english followed by spanish. Then, without any warning, it changes to giving you the spanish word first and then the english. This makes learning even more difficult. This is not a good program for beginners. Maybe if you have taken spanish classes and know some basic spanish vocabulary, grammer, and phonics then this would be a helpful review. If you are a beginner like me with one semester in college completed years ago this program is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any trip to a Spanish speaking country!","review":"I picked this up before a trip to Guadalajara, and it really came in handy. It was simple to use and full of exactly the words I was looking for. I practiced with the cassettes on the plane, and then I brought the phrasebook everywhere - shopping, sightseeing, eating out, and (unfortunately) to the pharmacy for, um, an emergency. It even helped me there, although I wish the situation to test that particular area of usefulness hadn't come up. Really a great buy and a fantastic way to stretch those two years of high school Spanish I barely remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion, the best book written by Diana Palmer","review":"I like this book because it is so different from all of the other books Diana Palmer has written. There is no mention of Texas or oil men. The book is about a mystery writer and a previous software millionaire. He is hiding out while he tries to make his millions again and she is taking care of her kid brother and writing a new mystery. The plot is more involved than Diana Palmer's usual style and I thought all of the characters were interesting and well thought out. I wish she would write more like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have even seen","review":"This movie is so bad. I hate it so much. I don't know why it achieved cult status, but it really is horrendous. The acting is garbage. It's a joke of a movie.I would recommend X-Men Origins Wolverine instead, that's how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie is not funny.The scene when the people roll over the kid's head is not at all funny,just gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?!","review":"Let me start out by saying that I like some B movies. Evil Dead is one of my all time favorites! Over the top gore does not bother me either. The lawnmower scene in Dead Alive was CLASSIC! I enjoyed the arm rip scene and the scene where the weight stack is dropped on the dude's head. The death scenes were creative and I got the attempts at humor. With that being said, this is the worst freakin movie I have EVER, EVER, EVER seen EVER... Did I say EVER?! EVER! Remake it with some decent acting and budget and make the characters a little more realistic. I just thought this was stupid. I respect people who like movies that are so bad that they are good and I have a few of my own. This movie was so bad that it was horrible. I would check out a remake, but this was a joke and I fell for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to say this is a classic","review":"This with out a doubt good or bad it's a classic Troma release,Despite bad acting I can stand this and other troma releases. If you are new to Troma movies this is a start also check out other Troma releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best comedy/horror B-Movie out there!","review":"When I got this on VHS, I expected just the fun that was awaiting to happen. As soon as I saw Melvin and his clownish encounters with Bozo's gang, I couldn't do nothing but laugh hysterically. You should really see how much of a nerd Melvin is. As cheesy as the movie is, it's a classic and it contains non-stop cheesy action, comedy, gore, and everything you can wish for. The story is basically about a 98 lbs nerd named Melvin who works at the Health Club and gets tossed and bullied around. Eventually he gets chased out a window and falls into chemical waste and burns, goes home and voila! becomes The Toxic Avenger! now the rest of the way, you'll have to watch for yourself what he does. I recommend it to all the people out there who enjoy cheesy flicks like 'Killer Klowns from Outer Space' and 'Revenge of the Nerds'. This is the best Troma film ever! hahaha."},{"rating":"1","title":"bargin bin","review":"Not worth paying a whole lot for... wait until you find it in a bargin bin somewhere for cheap and then get it.

Everything about it tastes of lowclass amateurish \\"don't know what I'm doing\\" filmmaking. Bad on all counts. But the biggest sin is the bad story and bad writing. If you can get through this pile without rolling your eyes or shaking your head in shame, then you all the more power to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lloyd Kaufman is the Pier Paolo Passolini of B-movies!","review":"One of the best b-movies of all time is told with gratuitous gore, bouncing breasts, and bad acting. This low budget, low taste epic from the wonderful folks at Troma reserves a place in the b-movie hall of fame. Very entertaining and addictive for cult and Troma movie fans and an all to real for todays standards environmental message. This hillarious cult favorute is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is sick, twisted, and demented. I loved it!","review":"One day I was cruising around at the video store when this movie caught my eye.

If your looking for cheap B-movies..... THIS IS THE MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOXIC AVENGER Is A Tromatic Classic!","review":"I'm a big fan of TROMA movies...so I guess that's why I liked THE TOXIC AVENGER! The film is about a high-school mop boy who gets chased by a gang, jumps out a window and falls into a vat of toxic waste...thus transforming into a mutant superhero. That's all I'm going to give away for now, but I'll tell you that this movie has a lot of violence, a lot of humor, a lot of nudity, and a \\"head crushing\\" scene that is not for those who have weak stomachs. The unrated directors cut DVD is loaded with lots of extra TROMA goodies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only In Tromaville Can You Get Away With Murder In Public","review":"It's pretty tame by today's standards, but the Toxic Avenger is still one of the best movies of the gore/horror genre that you can find today. In it's day, it had some pretty shocking scenes. How far have when come in society that it doesn't even phase me to see a kid getting his head run over by a car? That is only one of the many scenes that are very memorable from this movie. In the world of many superheroes, there is only one Toxic Avenger, a hero that can kill people and be cheered instead of arrested. If you love B-rated movies from the 80s, and this film is proudly B-rated, then this is for you. A classic for sure, but not everyone will find it appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing Rabbish Talentedly","review":"Probably, mixing unstoppable murdering with sexism and good laugh is really a talent producers and performers display while satirised still existing US devotion to gyms, cars and guns in a world/the USA particularly consuming artificially created products increasingly since this work appeared decades ago.A world is still here in spite growing up of generations of pre-mature then kids watching this adult movie addictively."},{"rating":"2","title":"juicy!!!","review":"the toxic avenger was an inspiering to cheesy movie makers every and was one of the best movies ever and troma movies are the best film company around"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock'n'roll","review":"This is one of the best rock cds i've ever listened. I like bands such as Judas Priest, Van Halen, Black Sabbath, Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, UFO, Metallica etc and I must admit that Waysted surprised me. It is heavy and melodic in the right proportion. From the pure rock'n'roll of Dead on your legs and Around and around from the hard rock of Land that's lost the love and Heaven tonight, this album is fantastic. The last 6 tarcks, from the mini-album Waysted, are all outstanding. If you like rock'n'roll buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartwarming, uplifting book for cat lovers","review":"I originally purchased this book in paperback for my daughter, who loves to read stories about animals.

I do have to issue a warning about the chapter titled 'Farewell, My Love' though - don't read it if you are feeling vulnerable! It is very, very, very, very, very sad. I think the other reviewers have significantly underrated the 'crying element' to this book. My husband came home to find me red-eyed, shaken & exhausted after spending an afternoon in this particular chicken soup! Luckily there is a lovely, warm chapter about rescue kitties right after it which helps to restore one's equilibrium somewhat. All in all, it made me love not just my own babies more but all cats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bor-ing","review":"This book was okay near the beginning, but once you get past chapter seven it's pretty boring. I began reading this book and quit at chapter ten, then I finished it three years later. Quite a long time to read a book with less than 150 pages. It's an interesting look at witchcraft and dragons, though, so you may enjoy it. The plot itself is fascinating, if only it had been written differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cool!","review":"This was an awesome book! I love the Dragon! He was so cool! Well, okay, I have this thing with dragons, but still, he was neat. I wish Vivian would write another book about those Dragons. Alys was good too.

This is a book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not Spectacular","review":"Look, I'm not a book reviewer or anything, so I'm not going to talk about all this stuff no one understands, just what I think. And I think that this book was not the greatest one ever read (if such a thing exists) but it is much better than the worst one I've ever read (which definetly exists).Opinion are pretty much worthless, unless the person giving it is someone you know and has influence over you, so what I say probably doesn't count, since I'm sure that, even if you do know me, you wouldn't know it was me (is that too hard to follow?).But enough dodging what I'm really supposed to be talking about: \\"Dragon's Bait\\" is a charming story, which, excluding dragons, could be our own world in medieval times. It is told with the inner thoughts and feelings of its main character, Alys, though the dragon she gets to know sometimes steals the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull characters+No plot=Worst book I've read in a while","review":"In this sad excuse for a book 16 year old Alys is accused of being a witch. Soon after she is plotting reveng with the dragon that was supposed to eat her named Selendrile.Selendrile becomes a human for short periods of time during which he and Alys fall in love. Come on, gag me with a spoon, a dragon and a human? Realy I'm not being racist or whatever but in this completely plottless, not to mention piontless book that is exactly what this story doesn't need. Sincerly I think He should have ate her in the start, if only to put this struggling plotless story out of it's misery and mine. If you really want to read this go to the liberary, just don't waste your money and buy this book!! From, A disgusted 13 year old reader:^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spolier Free Review","review":"I have read 2 other titles by this author, and liked them quite a but (especially \\"Heir Apparent\\"). However, this one lacked the humor of her other works. Furthermore, it felt like it was written in one afternoon. Every possible chance to expand on the story or characters was simply avoided for no apparent reason except to get to the end as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy for anyone, though a little short","review":"As a young teen, this book introduced me to the world of fantasy and dragon loving.15-year-old Alys is falsely accused of witchcraft by a greedy shop owner who wants her deceased father's property. She is left out as dragon's bait and is convinced she's going to be eaten, but then the dragon decides on a whim to help her get revenge. Selendrile, as he calls himself in human form, helps Alys ruin the lives of the people who ruined hers. But in the end, she starts wondering if revenge is all it's cracked up to be.This book has a great message about revenge and is highly entertaining. Just watching Selendrile trying to fit in with humans is reason enough to pick up this great fantasy story. I read it when I was 11 and more than ten years later I still go back and reread it."},{"rating":"2","title":"revenge isnt the only thing on her mind","review":"When i first saw dragons Bait i thought it would be boring.But the second time i was interested how many books do you see with captions on the back about how the dragon doesnt see her??Also the fact that she teams up with him to get back at the town for killing her father.What i thought was interesting was how she got back at the people who had accused her.during the whole book i was waiting for them to figure out that they liked each other ,but surprisingly that didnt happen until the end of the book but istill read it occasionally if i feel like reading about a egotistical dragon and a girl who wants revenge"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I love this book!

She meets a shapeshifting dragon(who was supposed to eat her) named Selendril, a fascinating and enigmatic character(one of my favorites). An engrossing, humorous, romantic tale about a quest for vengeance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is an excellent short read. To any avid reader, this book may seem a bit short compared to other books but that shouldn't matter in this case. The novel is a real page turner and you'd just love the characters! The dragon, Selendrile, is the most amusing character in my opinion. You'd love his indifference and witty character. Alys is a strong-willed and funny. The \\" bad \\" characters are unique. The book is exciting and humorous. I truly wish Vivian Vande Velde would consider writing a sequel to this book to tie up a few loose strands. Nevertheless, anybody who is searching for some fantasy, excitement, humor, and a touch of romance, I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not spectacular...","review":"I've noticed that when people really like a book, they don't type much, just something along the lines of \\"I loved it!\\" or \\"It was TOTALLY AWESOME! \\" On the other hand, if they didn't like it, they had a lot to say; complaining about every single little detail.While this book has its flaws, it does have its good points too. Not knock-your-socks-off good, but much better than bad. Yes, the ending ended too soon (but it's obvious what will happen, so don't get too excited) and yes, the romance was what pragmatic people would call ridiculous and unrealistic. But on the whole it was pretty good, with thought-provoking questions raised on the price of innocence and the nature of human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique, breathtaking book.","review":"When I finished Dragon's Bait, I was loathe to put it down, hoping more writing would appear.Vivian Vande Velde has a frank, no-nonsense way of writing that catches your attention and holds it. She doesn't launch into long, wordy descriptions, nor does she explain everything about her characters, instead letting you get to know them on your own. That, to me, is a refreshing style I wish I saw more often.Plus, the plot is clear, and the story itself original. Both main characters, even cold Selendrile, are people I came to love, and the villains were not unbelievably villainous, like many Evil Incarnate, crazed bad guys.This is a good book for almost any avid reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it - Too Short","review":"Velde did an excellent job. You get attached to the characters as if you knew them for a lifetime. It is well written and has several unexpected twits and happenings that are truly cunning and have the reader with their eyes glued to the page. It is way to short but there is room for a book two if Velde decides to do that. Amazingly, Velde can convince you in such a little amount of pages. The plot is great and entirely original i have never read anything quite like it! it is easily a rainy Saturday book I finished it in one day. It was great, not a book to pass up despite its size."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it wish there was a sequel","review":"i fell in love with this book when i read it. its one of those that i could reread over and over because it is entertaining.Very witty with subtle hints at a possible romance. the characters are endearing and wouldnt i love to find a guy like selendrile tho he isnt really human.

It seems to be missing an \\"edge\\" which he always had with his albums. Prince is a follower instead a leader on this cd. Though the best is the 3rd disc, I think he wasted his time with 3 hours of music and should had only gave us about an hour. I would recommend to people who are are \\"die-hard\\" fans but for people just want to hear good \\"Prince music\\" get, \\"Gold Experience\\", \\"Dirty Mind\\", \\"Rave\\" and \\"Sign of the Times\\" is all all time classic and nothing can surpass it!

This cd is well worth a listen as is Musicology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty, Expensive, and Somewhat Disappointing","review":"Maybe I did not hear the same CDs everyone else did but these CDs have a few good songs but nothing like I would have expected from such a hyped up CD. Too many mediocre songs with no depth. Too many boring songs that obviously are only pleasing to him.

I love Jam of the Year, a track I fully recognized from it's careful placement of lyrics in the NPG Soul album ( if you don't have it you should get it ,,OMG doesn't begin to touch it.) Anyway, back to this one. Style another gem that proves the man has lots to say and if you shut up and listen you may just figure that out. OH, and for those of you who love the slow jams don't miss Somebody's Somebody. If you want his Purple Rain days, this ain't it. This is a journey of different styles and \\"flavors\\", there is truly something for everyone on this album. Prince ( always has been his name) can do it like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"This album is probably his peak artistically from all the albums he has done in the 90s.The first cd is fun and is extremely funky and soulful.Disk 2 is the best, with prince ranging from soft ballads like The Holy River to funky as hell songs like Joint 2 Joint.The third cd is a bit of a disappointment but it does have its moments.All in all, If your still stuck with the 80s sound,go buy something else like purple rain or sign o the times.If you like all of princes music,you'll treasure this album for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 songs was more than enough","review":"despite this being his first independent multi-disc release it sounds very contrived and very commercial.these discs try to tackle more than they can chew.over-produced and lack of harmony.one disc would have been justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the uncensored version....","review":"This is just a warning not to buy the censored version of this album. Make sure you get the proper version.Tracks 4 and 8 of disc 3 have some horrible noise put on to mask the lyrics, which makes the songs unlistenable. It would have been better not to have put the tracks on the album than to release them in this format.I would refuse to buy censored music on principle and it is a mystery to me why Prince, who spent years in a dispute with his record company over artistic freedom, should release censored music.By the way, the music is wonderful and I recommend the album 100%.

To add to his production perfection, each cd is exactly 60 min long with 12 songs. Impressive! He has never covered a song before either, untill now: Betcha by golly wow, and If God was one of us.

Musically, it's wonderful.Why am I giving it only 1 star? Because, for reasons I don't understand, two tracks are censored - they have some horrible noise on them masking the lyrics which means the songs become unlistenable. (The tracks are 4 and 8 of Disc 3).There is an answer: get the 'uncensored' version. Make sure you don't get the censored one.By the way, can anyone explain who is responsible for this madness?

What's that all about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing...","review":"As so many people seem to have enjoyed emancipation wildly I just would like to add that I really was disappointed. I think perhaps 6-8 songs meet \\"old\\" prince standards, of course I should add that I loved his music till let's say 1990-92, after that I was more or less disappointed by every new album, because I neither see his old magnificent style nor any real development.

Filled with the joy of music and life. Some old school music covers sung flawlessly in falsetto by Prince... Also, original songs that are just as smooooooooth as you could want for excellent R%B/Rock influenced Prince sound.

When O(+> said you could hear his emancipation on the CD, he was right. The whole feel of the CD is open, stripped down and real. It's nice to hear him finally release a cover song. Concerts have always held great covers from him, but none on tape, until now. Yes there is a bit of cheese here and there, but it's minimal compared to the smorgasboard of grooves we get. From the opening bass of \\"Jam of the Year\\" gliding on over to the lustful ballad of \\"One Kiss At A Time\\" to the rawness of \\"Da, Da, Da\\" to his last words being \\"Free...don't think I ain't\\" it's a feast for the senses. It took me a long while to digest all it had to offer, but being a songwriter, it also inspired me. I wrote 4 new songs in a week after listening to Emancipation.

However, \\"Doc\\" accumulated four championships, including Horse of the Year, running long and running short, carrying weight,running on turf and running on dirt. All he wanted to do was run.

The majority of the movie is predictable. The story line is under developed. The suspense was nonexistent. The ending is unsatisfying.

The residents of the town are at their wits end trying to keep the town afloat. When the town gets the answer to their prayers in the form of an Indian casino, Chase desperately seeks to stop the destruction of the towns historic battle site. Chase turns to his best friend and the new girl (cue romance music) in town to aide Chase in his quest to save the town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny unromantic","review":"This is not a romantic comedy as advertised. Even so, it never made me laugh for even a second. The only reason that made me watch this movie is due to the 4.5 stars rating. Now, I know that I really cannot rely very much on movie reviews. Anyway, every individual has his own taste. Its not romantic nor it is a comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janis Ian at her Best","review":"I have treasured this album since it was released in 1978. This eponymous set features Janis Ian's best piano playing and some of her most heart wrenching lyrics. The singing and harmonies are outstanding as well.The achingly beautiful Hopper Painting and Do You Wanna Dance stand out as slow, moving pieces that show the writer poignantly reaching out but perhaps not expecting to find her love match. Silly Habits is perhaps her best jazz song and That Grand Illusion should have been an Adult Contemporary hit. I Need To Live Alone Again may be the saddest song in her repertoire, but coming from Janis, the pain seems so real, yet we can believe in her strength to overcome heartache and continue delivering powerful, gorgeous music.I'm so glad to find that this is finally on CD at a reasonable price (though I paid a fair share more for the handwritten lyrics to a couple of these songs when she held a charity auction in tribute to her mother in 1998)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom Stallion # 13: Heartbreak Bronco","review":"This book is good.

It is heavily modernized. It's one thing to remove some of the thees and thous, especially from the prose sections, but it goes much further than that. In the poetry section, it restructures sentences and changes words so that poems that ought to rhyme, no longer do. For sonnets, that's horrible since the rhyme structure is critical to the sonnet form of Donne.And there are editing mistakes. For example, on the very first poem, \\"The Crown\\", there is an entire line missing (the second to last line). And #4, \\"The Temple\\", has an extra line (lines 7 & 8 should be one line, but it's been butchered into two lines that throw off the sonnet).Also, Donne's poems have great emotional intensity. Somehow these modernizations manage to suppress that intensity and make them pretty mellow.

When I played for the first time with a group of friends, we played several rounds the winners were rarely those of us with the most film knowledge. It's as much about making connections as it is actual movie knowledge.Since the game comes with hundreds of cards and each \\"clue\\" is a combination of two random selections, there's almost infinite replay potential. It's a simple idea without complicated rules, and enormously fun. I'd recommend it for any adults or kids over 13 who love movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great party movie game","review":"My wife loves movies, and movie trivia games. I hate them. I'm terrible at remembering actor names and details about movies, and haven't seen enough main stream movies to be able to answer the trivia.This game is different however. Its premise is simple but amazingly fun. You draw two cards and try to think of a movie that has both in it. The cards could be a scene, a place, a prop, a genre, and actor, etc. Its really fun trying to come up with movies that fit. Since you can come up with any movie that fits the cards, you don't run into the trivia pitfall of not having seen a specific movie.

The production of the DVD/CD is great, high quality video and audio (unlike many other artists in independent labels). The live performance includes most of their known tracks, and their 2007 hit \\"Criticar Por Criticar\\". Both DVD and CD's contain the same tracks. This set comes in a 2-pocket digipack."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Janis Ian's classics","review":"This CD is from her earlier years and is one of Janis Ian's best. The title track is haunting and prescient, very beautiful. In her live CD, she quiets the crowd because it's best heard without distracting noise. But the star of Stars has got to be \\"Jesse\\". If you listen to one song from this CD, make it \\"Jesse\\". The give you an acoustic bonus track of \\"Jesse\\" but it really doesn't matter. The song is just drop-dead gorgeous. My wife and I dance to this song whenever it comes on. \\"Sweet Sympathy\\", \\"You've Got Me on a String\\", \\"Applause\\" and \\"Without You\\" are all great and infectious tunes that will stick with you a long time. It's a very good CD to sing along with. I heartily recommend this CD to all music lovers with discriminating taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancers, beware!","review":"Belly dancers, beware!

This is all relevant to me because my computer would not start up when the drive was plugged in, and all they said to do was \\"check the cables.\\" This does not work, but still seems to me to be their main problem solving tactic, along with \\"shut the computer down for 20 seconds and then turn it on.If anyone from HP reads this, please note: Your customer support is horrible.

He had a wonderful touch for his instrument that is captured on this must-have disc. From his mournful sound on \\"Django\\", to the sweet and mellow notes of \\"Skating in Central Park\\", you will love this cd. Guaranteed. The playing by the rest of MJQ is above par as well, especially the lead melody part being played by the bass on La Ronde. For those Ellington fans out there, you will enjoy the interesting version of It Don't Mean a Thing. A very satisfying album and a lot of music for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Reference to a Wealth of Information","review":"As a desk reference this book is not intended to be a replacement for a textbook on the subject, but to provide a well indexed quick guide to problems likely to confront the clinical worker.In addition, the clinical worker is likely to find this to be a useful book to share with patients seeding additional information about particular conditions. The ability to show such patients (or their parents) brief descriptions of conditions being discussed is often a help. This is especially true in those cases where diagrams are included that can be shown to illustrate the condition being discussed.This is the first edition of this book. It is remarkable in that so much information is included. It is such a useful concept that I expect there will be future editions over time and that it will become one of the standards kept on everyone's desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly high quality compilation album","review":"A Surprisingly high quality compilation album from 2Pac's Outlawz retired member Napoleon.

Well, I got what I paid for. This ball is a joke. It is basically a white rubber ball with black pentagons painted on it. The larger ones may be stitched, but the size 3 is not. Some of the black patches had black marker on it, I'm assuming to cover scratches. I wasn't even looking for a top quality ball (this is for my 3 year old) but honestly I wouldn't keep it if it were free. Well, maybe as a dog toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a dude","review":"Over my lifetime of playing and coaching soccer, I had some good soccer balls and some bad. This ball is in name only, a ball, but not much more beyond that.While trying to be somewhat polite about this write up, the ball is more of a plastic bubble that is extremely poor in quality, feel, texture, and even labeling. One of the best features of this ball is the continual losing of air from day one. Nothing like kicking a soft piece of rubber. I would actually speculate that MacGregor used a smaller measuring standard than the Official Size and Weight one used by other soccer brands. Compared to two other size 3 balls, this one was smaller than them, which made me investigate what the official measurements were. Needless to say, MacGregor may have made their own standards up.If you care about your child, never buy this ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Proper' ball","review":"Although small, (we purchased size 3 for our 3 year old), this is not a 'toy' ball.

That may be the reason the warning is not found anywhere in the Amazon description. I got the ball for me and my 2-year-old to play around with, but I don't feel comfortable using it now. I'm going to return it. Otherwise, if the whole chemical deal doesn't bother you, the ball seems fine to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy . . .","review":"For anyone who likes lyrics that speak more than just words and music crisp and professional. This is an excellent CD in all phases: production, musicianship, lyricism, and overall quality. Jeff Reid's laid-back originality hits you from the start--especially on the best cut, \\"In Time\\"--and doesn't let go. \\"Brother\\" is also a favorite--a soulful rendering that sounds like a musical healing, a rain forest with words. There is a sound here--original, yet not unfamiiar. This one you can't pass up. Great job, Mr. Reid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful new music from the coast!","review":"Jeff Reid has a gift for writing songs that lift the spirit and stir the mind. Better Days fed my soul and Fear of Fire left me remembering times i thought i'd forgotten. That's a good thing!

No matter how tight the screw is, the constant pushing pressure causes te blade to slip the tiniest amount to where it is not level. I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I tried this item out yesterday, and found that the slot for the blade was made too narrow, so that the entire blade cannot fit into it. I was left to decide whether I wanted to cut deeper on the right or on the left, which makes it hard to actually plane a surface. Attempts to set the blade with a quarter of a millimeter on either side of the too narrow opening, rather than leaving the excess to one side alone, resulted in too deep a blade setting, right up until I tried to use it like that, at which point one side slid in and it went back to being crooked. How does quality control not catch a thing like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This excuse for a tool is entirely useless.

The big motor is noiser than the smaller 325 watt machine we previously had but is a small price to pay for that great mixing and kneading power!

They quickly sent the pouring shield without extra cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mixer","review":"What you really get:I couldn't tell the difference from brand new.

As has been mentioned, there is no pour shield. Free shipping was very fast.I'm still not sure whether I would have rather had a tilt-head model like the accolade. I guess that comes down to personal preference. Overall this is a great mixer at a price way cheaper than a base model at a discount store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor transmission, noisy","review":"We've had this unit for years. Transmission is noisy and has to be run several minutes prior to using to 'warm it up'. Just replaced gears in the tranny that were shelled. Kitchenaid was no help getting the unit fixed. Buy your parts on Amazon online though since the local shops like to mark them up 400-500%. This is not the mixer we expected with the HD label.

I had an Oster Kitchen Center Stand Mixer for 20 years. Some things it mixed well and others it didn't. It wasn't a strong mixer.

I've never been able to use any electric mixer on this recipe and I've even broke a Rubbermaid spoon while mixing the batter.

They can be used over blisters and sore spots to relieve pain or can be used proactively on spots where you might worry about rubbing. I've found many other uses for them at home though! The squares are also great when you need to break in a new pair of boots or shoes, particularly if you have to walk a long distance the first time you wear them. Just stick them on the spots where you think you may have trouble, like backs of heels, sides of pinky toes, etc, and you're good to go. I have some beautiful dress shoes that used to kill my feet, and now I find even those are more comfortable with the Second Skin squares.

Oh, and you also get a special version of \\"Light My Fire\\"--a version that I think Ed Sullivan would have approved. Come on baby, light my fire.

Then to make matters better, I got the chance to meet him at the Missouri Black Expo that year. I believe his mother was with him. He was very nice and he signed my CD cover.

I didn't drive the truck for 2 weeks and then my truck wouldn't start. When I brought it back to auto zone, they told me that optima had recently outsourced their manufacturing to another company in China and the quality has gone downhill.

At the other end of the musical spectrum, Braff teams up with the Beaux Arts String Quartet in a 1981 studio session kept in the vaults until now.

Trinidad is known for its calypso and soca music, as well as reggae, each of which appears in fine form here. What makes this album unusual is Patasar's ability to integrate the sitar into these Caribbean music forms and to interact with the steel drummers to create harmonies and melodies unlike anything ever produced on any album. Patasar studied classical sitar in India for many years and employs his knowledge of the instrument to bend traditions.

The album takes on a more traditional approach to Southern Rock. Gone are the heavy sound of the triple guitars, but there are still some harmony leads. What this album has done is put keyboardist John Galvin on a pedestal, and takes on more of a blues based Southern \\"boogie woogie\\" feel, more like Skynyrd. I know a lot of people do not like this album, because it doesn't sound like the traditional heavy Molly Hatchet of the first 4 albums, but songs like \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\" and \\"I Can't Be Watching You\\" are actually quite good. Probably could have pulled this off more effectively with less horns and female background vocals, but it's fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Molly Hatchet album","review":"When I got this CD, I couldn't take it out of my player. Every tune is a gem. It's not as gritty as some of the earlier releases, and doesn't have the triple guitar sound of the earlier albums, but it is very polished sounding and is definitly the most melodic of all of their work, in my opinion.John Galvin get put way up front in the mix with his keyboards and gets to sing with the amazing Danny Joe Brown, on Goodbye To Love. Bobby Ingram and Duane Roland do some great guitar work in tunes such as There Goes the Neighborhood and Take Miss Lucy Home.There are a couple of ballads, but for me, the highlight of the album is the tune I Can't Be Watching You. It has some great piano work by John G and has a very jazzy feel to it.To me, this is what southern rock is all about, guitars, a great singer, awesome piano work, and mostly, the story that is being told."},{"rating":"2","title":"The forgotten modern British band","review":"Radiohead, Pulp, and Blur are mentioned when talk shifts to modern British rock.

You really need this one PLUS the Boogie Nights #2 CD (which is just as good, if not better) in order to get all of them. However, this one probably has the songs most essential to the movie (including Mark Wahlberg singing that horrible, horrible yet funny song, Feel The Heat). My favorites are Best of My Love (The Emotions), Brand New Key (Melanie) -- it's hilarious, Spill the Wine (Eric Burdon), Sister Christian (Night Ranger), Machine Gun (The Commodores), the classic Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now (McFadden & Whitehead), Livin' Thing (Elo) and God Only Knows (The Beach Boys). If you like this one, I'd definitely recommend buying the Boogie Nights #2 CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect compilation","review":"Thid soundtrack is a perfect time capsule of the music of the late 70's/early 80's era. From the disco of The Emotions to the funk of War to the soul of Marvin Gaye to the AOR fluff of ELO to the cheesy but timeless Night Ranger, Boogie Nights is tons of guilt-free fun.By far the best track on the cd is the \\"hidden\\" track 'You Got the Touch', sung (not very well, I might add) by Mark Wahlberg. The tacky keyboards, the cheap drum machine, the pop metal guitar noodling, and Wahlberg's brutal (while trying to sound sincere) vocals make this song seem eerily close to a lot of the dreck we heard in the 80's, while retaining its tongue-in-cheek humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this album's a magnet, then I am steel.","review":"I saw this movie at the theatre when it came out in 1997.

It's pretty much been in heavy rotation for me for over a decade. These are songs that you would never think would fit together but as in all great soundtracks somehow do. Complete brilliance putting \\"Magnet and Steel\\" (one of the best one-hit wonders of the 70's) with \\"Sister Christian\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\", I mean I could go on.

From Melanie's clanky vocals, to the honey-like voice of Marvin Gaye, even disco hits from the Emotions and my all-time fave God Only Knows from the Beach Boys (I think it's their best song). Paul Thomas Anderson has a knack for selecting fabulous music to put in his movies (i.e. Magnolia). No matter what your taste is in music, the Boogie Nights soundtrack will not disappoint.

I have a notebook computer with no CD drive - I install software over home network and run it off hard disk - and when trying to set this up I spent an hour trying to figure out a way, before concluding that it's not possible. It's just as well since I'll be throwing this item away anyway (don't want even to donate it and subject another family to it) but I wish I hadn't wasted the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Product!","review":"We attached the Imaginative Minds keyboard to an extra computer we had and put it in the children's playroom. They love it! Teaches them colors, what color combinations make (red & yellow make orange!), shapes and they love the music. The initial software is a bit limited for older children (we have a 1, 2 and 4 year old that use this)but just fine for the younger one. The buttons are nice and large for little hands to manipulate but I think the children were a little disappointed that the phone didn't work and I fear it will be lost quickly since it is not attached. All in all a little pricey but a very solid and entertaining product. Definitely a plus that you can switch to other language as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want your laptop/pc to stay in one peice, don't buy this!","review":"the product must be hooked up to a computer. since we only have laptops, my son has access to their keyboards when he plays with this... we've already lost a few letters for typing, and they can't be put back. don't want to think what would have happened if he would have swallowed the keys.my son is 13 months. he can activate the controls and all, but gets bored very quickly - and then goes straight for the laptop.i think it would be even more boring for an older child.

I would call, but no number on their website. go with Leapster instead, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Oldies","review":"This album is a lot of fun.

But still great, a must for any car racing fan, Formula 1 fan or not, Ayrton Senna da Silva supporter or not.

This combination works well. \\"Lou Weed\\" is a great parody, and a great song at that. \\"The Coffee and Tea Wrecks\\" is a classic. It is kind of stupid happy with a thick sound from a fuzzy bass line and layered vocals. Definately a fun album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Albums","review":"I bought Dandys Rule OK after I had owned ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down for about 5 months.

Through a dramatic event and an unwelcome separation from his wife, Larson is forced to reevaluate his priorities, all the while wondering whether Kathryn will still love and accept him when he returns, changed beyond recognition.Rekindled is the story of two individuals responding to the true Lover of their souls and allowing Him to fan the spark of their romance into an undying blaze. Tamara Alexander expertly balances the novel's quick-moving, intriguing plot with the complex emotions of the characters, but she wraps up the ending so tidily that readers may not be enticed to read the second and third books in the Fountain Creek Chronicles series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rekindled","review":"This one shocked me but didn't suprised me because she how to tell a story.I was beautifully written.I did not expect her husband to come back to her that way awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge what's on the outside!","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

Watching the struggles the two went through together, yet not really being together...that was a WOW!I loved the \\"beauty and the beast\\" factor. It really added a romantic element to the picture. Lawson had been scarred his WHOLE life; and what Kathrine said at the end really got to me!I can't say much about this book without giving it away. I mostly listened to this story while driving to and from work everyday, and can recall a few times when my mouth popped open. Mostly, it was Kathrine's boss that made my mouth pop open.

These are not top 40 pieces, nor are they the discordant and rambling wailings of late Coltrane or Gato's \\"Third World\\" album. Each cut on Fenix is unique & rhythmic. These cuts together are a tour de force of Gato's range and debth - haunting melodies with emotional force that grab you in the most hidden areas of your felt sense of musicality. Fenix is in the same genre as \\"Under Fire\\" - another early 70's masterpiece. If you listen to all of Fenix in one sitting, the last note of the last piece leaves you spent, moved - like a good session of yoga .. or other pleasant encounters. This is Gato's greatest accomplisment - and with Gato, that's saying alot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dude get somthing else like the longest yard","review":"this was a total let down not only was it stupid it had no point if you are goning t get somthing get somthing like tghe longest yard that is the best movie for psp they have peace out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Selected tempo for opening chorus was great","review":"Compared to Richter's St John Passion, opening chorus was striking expressive and faster tempo.

It covers the gamut from 'light' to 'deep' Flamenco styles (including the deepest of all, the siguiriya, of which Sabicas recorded comparatively few examples).The remaining tracks are taken fromFlamenco Virtuoso(1961).Altogether a terrific album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title is Misleading","review":"I give this book a 4 although I would have given it a 5 had it not been for one thing - the book's title suggests it's all about the Andrea Doria which is why I purchased it. However, it's really an overview of the Italian Line with a small section dedicated to the Andrea Doria. There are many wonderful photos of many great Italian ships which makes it worth purchasing this book. The photos of the Doria are wonderful too though there could have been more interior and exterior photos included. I know more photos exist. The Doria is my favorite liner and I was very excited waiting to receive it - I was disappointed when I saw the book was not what it's name suggested, but was then pleased with the wonderful photos of the other liners which I'd never seen before. So, it is a wonderful addition to a collection but just be forwarned it's NOT about the Doria."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Doria","review":"This book is beatiful, the pictures are great.

They stay on your feet so you aren't having to scuff your feet to keep them on, and they don't have the annoying moccasin leather ties on top that ALWAYS come undone and serve no purpose but to annoy. They are true to size. The rubber soles curve up around the sides enough to make them effective at keeping out moisture, and they are warm.The not-so-good: I have to chuckle when I remember reading about the gentleman who said he wears these to the store. I wouldn't dare. This is hard to explain, but there seems to be more leather around the toe area than is needed, which gives the slippers a funny look -- like elf or leprechaun shoes. In Maine, it is customary to bring slippers to friends' homes because you remove your wet, snowy shoes at the door. When I broke these slippers out, we had a good chuckle with our friends.

This book is not for early chess players (even adults like myself). Written in 1953, the notation used is NOT the typical algebraic notation that is basically ubiquitous today. It uses what I think is called descriptive notation - very counter-intuitive to the novice (ergo, the eventual replacement with the algebraic variety). Unfortunately, none of the prominent reviews on Amazon mention this fact!Aside from the notation, the book mires down in historical examples. While occasionally useful to prove a point, this text goes overboard. For a casual player like myself who is looking for a book on endgame strategies, this is not it. I guess I will keep looking, but either find a modern book on Amazon or browse the text myself in a bookstore to be certain I can understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bunch of better books out there.","review":"contents are so basic. you can choose better books at sameprice.if you are an utter novice, pick pandolfini's more chessersize.if notchoose classic 1001s by reinfeld."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're potty training - pick something else","review":"We bought this for our toddler for potty training.

The Rabbit who yearns to be Real and whose love for the boy was unconditional is both imaginative and sad. I cannot read this book without a lump coming to my throat and being transported to simpler days when the love of a toy was the greatest thing in the whole world.This is a book with an ending that is mixed, that touches on the ambiguity of life and loss. But there is also hope of a new beginning.

At one point there is a ugly guy talking about after he gets off watching porn that he feels so bad for the porn actress as she is on her knees in front of some men. Seriously guy?

But, I decided to replace my 7+ years old modem anyway. It took few minutes for technician to reset my new modem remotely and I ended up booting my system twice. The results? 15down/5up mbps. I was shocked. I checked speed on couple of different websites that provide speed meter and I got always around 15 mbps. I wish I bought it long time ago.

I was so frustrated because of buying two different models of this modem from two different sellers and getting two different DOA used modems. We ended up just going to Best Buy and paying 30 dollars more and making sure we could plug it in and try it before we took it home.

Think about it...how about the story of Superman, and of Peter Pan and Never Never land, and of Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz, Plastic man comic books, the super heroes, and on and on and on... where did the ideas come from? This book tells...from where! Out of Body experiences are real and frightening at times. I can't imagine being able to have some control over it...but Monroe claims that you can.

Wrong conclusion by author.","review":"I read this book many years ago. I thought it was the answer to some of the things that I had experienced (sleep paralysis, floating/flying, extreme reality, etc.). However I believe I now know that \\"Lucid Dreaming\\" was really what was happening to me. After reading Dr. Stephen LaBerge's 1st book on the subject, I became convinced that OBE's are really Lucid Dreams. Check out www.lucidity.com for more objective info.

This book is typical to the myriads of modern, new age, phenomena based books. self-centered and pseudo-scientific. I.e. I do not need Monroe attempting to explain the phenomena. Also his conclusions are mostly wrong. Fortunately I ordered a used copy to save some dollars. Out of body experience can be spontaneous (mostly with children, myself included) and can be induced, read/check(google) the Russian expert M. Raduga on the Internet, or just use meditation techniques, whose main purpose, if done right, for the extended period of time, is to achieve out-of-body travel, at will, at any place ands any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting book of dreams","review":"I found the book to be an interesting description of an illustrative man's dreams. DREAMS. Monroe makes a giant leap of faith and disregards any connection towards a logical, believable explanation of the events that occured to him. Maybe he should consider different states of consciousness as possible explanations? Or lucid dreaming? People seem to underestimate the power of the brain to make up experiences that seem incredibly realistic. Most people believe what they so desperately want to believe, whether in an OBE or flying turtles. Whatever makes you feel better. Its just a shame when a man such as Monroe capitalizes on such a desire for understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonic Crap","review":"Satan uses the phenomenon of Astral Projection to deceive you from meeting your only Savior: Jesus Christ, the Risen Son of God. Can you \\"astral project?\\" Sure, but it's just a metaphysical drug Satan uses to drive a wedge between you and Jesus Christ. Satan is an ancient, supernatural being who will make mincemeat of you if you let him. What we're all really looking for in life is reconciliation with our Father, which only happens when we admit our sinfulness, ask for Gods' forgiveness, and follow the Risen Son for the rest of our lives. If you're on the verge of trying Astral Projection, ask yourself first: Why doesn't everybody do this? If Astral Projection can bring me closer to the Truth, why is that only a handful of people would even consider it, much less actually do it? Turn tail and run to Jesus, my friend. Something wicked, this way walks. The devil comes to kill, steal and destroy.

The hero and heroine spend more time apart than together so it is really implausible that they suddenly fall in love. I know this is the romance genre but c'mon, get a little closer to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all","review":"This was Joan Wolf's first novel, and any writer who gets a book written & published deserves at least one star. But, in terms of plot and character development, I'd say this story really shows \\"first time writer\\" syndrome. This is a romance novel, and therefore I could NOT get over the fact that the hero actually rapes the heroine. He's not much of a hero to begin with (too rich, too controlling, and too spoiled by women). And the circumstances surrounding the heroine's rape! The heroine can't talk or scream because her throat is very sore & she's recovering from flu? And the way she's kidnapped by the hero's drunken friend, while out riding? The whole scenario just seemed too unreal and overdone.I never believed these two people could fall in love with each other after such a beginning, and Ms. Wolf did not convince me otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"The man was at first upset he'd committed rape... but his friend was worse.

Couldn't she have found another reason for a forced marriage than a brutal, drunken rape? That being said, the rest of the book is great, if you can suspend your disbelief that the drunken rapist is really a nice guy and concentrate on the development of the love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, moving story","review":"Joan Wolf has the incredible writing skill of turning an ugly situation -- a rape , into a beautiful and moving story of love . The suffering of both the hero and heroine in the process wrenches your heart but you would be touched by the tenderness of budding love and the satisfying conclusion. A highly-recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE USUAL QUALITY FROM HOUDINI","review":"I have a Houdini corkscrew which I found to be of the highest quality.

When I have used it though, it has worked WONDERFULLY! It uses leverage to open the wine bottle instead of the old pull and yank and twist method I had to use when working in an upscale restaurant many years back. I've never had a broken cork while using this opener - which is a wonder! This opener is a little bit large and takes quite a bit of storage space in my kitchen drawers.. but that's the only fault I can find with it!

I could not get the corkscrew inserted no matter how much pressure I applied."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"The reason this item is so inexpensive is that it works poorly and they are changing the engineering. It will work okay for a while, but in short order will begin shoving your corks INTO the bottle rather than extracting them. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality","review":"It is an all-plastic item, with poor fit around the bottle's neck, leading to irritating operation. Don't waste your money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't order this again","review":"Bought this corkscrew and the first time I went to use it, it broke. The top popped off.

I just can't remember how I did it.The directions consist of 3 small drawings I found quite unhelpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"In my opinion, the display ad for this item was for a \\"Rabbit\\" cork remover. We have all read such good reviews of the Rabbit, and how it lasts forever. I believed that we were buying a plain model of Rabbit, it isn't, it appears to be an inexpensive copy, plastic components, and no better than the no name knock-offs. I emailed Metrokane, the Vendor, asking about the difference from the real Rabbit, received no reply. I'm sure that this model will be in the trash in a few months, just like it's predecessors. I recommend that you make sue you are getting a real Rabbit before you order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of packaging","review":"I haven't even used it yet, but I would never have bought this. I got it as a gift. It VERY securely fastened to its 2 pounds of plastic packaging, which you can't do anything with except throw away. I also cut my finger trying to separate it from the tray it was in. Horrible product. And it's made in China. 0/5 stars if that was possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Had it 2 weeks and it broke. It looks sturdy but it isn't. It got off kilter and just wouldn't open bottles anymore. For all their advertizing, etc. you would think it would be a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Houdini not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I purchased the Houdini and it worked great--for 5 bottles of wine. On the 6th, the handle cracked completely in half. I thought it was made of metal, but turns out it was just made of cheap plastic with a clever metallic coating. Not worth the money to me if it breaks after a few short uses. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piece o' cake!","review":"I admit, it took me a couple minutes to figure out how to actually use this. After a few tries, I realized that you must bring the handle ALL the way down/open, then close it all the way, then open it all the way again. Makes pulling the cork out a breeze. Sure, it may be a bit large, but the handles necessitate that, which brings me to the thing I dislike most about it. I strongly feel that there should be some sort of a latch or a lock to keep the spring-loaded handles closed when you wish to put it away. I guess one way to avoid the nuisance of the lack of this feature would be to not put it in a drawer, but still...The foil-cutter that's included does just what it's intended to do, although I find it a bit awkward as it would be much more comfortable if used by smaller hands.All-in-all, if you're a wine drinker, this is a very handy thing to have around the house, or even a restaurant for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke","review":"It looked great. Was fairly easy to operate and then it broke after only a few usages.

Not sure I would get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like Rabbit but cheap repo","review":"I had my rabbit for several years and ordered this one to replace it...The other was quite hardy, this is made cheap of plastic, feels like it is going to break everytime I open a bottle which has only been a few times because I thought it would break do not recommend keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metrokane Houdini Lever-Style Corkscrew","review":"We have finally found the perfect Corkscrew, the Houdini!!

The price was right!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine opener","review":"The Houdini 2803 is a great opener. I never use the corks after removing them but the cork ejection is a wonder as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Product represents a good value for this type of corkscrew. We've had it for about a month now, and used it to open more bottles of vino than I care to admit! Never had any problem with a bottle of red (served at room temp), but have had some difficulty with chilled whites (cold corks harder to pull), and it simply refuses to pull artificial corks (perhaps on principle!!) overall, a good gizmo. motivates you to stick with good quality reds. with the reds it's been a 5-star performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"This particular opener is a piece of junk. The handle snapped in two before it was one month old. I bought it because I had a previous one that lasted years. What happened? The handle needs reinforcement all the way to the end. We are pressing on it. It could not withstand the pressure. Get back to the drawing board and redesign this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Total junk.Cheap and clunky. I have had other cork pulling devices of the same general design and all of them worked better then this unit. The foil cutter does not work either.If this is the brands' typical design; buy another brand.I gave it a 2 star over 1 only due to the fact that it does manage to pull out a cork 75% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - Easy to use!","review":"I expected this to be easier to use than a standard corks crew, but this thing is magic. Zero learning curve. Foil off, cork out and wine poured in under 30 seconds. Amazing!UPDATE Dec 2012: I've had my corkscrew for over a year now and am still very pleased with it. Works great and still very easy to use. Some of the paint has come off/ worn away on the inside due to repeated use, but this is a very minor cosmetic issue. The outside looks great and the plastic case is holding up well which I use to store the corkscrew and cutter when not in use. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Heavens...","review":"For anyone who has struggled with the cork in a bottle of wine, this product is heaven sent. Ever have the cork break apart as you attempt to save the bottle inwhich you inserted the hard cork screw crooked? Sure you have. The Houdini solves that problem.Ever find despite visiting the gym that day, you simply cannot get the cork out of that bottle. Just flip the handle on the Houdini and the cork pops out.I could go on for paragraphs about the way this Houdini has eased the wine bottle opening pressure. Better yet, see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"All great songs","review":"I'd recommend this CD to anyone.All the songs are done quite well and give a lot of emotion to the listener. The only complaint is that too many of the songs are about lost loves ,getting love,and finding new love,ETC. and it gets a little sappy atfer a while.But maybe its just because I'm a looser and can't get a babe at gunpoint.

So many modern bands these days just dip their toes into the rock waters but these guys jump in with both feet and submerge themselves in its power. I love a good screamer and Dave's one of the best (along with Roger Daltrey and Tom Petty from the old days). \\"Monkey Wrench\\" just flat tears it up right and \\"Everlong\\" is one great song.

I always meant to pick it up again, I had memories of it being a great CD and finding it re-released with bonus songs was a pleasant surprise.Maybe getting older has helped me appreciate things I once did not have time for, but it has also changed my perspective on a lot of things I enjoyed in my youth. This CD, as with Foo Fighters in general, is only OK, and overrated by many. They have a few hits and singles, but so much of their music is so easily forgettable. I've had all their newer CD's to listen to on our network at work and have never been able to really go through a whole CD. Now going back to this one I can see it was just not as great as I remember. I hate buying single songs, I enjoy owning a whole CD.

Until then, this album is going to be in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes ladies & gents, another one for the books!!!","review":"The Foo Fighters have done it once again. If you haven't heard any good rock lately, you most likely haven't been listening to the Foo. Grohl has truly poured his heart into \\"The Colour and The Shape\\". The lyrics make you look at your relationship in a whole new light (if you're in a relationship, that is). \\"Everlong\\" explores the darkest boundries of a break-up (\\"Hello, I've waited here for you.../Come down and waste away with me/Slow how you wanted it to be/Out of my head...\\"). Nowhere else can you find such melancholy. Only the Foo Fighters' lyrics and music can capture it so perfectly. If nothing else, you must have this CD. You'll catch yourself listening to it over and over without once ever getting tired! Dave is truly **THE MAN**!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music by a Great Band","review":"The Colour and the Shape is a great CD. Songs like Monkey Wrench and Everlong stay in your head.

I can listen to tracks like: Monkey Wrench, Hey Johnny Park, My Hero, Everlong, and Walking After You; over and over again without getting sick of them. This is probably why many of those songs became singles However, this album does have some filler as well.

Like, \\"My Hero\\", \\"Everlong\\", and \\"Monkey Wrench\\". I can still recall in vivid detail the first time I ever saw the music video for \\"My Hero.\\" I remeber being blown away. The Foo Fighters are essential ninetys rock, and for those of us who have fond memeories of those days, The Colour and The Shape is an esstenial."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"This album is very nearly perfect, and is by far the Foo Fighters best. I only have two problems with this CD that made me give it four stars. First, February Stars is total trash. Not only do I have to skip it when I listen to the CD, I start to feel depressed at the end of Enough Space because I know that February Stars is coming. It's that bad. Second, I like the song Walking After You, but it goes on for a minute or so too long. I wish they would have stopped when the song was obviously over, but instead they kept going. That said, Everlong and My Poor Brain are two of the finest songs ever, and certainly make up for those two problems, and the rest of the CD also is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sophomore Success of Dave Grohl and Co.","review":"Sure, the debut by Foo Fighters was punky, spirited, and was crafted into a big wall of sound. THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE is a step above that, carrying more than its fair share with big hooks, more buzzing rock, and improved songwriting. The first single, \\"Monkey Wrench\\", is one heck of a roller-coaster ride from start to finish, and \\"Everlong\\" rocks with a breezy melody. Many people will find \\"My Hero\\" an addictive gem, and also \\"New Way Home\\" is a splendid closer, showing off the ever-improving guitar work of Dave Grohl. Also worth of mention is the melodic to unabashedly chaotic \\"My Poor Brain\\", and the lilting and gentle one-minute-plus opener \\"Doll\\", which is a really melodic affair from such a rockin' band.THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE really showcases even more of the musical prowess behind Dave Grohl and company. And you know what? It only gets better from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best foo album to date","review":"This is gotta be song to song their best so far. 'There's nothing to lose is good' also, but this just knocks it out of the water. This is a big step up from the first album which was nothing special. Personal favorites on this album are ' Hey Johnny Park' and 'new way home'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has aged extremely well","review":"This is one of the greatest alternative rock albums EVER! The songs do take a long time to get into but they are really worth the effort. The first Foo Fighters album is excellent as well. But \\"There Is Nothing...\\" is quite bad, so avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"I bought this album about a month after it's release, and since that I've been into this group- until now ( ok, so the new one is a bit too commercial, so what? ). This still isn't the best of the group, because the production make it sound maybe a little too mainstream, as the first one was sounded really alternative. The peak of the album is, without doubt, \\"Monkey Wrenh\\", whichis catchy as hell as it's simpleness. Other great tracks are: Doll, Enough Space, February Stars, Everlong and New way Home. Well, actually almost each and every one of these songs are great, but especially those ones... No, wait! I don't like Walking After You, which is one of the most clichèd rockballads ever... So, this is absolutely worth of listening, although there are some signs of the forthcoming commerciality. Geewhish"},{"rating":"1","title":"very bland album","review":"After the grunge scene died down, some bands decided to ride the cotails of previous great acts and deliver a watered down version of music that used to have some passion and emotion going into it. The Foo Fighters can be catergorised as \\"grunge-lite\\" - harmless almost dancible tunes that will not offend anyone and are sure to be played in every radio station around.When listening to this, I cannot say that it is a terrible album. The band does know how to write some catchy music - \\"Everlong\\", but these songs are too harsh to be pop, to weak to be considered rock and they lack the bitterness of grunge. I am reminded a lot of Silverchair's 1st three albums as they are very similar to this - neither of those making any impression on me at all.In the end like many bands this music falls into the \\"cute\\" category - read: background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"Foo Fighters are all right, but the overall problem with them is blandness. How do you work with Kurt Cobain and churn out music so boring? Didn't Kurt play Dave any Sonic Youth albums? Not to mention the horrible sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"This album is totally middle of the road whether it be the boring and unimaginetive guitar riffs or the one dimensional lyrics and vocals of Dave grohl. Everlong is an instant classic but nothing else here bares repeated listens. Stick to your Nirvana and Pixies albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"There goes my career !","review":"\\"There goes my career, watch it as it goes!\\" would probably be a more telling refrain, as this weak-*ss tune seems to capture perfectly the listless vapidity of modern rock and roll. I wonder which band members' little brother wrote such lyrics or which art-school dropout would actually confuse this for real music. This song makes commercial gingles sound like Leanord Cohen lyrics in comparison. I feel that listening to this album has actually made me a dumber(yes, dumber) human being. It filled a much-needed void in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this thinking it would have the quiet, melodic version of Everlong. It doesn't. I also thought I might like the rest of the CD. I didn't. Nirvana wanna be's but nowhere near as good, and all the rifts sound the same. I did like a couple of the slower, quieter songs. But as a whole, a waste of $13.49."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"nirvana was ok but this is terrible! they have no good lyrics or riffs! they would need help to make better songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In good shape","review":"I like almost every song in this album, from the emotional Walking after you to the powerful Monkey wrench.

In general, it's a good rock cd with lots of great tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"three thumbs up!","review":"As a new foo fighters fan, i was surprised that it took me so long to find them. This album is fully charged with great guitar riffs and soulful lyrics, which are often hard to find together. \\"hey, johnny park!\\" has a ridiculously cool intro on guitar, which i couldn't get out of my head for about 2 weeks after i heard it. The last song on the album also has THE longest crescendo i have ever heard on a rock album, after which it breaks into a frenzied chorus that grabs your body and throws it against the wall. I would rate the following songs with 5 stars: monkey wrench; hey, johnny park!; my hero; everlong; new way home. the rest i would give four stars, so i would give it 4 and 1/2 stars overall. An essential addition to any rocker's music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is very, very, good.","review":"I like this CD a lot, and every song on it is a really good song in my opinion. The Foo Fighters are my favorite band, and they really have talent, unlike these one-hit wonders like the Spin Doctors (way back) and Citizen King. I think the Foo Fighters are massively underrated; a lot more of the songs on The Colour And The Shape should have been played on the radio, like Hey, Johnny Park!, and See You. I hope they come out with another CD real soon, I love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Find your Reward","review":"Foo Fighters first album was full of catchy tunes and a great album to listen to but \\"The Colour & the Shape *explitive deleted* rocks. This album gets a solid 4 stars just on the strength of \\"My Hero\\", \\"Everlong\\" (btw- one of the best videos I've ever seen) and \\"Hey, Johnny Park\\". Those songs rock with so hard and have so much power they make up for the rest of the album being just good. Dave Grohl apparently learned something sitting behind Kurt Cobain for 5 years and when he puts it together with his knack for catchy hooks you got a couple of kick @$$ tunes. (If Baker Street was on the album it might almost be worth 5 stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album In The History Of Man","review":"As a hard core Foo Fighters fan, I see no reason to not give the Colour and the Shape 5,000 stars other than the fact that i can only give 5 stars. I have listened to this album everday since I got in in August of '97. The strange thing is, it keeps getting better and better ever time I listen to it.

And sure, I thought for a LONG time before buying it (this was before I found places where I could listen to CDs) and, I decided to buy it because of the number of airplay singles.So...I thought it would be good. I thought that the same amount of heart would be put into other songs. Well...that wasn't the case. A lot of the songs seemed to be 'filler.' I have sold this album, so I can't give a song-by-song relay. I DO remember that \\"Hey, Johnny Park\\" was pretty good though. So, to anyone reading this, listen to the samples (i know they're only 30 seconds, that sucks) and try to find a place near you that lets you listen to CDs or borrow this first.

It is a great way to describe it, however it is not watered down, on the concentration. I think it's very appeasing to your senses and it is not a overwhelming smell. It has a ~Lilly flower smell to it, my favorite flower by the way...it also has a citrus orange appeal that is very light and not overpowering, has a hint of a light airy musk hidden inside the smell as well...the scent lasts all day, as well.I think the balances of each has adapted the whole body of the smell, which makes it very light and I personally would consider it a all day smell. Very nice indeed and well with my collection of high-end perfumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but VERY cheaply made","review":"This costume is very cute...until you take it off.

It had drama, suspence, and most of all (and, of course, my favorite) romance. In the first chapter my eye brows were squinched and I could not figure out what was happening fully, but by the second chapter, I was completely hooked. The characters were well defined and the plot was captivating and enchanting. Erica's faith is God was evident by her strong convictions, and I believe Patty Metzer did a fabulous job of exibiting Christ-like character in her. She did a fantastic job portraying the Indian religion, and I believe she outdid herself with the outstanding and well-written work she wrote. She deserves more then 5 stars. However, despite these wonderful comments, I advise anyone considering reading this awesome book to make sure they have plenty of time to finish it at once, because frankly you cannot put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have been reading Christian fiction for 15 years, and have yet to find one as compelling and thrilling as this one. This book not only included suspense (the first time I have been actually INTO a book by the first page), but an interesting plot-though a bit unbelievable- it captured my interest and caused me to want to further research the culutre portrayed. For those who like a little romance-this definately has the perfect blend. There were few downfalls with book-the main one being the unlikeness of Erica enduring the prince's attitude problems...but otherwise...this book is incredible! I definately recommend it.It is obvious that the author has a wonderful talent that I am sure many will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic","review":"What first caught my attention was the cover which immediately brought to mind the picture of Taj Mahal. Then I read the book. To say Patty Metzer is an amazing author is an understatement. This book was wonderful. The prince was gorgeous and the heroine, for once was intelligent and thankfully not to much so. In most christian romance books, the hero and heroine don't seem to be attracted physically to each other, but this book has all the spine-tingling tidbits that will give you the idea that characters are attracted to each other.I love the Indian setting. It lent the storyline a sultry exotic setting. The characters were intriguing and so was the plot line. Although I thik the Prince's character was a little to bratty and arrogant, it worked well for the plot line because he showed the right emotions at the right time.All in all, it was a great read and I would recommend it for anyone who wants romance that does not contain Hentai( japanese, for well you know..)Good job Patty!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I am happy to say this book is worth reading if you are interested in christian fiction. I particularly enjoyed the travel to a foreign country and learning a little more about India and Hinduism. Some of the descriptions really brought to life the sounds and smells of the busy marketplace. The mystery and intrigue was well done. The romance storyline was entertaining. Overall, a good easy read.

It's been a few weeks now since I stopped using the product and the corners of my mouth are still recovering from it. I've never had such an allergic reaction to any goat milk product, and I use goat milk serum and moisturizer al over my face from another company/ brand with no issues.

This type of ingredient is irritating to the skin. I get frustrated whenever vendors include menthol-type ingredients in their products. They should know better than that!

I decided to try this Canus organic lip balm out, but I didn't care for it. Its performance didn't help nearly as much as other brands on my lips.

Even though Fforde's novels are light and fluffy for the most part, you can always count on Fforde to present a great protagonist.Katie Fforde is a great author to read when you don't want depressing, when you don't want to think too hard, when you need a smile.The only thing I didn't care for about Highland Fling was the sometimes in-depth information into the textile aspect of it; however, I understand there was a place for it and that those details were appropriate; they just bored me a little.I will continue to read Fforde's offerings with pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, formulaic, sloppily written","review":"I used to enjoy some of Katie Fforde's earlier romantic novels, but now she seems to be rushing off a book a year simply to meet her publication deadlines. Highland Fling rehashes Fforde's overworked formula of an ordinary, rather scattered heroine who somehow manages to attract a gorgeous, highly desirable hero, all the while denying her own attraction to him and repelling him with rude, immature behavior at every turn.

I watched it again when it was broadcast late at night. How my opinion has changed. I found the relationship between Ormond and Roth beautiful, amist the cold and starkness of prison life. The contrast is what makes the love story different to many others around. The love and chemistry that bloomed between these two lonely people is what makes the film so compeling to watch. Both characters come from very different backgrounds with one thing in common; their devotion and seemingly true emotions for eachother. A great cast and script (especially the conclusion) pull at the heartstrings of the viewer. This proves that true love can survive all-there is a chance for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Roth is Gifted","review":"I was inspired to write because I like this actor SO much. The movie's script may seem improbable (jail dentist having affair with inmate)but who really knows...certainly the acting ability of the leads (Julia Ormand and Tim Roth)convinced me that the characters were destined for each other. The depiction of life inside, people's motivations, both good and bad seemed very realistic and thought provoking. I liked to see at least one movie that doesn't equate criminality with being evil or insane....sometimes it's just the bad, stupid actions or mistakes that good people make. Yes he committed the crime but he is paying for it. Also, I'm a hopeless romantic and the movie indulged me, e.g. the sex scenes were incredibly erotic and Tim Roth is my ideal of a man with intelligent sex appeal. I believe this movie would appeal to both sexes for different reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually different and exciting","review":"When I rented this movie I really didn't think it was going to be very good. I had never seen Tim Roth and Julia Ormand in anything before. Normally I would have thought that is an off the wall movie that most people wouldn't like. There was definitey something passionate between Roth and Ormand. It wasn't really overly sexual, just enough excitement to keep you on edge.It was very suspenseful and adventures and the ending was a little bit scary at first but turned out to be a surprise.

I use it several times a week. I like it just as well or better than several other exercise items I have in my home.The reason I like it better? I am a plus size senior gal with respiratory problems. The Gazelle is easy to step onto and off. It requires no effort other than remaining upright :)Sometimes I just hold onto the crossbar; other times I use the handlebars for a more aerobic exercise. A slow aerobic exercise, but I am moving!Using the Gazelle does not hurt my knees or any joints for that matter.The machine just does not require any exertion to use! And, it's quiet and very sturdy. I never worry about losing my balance.It is capable of much more, but for me and what I need and what I am able to do, it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great economical workout equipment","review":"I really love my Gazelle. My recommendation is to put it in front of a TV, which totally takes your mind off the fact that you are exercising. Its also nice that you can vary the intensity of your work out. Either take it at a slow walking pace or turn it up to burn some more calories. Its quiet, and it folds away when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"I had seen the gazelle on TV and always wanted to try it. When I got mine I was disappointed. I don't feel like I'm getting much of a workout and my feet slide all over the platforms, (even with my brand new sneakers), so I have to keep stopping and moving them back into a comfortable position. Also, it's a little difficult to get into a steady rythm. Overall, I just don't think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most favorite thing","review":"I love the gazelle edge! The gazelle edge does so much for my body. Using it everyday it got rid of my saddle bags, love handles, upper back arm fat. It flattened my tummy, firmed and lifted my butt, tightened my chest, and gave me leaner thighs. Using the gazelle edge also made my skin look better than it's ever looked! I always had a glow, and such dewy skin! I'm not even kidding! This gazelle edge does so much for me that I can't imagine my life without it. I started using the gazelle edge about 8 years ago...I've owned two since. The last one lasted me 6 years, so now i'm without one and it's driving me crazy! It's like one of those \\"too good to be true' things in life, except what the gazelle edge does for me is a true reality...it puts running to shame. I'm a gazelle edge addict. I love it so much that I had to write this review...I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for days when you can't get to the gym","review":"I am one of those people that hates going to the gym so for days when I can't get myself out of the house, I picked this up. It's better than nothing but be warned that it's really not much of a workout. You can get moving on it and the speed and level of exercise is really up to how fast you move and how much you attenuate muscles while moving but since it's a glider, there is no resistance at all. You won't break a sweat on this, elliptical users: unless you're really hammering out a run, which it's a little too lightweight to feel safe doing, it doesn't get the heart rate up the way a bike or elliptical with resistance does. Still, if you aren't doing anything else, it'll at least get you off the couch and it really does fold up tiny. I live in a minute apartment and it fits behind the TV stand against a wall. Open and in use, it takes up about the space of a double bed, maximum. Not a bad unit but again, not going to make you huff and puff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy way to exercise!","review":"This machine is great!

It is so quiet that I don't have to turn up the TV and blast my neighbors out of their homes. I can see a difference in my health in just 2 weeks. 20 minutes a day and I'm sleeping better, my clothes fit better and I just plain feel better. Thanks Amazon for such a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can hardly walk today","review":"This machine take a MINIMAL amount of balance and corridation. If you aren't able to do it, you probably shouldn't be walking around on your own. I'm a competitive soccer player so I'm already in pretty decent shape, but after just one 15 minute workout my entire body is so sore I can hardly walk today. Abs, chest, shoulders, butt, hamstrings, I can feel it everywhere. Definately the best, fastest and easiest workout I've tried so far. And DEFINATELY worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gazelle Edge Feedback","review":"I bought this off of Cragislist and it has kicked my butt. I really researched it prior to buying and noticed a person either hated it or loved it.Let me tell you, if you are doing it right...you WILL feel it. Especially in the whole thigh area. When I first started doing it, I wasn't getting much of a workout. I adjusted myself after 4 minutes my thigh muscles were straining so hard I had to stop.If you can buy it used, that is the best deal. I paid $50.I will write more feedback after I have had it a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely no Resistance!!!","review":"Okay, Im actually one of the people who read the reviews before purchasing. Although there were neg, there were more positive so I went on and bought it. however, I wish I could get my money back. This thing makes you feel like you are gliding on air. I didnt even sweat until like 20 minutes in and it was only a couple of beads of sweating? UGH, I am like a moderate workout person and since having a baby 10 weeks ago, I needed something to help shed the pounds, but this is not the machine for me. I ended getting a membership at the gym for only 20 bucks a month were their are real ellipticals and Im sweating in no time and doing 45 minutes. I now have my edge trainer listed on Craiglist for sale!!!!! There is absolutely no resistance on this thing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Product","review":"Once assembled, the Gazelle does not sit flat on the floor. The back bar is not straight and I have to put a pile of papers under one corner to make it not rock from side to side. No way of knowing until assembled. Too much of a problem to send back."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh....not quite up to my standards","review":"well.....its not that great. My main problem with it is that my feet slide all over the place...I spend most of the 45 minutes a day that I use it trying to reposition my feet. So that part really stinks they should have atleast lined the foot bed with some kind of rubber...The other part I cant stand is that the computer is not accurate, when I speed up it says I am moving slower. So I dont get it... I do sweat alot when I use it but that may be b/c I live in Florida and have it set up on my porch-its hard not to sweat here. And lastly there is absolutely no resistance whatsoever.... So be forewarned that its not all that its hyped up to be....The only thing thats good about it is the price, but remember you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts the knees if you keep at it","review":"I have used this machine for a few months, initially it was only the feet that hurt, but as time went by, I feel the pain in my knees, they feel sore, simple physics, the elliptical makes u actually move your knees, with the gazelle, your knees are straight while just swinging your legs with pressure on your knees to accommodate the contraction and expansion of the swings.....messing up the cartilage of the knees. I would give this machine a no star....it HURTS your knees. Don't buy this piece of junk, $120 in the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Goofy","review":"Using this machine feels like trying to run with a swing under each foot.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised!","review":"This works exactly as advertised and is enjoyable and gets me moving! Because it is so quiet, I can work out anytime while watching a show and not have to blast the tv and disturb the entire household, which was part of my excuse for never getting on the treadmill I had for years!

After being diagnosed with MS in July '08, I knew I wanted to continue to keep my body as strong as I could but could no longer walk long distances without becoming uncomfortable. The gentle glide of the Gazelle and my ability to control the speed and length of my stride is the perfect \\"medicine\\" for me. My 55-year-old sister and my 57-year-old husband have also benefitted! Now, every day, each of us does at least 10 minutes(that would be me!) to 25 minutes. We all plan to increase our daily times as 2009 progresses. I would recommend the Gazelle to any one at any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout, Easy on Knees","review":"Having recovered from a knee sprain, I was looking for a way to workout which didn't involve impact. Since my knee is still healing and is a bit sensitive, I was very happy to find that this piece of equipment provides a good aerobic workout without causing any knee pain. It's very quiet and folds flat for easy storage. It's very sturdy, too. I enjoy using the computer to track calories burned and distance traveled. The only downside is that it was a bit difficult to assemble because the bar was so tight, it wouldn't slip into place and had to be hammered in with a mallot. Also, when I first started using it, I had trouble locating an annoying squeek. I discovered that one of the preassembled joints had been over-tightened. Once I loosened the nut, the squeek went away immediately and it's been perfectly quiet ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rita Pgh Pa","review":"I would recomend this product to all.

You just need to attach some bolts and you're ready to go. I do suggest a socket wrench (if you have one) is faster than the tool they enclosed. It's easy to move around and folds flat--I keep mine behind my bedroom door.

This machine would be acceptable for in between workouts of intense aerobic activity days. I worked out on it for 30 minutes (2.25 miles) and I didn't even break a sweat and my heart rate didn't even increase. I thought it was a glorified treadmill, because it's very easy on the joints. I did have a problem with my toes feeling a little numb after 20 minutes and I needed to adjust my feet every so often to make sure they were in the middle. I was a little disappointed I am used to getting a good aerobic workout (i.e, step aerobics, elliptical, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this exercise equipment.

It's as fun as I remember. Time goes by quickly. The calorie counter is not accurate though, but the others (time, distance, speed) seem to be ok. After several uses, the machine gets a little noisy, so will need WD40. Fairly easy to put together too. I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gazelle Edge's okay.","review":"After reading so many good review about gazelle edge, I have decided to buy one to try it. It is not hard to use at all, and set up it's easy if you have a man around to help you. It is not a fun to use as it seen, because you are basically doing the same thing over and over again, so it is really boring even when I have my favorite show on. You really have to work on it for about 30 or more minutes to actually feel like a workout. This gazelle say it can hold up to 250lb. I'm around 217lb, and my boyfriend is 220, and this gazelle is holding up fine. I would recommend this product to overweight people that wants an easy exercise at home like me. But I don't think it will make a good workout for advanced people."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke...","review":"i bought this thing in college and granted i had a small apartment but this thing took up way too much space - especially when you are using it you have to be careful you don't send the dog flying with one stroke. but the worst thing about it is that you don't get a workout at all. it's like running in place - but easier. there's NO resistance, your heartbeat does not rise at all, even after using this thing for 2 full episodes of buffy. and i am not a fitness buff. it eventually became a coat rack and i gave it to my mom's friend. total waste of money and materials. i would try it out somewhere first before buying it if i were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love2Run","review":"I purchased the Gazelle and received it a few days ago.

It is so loud, you cannot bear it, and if you turn the TV on to silence it, you can't even hear the TV! I used to use it late at night but now I can't because it wakes up my kids.

It folds up fairly easy for storage. I just about use this everyday. It is a total body workout, and because of a medication I was on, I have very weak hip muscles. I have found if you stand sideways on the gazelle and move your legs from side to side, it exercises your hips and thighs. The higher you hold the handles during your workout, the more your workout your biceps. It's awesome because you can work out right in front of the tv or play music or whatever. If you turn the opposite direction on it, you can sprint and only work your legs. The one downside is that it takes a vigorous and intense workout on this (probably 30+ minutes) to really work up a good sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can do it!!!","review":"Just got this a few days ago.

I will say I have a tricky low back that tends to tighten up more easily than it should. The Gazelle doesn't offer a natural range of motion- it seems to force you to lean forward causing low back strain. It's also not stable enough to get to an intensity level that would be beneficial.

The last one I had (ski machine) I literally wore out and couldn't get replacement parts for, because it was out of production. First, this machine was easy to assemble. Second, when I purchased this machine, I had an eliptical exerciser which I could no longer use because of a bad knee. Even though this machine is classified as an eliptical, the movement imitates the action of my old ski machine, and I can use it even with my bad knee. The machine folds flat and can be stored under a bed, if needed. I just started using this machine but can already feel the difference in my leg strength and energy level. I would recommend this machine for anyone who wants to get moving again. I also LOVE Amazon!

I'm thinking about purchasing a new unit or perhaps upgrading to the more expensive model. I have diabetic neuropathy which particularly affects my feet and hands.

This -to me anyhoo-qualifies as something productive- meaning- it's better than nothing. Actually much better. I got mine at a yardsale for 20 bucks- I see at least 3-4 a week -you can also find them on your local Craigslist or even Ebay for local pickup only- just search under closest location to your home. If I had too- I would even buy it on Amazon or Walmart for the going rate. I gave up on my treadmill because it was too loud to hear the TV over and who wants to \\"waste\\" a half hour or so walking to nowhere? This is lightweight- sturdy and easy to use.

I bought mine at Wal Mart just because of the convenience. When I first got it, my legs hurt the first few days, so I went back to the manual to see exactly how they say to use the machine. Once I changed my stance and followed their advice the pain went away. I wouldn't say this machine is for someone who's looking to loose a lot of weight. I use it about 4-5 times a week just to help keep in shape with my busy schedule. I love that it doesn't take up much room and can be easily folded and transported for storage. Overall, I would say that it's a great buy. There isn't any resistance, but there are ways to use the machine to get a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real resistance","review":"I purchased this machine a couple of years ago after seeing it on TV. It doesn't have any resistance to it at all, so basically your just in the air swinging your legs back and forth. I used it for a week about 45 min every day and never once broke out in a sweat or felt like I did anything. I guess if you want to say you worked out without really doing it than this is for you. My advise to others...pass the gazelle up and get something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Useless...","review":"This machine does nothing for you, is awkward to use, and makes the bottom of your feet BURN. Unfortunately, that's the only part of the body that feels any burn. You can't even break a sweat on this thing. Useless waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeaked for a year, then broke while I was using it.","review":"Not very durable.

Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin my Gazelle!!","review":"I agree with the others that the directions to put this together suck! my advice before you start is to stand each side up to make sure it swings freely. then lay it down and put it together.Have been using my gazelle for 3 days now, and love it!! im not in great shape, and was totally able to work up a sweat, but then again i am motivated and go at a pretty quick pace on it... a little sore from the first few workouts, but so far i think its totally worth it!! its fun and easy... can set it up in my living room while i work out and watch tv, and then fold it up and put it away when im done. if you are not a runner, then this is perfect!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible instructions","review":"I ordered this machine after reading some reviews and doing independent research. The product got here quickly, but once I opened the packaging and attempted to put the machine together things started to become problematic. If the directions are followed exactly as they appear in the insert the machine will not come together as it is supposed to. However you will still get a decent workout hefting around the bulky pieces trying to get the machine to open properly, which becomes even more tricky as the factory lubricant smears all over the slick metal. It may be a decent work out once assembled properly, however after an hour and a half of attempting to assemble I decided to walk away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine","review":"I bought this because I was just looking for a low cost machine that I could use in my spare time. I was not looking for a hard-core workout machine, so the Gazelle Edge is perfect. There's not any resistance, but I found that if you buy some ankle weights and use them while on the machine, it works very good. This machine is perfect to use while watching TV instead of just sitting on the couch. I have stress fractures from running, and there's no impact, so this is a good machine to get the heart rate up and a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and very easy to use","review":"This machine is extremely quiet and so easy to use, the first day using it I thought, no way is this thing going to really work. Just to easy. Stayed on 30 minutes while watching t.v and could have done it all night. The next day I did feel it, in my lower legs especially, so I guess it really does work. My entire family uses it, have to wait in line to use it. So much easier than a treadmill and quieter too. I don't believe the calorie counter is correct, no way I burned over 340 calories in 30 minutes, didn't even break out in a sweat. I would recommend wearing shoes, because doing it barefoot will cause your feet to go numb not to mention those tread things digging in your feet. For under $100 can't go wrong with this machine. Purchased ours at Wal-mart for $94."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this is a great workout!it is so compact it can fit under a twin bed. good for any age group my kids love it. you will never get tired of it. time passes by quick when u watch tv. it taKes 15 minutes to assemble. its soo cheap to. the worst thing ever happened it squeaks 1 time or another but after u use it for a week it it perfectly quiet!! u need 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glider","review":"Nice equipment can go at own pace I prefer natural walking but works well when you can't go outside to walk because of the rain or heat and I dont get dizzy like i have in the past with treadmills, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets you exercising","review":"I have been trying to lose weight, and of course, you need to exercise.

I bought this item because of the good reviews at Amazon. Unfortunately, it does not provide a good work out, and is only appropriate for people who have never exercised in their lives. It has a rather limited range of motion and is really nothing like an elliptical machine. Is it better than nothing? Of course it is, but not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior product","review":"I purchased this product almost a year ago.

Please pay attention to all the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Youngsters....don't buy this!","review":"I bought this piece of junk about two months ago and now it has been placed in the garage. It does work out your calves but other than that you might break a drop of sweat, ONLY (that being my case). You really have no idea how fast I had to operate this machine so that i could feel that i was actually having a good workout. I think this machine is ok for older people who have knee problems and stuff like that, or for people who have never exercised in their life, but if you're trying to lose weight(after changing your eating habits...the gazelle does not complement your effort) and break a sweat consider spending more money. In addition, after 10 min my feet felt numb. After all, it was only 100 dollars, but i learned my lesson and pretty much you get for what you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for the price","review":"i was skeptical about this product but i went ahead and bought it anyways ways it has been few months and this product has not disappointed me yet!!!!Great Product for the price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st exercise machine that I actually like to use","review":"I really like it, it does everything like Tony said.The only cons:-lots of parts to assemble-the \\"computer\\" is flaky and stopped working only after a few months-rattle and creaks after a few months"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"The gazelle was out of stock when I first decided to order it, but once it became available and I did order it, I was amazed at how fast it arrived!

The frame has cracked twice now in the handle bar area.We would like to replace it, however I would like to know if they have improved on the frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your MONEY!","review":"I have to say that I have used several of these Gazelles, I purshaed one new and it lasted about a year before the rubber on the cables wore out and broke. I have bad knees so this low impact machine is good for that reason. But they have NO durability what so ever. I am on my 5th machine now, I do not buy new ones any longer because they are not worth the price. I can find all I want on Craiglist for $25 to $50.00.

It is bulkier than I wanted, even when folded up. The action is more like a ride than actual muscle exertion. I think it would be too dangerous for most elderly persons to manage getting on & off. I use mine, since it is all I have & it is too hot outside right now. But I really wish I hadn't purchased it. Positives-- it is exactly what they told you it is; it is well made & stable (does not tip or rock); it does fold (easily) so you can lean it against the wall & regain the floor space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gazelle Easy To Use","review":"Gazelle was easy to put together and easy to use.

It has done for me what I needed. But if you have a problem or need to order replacement parts, forget it. Customer service at [...] does not exist.

Do you think you could get a good workout with such equipment? No, you can't. The reason is because there wouldn't be any resistance, you would just be going through the motions, your body wouldn't be pushing or pulling against anything. Well that is exactly how I would describe the Gazelle Edge.IT HAS NO RESISTANCE.I put my index fingers on the top of the handle bars and was able to easily get this going without any effort from my legs. That's how little resistance there is. It's like the manufacturer wanted to make operating this as easy as possible. It is totally worthless.If you are looking for a workout then save your money and get something, no......ANYTHING else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if just your calves need work...","review":"I've had this machine since it first hit the market a few years ago. Everyone in my family has tried it with little result. I used it for 1 - 3 hours EVERY DAY for a few weeks. I have great calves. It works no other area, I didn't lose a single pound with the gazelle. I hardly break a sweat even given the lengnth of time that I spend on it. Add that's it's absolutely dangerous to have around young children and you'll can bet your money will be better spent to swallow your pride, join a good fitness center, and dedicate yourself to going. --- Jeannie"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of Cash!!!","review":"This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought. It is a swing, not a workout machine! Your legs just go back and forth for hours, with no actual workout. Yes, you are moving and that burns calories, but a walk would do you more good in less time. The only people who need this machine are the housebound, the snowbound and children. My five year old niece can swing on it for hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tennis elbow","review":"I owned this untill it fell apart. I am a larger person, 250lbs.

The only result it produced was nearly throwing my husband on the floor as he struggled to keep balance and the biggest impact was to my wallet.I worked with the device for a month with no results, it raised my heart rate by only a point or two after a twenty minute \\"workout\\". The device is large and unruly, you spend more time trying to keep your balance than getting an aerobic workout.Assembling and returning it proved to be more of a workout than actually using the product. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"I like the Gazelle Edge very much. It was easy to put together and very simple to fold-up for storage. I would agree with other reviewers about foot pain. I really can't do more than 1 mile at a time or else my toes start to go numb from the hard pedals. I've learned to take lots of breaks during my workout (I usually try for 5 miles a day). I use the tool more as a walking device and not a heavy, sweaty running workout. For $100 I still think it's a great deal. My only complaint is that is doesn't have a step counter on the electronic monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adding Tension","review":"Like everyone else, I was disappointed at the lack of resistance so I simply added a couple of bungee cords to the handles--you can slide them up for less resistance or down for more.

All in all, I highly recommend the Gazelle.Update:After using the Gazelle for 6 months I have lost over 20 pounds, lost 2 inches from my waistline and feel much better.

The gazelle was in my price range, so I researched further and decided it would work well for me. I live in a small space, so the ability to fold and put the equipment away was a plus. BUT! I thought it would fold up a bit flatter than it actually does. The exercise you get on the Gazelle is up to you. You can have a low-key work out, or really get your heart rate up. You can build strength in the arms, and really stretch your leg muscles. I like that you can monitor calories burned, distance, time, etc... Overall, I have been very happy with the Gazelle Edge. My family enjoys it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"I love that this Edge is so silent that you can be watching tv and not have the volume up all the way like you do with a treadmill.

Does NOT fold up small enough to fit under bed or high couch as I thought it did, but it will fold up and allow you to rest against a wall to get it out of the way.

If I do the Gazelle for 30 minutes, my heart rate is 106. So I dont reach my target aerobic workout heart rate, I don't burn any fat, and I wasted my time and money. Cleaning the house works me out better than this. Why do you think none of the other reviewers break a sweat?

When I nestled my sneaker against the front edge the sneaker \\"lip\\" was slightly too high and hurt my toe, so I tried to move back. As a result of moving back my foot would slide all over the platform. When I worked out until I raised a sweat I found that my knees would \\"lock\\" and for days after I'd be in pain.

Thankfully he only chews on his toys! Unfortunately it makes if very hard for us to find things that can withstand his jaws. I was so hopeful with this one. He had the sides chewed off in 15 minutes. I'm not lying. The stuffing was ripped out before I knew it, and within this mass of white cloud was one of the squeakers - which they market as being triple wrapped in \\"tuff\\" material to keep it in the toy. He really did LOVE this toy though, I'll give them that - but it definitely did NOT hold up at all.If your dog is a big time chewer, don't get this toy - it just won't last.

This Tuffy toy (rated 8 on the 10 tuffy scale) was opened-up to reveal stuffing in about 10 minutes.This toy may be for rough play time, but not for chewing.

She didn't care for the King toys, and has torn apart everything else we have gotten her. It says for large to medium dogs, but our vet recommended we get something oversize. She was right. Moxie loves the challenge to make it squeak and it is so durable she has yet to do any damage to it. I am guessing it will be a long time before it wears out and she has yet to tire of playing with it or bringing it to me for throw-and-fetch time.

At times when he can't find it, he's almost in a panic looking for it.He chews it quite aggressively at times, which it holds up to pretty well (over time, he does end up chewing through it). It does collect moisture (saliva), so it eventually gets soaked completely through (I always have several on hand, so one can dry out while he's playing with another one).There are two squeakers inside this toy (one in each end). The squeakers are very quiet, and don't squeak for very long, but I consider this a plus.

We continued opening presents as they busied themselves with their toy, and when we glanced over about 5 minutes later, stuffing and shreds of fabric where everywhere.

They did not rip up the toy so I was thinking if tigers and bear can not rip it out, then my dog would have a blast and have it for a while.

While not well known this book is a wonderful one to be read aloud to a child with a good imagination or as a way of helping them to develop one. The character of Kay, a young boy, being cared for by a governess and household of servants helps youngsters from the ages of 7-10 to strech their imaginations and expand their vocabulary. The story is an engaging fantasy and fortifies the virutes of honesty, courage, and intelligence that we should all encourage. Much of today's children's literature may be action packed but is simplistic and lacking in character building ideas. The Box Of Delights is acutally the sequel to the Midnight Folk but can be read on its own. It won't bore the parent reading it either!Follow Kay on his Christmas adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My 11 year old son really didn't like this book. He struggled to get through it as he says it was really boring. We kept encouraging him to finish it but it was putting him off reading anything so about half we through we gave up. The wording was old fashioned, not enough happened in the story and on the odd occasion when it promised to get more exciting, it did not follow through so he was very disappointed. He likes books full of action and adventure and this has none (so he tells me!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fresh...","review":"For those that like jazz, but are tired of experimenting and getting burned, this is your pick. I'm not familiar with the history and makings of this CD, but its funky, smooth, good variety, likeable, but not commercial....similair to a \\"Kind of Blue\\" meets acid jazz meets a touch Roni Size. About half or so of the tunes have vocals mostly female, one or two male. This is the kind of music you hear at a cool Bronx cafe, and wish you knew who was playing. Its got that \\"Massive Attack\\" laid back flavor with \\"Morcheeba\\" style."},{"rating":"2","title":"one third the price available at Best Buy","review":"I ordered this cable from Amazon.com and then got impatient and picked up one at Best Buy for $20.

You see that 90 degree angle bracket? It's bent the wrong way (sort of).My DVD burner required that this cable be connected with the cable pointing up, and then run down to the bottom of the case. So much for the extra length, not to mention the extra stress on those wafer thin SATA sockets.Okay, so Plan 'B', connect the right angle connector to my motherboard and plug the straight connector to my drive. Strike two. The cable has to point down and then swing UP for the cable run to my drive. Again this shortens the actual length the cable can reach and putting stress on the SATA socket.In the end this went into my closet.

Turns out they were just a little too high for this use, and i ended up wedging the card down and forcing them to lean forward slightly, like someone leaning into a strong wind.They are so well made that they stood up to that pressure and didn't damage the SATA ports on my board, and rocked steady until I purchased another set of cable with a more shallow 90 degree bend, some Phobya sleeved ones.

This, in my opinion, is where Polar Lights dropped the ball... the faces all bear a remarkable resemblance to a hybrid of Martin Short's \\"Ed Grimley\\" character & comedian David Brenner.If you can overlook or have the skill to rework the odd faces, this kit's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with my purchase","review":"I have been looking for this book to replace mine that I loaned and never got back!

The beats are classic old school. The beats are great, since Dr. Dre produced them. The rapping is the old school type. Snoop's voice on his album isn't like it is now. It's cooler and makes the songs better. The flows are great, too. Most of the songs talk about getting high, pimpin, having sex and partying all night. But that doesn't bother me. As long as the songs are tight, I'm OK with it. All the songs are good, but the best ones are: G Funk Intro, Gin n Juice, Lodi Dodi, Murder Was The Case, GZ And Hustlas, Serial Killa, and Who Am I.If you want to hear some good old-school rap or just a big fan of Snoop Dogg, you gotta buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love this CD for the most part, but when they remastered the CD they left my absolute favorite track off.

Track 19, entitled \\"Gz Up Hoes Down\\" was my favorite track, and I was utterly distraught to find it was cut from the remastered release, which is the only one you can find in stores now.

Hip-Hop has taken a change for the worse over the last few years, as it has become so mainstream, that it is hard to think that there is much feel put into the CD's as there was back in the day. This is why CD's like this are a sigh of relief. We can still go back an listen to this, and remember how much hip-hop meant. Snoop does an excellent job on this album.

The whole album from start to finish is incredible and feels like a continuation of Dre's \\"Chronic\\" LP (Which is another classic in it's own right).

Every song but one could be rated as incredible, 5 out of 5 stars, and other I'd rate as 4. I also have Hunting Time, which I'd say has about 5 songs that are awesome, and about half are only so-so. I'd say that Gypsy Ways is not as good as Bound To Break, but better than Hunting Time, and I would definitley reccomend Gypsy ways to anybody who has any other anthem album because it is definitlely a great Anthem album and if you like Anthem, then for sure you'll like this.

We have heard about the sufferings of our country's first soldiers but Martin tells us like it was as he lived it. There is not a lot of battle descriptions but he is a master story teller who will take you back in time to the days of the colonies and George Washington's army during America's struggle for independence.If you love good personal history narratives and want to learn about the Revolutionary War then get this book.

Seeing Jamerson actually play and hear how he developes the line live compared to the studio cut was great.The rest of the DVD: The first several live performances seem like old school music videos.

I wanted to share this story with my \\"Teen Coffeehouse\\" group which meets on a regular basis. They too were touched by Sadako's story. We have gotten involved with the folding of 1,000 origami paper cranes and will be sending them to an elementary teacher in Hiroshima. He will be placing our 1,000 cranes under the Sadako Statue in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park on August 6, 2000.The book, \\"Children of the Paper Crane\\" by Masamoto Nasu has given us an in depth description on how this statue had come to be the worldwide known place where children from all over the world can visually show their want for peace all over the world.It is a wonderful heartwarming book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource!","review":"This book is required as a reference tool for a course that I am taking and it is quite helpful.

Too scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to work well, but unacceptably noisy","review":"Despite there being no customer reviews for this item, I took a chance on it because it was the only compact Firewire hub without complaints about its performance or high-pitched whine that other hubs in its class, like the Kensington PocketHub, reportedly exhibit.These manufacturers must all be buying the same faulty components, because the IOGear has the same very noticeable whine, which you can hear as soon as you plug it into your computer and attach devices (in my case, a bus-powered hard drive and CompactFlash reader).That said, I'm not sure whether or not to return it. So far I've had no problems with data transfer between my MacBook and either of the storage devices I've attached. As annoying as the whine is, I can just work with headphones on when it's in use, and the noise is barely worse than my CPU fans. It's better than lugging around a larger hub when I'm traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Usable - Very Noisy","review":"On a positive side, this hub has a very small footprint (about half the size of a computer mouse, fits on a palm), and is bus-powered, which means one less cable and power adapter.However, it produces a quiet, but noticeable high-pitch noise when plugged in, which I found very irritating. In fact, I am planning to return it without even trying to plug anything in - I cannot stand the noise for longer than a minute. By laws of physics, this noise is only amplified when the hub is in touch with a hard surface, such as the desk or a computer case.In my opinion, this noise may be acceptable in a server room, but not in a home or office. If you are still planning to buy it, make sure you can return it and get your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"This is the most useless product I have ever bought!

With rythms and sounds clearly influenced by north African and arabic music, this work takes the band into the realm of Religion, Spiritualism and some other Universal themes that had been absent from their previous productions. For anyone who's into World Music with a jazzy twist, or for those diehard fans, this is certainly Amistades Peligrosas best album ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMISTADES PELIGROSAS - NUEVA ERA","review":"De hecho sus otros cd's desde mi punto de vista fueron mejores.

The secondary romance is also unlikely, although enjoyable to read (and that male a bit wishy-washy). Georgy's little sister is delightful and one of the best characters in the book. The interaction between the two leads in minimal; more happens to each one apart from the other than occurs with them together.

Other books I tried I just couldn't get into because there was always prerequisite knowledge of programming. However, the Guide assumed nothing, explained each term / idea before dealing with it, and gave me the entry point I was looking for. There was even a crash course in HTML.

Well, if the former is true, you simply have to decide whether it's worth it to buy a whole album for one song. But in the other scenario, you have a bigger problem. This album is nothing like the first. I enjoy instrumental music, but this CD just depresses me. The album is amazing in that it has so much power to bring a person down. \\"O Verona\\" is great when you want to crank it up and yell along with the music, and the instrumental version of \\"Kissing You\\" is incredible. The second half of the album, however, actually made me cry...something a CD without memories attached to it has never done before. Buy it if you're really into classical or if you noticed that you enjoyed the background music during the movie. Do not buy it if you're looking for an encore to the first soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing score to an amazing intrepretation.","review":"Baz's R+J is one of my all time favorite movies. His interpretation of this tragic love story, is spectacular. Unlike one of the other reviews, I am pleased that clips from the movie are included in this soundtrack. You do appreciate them more after having seen the movie. My only complaint about this is that the dialog included is much lower in volume than the music. I don't know if this was intentional, but it does make it a bit distracting since the volume level is so different. It makes it hard to discern what clip is being played without constantly having to adjust the volume. Also, at times, the music volume is very low.One other thing is that I would have loved to see a full length version of \\"Every body's Free\\" (to feel good) included on this or better yet, on Volume 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definately one of the best soundtracks available...","review":"Having purchased Volume one before this one, I was expecting hard lyrics with strong guitar (my kind of music!) but instead it was peaceful, touching music.

(I kept listening because I was a captive audience and I wondered what the end twist would be. Unfortunately, it was just ugly.)Maybe when you hear the repetition involved in the way in which the characters speak to one another, it's worse because you don't skim it. Each time one character spoke to another, their conversation included a lesson in genealogy or some other topic. They never had ordinary--let alone sparkling or interesting--conversation! I agree with others--where is the EL who has written so many GOOD stories? Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always time to die","review":"Dumb. Too convoluted,the plot blew up at the end after pages and pages of exposition about the Governor, who was the murderer and who cares?

I just re-read the series \\"only mine\\" etc., the Jade Island, Pearl Cove series, Autum Lover, etc. (plus all of the other wonderful & exciting novels she has written) and excuse me but what happened to the passion and romance between the two leading characters in her most recent books? They are just so boring; I can read about my own genealogy in my mothers bible - how excruciating and boring to read about it in Only Time to Die. I could barely bring myself to finish this book - what a terrible let down. Don't buy this in hardcover or paperback - wait for her next book I guess...she's like Linda Howard, Sandra Brown, etc. All were great in the late 80s, early 90s, but have fizzled out. Not worth the price of hardcover, that is for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downward sprial","review":"Unfortunately, Elizabeth Lowell has gone from writing excellent romance, to good romantic suspense, and now to only average straight suspense. The rich characterization that has generated such a large fan-base has been abandoned in favor of tediously dull \\"thrillers\\" that are anything but. As a fan, I do feel sold out by her past few books. This particular book plods through boring subject matter, with little action and depressingly one dimensional characters. Authors do grow and change, but Lowell's changes of late have not been for the better. After this book, I will no longer purchase her works, but wait for the library copies to free up."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!","review":"I cannot believe how slow, confusing and uninteresting this book was! I am a die-hard Elizabeth Lowell fan and this is the first book of hers I have not liked. I understand that she does not want to write novels with heavy character development anymore, but if she is not going to develop the characters, she should at least try to develop the plot in a more interesting way. It was all I could do to finish the book. This book is not up to Elizabeth Lowell's usual standard and I miss her old style of writing in which she develops the relationship between a man and a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in a maze!","review":"I bought this book because it was about three of my favorite things; It was a murder mystery, about a genealogist, and Taos.It became a mire of genealogy charts, DNA tests, families that had intermarried for 100 years, and characters that were dismally boring. Set in the winter, there was no taste of the Taos I know, none of the genealogy that I practice, and by the end I didn't care who had been murdered or who the murderer was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Read Something Else","review":"I have read Ms. Lowell before and always enjoyed her writting. This book, however, is slow, slow, slow. I thought the characters were wooden and uninteresting. I also found the plot to be something like the snow and ice of the book, something to be plowed through. Overall, I would say that there are more interesting books out there and, if you are thinking of reading this one, you might like to take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genealogy & Taos, OK, plot terrible","review":"As a lover of New Mexico, I enjoyed thoroughly the descriptions of the area around Taos, and the New Mexico flavor. The info about genealological research was there, if you're interested in this sort of thing. But what a convuluted, insane plot! After awhile, the reader begins not to care about who is the second cousin of the illegitimate, incest produced granddaughter of whom. And the sex talk between Dan and Carly--sounds like a high school sophomore wrote it. Again, good book if you've nothing else, but grit your teeth over the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Time to Die","review":"I will buy any Elizabeth Lowell book. This one is a contemporary novel. It is a racy book that you will be unable to put down until you get to the end. It is written with her usual attention to detail. The characters are believable and the story keeps you in suspense. Truly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but requires concentration","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I found it sometimes difficult to keep track of all the characters and their relationship to one another. It was definitely helpful that the author included the family tree at the beginning of the book. But with so many of the ancestors named AJ, it took concentration to follow along correctly. I did, however, enjoy the answer at the end. At least it was surprising how the culprit pulled the whole thing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"I have to mirror some of the other reviews. I can normally read an Elizabeth Lowell book in a day or two; this one took weeks. The book was a slow start, and by the time it ended I was scratching my head. The plot was so convoluted and there were so many people brought up that it was hard to keep track of who was whom and who begot whom. I really hope the next book is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Romantic\\" Suspense","review":"Carly May is hired by aging and ailing Winifred Castillo y Simmons to research the Castillo family history. Winifred is aware that the secrets revealed about the Castillos, and her sister's husband's family, the Quintrells (one of whom was a Senator, another the Governor) are secrets worth killing to keep. Dan Duran is a \\"vacationing\\" spy/FBI-type who has a very personal stake in the Quintrell/Castillo history and a very hard time keeping his hands off Carly.An excellent book. Engaging characters, steamy romance, a (mostly) believable suspense plot and very well-written. Enough clues are dropped along the way that the reader feels like he/she has solved the mystery. The reader does not turn out to be completely wrong, but just wrong enough to be surprised, and pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"who wrote this and what have you done with elizabeth?","review":"Having read most of elizabeth lowell/ann maxwell's books, I was severely disappointed with 'always time to die\\"...indeedy, quite an appropriate title. There was absolutely no life in this book. I'm almost convinced she didn't write it. Would have given 0 stars, it's that bad.The story has an overcomplicated, confusing plotline involving geneology, New Mexican land inheritance history, and a town full of unlikeable 'hispanos'. Most of elizabeth's books offer entertaining anecdotes, passionate, believable love stories, and interesting research on the part of the author. That's why I can't understand this book - it was uninteresting, the pacing nonexistent, the romance forced, and the storyline boring. The characters, the dialog, the descriptions - not the elizabeth lowell I know and love!I'm hoping that 'elizabeth' does read these reviews, seriously, if this is par for any future books - save the trees by all means!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Always time to die from boredom","review":"I've every book Lowell has written, but this one ... I think she let her kid, Heather, write this one. Always Time To Die is pure hard work to read. I've been reading the paperback edition for four days now, and I'm just at page 142. This book lacks the Lowell charm, has splashes of her word play, minimal sexual tension between the protagonists, and a dreary plot. Either Lowell is losing her touch or Heather Lowell did a bit of ghost-writing. I'm saying that cuz it usually takes me a week and more to read Heather Lowell's choppily written books -- hey, I get them from thriftshops for .95 cents! -- and Elizabeth Lowell's books usually just zip along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to get going","review":"This is not the best Lowell novel I've ever read.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It beguiles one to challenge the symmetry of the Seduction","review":"Tom Beller's masterpiece is small potatoes compared to some of his earlier classics. What is a mystery to me, is the function of the character 'Alex'. It is safe to say that the Seduction Theory has some amount of animosity towards it.I say, \\"take a poll\\" to see if Beller's work now merits attention, better yet, let those who can best associate with the book, that is of course the students sound their voice.Let's hear the student's voice on this one. Alex should definitely not use that bulk mail stamp that was otherwise available to him in one of the gripping short stories.What was the deal with that bus pass? Was it forged??? A very strong word indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"For 1920's and 30's wallpaper styles","review":"This is an odd little book - a slim 8vo on Curwen Press, a wallpaper manufacturer which had its heyday in the 1920's, 30's and 40's. This publication by the V&A reproduces the Curwen pattern book from 1928.It comes with a short but substantial introduction on Curwen which includes potted bios on some of the designers for Curwen, and also, most interesting descriptions on how various designs were actually designed. There are about 3 dozen paper designs in full colour at the end - and I am very pleased to note that taste has changed considerably since 1928. The papers seem to be either in shades of brown, or in the most lurid yellows and oranges - they certainly don't suit modern taste.If your interest is in design, or in reproducing contemporary atmosphere for the 1920's this is an enjoyable little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these blue lapis earrings","review":"My favorite color is blue.

All you see for 5 minutes are the names of those who helped make this atrocious film over a map of medieval Europe. I managed to watch half an hour before falling asleep. I live in China and was curious about how Marco Polo would be depicted. Suffice it to say that the best actors in this film are the camels in the caravan across Asia Minor. A good high school cast could have given a better performance and I say this as a former drama coach.

Truly a book that both children and adults can enjoy; shows in detail why growing up can cause tension between kids and their parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad I finally read it","review":"I bought this delightful book in 1969 from Scholastic Books, in school. I carried it around in an armload of textbooks and binders for a long time, intending to but never reading it. I wish I read it way back then! I happened upon an original copy of it in a thrift store last weekend and I bought it for 79 cents. I read it and loved it.I identified with the young man Dave because he has a dysfunctional family, weird friends and a cat he dearly loves. Plus, he and his \\"Pop\\" are both stormy. That was me! This book cuts to the heart of relationships. I was amazed at how well the author wrote across gender, a woman writing from the perspective of a young teenage boy. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of Cat and his antics. I think the title is what first sold me on the book, when I was a kid. I've always liked cats.I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages, whether you like cats or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy reading - moving story","review":"My mother bought me this book when I was a kid in the late 1960's. I read it several times then and each time was moved by the story. Recently I came across this same book while I was going through stuff so I pulled it out and read it again. I highly recommend this book for ANY age. Read it to your kid or let them read it. A very realistic look at life in the city and the views of a boy and his cat. Excellent. I will always remember this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring read!","review":"B O R I N G ! ! !I was very disappointed when I read this book. I chose to read this book because it had so many good reviews and awards like the 1964 Newbery Medal Award and was a Notable Childrens Book of 1940-1970. I also chose this book because I love cats. I couldn't believe how boring it was when it had so many high quality awards! The reason I think this book is so dull is because it had no plot or problem to solve. The book is about a boy growing up in New York City, not getting along with his father and owning a pet cat named Cat. BORING! For one thing, the cat is named Cat. It sounds like the author was having a bad day and couldn't think of a better name. If anyone sees the book, It's like This, Cat by Emily Cheny Neville on a shelf somewhere, don't bother reading it, it's really boring. -Rachel Milliken"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like this cat","review":"I love this book because it tells about even in the toughest times people or cats will be there with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inaccurate description","review":"I concur with reviewers who have given high marks to this novel. Note, though, that the description on the Amazon website describing this publication as an anthology of classical literature is completely off the mark. This is a novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little read","review":"This book is written for the young teen but it's a nice book for anyone. I remember reading it when I was very young when it first came out, and the story always stuck with me. We seem to think that our pets are along with us for the ride but usually it's the other way around, and they can and do have profound influences on our lives and where we end up. It's also a nice perspective of a young teen growing up in New York City, as I grew up in a small town and the ease which the main character and his friends use the subway and bus systems to go for miles, being out in the big city on their own as such young ages, is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps in the timeline of this book it was a safer environment, but it's refreshing nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can understand why it has a newbery award","review":"It was marvelous, spectacular, genius, excellent, ete. One of my favorite books Ive ever read. I can connect to the book a lot because I used to live in New York and the setting is in New York, I knew almost all the streets this book was talking about.

Dave goes on a sort-of date with Mary, Tom announces, out of the blue, his pending marriage with Hilda and the decision to join the Army; Pop, who's been looking out for Tom, does nothing but offer him a toast -- and then what? Nothing? I've never in life read a book that felt, as this one did, that it just ... stopped. I tried to turn the page -- and there was no page to turn to. Help me out here. Were all of you convinced that the book had any kind of ending? Perhaps the Kindle edition is in error? I hope there's more to this book than has met my eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Plot","review":"I read this book to help my son with his book report. I'm in awe that this book won a Newbery award. It tells about some exploits of a boy and his cat, but lacks a main plot. There isn't much action. I kept waiting for something to happen, maybe a twist at the end about Tom's dad. I was pretty disappointed at the end.My son has had problems finding good books to read for book reports. So many revolve around female main characters and narrators. He picked this book because it has a male main character and a cat - my son loves cats. Sadly this book is missing something vital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm always on the lookout for a good fantasy writer, and I had hoped Hunter was one. No such luck. The plot wanders with little direction from villain to seemingly indestructable villain, each of whom is dispatched in about four pages. The characters create neither sympathy nor revulsion - there is just very little here to care about. There are some inventive (fantasy) ideas, but nothing of interest to hang them on. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught me by surprise!","review":"I'd have to say this book was a complete surprise to me from what I was expecting. Right from the first chapter I was hooked and found it held my interest right to the end. The story was interesting as were the characters. It had a touch of fairytale, macabe, humor, romance great characters and lots of surprises. Kim Hunter doesn't hold back when it comes to gritty discriptions so be prepared to be grossed out at times. He is not afraid to describe things in it's rawest form.This just adds more believability to the story in my opinion. If you like peaches and cream fantasy then this book is not for you. Otherwise give it a try. I don't think you will be disapointed. I'm am definitely looking forward to reading the next book \\"Wizard's Funeral\\". I'd give this book 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing erratic fantasy","review":"This book seemed to have great ideas, and I believe the story-line is quite good. The writing style is dry and uninspiring and at times the writer seems to forget previous information about characters and events. Some strange/fanciful events seem to be added for no reason, other than to help the \\"hero\\" escape from his latest problem, or as an attempt to enliven a part of the book. Towards the end of the book it gets a bit ridiculous.Overall - a great story that is badly told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively","review":"This album really sets your feet tapping; these people have honed their skills before many audiences in Nova Scotia.

So I ordered a much-newer set copyright 2010, which was withdrawn by a big public Library that renews their encyclopeidas every year or so. This new version is just as readable and useful as the older 1973 version, but is updated with world events that happened over the last 40 years. Brand new printed encyclopeidas in book form are expensive, but this slightly used Library copy was like brand new.

I was able to use the 5X magnification of the camera and the 60X of the scope. So appox 300X. The review that mentions a blue shift it accurate. When on the highest 60X the image showed a blue edge about like a sliver of a moon, only blue. I wish I spent the extra money and got the 100mm. Better glass I guess no blue shift. I recommend this scope for the price and it needs a decent tripod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but not sweet!!","review":"I have had many scopes before trying this one and based on all the good reviews on Amazon and I purchased a Celestron 52250. The Celestron has good image quality only at 20X but at the higher magnifications the image deteriorates dramatically, the eye relief is not good either.After using it for a year and 3 months the prism has gone dark and I can no longer see through the scope, it's junk. My advice, would be to spend a little extra and go for a Kowa or Leica, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this scope for long range shooting and although I didn't expect it to work at 600-1000 yards, I would at least have expected to be able to see a 30 cal. bullet hole in a white target at 300 yards, but the resolution at high power is absolutely atrocious. It might be great for birdwatching or spying on your neighbors, but otherwise it is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"I love this cheap spotting scope ! For that price it's an excellent choice. Waterproof (well, never let it fall into the water...) and very light it's easy to carry around. Bright. It only shows some blueish aura around object with high magnification, but nothing to kill you, specially not for that price.I have compared it to Svarowskis, and there're big differences, but I wouldn't pay 10x more ...so I'm happy with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for target shooting","review":"Celestron has always made good quality/value scopes, and this one is no exception. While it is no Swarovski or Nikon, it certainly gets the job done! You'll love the extra brightness that the larger diameter objective lens gives you, and the zoom eyepiece is about as good as you'll find.Focusing is slightly awkward, but once you get used to it it works OK. Once focused, images are tack-sharp.I use this primarily for target shooting, and it is perfect for that purpose. It works best in bright sunlight when at higher magnifications, and works great in any conditions when using lower magnifications.I plan to use this for some up-close bird watching this spring, and I think this scope will be great at that as well.For the money, this scope is hard to beat for its excellent build quality and good overall optical performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolt hard hat","review":"Item was exactly what I thought it was.

I've been using it for nearly 18 months and all I can say is WOW! The reception is vastly improved and I can roam all over the house and still get a good signal! I know this is not some fluke of other conditions because I've tested my laptop and this card side-by-side with other laptops using various 802.11b cards. My laptop always maintains its signal, yet the others frequently drop theirs.I'm not always a fan of Belkin products, but this one definitely deserves all five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with Mac G4","review":"I have been using this wireless card and a Belkin router for about six months now.

After I called, they sent them to me quite promptly. They probably include them now. Setup was then easy and I have had no problems at all. Mac users note, this is a PCI card, and does not install like an Apple Airport card, which is internal.

The card that I purchased had a Broadcom chipset, which is notorious for being incompatible with Linux. Even after going to the forums, I was unable to make the card work.Belkin is dishonest, in that it makes changes to the chipset without changing the product number, only the version number, which the consumer is not made aware of.

The Chocolate Coconut is good, but the coconut flavor isn't as prominent, though it is worth getting.Also if you have seen the Larabar site, they also have Maya Chocolate Bars - I got some, and my first taste was what I can only describe as 'turpentiney' - do not bother.But these Larabars are a great meal replacement, or snack, and oh so healthy -and a great price with Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good - though flavor not all I had hoped","review":"These are, like all LaraBars, flavorful, filling, and made of simple ingredients. The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste. What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love. However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty but.....","review":"Larabars are one of the several natural companies that are fighting labeling GMO's.

If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do. The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains. The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting. Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives. All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better snack bars you'll find","review":"I've now sampled four different varieties of LaraBar, and here's my main take on the lemon ones: if you like lemon squares, this is your bar. The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle. I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"larabar ginger snap","review":"This bar is utterly delicious. Real ginger makes it spicy and crunchy and everything else makes it sweet, and the whole shebang is just so good for you. They vanquish hunger for hours and give you lots of energy. I am pretty sure I could live off of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Flavor Names Not Always Appropriate","review":"I've grown to really like these bars, but the flavor names are a bit misleading. I've had the apple pie, which is appropriately named, the jocalat(chocolate) I think will be disappointing to most in the beginning if you're really expecting true chocolate taste, but the actual flavor does grow on you, and the pecan pie is really delicious but it doesn't taste anything like pecan pie. It's more like a very tasty, nutty, gooey date bar. So if you don't get your hopes up with the flavors, I think you'll like them very much, AND they are truly wholesome and are perfect for the Paleo Diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Lara Bars, Just not this Flavor","review":"The Cherry Pie flavor is, for me, far too tart. I really prefer the pecan Pie bar out of all the \\"Pie\\" flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bars I've Found","review":"I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemon larabar","review":"First off while opening the package you get a good lemon sent. Bar semi firm and pretty moist from the dates. Great lemon flavor, reminiscent of a lemon merengue pie. Bit of crunch from the almonds and cashews. Overall a great bar. Gluten, dairy, and soy free (there are only five ingredients: dates, cashews, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and natural lemon flavor) non gmo, vegan, and kosher. Package is very well labeled with these notes.It lacks any value in the form of vitamins. But has a decent amount of fiber. Higher in fat (11g) than most other bars I've tried.I would recommend these to take along with for some snacking purposes mostly as a candy bar reacement. Not really nutritious enough for an emergency meal replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Larabars were recommended to me as a great gluten free snack. I know that I need to alter my food expectations and stop to comparing to \\"real food\\" (that is the gluten containing food), but I couldn't even swallow the Carrot Cake Larabar. I tried it and really wanted to like it, but I couldn't do it! I'm still in search of some fabulous gluten free snacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recall Larabars due to mold use by 30May2013","review":"Food Safety Recall: Loblaw Companies Ltd. recalls Larabar Gluten Free Cashew Fruit & Nut Energy Bar (48g, 50g, and 16 x 48g; Use by 30MAY2013), due to microbiological spoilage.

In fact, that was the reason why I purchased it from Amazon - because the cost per unit is so much lower. The peanut butter cookie bar from the grocery store was moist and delicious. The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are. I won't be reordering any more Larabars from Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moldy! Full of a white fuzzy mold!","review":"Every one of the bars have a white fuzzy mold on them. It is disgusting!Fortunately, I received a refund; without having to go through the hassle of having to package them up and send them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larabar Banana Bread","review":"Great Bar. Tastes like banana bread with only 3 ingredients. I've tried cashew cookie, and cherry pie, and even though they taste good, they don't need to match the taste of something as distinctive as banana bread. This bar amazingly tastes like banana bread without bread!My boyfriend doesn't like dry bars, and this one is nice an moist. I took it snowboarding as a small snack and it doesn't get frozen solid. I plan on buying this flavor often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherry pie in a bar","review":"To take a bite is to recall a luciouspie, just out of the oven.

The price is way too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to what I expected. :(","review":"I really relied heavily on reviews on this one. Unfortunately after receiving the bars I was sorely disappointed. I like the RAWness of these bars but they don't taste like coconut, they don't taste like pecan pie. They taste like a slightly tart pecan date nut log. I LOVE pecans and dates but I like my dates sweet. These aren't. Too bad for me but hopefully I can help the next guy out. Great deal though for those of you that like these bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like ick","review":"I'm not a fan.

Bar was waxy, dense and bland tasting with NO semblence of pecan pie flavor whatsoever. My expectations were reasonable considering that this is a nutritional product rather than an actual slice of pecan pie, but it was so awful I had to throw it away after 2 bites, followed by a thorough rinse-and-spit session with a glass of cold water. Blah! Sorry Larabar, I tried to like you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"I love the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Its amazing. Good product--mostly filling for something on the go.

Mine arrived safe and sound, and all of them I've opened so far have been great. The expiration date is about 12 months from now.These taste good ... they aren't overly sweet and have a natural coconut flavor to them. I'm VERY picky and I like them. They are soft but dense, and as a result I eat them slower than say a quaker granola bar that you swallow in 3 bites. They looked a little on the small side, but they are pretty filling so I'm glad they aren't any bigger.I use them for a quick grab-and-go snack to keep with me or a light breakfast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fresh as when I buy them at the store","review":"I was very excited to be able to order a box to work instead of having to remember to bring them from home but the quality was not as good as when purchased at Whole Foods or Trader Joes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful taste.

It's primary ingredient is dates and you can't even tell. When it's blended with the spices and nuts, it takes on the flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Taste!! Good Price too!!","review":"The bar is pretty good. Taste more like cinnamon than apple pie IMHO!!The texture, to my surprise was pretty mushy, thick and had bits of almond throughout.Very chewy and you can taste the real fruit inside. (just think of a few different dried fruits pressed together)This was my first time trying bars like this as part of a new diet. I like the minimal ingredients used.(no chems)I ate the Trio brand bars along side this one for comparison.The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of personal preference. I like the more nutty, crunchy textures of the Trio brand.Overall, I think it was a good bar. Not high on cals pretty good on nutrients.Looking for a good tasting vegan bar, this is a good one to try out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LARABARS!!!","review":"Amazon always has such good prices! I'm so happy I can purchase larabars off Amazon, because I live in Canada and honestly, they sell them for about $1.75/bar it's ridiculous.The lemon larabars are so far my favorite. They are healthy too, with no preservatives and have such little ingredients and are all natural! They're such a great snack. I would HIGHLY recommend the lemon larabars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes OK","review":"Tastes OK has a very strong lemon flavor, I understand its a Lemon bar but I feel its a bit too overwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for dieters","review":"Read about Larabars in a diet book, and I went Larabars' website. I got several boxes including a variety box. The Pecan Bars are out of this world, tasting amazingly like a pecan pie!Also great was their cinnamon bun bars. They were very nice in processing and helping me with these orders...BUTThe GREAT NEWS is Amazon has these bars for $5-6 cheaper!Order through Amazon!I am using this product as a meal replacement sometimes, and it has been a great hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced at Amazon","review":"I like all of the Larabars that I have tried. They taste good and are able to satisfy my appetite. I do not understand why the bars can be purchased cheaper at Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods) for $1.35 and Walmart for $1.25 and they are more expensive per unit when purchased in a box of 16 at Amazon. Depending on which Larabar you choose, the Amazon per unit price ranges from 1.35 for the Cherry to 1.83 for the chocolate per unit. Amazon needs to adjust its price in order to be competitive in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was moldy","review":"I purchased these through Warehouse Deals, and even though they still had not reached the \\"sell by\\" date...the bars were covered in fuzzy white mold.

These tastes a lot more like someone doused a date and nut bar with sour cherry juice.Too tart and WAY too sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bar ever!","review":"The cashew cookie bar is one of the best bars i have ever eaten, especially when you look at the ingredients. It is all natural with no preservatives. you cannot make a better tasting, better for you bar. I eat these on my long runs on the weekends and they seem to sustain my energy very well.

Nowhere near expiration date, not moldy or anything. I ordered a box of a different flavor to see if they have the wine taste as well.

I ordered the cherry pie flavor and it does taste like that but the texture islike you took the liquid part of cherry pie filling and made it thicker and formed it into a bar. Noactual pieces of fruit and no nuts, only a few tiny pieces scattered through out the \\"jelly\\" thatwere light in color and presumably are tiny nut flakes. This is more like the candy fruit slices yousee at the holidays than what I consider to be a fruit,nut bar. Did not like this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole foods that taste great","review":"I've tried about a dozen different Larabars, and the Cherry Pie is my favorite.

No additives. No added sugar.

I've tried the lemon and the apple pie. I've very please with them both, but I didn't have unrealistic expectations for them. We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully delicious . . .","review":"I have always enjoyed LaraBars and these cherry pie bars are delightful. Just three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries, these bars are a great texture and slightly sour cherry flavor.

This product enables me to have my \\"sweets\\" without the consequences. It's substantial & if I have two, I end up skipping a meal. (Not recommended, I know.) The consistency is slightly moist, compact, heavy; the flavor is not overly sweet, peanut butter-y and fun (it's the only way I can describe it) when you get the chocolate chip. If the bars had any more chips, they would overpower it. I only wish it was a wee bit larger. Just a wee bit because I go through three to four boxes every month."},{"rating":"2","title":"healthy and delicious","review":"if you want a healthy treat and one that is very satisfying try the lara bars. an important plus is that is soy free which is important to a lot of people these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tasty!","review":"The Cashew Cookie is my favorite flavor of the Larabar.

Will Kent follows his dream of becoming a doctor and after an initial inclination to concentrate on becoming rich and famous by marrying the promiscuous daughter of a society family, realises his true potential and joins a practice in the N.Y. slums. Eleanor Kent, married to Leo, a Jewish actor, experiences for herself the prejudice against Jews directed against her for daring to marry a Jew.

In 2002 I finally got around to reading them! All in all I loved them, but I think some of the praise in these reviews is way over the top. One big complaint I have is that each chapter title gives away what is coming, like the snippets of coming scenes in a mini-series before the commercial. I found it rather insulting. But my biggest complaint is that John Jakes is so blatantly homophobic that it would be laughable if there weren't still people in the world who will take what he says at face value. Countless times in the series there are male characters that exhibit some form of creativity (Matt comes to mind with his painting), and instantly the parents are fearful that their child will grow up to be gay. I found these passages to be extremely offensive. But other than that, they are fun to read.

This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOod and fast-paced, the action never drops","review":"But it is action with intelligence, not bubble-gum action like Hollywood always does. Costner, Hackman and all the cast is great, the ending is not very predictable. THis is the last good movie that actress Sean Young made."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Costner's First Good Films","review":"Roger Donaldson's 1987 film regarding the intrigues of the Department of Defense and the Pentagon starring Kevin Costner, Sean Young, and Gene Hackman.Costner is a navy officer and C.I.A. operative who starts having a risky relationship with the mistress (Sean Young) of the Secretary of Defense (Gene Hackman.) When the Secretary of Defense accidentally kills her, Costner is made a scape goat to cover up the potential scandal: he's accused of being a KGB mole. The story then becomes a cat-and-mouse game between the U.S. Government and Costner on the run.This is certainly one of Costner's better movies and the film carries the suspense quite well. Costner's limited acting talents are also complemented by those of Gene Hackman. This is a better movie to rent as it counts on mystery to carry the suspense which is resolved at the end of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't go anywhere, even with a star cast","review":"I kept waiting for something great to happen.. and with a better script, I am sure that Costner and Hackman would have delivered as they always do.

No Way Out is fantastic, but dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail biting stuff!!","review":"Even though this movie is getting on in years, I watched it for the first time recently and found it to be a thoroughly entertaining, suspenseful movie. One sits there hoping there WILL be a way out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"High caliber thriller!","review":"Desire and seduction, murder and cover up, scandal and intrigue, half truths and false promises of patriotism; where the duty lies beyond the flatter and the appearance must become a politically correct matter. In this sense this Neo Noir Film transcends the anecdote in a very linked similar profile with classics of the genre such as Pick Up on South Street or Kiss me deadly where the personal destinies are tied with the another dark side of the ethic.Costner is an actor who is not precisely among my favorite ones, but I must acknowledge all the possible credits for this role, the alluring, irresistible and captivating of Sean Young as Femme Fatale and the worthy acting of Will Patton plus the presence of this giant actor as Hackman making of the sophisticated villain conform a magnificent cast that support the admirable camera work of Roger Donaldson who made until now, his most interesting work.A magnificent remake of the Big Clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy for Costner fans!","review":"No Way Out is Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman at their bests. This action-packed movie has everything from romance to espionage. Kevin Costner is a naval officer who ties himself up into a world of trouble as he discovers his mistress is the same as the Secretary of Defense.The ending is truly explosive as both Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman, along with a great supporting cast, truly make this movie a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Bad Apple","review":"Some excellent musicians spoiled in my opinion by poor clarinet playing.

While the characters were colorful and fun, after a while it seemed that they were just shifted from one goofy situation to another without much linking them.William Hurt is the chef-owner of an unsuccessful restaurant when his friend Phonse comes up with a way to bring tourists to the area -- pretend a rare bird has been sighted. Hurt's performance is good but he has too many ludicrous lines to speak, and the movie never really goes anywhere. We were both very bored watching. My husband eventually read a book, and I only finished so I could write this review in good conscience.Obviously a lot of people really liked this film, so don't take my word for it, but be aware that you may find it really dull.Minimal special features: commentary track with the director; trailer; computer-generated production artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money.","review":"Massive rhythm, soaring guitars. Worth it's weight in heaviness. If you're looking for a CD that's not to commercial, but original, and really well done for a freshman release, this CD will fit the bill. Great players, great songs. I would be curious to see how they re-create this sound live. Way to go Wonderland!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda stupid.","review":"Do not be misled by the packaging of this CD: these are not songs from a quasi-underground electronic music scene in Tokyo nor do these songs possess any sort of urbane sophistication in the tradition trip-hop or European electronica. Instead, the songs on here are really silly and one ballad in particular sounds like Celine Dion on crack cocaine. I never really realized how truly awful Japanese music really is, which is sort of strange because Tokyo is one awesome city. I gave it 2 stars because I really like \\"Touch Me, Squeeze Me baby\\" by Ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off - False Advertising!","review":"The product picture shows the real MRE crackers and what you get is totally different.

If you want to know a couple along the drive trees this works. If you want to go any further this book can be misleading. I teach a lab that has a stock pile of this book and I have noticed that several of the photos have abnormal leaf photos and some of the range maps and information are off. This whole series has several problems like this.

There are better compilations of the later Funkadelic years (post-Westbound, 1976-1981). And WHY is Bootsy's photo on a Funkadelic compilation? That is a dead giveaway that this was put together for those who don't know the difference between Parliament and Funkadelic, Parlet from the Brides, the Horny Horns from the Sweat Band. Admittedly, there was a lot of overlap, but put a photo of Garry in a diaper or George by himself if this cd is to be truly representative of Funkadelic.

Even though it's categorized comedy, it contains many dramatic and true-to-life issues. The characters are lovable, fun, and incredibly entertaining. It is reality with an extra touch of zaniness and cleverness. I would definitely recommend this to any theatre-goer, especially Shanley fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminded me of the movie 'Flowers In The Attic'","review":"The review title pretty much says enough, I think. I'll say more though, to compare the plots:1. In both stories, the girls admit that they used to be quite happy, until things changed for the worst.2. A teenaged girl and her siblings are being held hostage by their evil, greedy grandmother.3. They are abused by her in ways besides being her prisoners. For example, when they do see her, she lies to them and starves them, in spite of the fact that there actually is more than enough food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Great Royal Diary","review":"I think this was a great diary.

I loved this book because it was so interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an incredible book","review":"Jahanara is a high ranking princess living in India, but life is pretty boring for her. She has an evil stepmother named Nur Mahal who is determined to destroy Jahanara's father the emperor and they have to go through extreme measures to keep him safe.But despite that, Jahanara finds some interesting things to do, including a 'flirting market' and sneaking food to eat during the holy month of Ramadan, where all devout Muslims are to fast all day.But when things take a turn for the worse, Jahanara proves herself to be worthy of the royal family of India.This book is absolutely wonderful. After I started reading, I could not put it down!Life in the harem sounded so interesting, and the historical note is very informative. You will not be disappointed with this stellar book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine look into Jahanara's life","review":"While this is different for The Royal Diaries, it is still excellent. The story tells the earlier part of Jahanara's life. She tells of how her father becomes emperor, how her two brothers return to the family, how she fears Nur Mahal (a.k.a. The Snake), and other daily life activities. She and the rest of the women were very confined, and were always behind a screen in public. Later, as Jahanara's life continues, her beloved mother dies while giving birth to Jahanara's sister. The book may be confusing at first, but after a while, it starts to become very interesting. I would recommend this if you enjoyed reading the rest in The Royal Diaries series, or if you are interested in India's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another diary","review":"well...

The plot was intriguing at first, but Lebbon played on a lot of tropes, most notably sexual violence against young girls, and it was just repetitive and uninspiring. No real character development to speak of...the dad starts off a weenie and never really becomes anything else. The daughter is a cliche, of course - an oversexed, angsty teenager with a chip on her shoulder - and the mother is a religious zealot who also experienced violence at some point in the past and who I *think* Lebbon was trying to portray as the only virtuous character in the book, which was weird. The only person who doesn't really feel like a victim - predictably and disappointingly - is the father, who again is a most unimpressive person. The characters really are a collection of two dimensional stand-ins, and the villain is rather boring and annoying rather than frightening. It was quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten and Repetitive","review":"Having mildly enjoyed Lebbon's \\"The Nature of Balance\\", I decided to give \\"Face\\" a try. Well, the beginning is quite gripping and I loved the concept of a family picking up a strange hitchhiker in the middle of a snow storm. It seems that the author started writing with this idea and didn't know where to go with it. Spelling errors aside, Lebbon repeats many of the character's thoughts over and over. Yes, we get the point, you don't need to tell us again! Anyway, having no growth with the characters and a disappointing ending, I cannot recommend this book. Tim Lebbon also seems like he's holding back with scenes, taking the easy way out with his conservative scares and sexual themes. Richard Laymon, Bentley Little, and Tom Piccirilli do it much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lebbon &#65533; Face","review":"I'm not a discriminating reader. I'll read anything and I rarely put anything down unfinished. This is one of the few exceptions in the last few years.Face is tedious at best. And I don't particularly mind tedious if there's some decent writing behind it. Sadly, Face wasn't compelling enough for me to finish. Its quite obvious that Lebbon has talent. He's got enough praise and awards to make me think he's definitely got some talent going for him. But sadly, Face doesn't display any of it. Sure, his characters are decent but I had a hard time liking or empathizing with any of them. Brand, our intrepid bad guy, is just a mystery. He's not well developed enough to hate or even to scare the reader.I've got a copy of The Nature of Balance by Lebbon on my \\"to read\\" shelf. Its been there awhile. Having attempted Face, it might just be there for a while longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the reason???","review":"There has to be a reason why Brand is terrorizing this family. You can't put 355 pgs on the basis of \\"sometimes bad things happen to good people.\\" What is that?

Ideal for teh first year student but a usefull helper for those who are finishing their studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things you need to know before the world ends.........","review":"\\"The Illuminati\\" is a wonderful journey through the depths of our mortality. It is the story of a worn out preacher and his fight agianst Death and the Devil. Before his last moments on this earth he wants to teach his young apprentice about how to fight the evils of the world. The play consists of many zany turns because the preacher's dreams are actually acted out. Although confusing at times these twists are quite humorous. Being that I've played the part of the old preacher, Reverend Eddie, I know how fun it is to reach the depths of this script. So If you like plays and good theatre \\"The Illuminati\\" is a must read!Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I've recently discovered Bannister's Brodie Farrell series and now I can't get enough. Unlike other reviewers, I found this book completely engaging and full of surprises. For example, the major characters reveal complex personalities not portrayed in earlier books. I liked all the characters in The Depths of Solitude, including the bad guys, and I even enjoyed the sometimes cloyingly sincere Daniel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift of Friendship","review":"It is an excellent book.

I have all of the books written by Coats. I have also begun my own research into the inventions of Viktor Schauberger using Coats' work as a starting point. This video, although slightly \\"slow\\" paced is a great addition to your study material on Schauberger. I wish there was more on the inventions, which are not really mentioned, however, the video does delve into the inner workings of how Coats became fascinated with Schauberger's work. It is more based on the vortex and implosion material that appears in \\"Living Energies\\" and the \\"Water Wizard\\" in the book series. All in all, this video set gives a more thorough understanding of Viktor's work and I would say - buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice look, about the size of a tea cup.","review":"The title says it. They are clear glass with a stainless steel saucer, so they really show off the beverage. They are about the size of a fancy tea cup, so not really appropriate for people who like big mugs of drip. It's also bigger than the demitasse espresso shot cups. It's about right for a cup of tea or for French press coffee.They've been pretty durable, but I have not abused them. I hand wash, but the glass is pretty durable. I'd pay attention to not scratching the saucers. No problem yet, but scratches would show up pretty clearly if it were to happen. I'm guessing they'd scratch if I left them on the bottom of a sink full of knives, forks and other dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth's best effort in years....","review":".....and that's sayig a lot! I have never been disappointed by any of his stuff, yet, like the other reviewers, I must say this one is more country than his past two. This one is awesome! It's rare that I like EVERY single track on a CD, but all 14 (yep, 14) songs are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memorable - with a short shelf life.","review":"After all the hoopla related with Chris Gaines, I was drawn to study this album since it was his last studio album before the Chris Gaines release. The first thing that is striking about Sevens is its short shelf life. It came out about the same time Shania Twain's Come on Over was released. Come On Over is still doing well on the charts while Sevens is history. Why? Sevens just doesn't have a strong theme nor any stand out songs. I still enjoy the Chase because of its strong song selection. But Sevens is another story - it is contrived and made to sound country. The overall feel is there - but the heart and soul is far, far away. And that is probably why the album is all but forgotten. Save your money on this one! Go back about six years and you'll get more for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Once again Chris Gaines shows why holding his guitar is better than playing it. Leave that for real guatar players like Eric Clapton or even Roy Clark. Sevens starts promising, but by the third beat goes straight down hill and never recovers. Sappy, sill songs on Sevens - suck. Take \\"I Don't Have To Wonder\\" please. Also, \\"Do What You Gotta Do\\" is only a sample of the CD's atrocious attempt to satisfy the musically uneducated. Well, Garth, I gotta do what I gotta do - and that is use this CD as a frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Garth really knows now what he wants to do..and that is...sing pop music. It's too bad he has turned the way he has. Garth really had a few great albums in the beginning of his career. His first (self-titled) album shone in the \\"country\\" music department. Songs like \\"how you ever gonna know\\" sound like today's pop music that Garth brought into the world today. The only two songs on this album worth listening to are \\"Longneck Bottle\\" and \\"Beleau Wood.\\" With the latter not being a country song but a very beautiful listen...with a good message. Longneck is the only true country song on the album and that probably is because of Steve Warriner. Garth, I hope you come back..you had such talent...it hurts to see it wasted"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth, Garth, Garth what a talent in my time.","review":"Garth Brooks is an all time Favorite of mine and my boyfriends we togather lack a few of his CDS.

Garth Brooks is far superior at The business of being Garth, than he could even pretend to be as a musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Garth CD Yet","review":"In my opinion, \\"Sevens\\" is Garth's worst CD yet, a real shame considering all of the hubbub he created in Nashville trying to get it released. This CD lacks the powerful songs on his earlier releases, like \\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\\", \\"What She's Doing Now\\" or \\"Learning To Live Again\\". At the same time, it also lacks the upbeat crowd pleasers like \\"Papa Loved Mama\\", \\"Rodeo\\" or \\"Two of a Kind (Working on a Full House)\\". For the most part, I found the CD decidedly UN-country, another example of Garth's selling out the gods of pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"seven, six, five, four, three, two ONE","review":"Should have been called ONES.

Country fan or no, this is one album you may want to pick up. A little bit of this and a little bit of that combine to make \\"SEVENS\\" one of his best efforts since \\"ROPIN' THE WIND\\". As loyal as he is to country music, he manages to choose and record quality songs, with lyrics that go well beyond any narrow musical barriers. Listening to any of his new music is like opening a Christmas present; you're almost positive you know what you're getting, and when you open it and discover it's nothing you ever imagined, you realize it's better than you could have expected! Give it a shot! Good music is good music, no matter what kind of hat the singer wears."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!!!!","review":"Garth Brook is an awsome singer, number one. Number two, this, I think, is his best CD ever. The songs, \\"Do What You Gotta Do\\", \\"Bellau Wood\\", and \\"When There's No One Around\\", are my all time favs. They really touch somewhere, that other songs don't even come close to. I was so entrigued by this CD, that I just had to get the piano music for it! I'm still trying to find a place or website that has it. If you know of anyplace that does have it, please E-mail me. Thanks, greatly appreciated. If there is one CD that I could keep 'till the end of time, this would be it.

Nothing Garth does (in the country music world, that is) is ever really bad. Some of the songs are a bit cheesy but some are really good. My favorite is \\"Belleau Wood\\", and as a history major I appreciate the significance of it. But would someone please tell David Cantwell (Amazon reviewer) and all the other websites that copied and pasted his review that the Battle of Belleau Wood/The Christmas Truce of Belleau Wood happened in the FIRST World War, not the second. It was a real standout moment in the War and this song does a lot to commemorate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-impact and fun","review":"I'm 54 years old, have arthritis, but I want to be healthy and strong as I age. So, I've been looking for a good, low-impact workout. I saw Jane Fonda's workouts at Target and decided to try them.

Thanks Jane!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Impact Fun","review":"I bought this for a low impact alternative to walking outside on days when the weather is bad.

Jane knows that and has designed this low impact workout just for people like me. I'm way past the point where I'm going to do any workout with \\"steel,\\" \\"blast,\\" or \\"ripped\\" in the title. If you are expecting the 1980's Jane Fonda workout, you will be disappointed, but I wasn't expecting that from a 70+ year-old.I like this workout and it makes me work up a sweat. My only criticisms are that the music is a little dull and there are no floor exercises like leg lifts or ab crunches that I need.

However, I wished that she would've taught the moves a little slower at first and then worked her way to the full set which is why I only rated this DVD a four. I had to play each dance segment more than a few times to catch on. Other than that, the excercises are fun to do. I am in my late fifties so I found it easy and not too \\"aerobic\\". Just enough movement to make me sweat a little and feel I am getting a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow workout!","review":"Great workout for seniors.

I lost that weight over the past 6 months by walking 10,000 steps a day on my treadmill. Boring but effective. Santa brought this tape and I just completed it for the first time. Fun and doable in spite of my 61 year old body. In the extras Jane provides a 10 minute meditation with breathing exercises.

She does a good job of demonstrating the simple moves, and encourages you to warm up and cool down. Even though this is a low impact workout your muscles will feel stretched and your heartrate will increase. My one complaint: I can't hear the music! Ms. Fonda is showing you dance moves and telling you to feel the rhythm and have fun, but I can't hear the music. I have found this on other instructors' work out tapes also, you can't hear the music. I would love to feel the rhythm but the music is so much a part of the background I only hear Ms. Fonda's instructions. Kinda frustrating and disappointing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Fonda Prime Time","review":"This video seems at first like it is too easy but you really do get an arobic exercise from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO firm or burn","review":"O chose this rating because there was ZERO calorie burning in this video.

So glad I did. I have been alternating the videos, which are very different.I selected the full 40 minutes of workout time on each video and realized how out of shape I was. Firm & Burn Low Impact Cardio was the toughest. Perspiration was running down the sides of my face along with a full body sweat. Phew! Trim Tone & Flex truly works most muscles in the upper and lower body. I can tell which muscles are the strongest or weakest. I am definitely on my way to a healthier me.Thanks Jane for thinking of people that are really out of shape or need to bounce back from a health issue!

This one is perfect for just that, especially for someone who likes to dance. While it could be a bit more \\"dancified\\", it does have good genre music that encourages easing into fitness. While I still do not love exercising, this DVD is not something I dread - may not sound like high praise, but from a former couch potato, it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly effective!","review":"It is targeted for a \\"mature\\" audience and it works well.

Jerry tears it up. Disk 2 by far steals the show. Uncle John's is great but when they move into Estimated, you better hold on because Jerry's solo gives me chill bumps every time I hear this. All in all, this is a great pick. If you like Brent and his Hammond, then this is a must have. It is early in Brent's career with the Boy's, but you can't tell, because he doesn't miss a lick...very tight...and if you think I'm kiddin', skip striaght to Shakedown on the third disk, it seems as if Brent has been playin with the Dead his whole life, when actually it had only been a couple of months...a must have for any true head"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"the book is interesting! is one of the required book for my class and the only one i read because it caught me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is not Mandelbaum","review":"The stars are for the Kindle link, which is bad advertising.

As far as I can tell, there is no Kindle version of Mandelbaum. The Riley text is tedious; footnotes and explanations follow each fable.

Fun too bad there's not a option for a higher quality version, would be worth paying for, Love the 12mm-24mm Lens I bought from them though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change up!","review":"I have the Pentax 12-24 lens already, but found that I really wanted something that was going to offer another perspective. The DA 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 ED(IF) by Pentax offers a fish-eye look at 10mm while having minimal distortion by 17mm. Colors are great (as is typical w/ Pentax lenses) and the sharpness of this lens is excellent. There are some scenes where a fisheye is just fun and adds interest to the picture. Definately not an all purpose lens, but it's so small and light it's easy to have in the bag for when the situation warrants it.Only downside is that adding a filter on it is pretty much impossible as the integrated lens hood combined w. the ultrawide field of view makes using a filter much more difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lens","review":"My very happy with my new camera lens.

While Keava is surprising - and I didn't care for it from the photograph - when I saw it made up, immediately bought the wool.

The curved hooks of the chair actually sticks out on either side of the bag. The bag does not fully enclose the chair like it is pictured. It does make it cumbersome to use because if you don't ensure the screws are locked, the sides will slide out if the bag is tilted or turned upside down.

Great for snapshots when you just need a portable camera and camcorder and just don't feel like packing two.Low light conditions have limitations, but similar to regular camcorders in darkness of video.No mount for external camcorder light.Very small, fits the hand better than the MC100 by JVC.Similar in size to JVCs hard drive only camcorders, but you can access video and photos without connecting to this camcorder (by removing the CF and SD cards)."},{"rating":"1","title":"product just ok - using it is a nightmare","review":"I bought this camera to video my new born, and catch him in all his new stages. I now have a lot of video I can only view on my computer. It records ok in full sun and very badly in poor light. But the biggest problem is that all files are MOD files and most software will not recognize MOD, so you have to convert it. Now, I am not super techno savvy but I am not a dolt either, and I had a good deal of trouble managing this. Then if you want to add music or anything the software bundle that they include is truly pathetic. And then it is nearly impossible to take what you have made and play it on anything else. Do not buy this camera unless you know exactly what and how to do things. Look for a more layman-friendly product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect except in low light","review":"Pros:- Great video quality if the light is good- Great sound quality if the person shooting doesn't talk too loud- Great size- Massive convenience of not having to rip and encode videoCons:- Terrible (useless) video quality in low light- Cannot focus in low light (making even still photos with flash difficult)- Sensitive mike results in audio distortion is person shooting talks loudly- S-l-o-w cold start- No flash shoe or tripod mountThe above pretty much sums up all that is good/bad with this camera. If it worked better in low light I'd give it five stars.One tip - the camera produces MPEG2 video with AC3 audio (not MP2), in files with a .MOD suffix. You can rename these to .MPG to play them, but many players will not handle the AC3 sound. There is a free tool to fix this. Amazon won't let me include a link but search for Converio and you should find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment due to its limited perspective","review":"As a parent new to the idea of homeschooling, I was hoping that the Homeschooling Book of Answers would provide me with a broad scope of ideas and opinions on the subject. Although it proports to encompass the views of \\"39 respected mentors,\\" all 39 come from the same educational philosophy; each question is answered by several people, but all of the answers are maddeningly similar. The contributors share an \\"unschooling\\" philosophy, which often means not only that they believe in \\"child-centered learning\\" but also in not teaching at all and in the idea that schooling is inherently bad. Anyone looking for a balanced view that represents a range of homeschooling philosophies, families, and experiences had best look elsewhere. One recommendation is David Guterson's Family Matters, an excellent, intelligent, balanced primer on the subject of whether or not to homeschool, beautifully written by a high school teacher/homeschooling father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homeschooling Does Not Equal Unschooling!","review":"The purpose of Dobson's book is to present \\"homeschooling\\" as synonymous with \\"unschooling,\\" the radical philosophy put forth by the late John Holt. The \\"respected voices\\" Dobson touts as her collective authority on homeschooling may be respected in UNschooling circles, but they are most certainly NOT representative of the homeschooling community at large. Dobson's book is designed to mainstream the radical unschooling philosophy and pass it off as homeschooling. It's a very misleading book which should have been titled, \\"The UNschooling Book of Answers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Others are right; this book is about unschooling","review":"I agree with other reviewers who remarked that the book is not so much about homeschooling as it is about (the more radical) unschooling. The book also assumes that a parent would turn to homeschooling out of a mistrust or distaste for public schooling, which is not always the case. Finally, the book doesn't give an even-handed assessment of how difficult a choice this can be for a family to make. All in all, it's highly biased towards unschooling; I would advise people to consider other books first."},{"rating":"1","title":"very misleading title-NOT about homeschooling","review":"This book is not at all helpful to anyone who wants to homeschool and learn more how to get started doing that. This book is about unschooling, a technique I do not agree with and am not interested in doing. I was very disappointed, it didn't answer one of my questions. It reminds me of a talk-show written in book form."},{"rating":"2","title":"The military's role in Modern Canada","review":"I'm a Yank, but I was in Somalia at the time the Somali was murdered. This book describes both the incident in good detail and the (disgraceful) disbanding of the CAR, but also addresses the larger issue of the role of the military in modern Canadian society. The author notes that with recent defense cutbacks and a deemphasizing of the old values and professionalism that had made Canada successful in battles like that of Vimy Ridge in WWI, that Canada may no longer seen, internationally, as a country deserving respect.All of the author's points are well written and valid (and hopefully someone in Ottawa has read this book...), but I deducted a star because he does not mention the role that melafloquine, an anti-malarial drug that was taken in Somalia, may have played in the murder.-Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bercuson's best military books","review":"Bercuson has obviously used his past research to good effect in this volume (he even quotes one of the WWII Calgary Highlanders he interviewed for BATTALION OF HEROES early on in this one.) Bercuson demonstrates a solid grasp on the social and political history of the Canadian Army, tracing its roots to the middle ages, in an easy to read and well written book. This is not just a description of the murder committed in Somalia, but a detailed look at why the Army has come to be the way it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on Target","review":"This is a very informative book on many forms of bullying.

Reading this will enable the reader to identify bullying from everyday conversations, in workplace realtions, during TV programs and it is like opening the eyes to a new world of understanding. The list of actions that identify a bully, plus the list of actions available to counter bullying are remarkable and have come from studying victims of this rampant \\"disease\\".

I use this lotion on my son and love the way it makes his skin feel. It is not heavy, is absorbed quickly and makes his skin soft and not greasy. The one thing I did not like was the smell, at first. I do like it now, the problem most people have is the fact that this lotion does not have actual perfume in it, it has the actual scent of the herbs. Most commercial bath products that have a lavender scent, though it is a perfumed version of lavender, not the actual plant's essence. I also wish the bottle was bigger, if I use it too, we run out quite quickly, though I think the company offers larger sizes on their website. This product is definitely great, especially for those who do not want to use products with artificial ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!

However, the manufacturing quality of these earplugs has diminished over time. The earplugs length has gotten shorter and shorter. Consequentially, the sound attenuation is less effective now. Also, it is easier for these shorter earplugs to get stuck in the ear canal. On top of that, I think they changed the foam type used in the earplugs to a type of foam with poorer attenuation characteristics. I suspect these were all cost cutting measures. But, the consequences might be hearing loss for those people who use the earplugs to protect their ears from high decibel environments.

But then after a few moments that wonderful plug began to expand and completely fill my canal. I can only say the feeling of that foamy plug expanding against the inner walls of my ear canal was exquisite. Finally as the widening of the ear plug was completed, all sound ceased to exist and I was thrust into audio deprevation...AMAZING !!!!After a few minutes to compose my self I began the process, much more slowly in my right ear.

I really appreciated the insight into the early part of her career.<<<26 years, and who on Earth has the right to criticize?As far as I'm concerned, if she truly loves Renee, then it only makes sense that they married. It is no ones' right to discriminate something simply because it is uncommon, especially something this personal, and in this day and age.There have been lots of false things written about this woman, but this is by far the worst ever!!!!

Out of the half dozen bios on her which I've read nothing comes close to giving such a fair account. Bravo and congratulation to the author for providing us with such a well-balanced book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this book to the bookstore to get my money back.","review":"I live in Montreal, so I know the \\"real\\" stuff about Celine Dion. This book is useless. I was laughing throughout it. Yes, how can they know about what goes on in the hot tub on their honeymoon giving word for word quotes. Proposterous! Incredibly suspicious and I too found the songs had wrong names or dates were wrong. I didn't take this book seriously and would never have this pint-sized little handbook of lies in my library. It just wouldn't fit in with the other reputable books.I returned it because I wouldn't want to contribute to the evils of society. Shame on the author. I do not recommend that anyone buys this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Mostly False","review":"This book portrays Celine Dion in a very negative way overall. The lasting impression that one has at the end is that she is a weak person with very little inner strength and self esteem. This is not so. You can tell that almost everything, with the exception of a few things, is false in this book. The auther is incorrect on very basic facts on Celine, so what can he know about supposedly secret ones. Read this book if you want, but know that the whole story is made up. I recommend reading the authorized biography which gives a great amount of insight into and information about Celine's life and career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine Behind the Fairytale","review":"First of all...she is NOT anorexic! Who cares what the cousin of the ex housekeepers long lost brother in law said. All this is based on loose gossip and to honestly print this information as fact is ridiculus. Why don't you write for a tabloid because thats obviously the gutter from which your thoughts are conceived.

Ian Halperin doesn't care about Celine or anyone he mentioned in the book. Celine luvs Rene and her life and she would never try to commit suicide, and SHE'S NOT ANOREXIC!!! if you want a good bio, read tour de force by hebert georges-germain, or it's canadian version called Celine also by hebert, it's the only authorized book out there, and very good! email me for more info if you'd like"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book!","review":"I order this book because I thought it would give me a different perspective about Celine and Rene's life together. This book is so inaccurate and full of gossip with no valid fact, \\"a maid who use to work for Celine said this, a musician who use to work for the couple said that.\\" The author claims to be a \\"investigative reporter\\".

However, if you read it carefully it makes sense and a lot of these allegations have since been repeated in the press. Celine is great, as the author repeatedly points out, but the people around her are control freak and take advantage of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Poor Céline! How could anyone believe, let alone write any of this junk about our beloved chanteuse? And let me say once and for all, because I'm sick of hearing it...SHE IS NOT ANOREXIC!!!!! If you have ever seen that girl eat, you know that's true...she loves food. I don't think she could be anorexic. And suicide attempts, please. She's always smiling. She is an inspiration and role model to people everywhere. Don't believe a word of this FICTION NOVEL. If you want her real life story read her official bio, or if you don't speak french, try the Barry Grills one Falling Into You. It's not as excellent as the official one, but better than this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a buch of lies...","review":"I'm from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I watched Celine from 14 y/o till today. I'm not a big fan but we have to give her her wonderfull talent, great voice and all the success she had. The rest is all wrong, what do you want it's not because your an author that you're smart. That guy just want to make a few bucks fast.

As where before he hinted at his vision he fully brings it forth from the shadows. This book is brilliantly thought out and executed. A masterpiece of photography regardless of the subject matter. The composition goes beyond its erotic context to show the full visual impact of what is being photographed. It's less about the erotica than actually capturing a feel, a moment , art!! Masterfully executed! A MUST for any erotic photography collection. the book does have it's shortcoming as at times the actual surrounding setting the picture is taken in is slightly \\"everyday\\". Some of the pictures could benefit from better sizing as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for families","review":"This is a nice little book for family devotions. It was published in 1976 which is evident in the art work mostly. The devotions are still very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advent devotion","review":"This is the first year that we've used an Advent devotional book and we've enjoyed \\"We Light the Candles\\". Some of the devotions are a bit too involved for our 3 year old but generally the devotions are simple and good. If you are looking for a deep and insightful Advent devotional for adults and older children, this may not be a good fit but is probably ideally suited for families with children ages 4-10."},{"rating":"2","title":"We light the Candles","review":"Someone gave us this book when our children were young, and it made Christmas very special for them. Chidlren love to light the candles every night and then you read the devotional to them. Now our children are using it with our grandchildren and they love it, too. Excellent book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful CD","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer who compared this to the Buena Vista Social Club and the Afro Cuban All Stars CDs. As a person with over 600 CDs in my collection, I can clearly say that this is one of the best and as good as the Afro Cuban All Stars two previous releases which were also outstanding. Well recorded and mixed, this CD will give you a smile and will get you on your feet. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dictionary, ok software","review":"Before purchasing I did a lot of reading and felt this was the best out there for a Spanish-English CD, and I am not disappointed.With the other reviews I agree that the thoroughness of this dictionary is outstanding. Most words are put in a variety of contexts to show different usages including common idiomatic expressions and regional expressions according to country. I use it daily as an essential tool in studying Spanish.However, as a sofware product at $50 it is pretty lousy. The design is clumsy. The search is awkward and very limited, that is, you can't look up combinations of words in quotes. Still, all things considered, this does not hold it back from being worth the price. For the basics it's very easy to use and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oxford Spanish Dictionary - CD-ROM","review":"If you are serious about learning/improving your Spanish, buy it! This is a Spanish/English English/Spanish Dictionary. It is wonderful because not only does it have tons of entris but it seems to have examples for all if not most of its entreis. Example, say you want to learn the word \\"flat\\" in spanish. It will give you English sentences or phrases for the various connotations of the word \\"flat\\" and it will have the spanish translation for each of the English connotations! This is great becaus you'll know that your getting the right Spanish word for the concept you want to convey."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this book was way too techincial. i could barely understand it and i am a full fledged figure skater! yup, i even skate 5 days a week, and this book is a big bore even for me. the author seemed to think tara was perfect but michelle was a clunky old wanna be.

A must for all Dalida fans or those who want to know her. Having this CD is like having Dalida with you wherever you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxed...not meant for the charts.","review":"This CD was not exactly \\"Beatles-inspired\\" as it claims to be. If you're a fan of Paul's musical genius, you might be a bit disappointed. However, as the other cd-raters wrote, he was taking it easy and just writing happy-thoughts. No pop-chart-worthy tracks, but still an excellent listening pleasure.PAUL IS STILL GEAR AND FAB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly solid songs, good production, embarrasing lyrics","review":"Alright, I'm kind of a Macca freak, but not uncritical. I though Flowers In the Dirt was a good to great album - this one is not quite there, but still good. The production is pretty retro as he retreats from the stylish sound of 'Flowers' (and to a lesser extent 'Off the Ground') to a more basic 'Beatley', immediate recording sound. The songs are mostly good, a few he could toss off in his sleep, and all, maybe save 'Heaven on a Sunday', again hearken back to his older compositional styles. The lyrics are often cringe-inducing though, so I'd never play this to unsympathetic friends to try to prove something. Probably the best moments are 'Souvenir', 'World Tonight', 'Song We Were Singing', 'Great Day'. C'mon Paul - there's plenty who love you and you're killer melodic instinct, so do us all a favor and push yourself! Or at least hook up with Costello again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I love the Flaming Pie album.","review":"The reason why I love this album is because I am a big fan of Paul McCartney and I have heard the story and I thought of John when I heard it.I was 14 when it came out and shortly after it was released I went to the music store and got it and I just love all of the pictures in the book inside!They really took alot of time with it and when Ringo and Paul's son James got in the album it had great meaning to some of the songs.Go get this album and you will see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calico Skies - What A Ditty","review":"McCartney's well of course dried up thirty years ago, but then along comes Calico Skies, a fantastic tune that would be right in place on the White Album. But don't buy Flaming Pie (an otherwise suckified album) to get it - get ahold of the live version of the song that appears on Back In The World - it is much better. However, the lovely rich tonality of Mick's guitar on the studio version is definitely something worth checking out, for those in the crowd that care about such things (even if the track sounds about one notch above a demo vocally).Man, this was so nice to hear after such a dry spell - I've worn the threads off this song playing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, underrated McCartney","review":"I'm a George man first, but this effort from McCartney pushed its way into my CD changer and never left. Historically, it got buried a little bit between the Anthology tsunami and Linda's passing, but the music itself stands with anything Paul has released in the last 20 years.There are excellent rockers like \\"If You Wanna\\" (Steve Miller on guitar), \\"Young Boy\\" (James McCartney (!) on guitar), and the title track.Linda would die less than a year after Flaming Pie's release, and that knowledge makes the acoustic 'Calico Skies' poignant and affecting. It sounds very much like a good-bye, done in a beautiful, understated manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"just lovely music","review":"Great collection of wonderful songs that really represent the best of Paul and his music. Has been a favorite of mine since the original release."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Paul McCartney's best albums","review":"For me, Flaming Pie ranks among Paul McCartney's best albums. Overall, the songs are enjoyable to listen to, and the album includes relaxing sounds (such as Heaven on a Sunday, Souvenir, and Little Willow) to a more upbeat, rocking sound (such as The World Tonight, If You Wanna, Used To Be Bad, and the others).This album is a good mix of songs, showing McCartney's diverse style and writing abilities, and is good to listen to on a relaxing Sunday afternoon or any time. It's definately one of McCartney's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Since the Beatles","review":"Having recently bought this album, I can honestly say it is the only one of McCartney's that comes even close to those of The Beatles. I enjoy a lot of his solo work, but never have I discovered an album that I ENTIRELY ENJOY. On all the others there are the crappy samey songs that obviously either seemed like a good idea at the time or just show a lack of imagination.This one is different. \\"The Song We Were Singing\\" is a remarkabley simple song, yet brilliant. \\"Somedays\\" could quite easily appear on a Beatles album, with Lennon singing backing vocals. In fact in reminds me strongly of \\"For No One\\" or \\"She's Leaving Home\\". \\"Calico Skies\\" and \\"Little Willow\\" also recall the greatness of the Beatles, and with Ringo on backing vocals on \\"Beautiful Night\\" it is as close to Beatles perfection as Mcartney has ever got, or is likely to get. His more recent efforts simply do not compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"What May Be More Impressive Than The Songs....","review":"And this is absolutely my opinion...is the booklet that comes with the CD. Not only does it give the usual liner notes of who played on what and where, but also personal notes from Paul on and about each of the songs here. That made it more of a listening pleasure for me, even though, once again in my opinion, there are a few clunkers here.Fresh from the Beatles \\"Anthology\\" project, it's just Paul & Jeff Lynne, mostly (though not over-produced, as Lynne has done in the past) with contributions from Steve Miller, McCartney's son, James, Ringo Starr, George Martin and, of course, his lovely Linda.The \\"best's\\" for me here are:\\"The Song That We Were Singing\\" \\"Young Boy\\" \\"Calico Skies\\" \\"Flaming Pie\\" \\"Souvenir\\" \\"Little Willow\\" \\"Beautiful Night\\"Not my favorite McCartney CD, but still one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece minus 2","review":"I found this album to be very enyoyable. However, I feel that it falls short of it's potential because of the inclusion of Used to be Bad and Ready to Love. These songs are not terrible but they just do not fit well with the rest of the material. Does every song have to be great to make a great album??? No, in fact, IF You Wanna and Great Day are average tunes but they flow well with the other songs and make sense within the context of the album. That said, I still highly recommend this CD and hope Sir Paul has a few more up his sleeve. Long Live!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album","review":"After reading the other reviews I have to agree with most, but unlike the other reviews I think \\"Used to be bad\\" and \\"Flaming Pie\\" are the best songs on the album. Yes there is some filling on the album but there are 14 songs, so that leaves alot of very good material to listen too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably, his best album ever!!","review":"I must say, this album is a jewel. From folk to progressive numbers, this album may show all the music routes he had tasted over the years. And fortunately enough, it also has great lyrics. \\"Somedays\\" is heart-breaking, so does \\"Young boy\\" (kind a father-to-son song). And the supersub \\"Beautiful night\\" should be the new standard Paul would consider when he might go on and release (I truly hope so) a new album. But even if he doesn't release any other record, this a great ending for such an incredible career. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE OF McCARTNEY'S BEST IN A LONG TIME.","review":"Thank's for a great cd. Paul McCartney's Flaming Pieis a cd that sounds like the old Paul I'm use to. I hopehe will continue to write more song's like this. I recommend it to any one who loved the Beatles music, and Paul McCartney.The cd came perfectly shipped as seller promised, and veryquick in sending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant, once again.","review":"I know a lot of people say that Flaming Pie doesn't live up to the standards of Sir Paul's previous material, but I personally think that Flaming Pie is my favourite of his albums. It's got everything on, from the beautifully haunting melody and guitar backing of 'Little Willow' to the driving energetic Rock 'n' Roll of 'Used to be Bad'. It's a very varied album, and I think that anyone who says they don't like McCartney should listen to this. Absoluteley brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I understand wanting to like anything new by Paul. But really five stars for this???? I gave it two just because he is McCartney and I'm a big fan..but really almost all of this is trite and not among his best work. Little Willow, Young Boy being the exceptions. To check out some of his best, look to: McCartney, Band on the Run even Back to the Egg. Still, it's too early to write the man off just yet. Run Devil Run was his best album in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I think that Flaming Pie is an awesome CD. It's by far one of Paul's best in a while. There aren't any songs that I skip over. Young Boy is definitely one of my favorites. Calico Skies is going to be my wedding song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mostly great album","review":"I really enjoyed much of this album. A few of the songs such as \\"If You Wanna\\", \\"Used To Be GBad\\" and \\"Really Love You\\" seemed like throw away songs. However, \\"Beautiful Night\\", \\"Souvenir\\", \\"Heaven On A Sunday\\" and \\"Somedays\\" are really good. All though maybe a little over-produced at times. \\"Flaming Pie\\" is a fun song to listen to. I think Paul would have had better look reaching and adult contemporary audience by releasing songs like \\"Souvenir\\" etc... as singles instead of the light pop of \\"Young Boy\\" and \\"The World Tonight.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Does It Again","review":"This album blows away everything Paul did since the underrated Give My Regards To Broad Street album. Some of the tracks are hauntingly beautiful, such as Somedays and Little Willow. Beautiful Night may very well be among the best songs Paul has ever done (and that's saying something), although some have said it was overdone. While the ballads are great, Sir Paul also rocks out on this album with The World Tonight, Young Boy, and Flaming Pie. However, a McCartney album wouldn't be a McCartney album if it didn't have pointless filler tracks on it. The Steve Miller collaboration Used to Be Bad and the Ringo Starr collaboration Really Love You are boring at best. However, the album is also redeemed by acoustic-oriented pieces such as The Song We Were Singing, Calico Skies, and Heaven on a Sunday. Overall, this ablum is the definitive one for the Paul McCartney of the 1990's, and is most certainly worthy of \\"that other band he was in\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, heartfelt return to real pop","review":"While I have to admit to being such a Beatles fan that I'm predisposed to buy a lot of solo ex-Beatle music, I also have to admit that I've been disappointed with a lot of it, and probably with Paul's more than the rest. Each album has a gem or two, or possibly several, but few of Paul's solo efforts are great as a whole. \\"Flaming Pie\\" ranks up there with \\"McCartney\\", \\"Band on the Run\\", and perhaps as someone else mentioned, \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\". It has a more honest, sincere, down- to-earth feel than many of his solo CD's, coupled with a more spare sound. The addition of Ringo (particularly on the coda to \\"Beautiful Night\\"), Steve Miller and Jeff Lynne all add spice to this Pie, but Paul's still the chef, and this is puts him back on the menu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Paul's comments about each song","review":"This is, perhaps one of Paul's greatest achievements since Band on the Run. The depth, or is it greatness, of his talent runs throughout every song on this CD. Do yourself a favor, get the most of this CD by reading Paul's comments about each song as your listen to this masterpiece. Subsequent listenings will be enriched by this information. Paul continues to amaze me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD","review":"Don't try to tell me that this isn't Paul Mccartney's best album ever. It beats most Beatles work! There is not a single song on this album not worth listening to! All of Mccartney's other albums have one or two legendary songs on them, and the rest [are not so great], but this is one ...exception! It could use a little bit more electric guitar, but I'm not going to start. If you don't have this album, no matter who you are, GET IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"are u shure this isnt a lost beatles album??","review":"this is in my opinion the best album released in 97. yiung boy, the world to night and so many others make this a mccarntey classic! this is a great album. its so good your gonna think u are in the middle of the sixities with paul and the beatles at there prime!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and fun","review":"This may not be the absolute best Paul ever made (Ram, Band on the run...) but it's a real fun album, cause you feel by listening to it he had fun making it, and that he didn't spent six months on every song and every sound. Which is an attitude I quite like. Songs like \\"Really love you\\" could be called filler, of course, but they're in the spirit of the album. And it's Ringo drumming on this song so... But \\"Young Boy\\" is so good, from the guitar intro to the last note, it has such a great sound ! I could listen to it on and on. And what about beautiful ballads like \\"Calico skies\\", \\"Great day\\" or \\"Somedays\\" ? Who else can write songs like that nowadays ? I love this one ! Thanks Paul for everything !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"There is the inveitable dead weight that comes from just messing about, but for the most part Paul is offering up some remarkably good tunes here, simply and clearly produced, at times masterful, and always fun. \\"Young Boy\\" is a particular hit. Liner notes by Mark Lewisohn are so detailed you'd think this was a reissue of an old classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one but Paul","review":"I have been discovering Paul's post-Beatle work mostly in reverse order, starting with \\"Memory Almost Full\\" and working backwards. And I am impressed. \\"Flaming Pie\\" is a bit inconsistent, but the best songs are truly first rate, and the worst would be considered \\"good\\" by the standards of most other pop stars. For our era, Paul stands alone as a songwriter. He is our Schubert, our Gershwin. I only wish that more people could appreciate the genius that we have in our midst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer Friendly","review":"If it was readable it might be a good book for the beginner.

I paid 4 dollars for a used copy, and I think I overpaid by about 10 dollars. I feel that the makers of this movie owe me 6 dollars for wasting my time. I will never get those two hours I spent watching this movie back. The acting was terrible, the effects were terrible, the movie was terrible. I usually like stupid teen movies, but this one was too much even for me. It was a waste of time and money. DO NOT buy this movie; if you do, believe me, you will be angry with yourself not only for wasting your time and money, but also for not listening to this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU FIVE STAR PEOPLE?","review":"It's not a scarymovie, this comedy still sucks. It's not really even funny, the Comedy is a zero...and the characters are crappy ones...the one who don't know how to act.

Not as funny as it could have been, but very funny none-the-less. It had a good plot and some of the jokes were original, and smart. If you like Airplane or Hot Shots, you will love this movie. If you like a funny, but not a leaveyourbrainatthedoor funny, try scary movie. To me, Scary Movie was better. Probably because \\"Shriek...\\" was made for tv while Scary Movie was made for theaters. Go out and get it, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems like scary movie","review":"i wonder if this is a rip off of a rip off well, it is and its pretty bad to beat and not funny at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"I know what I did last Friday night: watched this movie","review":"I thought \\"Shriek...\\" was hilarious.

GO SEE SCARY MOVIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Sewage","review":"I watched this flick on USA because it sounded reminiscent of the much funnier \\"Student Bodies\\". Not quite. It was boring,stupid and I did not like the teen-age characters.Tom Arnold was a bore too. Fans of true slasher films will be disgusted. The \\"Scream\\" take-off was overdone too.

Should be a clue to anyone who stuck around that long in the theater that it's time to ditch the movie. The jokes and dialog are half rate and so obvious that originality of any kind flew out the window. I suppose that if I were 13, I'd get some sort of kick out of it, but these days, I wait for a movie like this one to make it to DVD and rent one and get this one free for five nights.

Yes it's been done. But still, we couldn't help but laugh all the way through this movie. It's a perfect movie to watch with the older kids (around age 14 or so). I'm glad I bought it instead of just renting it. It'll be one of our Halloween staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad","review":"I cannot believe that anybody could find this funny. Just throwing in a reference to every movie ever made isn't funny, you actually have to do something with it. They have even managed to make Tom Arnold unfunny(not easy). I am not a snob and I love stupid films such as TOP SECRET, NAKED GUN, THEY CALL ME BRUCE and the film that this couldn't even hope to get close to, STUDENT BODIES. If you want a spoof of horror films see that, not this(don't even think about it).PS, the guy who plays the part of Dawson is possibly the worst actor I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then Scary Movie","review":"I actually liked this better then Scary movie and then found out it actually was in production first too and got kinda screwed when Scary Movie came out first. This parody reminds me more of the original horror parody Student Bodies from the early 80's then the more raunchy Scary Movie did. These types of movie always have people that love or hate them so I am not surprised by the vastly different reviews on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me yawn.....","review":"who can enjoy a movie like this, at first i was tired when i watched it, a few months later one of my friends had rented it and called me over, i gave the movie a second chance, it is the worst comedy i have seen in my life, there is nothing funny about this movie, it just bores everyone to death, if i had seen this in the theatre, i would have just walked out, this movie is not worth the disc it is recorded on, if i had actually bought this title, i would be too humiliated to take it back and ask for a refund, it is such a crap movie and does not even deserve to have any copies of it made, after all it's only wasting good discs.Another thing, it has a stupid intro and is too similar to scary movie's (wich is a good film) and this film makes me feel that i'd be better wathing static for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.E.M.?","review":"Seemed like a decent pickup coil but ran into flow problems when I used it.

She writes a story about a man that rebels against the rich and entitled and yet she attempts to 'fleece' her richer readers, leaving folks like myself unable to participate. If that is not class separation, I do not know what is.She should take a page from her own book (the expensive one) and be a person of generous spirit, like Fulk Fitzwarin and his lovely wife Maude Le Vavasour, my 27th Great Grandmother, and price this like her other books so that everyone EVERYONE can have access to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for that Deadwood junkie!","review":"An excellent representation of the first season of Deadwood, fine music and dialog from the series.Be aware of the harsh language on this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing CD","review":"I assumed that the cd would contain ALL misic from the series, unfortunatly they included dialogue from the series which in my opinion detracts for the content of the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more good bluegrass music","review":"I expected more bluegrass style music.

Being English and a lover of westerns, it's great to see a series that is not about Housewives, CSIs, and Bones. Anyway this is a great album with some very long, some short, cowboy, country and western music plus the blues. In between we have dialogue from the series and it is Deadwood language. My living room is blue with every other word and I love it. This is one album my Mother would not want in her apartment. Nearly all the cast does some singing plus some authentic C/W artists. This is a thoroughly entertining album just like the Deadwood series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated","review":"The content was not worth the price of the CD.The songs were not complete, only partialy played or sung.

The \\"used\\" copies are starting at $26.00! When albums are going for $9.99 in most places, why does Amazon try to rip us off?

She matured and made a very confident and slightly experimental set of recordings then. It seems that Joyce made her best album in 1980! Barring that album getting more widely available,start here for another singular voice from Brazil.The only Caetano connection I am aware of is her country,and her lovely voice and talent....but shouldn't that be enough? Great sounds to sooth your mind and day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I even remember the day I bought this.","review":"It's one thing when you know an album and a first single are coming out. It's another when you find it by accident and end up loving it. I don't know the difference between dub and remix, but I liked both here. Too often, CD singles only have one good version of the track. Here, all the versions were good. I liked \\"I want to wake up\\" on their \\"Actually\\" disc, I liked it here too more so because the Boys have lasted despite naysayers, disco-haters, and homophobes. The fact that they have album cuts to remix shows that they have staying power. Thumbs up to this disc. It'll make you reminisce on the fun and positivity of the 1990s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...fun to watch more than once. Fantastic location.","review":"Good writing,with an interesting story. The two main characters are opposite personality types and this is always an important spark for a successful comedy. The romantic side of the story is interesting as it does not follow predictable pathways and helps propel comedy as the main story driver. The location is compelling and the ultimate fantasy for anyone wishing to escape a city packed with people, buildings and machines. The restaurant is interesting as it has no windows facing the ocean. I could not find out if the building/restaurant was built for the movie or if it was a real restaurant in the location shown.All in all, an enjoyable movie with lots of laughs, with great acting by all in the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring it back... this is a great single","review":"No doubt with his popularity this single will be a hit.

The song in its original form is retro disco and the best mix on the cd. You get two full 12\\" mixes:one by John Creamer& Stephane K that is very much like their mix of Iio's \\"Rapture\\" and then a mix by Full Intention that more aggressive than what their normal disco/house mixes of past.

As this book points out, there can only be one brand for the internet. Dell is the king of the 'PC ordering system', and then they say Yahoo is king of search engines. I understand that this book was brought out before Google was such a player, but that goes to show you that their laws of internet branding does not work. Yahoo and Google are the Pepsi and Coke of online search engines.

It is a total time-waster, a plate of rhetorical tripe, as are the reviews of those who raved about the book (many obviously paid off to write a nice, tidy review). Most of the 'arguments' in this book could be overturned by your average teenager, and most of the 'laws' are reformulations of the first 'law' cursorily outlined in the first chapter.

(Selling the Invisible is a good book if you are more into the service area - but definitely read this one as well.)

While well expressed these views seem to make an imbalanced and narrow assessment of how things work in the world.

It may have more appropriately been called, an approach to doing business by someone who likes Coca Cola. Someone who wants to develop a sales strategy for a global product line might read it...

Unfortunately, they manage to sell this book, because they use this branding (title, cover, structure, the Reis name) to suggest that it is as good and revolutionary as the original. Unfortunately, it is neither. There exists a number of good books on the market what regards branding, this is not one of them.

It has an easy flow and is written in layman's terms so anyone can understand. And while all of that is wonderful for a book, there is one thing that stood out the most to me-BRANDING IS MADE THROUGH PUBLICITY, NOT ADVERTISING. I swear I thought it was the other way around. I thought if you advertise your product enough then the media would pick up on your product and give you the publicity. That advice right there was worth the price of the book.

Any in-depth examination of these over simplified and sometimes-bizarre rules leave you only with an empty sense of their cleverness and no clearer idea on how to approach the challenges of branding. If you thought that you knew nothing about branding, and want some reassurance that there are people out there writing books who know even less, than definitely buy this book.

One of the vocalists had a sound reminding me of the lead singer in Coheed and Cambria. The other vocalist was regulary off pitch, not quite hitting the higher notes in the simple melodies. If he had wanted to distinguish his vocal character as original and not a pure mimic of Maynard James Keenan, then he should have found a way to vary the length of notes held, or his start time, but definitely NOT the pitch performance.

But besides the point, I saw this film a few days ago- what the heck is this?????When did Child's Play become a comedy? There is nothing scary at all in this film anymore. Back when Chucky was out hunting for Andy- it was scary, now it is just a waste. Sure, I laughed a lot, but is that what this film was meant for?Another point- After Chucky and Tiffany did \\"their thing\\" (how is that possible for plastic dolls???), how could the Tiffany doll produce a baby in less that a day??? STRANGE.The acting wreaked- (the human people), and even the visual effects sucked. From Chucky crawling on the sidewalk, to Jennifer Tilly getting electricuted in the bathtub- it was all bad.The only stars for this film go to how stupidly funny it was, and Chucky's voice.\\"Hi, I'm Chucky...

I was disappointed after I saw it because I thought it was more of a comedy movie than it was a horror movie. It wasn't scary at all, in fact it was more silly than it was scary. I like comedy movies, but not when it comes to great series of horror flicks like \\"Child's Play.\\"In my opinion, they ruined the classic \\"Child's Play\\" horror movies when they made this movie. \\"Bride of Chucky\\" is an alright movie, it's just not what I was expecting it to be after seeing all the other movies of the series.

First of all, the movie has no meaning full story line, the two main characters, Jesse and Jade (not the dolls) are set out on a \`road trip' with the Chucky doll, and his obsessed girlfriend who \`turned doll'.The dolls rather cute, than scary and the film rather funny than horror, it is simple to say that this movie is not worth seeing if you are looking for something to spook yourself.It may become a classic horror tale one day, but as a 90's film it has quite not enough what you may expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went from Horror to comedy but still fails at it","review":"This movie wasn't scary at all and yes there were a few laughs here and there but overall this movie was not ment to be scary.

When Chucky's old flame Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) sews Chucky back together and performs the voodoo chant over Chucky's body, Chucky is brought back to life. Not wanting to be the only one stuck in a doll's body, Chucky turns Tiffany into a killer doll just like him. The two of them then find themselves in the back of a vehicle of a young couple in love who plan on getting married. Then, Chucky and Tiffany get married. Together, they form a killer doll duo. This movie has very stupid scenes and is just plain silly. There are a couple of cool death scenes but overall, I think we could have done without Bride Of Chucky.

She gets her wish.Bride of Chucky is gory, campy, still manages to be cheesy even with very good special effects, and is basically just a very fun, charming movie.Oh, to further compliment the movie, Spook master Rob Zombie is the main attraction on the soundtrack. With Rob Zombie you can't lose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect copies of the first movies","review":"because you will not get it with this. While seeing two dolls smole, sass each other and have sex is funny when finals time roll around, the rest of the year, it does not carry the same punch and is more bizzare than scary.I saw the first Child's Play movies when they came out, and this one is admittedly different from the others.While this is neither automaticaly bad nor good, I was glad I had free tickets to this movie because I probaly would not have wasted my time on it otherwise. The idea that two nonliving dolls can procreate is only one of the more off the wall portions of the film.I think that this movie is a prime example of what my parents were talking about when they said horror movies were the pinacle of camp, cheese and shock and I was too engrossed in it to really listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry Jack,Chuckys back!","review":"Childs Play has always been my favorite series of movies.Not for the great storylines (They are simplistic with plot holes all over the shop)but for the great character of Chucky.The series of movies has finally realised this and dispensed with the horror.This is basically \\"The Chucky show.\\" And what a great show it is.Every quirky one liner had me laughing more than any other film i've ever seen.(Including Austin Powers 2.)Tiffany is a great side kick/Straight man.I can't rate this film highly enough.Role on \\"Son of chucky\\"The inevitable sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chucky Gets Lucky ( U tell me, Jennifer Tilly is a babe ! )","review":"The best movie ever made of Chucky !

Just when you think that chucky died he's back! Charles Lee Ray is still looking for a new body, but this time the plot is a little bit more involved. This is also the funniest Chucky movie, because it shows Chucky on his honeymoon! But, I can't say anymore for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet. One of my favorite characters in the movie is the \\"psycho\\" girl who has a hudge collection of dolls in her trailer. She is too funny! I got a kick out of the way that she framed pictures of dolls as if they were people! I really thought that it was wacked the way she sewed Chucky's head back together! I mean, who would do that sort of thing with a doll's head, who murdered people?? Who would be at the right place at the right time to even find the head? In this movie we are introduced to a new character, \\"the girl doll\\". Who would've thought that Chucky would have a friend?

I've only seen Childs play 3 and this piece of crap. Now I found 3 to be a lot more fun to watch then this piece of ... (fill in the blank) Whoever thought this film was scary needs to see some real stuff. And to make things worse I've heard they are making Seed of Chucky. That will probably be worse.

Chucky comes back to kill his girlfriend and performs a voodoo ritual to put her soul in a doll. They make quite the couple and I got quite the migraine! Two dolls in love, enough said. There aren't any big names in this movie and I don't know why John Ritter made an appearance in this bubbling waste! The deaths are gruesome and unbelievable.

When I heard a new movie was coming to a release I thought I had to see it.Let me tell you that this isn't an horror movie. Sure it has blood but is nothing special or better than the first movie. Why? Because Chuckie itself is dishonoured this is more like a typical summer flick, it sucks, chuckie in this movie is not even scary anymore. (OMG HE HAS A BRIDE!) Big deal? NO! some of the dialogue in this movie made me laugh and same thing happened with the kills, it just didn't feel like an horror movie.The final sequence of the movie was very well made so that's why my two star rating.

When I was 29 part 2 came and I did not like as well as I did the first one. The next one came out and I liked it very much. The doll told another little boy that he was going to make him play a game called Hide the soul. The little boy had a horrifying look on his face. The little boy told Chucky that he did'nt like that game or Hide the soul either. I liked it better than the other three because it was such a horror movie that it was a comedy. There is going to be another one because at the end after Chucky got shot it showed the bride in a cemetary and a tiny Chucky was coming out of her.It will probably be called Son of Chucky or child of Chucky and that will be hilarious to see Family of Chucky. I have never had trouble with any movie scaring me, but this movie caused a doctors visit and a bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Horror At Its Best!\\"","review":"The best Chucky film and the highest grossing one making over 50 million dollars at the boxoffice, \\"The Bride of Chucky\\" brought renewed interest to the Chucky franchise. Jennifer Tilly steals the film as Chucky's new bride Tiffany who brings Chucky back to life. Tiffany eventually becomes a doll and the two go on a murderous rampage in the northeast, sort of like the doll version of \\"Thelma and Louise\\". The movie is intelligent, dark, funny, well-acted, and suspenseful, and horror buffs will love the chemistry between the two dolls. Another Chucky film, \\"The Seed of Chucky\\", followed, but was not a hit despite the presence of Jennifer Tilly. Nick Stabile, mostly known for a small role on the soap opera \\"Sunset Beach\\", plays a guy with whom the human Tiffany flirts with. He also shows off his amazing abs that will enlighten him to the female and gay audience that strive for horror films. The DVD comes with feature commentary, interviews, and the trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"bride of chucky is a geat movie","review":"I think that the childs play movies are good, funny sometimes, and also scary.

It's just a slapstick movie with forced laughs and dry humor, and almost no horror. Gone is organization -- they threw in a plot involving an amulent, and Andy could be in hell for all we know. This movie really drops the CP series' quality and honestly, may be the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is weak. The only plus is good acting, at least by Jesse (Stable) and Jade (Heigl). The movie isn't worth a buy; barely worth a rental.I do give it credit for not having as many \\"bloopers\\" as the first three - editing's been done to the max. But there are a few that I won't mention. Still, the first three had plot holes. This movie technically, unforutnately, has no hole in the plot. It just introduces a new element, which is weak.

So as soon as I saw DK 3 on the rack today, I bought it without even looking at what the tracks in it were. That's what I think of the Hed Kandi Disco series-they are worth buying on the spot. If you're into house music, this CD is worth buying. Usually the tracks are ones you'll never hear on the radio, but that's the type of CDs you should buy.

I have been listening to Sin City day in and day out and haven't gotten sick of listening to the cd. All of the songs are great.

Four extra tracks not on the original Red Covered Release, (but they are on the Machine Love EP). But even with that this Cd is limited to 1,000 copies and I believe was only available in Japan. I also believe if I am not mistaken that this version was only released at shows in Japan BUT I am not 100% sure about that.

The songs are not well-written. \\"Hail to the freaks\\"? I mean, really, please. Spare us. And why are there snippets of screaming/laughing/begging-for-Mommy children on just about every other song? It's damned pathetic. The only reason I'm giving this thing two stars instead of one is that fact that Gen's real cute and she has a pretty good voice. My advice to her: go to a few remedial song-writing courses, lose the fascist husband, and for the love of god, STOP with the satanic overtones! That's been done before, and it wasn't even cool then.

But not a lot of insight. Really, this book is academia at its most pompous. I believe the authors were competing to see who could write the most and say the least. I do not respect that.

After installing this device, signal strength shifted between Very Good-Good-Low. I can also get signal from anywhere inside the house, and out on the back porch. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"I bought this signal booster so that the signal would reach 200 feet away from the transmitter. It doesn't work. In fact I replaced an SMC access router with the Linksys model so I could add the Linksys signal booster. The SMC router had greater range even with no booster than does the Linksys router with the booster and network management is much more difficult with the Linksys unit. I can't understand how Linksys got to be so prevalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"Purchased the booster to supplement an unsatisfactory BEFWS1145 wireless router and access point.. not only did the product not work well, it resulted in markedly worse performance..

I'm getting 1500/250 on Speakeasy.net's bandwidth test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with WRT54G","review":"I've had the WSB24 signal booster in storage since I switched from a Linksys wireless 802.11B router to an 802.11 B/G router, the WRT54G to be specific. However, I decided to give the signal booster a try with my B/G router. It is very easy to set up, just unscrew the antennas from the back of of the router. Screw the wires from the signal booster onto the router in the place of the antennas you just removed. Then plug the power adaptor in and Bobs your uncle (you're done, that is).My signal strength went up 2-3 bars in the \\"dead\\" spots in our house and now goes to the farthest corner of our 2 story house with all signal strength \\"bars\\" lit up.So even thought the WSB24 is not designed to work with an 802.11 G router, it does work fine with the Linksys WRT54G. Note that this booster has been pulled from the market by Linksys. If you want one, you will have to buy a used one. But you can't have mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booster? Get serious.","review":"Easy installation but wildly overstated in the \\"boost\\" dimension. A/B (with, without) the \\"boost\\" in my environment shows at most 10-15% extension of the diameter of a useable signal. A near neighbor has found precisely the same \\"boost\\" in his environment.

When I tested it (repeatedly) I observed 18 - 20% signal strength without the unit and a range of 17-24% at the same test point using the same test instrument with the unit installed and powered-up. These results cannot be said to be any change at all from a scientifically sound standpoint. I will be returning my unit ASAP. I am a proponent of linksys products despite their \\"pricyness\\" but this unit simply does not work. The only pro I can relay is that it is very simple to uninstall for return to the place of purchase.I did see where someone said the unit was pulled from the market on June 18. The product is not listed on linksys.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - only buy if you have a Linksys router","review":"I bought this Linksys signal booster to broaden the range of my wireless network (in an old, two-story home). I connected the booster to my D-Link 614+ wireless router, and the signal actually got worse...almost to the point of no signal at all.After talking with technical reps from Linksys and D-Link, it turns out that the signal booster is a proprietary product. It will only work with a Linksys router. This is contrary to what the product description says, so DON'T buy it if you don't have a Linksys router!*Note: If you have a Linksys router, I feel that this product is a worthy buy based on other recommendations. The \\"one star\\" rating is based solely on the above comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, pure garbage.","review":"I purchased one of these units to punch up the signal throughout my house and it had the opposite effect. With the \\"booster\\" powered on, my wireless signal dropped to less than 10% even three feet from the access point! When it was removed the signal returned to 100%. All of these positive reviews must be Linksys employees or the Linksys quality control is going downhill fast. Avoid this thing at all costs unless you want total frustration. If I could give it zero stars, I'd do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was getting little or no signal out on my porch, where with the nice weather I wanted to try working on my Dell laptop. I could not get email most of the time, and terminal sessions or web site loads would often time out. (10 feet away, inside the house, the signal is fine.) All of this is on the same (ground) floor as my BEFW11S4 wireless router. A friend bought this booster to get the signal to his daughter's 2nd floor bedroom, but it did not help. It may have also toasted the router. He was unable to return it, so he gave it to me to try.I only got a marginal improvement - connections now just barely hang on, but are so slow as to be useless on the porch. Hope it does not toast my unit (my friend's hired expert said there were reliability problems with the Linksys equipment - high failure rate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I hooked up the Linksys Wireless Signal Booster as described. It definately was very easy to set up. However, once everything was connected, my signal decreased. I used to be able to use my laptop downstairs in my house (my wireless router is upstairs) with a marginal signal. With the booster attached, I was unable to connect to the network. The booster accomplished the exact opposite of what I was trying to accomplish. Maybe I had a defective product. I ended up returing the WSB24 to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Is Clearly Garbage","review":"I've been a longstanding Linksys customer. Linksys has clearly manufactured a garbage product in that this device is NOT compatible with the devices it states as compatible. As stated in other reviews here, you have to have specific releases of the Wireless Router in order for it to work.I ordered this device and went home on lunch to hook it up. When doing so my wireless signal went to zero. I disconnected and reconnected it twice thinking I must have done something wrong. Lo, after calling their technical support and verifying my information, this product is not compatible. Shame on Linksys.If I could I would give this product zero stars as Linksys has made no effort to state the limited compatibility. The phone rep cheerfully told me to \\"Take it back to the store.\\" Nice strategy, Linksys.Hello Dlink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like it says, it boosts your signal","review":"You should note that nowhere in the documentation does it say HOW MUCH it boosts your signal. It just boosts it.Well, I agree, it boosted my signal.My problem was that I live in an old building with dense walls (and maybe lead paint), so two rooms away from the router I was only getting about 15-25% signal. After I installed the booster (very easy), I'm getting 70% signal.If you just have one access point, this is the best way to increase your signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk, twice over","review":"I purchased a WSB24 from Amazon, hoping to improve the signal strength from my Linksys wireless router. With the \\"signal booster\\" in place, my signal became extremely erratic, even in my home office, where the router is located (there is an 8-ft clear-sight gap from the router to my laptop)! The office used to get link qualities and signal strength > 85%, but with the booster in place it was not uncommon to see the strength dip down to 0%. I sent the original booster back to Amazon for a replacement unit, but I now am experiencing the same behavior with the second unit. Needless to say, I've taken the \\"signal booster\\" out of my system, and I will return it for a refund. Twice burned is enough, I won't get a third one. BTW, I note that a greater preponderance of the newer reviews are reporting negative results with the booster. Perhaps quality has dropped in the past few months?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true about 54G","review":"First, who ever posted that it works with 54G is wrong. In fact they've little sleeves on the 54G antenna to prevent you from installing the antennas on the booster. You can remove the sleeves but once you connect it will not work. Your incorrect information wasted a bunch of my time.I do not know if it'll work with b networks or make any difference. I just wanted folks to know that it is not and is not intended to work with 54G equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless....","review":"Parts of my house only receive a 20% signal strength. I was so excited to see a product that might actually make surfing throughout the house more enjoyable.The product was incredibly easy to insall, however it made mininal difference on my signal strength. It was still in the 20% range.I use both a Linksys router and a Linksys 802.11 card for my laptop.Also, the tollfree # for technical support had been disconnected. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys Signal Booster 802.11b","review":"I found this item to be very easy to install. My laptop's signal went from very weak to strong and I have not had any operation problems. The only thing is in the Quick Instruction guide there were two different warnings about keeping the antenna away from anyone setting near by. Two statements said to stay at least 20 cm away and another in bold type stated to be at least 2.0m away. A reply to a note to Linksys stated that the 20cm one is correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy another router....","review":"I'm also not sure what people were thinking when they reported improved reception, where they just copying the text from the Linksys marketing department? I see absolutely NO improvement in reception. In fact, I see WORSE reception! I used to get a full 100%/100% signal sitting right next to the router, now I don't even get that! There was no better range either... it stayed the same.My advice is to STAY AWAY! Save your money on this. In fact, the best bet is to take this money and just buy another wireless router and place it near where you want a better signal. This is what I did. I now have two seperate networks that I switch between manually. It's not a hassle to change SSID's, just keep your other settings the same, and it sure works better than this \\"booster\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Was everyone lying before about how great this is?","review":"I bought this because all the reviews said it was great, now after I've received it and installed, I go back and find that recently, a slew of people have had problems. We have a loft, open space, and the booster is at one end. To the other end of the loft, there's only fair reception. My vpn connection is constantly getting dropped. I don't have any problems with my desktop, so this is strictly a wireless thing. Don't waste you money on this. It seems like the signal is degrading since I bought the thing too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work with the new Routers","review":"Wasted my time. The booster only works with version 2 of the BEFW11S4, not the v 3.2 that is out now. It doesn't say this anywhere. I had to call their tech support to find this out. So if you go down to the store and buy both, they will not work together.

The saw cuts nice and straight, and it feels high quality. Not everything made in China is bad; the quality depends on the requirements we give them. The junk that comes from China is because we ask them to make it as cheap as possible.The saw makes a nice clean cut, and it is powerful. I like that there is no trigger lock.

I used black soap and it works wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke me out even more!","review":"When I researched for a natural soap containing sulfur, this was one of the the ones that made me curious enough to buy. Wrong idea! After a few days of usage, my mildly affected acne face broke out intensely with cystic and painful acne. Very weird due to the fact that I use DDF's sulfur mask weekly and Proactiv's sulfur mask maybe once a month with no problems/irritations. Soap smells great, was yellow..not white as pictured and did nothing but ultimately break me out. I will stick to Dudu Osun's black soap [...] that really works for my combination acne skin and is very cost effective as well. Also, the soap box does not disclose the percentage amount of sulfur at all on its packaging as it does in the product description (3% supposedly) listed here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressive","review":"I got this to treat acne, however, it dries skin and does not seem to have any beneficial/ therapeutic advantage.

Smell is better compared to other sulfur soaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKY ROUGH SOAP","review":"I fell into the hype and ordered a bar, after a few showers I threw it away.

In fact, I listen to it more than \\"Empire\\" or \\"Mindcrime.\\" I've never thought it was a horrible album, but after \\"Promised Land\\" it just didn't resonate with me.Some time ago I popped it into my CD-Rom while doing some work on the computer and I fell in love with it. It's now in a fairly regular rotation.Give this another listen, you just might discover you've missed something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album From Start To Finish","review":"This album is incredibly underrated. This is yet another Queensrche concept album, but the songs are good enough to stand alone. I dig all the songs, and actually find myself humming them often. These songs are very catchy and feature good riffs. Geoff Tate does yet another great job at vocals! These are some of the better songs on the album: \\"Sign Of The Times\\", \\"Saved\\", \\"The Voice Inside\\", \\"Hero\\", \\"Hit The Black\\" & \\"sp00L\\"I recommend this album to just about anyone. This is a good hard rockin' album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Operation: Frontier","review":"This project from Queensryche has been pretty much ignored and that is sad. There are some VERY good songs on this cd. The song \\"Hit The Black\\" is a pure Queensryche metal song that hits you right in the face. There is a very cool song that Chris Degarmo sings called \\"All I Want\\" that has a nice structure to it that fits in very good on this album. Other highlights are \\"The Voice Inside\\",\\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Spool\\".This album is NOT Empire or Operation:Mindcrime. With that said, you cannot go wrong with this release as this seems to be an album they had fun making. You can tell from the way the songs go from Heavy to a bit slower to VERY heavy(\\"Hit The Black\\"). Some of the other albums like Mindcrime is heavy from the start. Nothing wrong with that as Operation:Mindcrime is still my favorite from the band but Hear In The Now Frontier gives you another look at what they can do with their talents.Check it out and play this one loud!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god","review":"We really needed another alterna-wank band.

It bridges the gap from Promised Land and on to the next (which I predict will be great).This album deals with the now,to expext a band to put out the same record over and over is silly.

After releasing simply awe inspiring works like Rage for Order and Operation:Mindcrime, the band made a MAJOR mistake by releasing this crud.Apparently they decided, like too many of the great bands of the 80's, to turn their back on the fans that made them great to begin with, and change sounds to appeal to a different generation. The younger generation wouldn't bother listening to it, because they were already stereotyped as an \\"80's band.\\"The net result is a horrible album, which nobody likes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Chris DeGarmo show!","review":"It's Chris DeGarmo's world--Geoff, Michael, Scott and Eddie are \\"privileged\\" to share it. The first time I heard \\"Sign Of The Times\\", I knew that DeGarmo was the sole writer, and it didn't surprise me to see that he wrote much of the rest of the album. God, Chris, we know you got nominated for a Grammy for \\"Silent Lucidity\\" and everything, but did you really have to boot Geoff out of the room and sing that horrible Sgt. Pepper ripoff whose title mercifully eludes me? The Ryche was going through the motions here, and it shows. Makes you wonder how good interband relations were at the time of recording . . .

Or is it?","review":"This is definitely not comparable to 'Operation:Mindcrime' or any of the other older stuff, and I am not too pleased. \\"Sign of the Times\\" and \\"You\\" are the only songs I really like here. The rest are just too boring, and completely lack a \\"metal edge.\\" If you are a fan of old Queensryche, I can't say that I would recommend this one to you. Oh well, it's head and shoulders above 'Q2K.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Horrible Horrible","review":"If you're a Queensryche fan of old then this album is NOT fo you. Queensryche used to embody POWER, HEART and SOUL, this album embodies dollar signs. 'Let's see if we can fall into the Alternative groove.' Promised Land isn't like Mindcrime or Warning, but it was still a damn good album. Here in the Now Frontier has really made me question how much Queensryche enjoys the spirit of music over the trend of music. Remember: Alternative music is just as is says ... Alternative to music.

Very, very bad. God, I would give my arm for the unity and harmony of the old Queensryche."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good group gone bad","review":"This album is terrible. I've been a huge fan of Queensryche ever since I first saw their Eyes of a Stranger video from Mindcrime. They're one of my absolute favorite bands, and I've been impressed by every album they've put out...that is until I bought this abomination. I sold it back to a used CD shop the day after I bought it. Ol' Geoff and the boys tried going trendy with this release and failed miserably. If you have any love for their older works then avoid this album like the plague, or risk having your opinion of this once great band forever tainted in your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"I was so bummed when I bought this cd. I love Queensryche, think \\"Mindcrime\\" and \\"Empire\\" are the two best albums of all-time, and think all their pre-1997 albums are amazing. I heard \\"You\\" on the radio in August of '97 before the album was released and absolutely loved it. I was so pumped about getting it. Then after playing it about 5 times I realized that I hated 12 songs, thought \\"Spool\\" was ok, and still loved \\"You\\"(probably my 4th favorite Ryche song). This is not Queensryche...its Matchbox 20 meets Blond Melon with the great Geoff Tate doing vocals. The lyrics are uninspired, the melodies aren't melodic, and the songs have no catchyness. If you see the album for 7 bucks or less get it for \\"You\\", but otherwise it is a waste of money. Buy the old ones first."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"I LIKE THIS CD VERY MUCH,ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS EMPIRE IT\`S STILL A VERY GOOD CD.THE SONG SIGN OF THE TIMES IS MY FAVORITE SONG.WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT QUEENSRYCHE IS THE WORDS.THIS CD IS VERY DEEP AND IS A GOOD LISTEN.MUST HAVE FOR QUEENSRYCHE FANS."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I honestly don't know why I keep buying Queensryche albums; _Empire_ and _Operation: Mindcrime_ are very good in parts but don't do much for me. Still, I was expecting something halfway decent after the excellent _Promised Land_ and bought _HitNF_ upon release. BIG mistake.I like the first and last song (\\"Sign of the Times\\" and \\"sp00l\\", respectively.) Everything else ranges from \\"forgettable\\" to \\"wish I could forget it but to no avail\\". In general it's very clumsy heavy metal crying out for some decent song-writing or at least some enthusiasm.To be honest, I don't get it. These guys *can* write great music and they definitely took the right direction with _Promised Land_. But my prediction is that the next album will be even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt believe rock was dead until now","review":"Blame this one on Chris Degamaro. Thank god the rest of the band decided not to follow this path and instead release him from the band. This album has no feeling to it, no mood to it, and by golly no @ss to it, although I dont hate the songs its just theres only 1 queensryche and then theres a million other bands that could make H.I.T.N.F so im glad to see that they take theyre uniquiness seriously like I do and are getting back to theyre roots in Q2k."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. .... Worthles. Useless.","review":"Do you want to really waste your time and money? Buy this album and listen to it. Queensryche were such a good band, as you can see if you listen to their back catalog. Geoff Tate can still wail, but the rest of the band must have thought this album was a joke. They put absolutely NO effort into writing songs, and it sounds like worthless grunge bands like Nirvana. I would much rather not have my ears molested by this garbage. Listening to this album makes me vomit incessantly. Oh, the last song, \\"SpOOL\\" is rather good, like the songs off \\"Promised Land,\\" but unless you're buying this at a really low price, it ain't worth having this CD take up any room in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This has got to be the worst cd ever put out in the world of metal. I am an avid fan of Queensryche up through Empire. I would give this album zero stars if I could. What happened to this band?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, Different and Very Good","review":"I love everything this band has done from their first EP to Promised Land after warming up to the latter album I stopped buying their music. 10 years went by since I bought anything from this band. I came across this album on Amazon for real cheap so I decided to give it a shot. This album is really different from anything prior. It sounds sophisticated, mature and less progressive...it's just a different sounding album for them. I like it...it seems fresh. Saw them recently at the Nokia Theater (NYC) and they were great. I sure do miss Chris Degarmo. Being this is the last album with him as a full member...i'll stop here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing the rules","review":"What most people don't realise is that the genere that queensryche is in (Progressive rock) is all about changing. Some may say that this isn't a good idea, especially from a fans point of view, but as a long time fan, I must say that change is good. When a band can incorporate different styles on one album, they must be good. Anything from heavy mettal, to balads, to unusual mixes of both are available on this album. A must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In one ear out the other frontier!!","review":"I don't see how anyone could enjoy this recent offering from a band that is usually extremely creative and thought provoking. It is enough to send any long time ryche fan spiraling into a deep depression wondering what happened. As for any new listners I really don't see any captivating intrigue here. My final assesment is that queensryche has assembled everything that is lacking in music today and assembled it into one meaningless album. All this from a band who made its career on breaking all the rules and staying true to heart before caving in to the whims of a fad induced culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a little dissapointed in this one","review":"Although I have fond memories of the day I bought this one (listening to it while driving down the California coast on Highway 1), it is easily their weakest effort. The only song that really stands out for me is \\"The Voice Inside\\". I would say that if you a fan, it's worth buying, but don't expect too much out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointing","review":"I got this release about a year ago and have only listened to it three to four times in that period. From start to finish, the album is a true disappointment. Some may say that change is good and that's the truth, but it's not really change when you're basically playing what has been already been played by so many other bands. The songs aren't really bad, they're just really not what you'd expect from an original progressive hardrock band. This album just drudges on and doesn't stop. Hopefully Queensryche's next release will be more mind-provoking than this sellout album. Buy the classic album \\"Rage for Order.\\" Now that's original and has stood the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAARRRGGGHHH!!!","review":"Apart from \\"spOOL,\\" this album just isn't in step with Queensryche's other stuff. Someone might be able to enjoy it by blasting it at a party, but I always liked how Queensryche intrigued one. That element is sadly missing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queenryche's Worst Album; Try Operation: Mindcrime or Empire","review":"Queensryche typically does outstanding music. Their lyrics are thoughtful; the drumming and singing particularly exceptional; the guitar work very respectable. When \\"on\\", their songs are among the most powerfully emotional available. However, they faltered here. This album is also well-written, but the music doesn't have the emotional intensity of their best efforts. Skip it; go back to their earlier work if you want to see them at their peak.If you have the opportunity to pick up a couple of tracks from this disc, try \\"Reach\\" and \\"Inside Out.\\" The rest is forgettable.I'm a huge Queenryche fan, so it hurt to write this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very captivating book","review":"Like another reviewer mentioned the type in this book is too small. I was going to put the book down due to the small type but after reading a few paragraphs I became so captivated I suffered through the small type reading the entire book.

The author is obviously an expert in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably very interesting book, but...","review":"Probably very interesting book. I can only guess.

I received an advanced promo copy of this when it first came out and as the years have gone by I've tried to force myself to dig deeper into this album and let it grow on me. It still hasn't.If you can get the 1st LP... DO IT.

From women who turn to prostitution, to men who join the French wing of the Gestapo, De Anfrasio describes how war destroys the fabric of everyday life, resulting in citizens' distrust of one another. A Garden of Thorns is also a crackerjack story of a kid who just couldn't keep still.

The text of the book places and emphasis on his family's emotional and psychological state of mind during the war, rather than placing emphasis on the actual bombings and tragedy of the war....it gives the book a much more personal touch.

It's a monotone format that inspires the listener to rearrange the cd into new mixes. The actual madrigals are very solid and fun to listen to and the remixes sometimes don't resemble the original much at all, but are still interesting to listen to and some actually would work really well in the mix of the actual song. Mainly, this album shows me how different musical styles can be relatable if placed within certain contexts, as such this is a solid pop album, but one of a very whimsical nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiness is 'Shakestation'","review":"This music is beautiful and fun and swings.

Savannah Breeze is no exception, and was well worth the few days it took to read. BeBe Loudermilk gets shafted, then gets her revenge. She also gets her man, and I don't think I'm spoiling a plot point by saying that as soon as she met the ornery handyman at her new Tybee Island motel (and of course hated him on sight), I knew what would happen.I might have given the book a five just for the sheer fun of reading it, but the storyline was quite slim and unfortunately predictable.

I was so pleasantly surprised!Besides completely capturing the spirit, quirkiness and cuisine(!)of Savannah/Tybee Island, it was a very satisfying crime-fiction romp that is the female/Georgia answer to a Carl Hiassen or Dave Barry novel.

I really liked all three of those and finished them all in record time. This book, however, was so boring. There was nothing redeeming about it. The main character, BeBe, was insipid and shallow. The Weezie that we knew and loved from Savannah Blues was really just an afterthought. It seemed that MKA needed to have her in the story to tie the two together so instead of actually giving her some action, she decided to write odd chapters from Weezie's perspective. I really didn't like that. There was no romance in this book. I never got the idea that the characters even liked one another.

She loses her house, clothes, furnishings, several rental properties, and her grandparents' savings. With the help of her friend, Weezie (heroine of Savannah Blues), Bebe sets out to regain her fortune. Assisted by her grandfather and a scruffily handsome fishing boat captain, she travels to Florida to run a con on the con man and regain her worldly goods.

I laughed alot, got involved with the characters, and cheered the \\"healthy\\" revenge.Will it make you a better person, will you discover your innerself? Probably not. But, if you just need a pick-me-up kind of book - put your hands on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savannah Breeze","review":"Enjoyed this book. Kept me going until the end. Good story line. Book in very good condition. Enjoy all her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer first reader","review":"I guess if you've never heard the reader on \\"Savannah Blues\\", Keating would probably be an okay reader. But the first book was such an incredible delight, and Bebe (\\"Bay-Bay\\") was such a such a crisp-sharp character in every way, it's very disconcerting to have her edges \\"blunted\\" in this book.It's not just the common-ization of her name (from \\"Bay-Bay\\" down to the everyday \\"Bee-Bee\\") -- didn't Andrews even listen to this tape first? -- it's just that her feisty-ness has lost its superior air. And with that loss, she's just another character, certainly not the memorable one she was in the first book.It's an okay read, probably would have been much better had I not listened to \\"Blues\\" first.Sad. I was really looking forward to Book #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"More adventures with Weezie and BeBe.","review":"If you liked \\"Savannah Blues\\" this book won't disappoint. This story is told mostly through the eyes of Southern femme BeBe Loudermilk, unlike \\"Blues\\" which was all Weezie's story. Although the plot is wildly improbable, the characters are charming and irresistable. BeBe, a strong yet totally southern \\"steel magnolia\\" gets taken for everything by a slick con man. Together with her best friend Weezie, and a few other accomplices, they try to track down the scoundrel to deal with him. The most interesting aspect of the story is how BeBe deals with her reversal of fortune. Although the outcome is no big surprise, the journey is humorous and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Southern Romp Featuring Revenge & Some Romance","review":"I count on Mary Kay Andrews for her spunky southern women, her silly situations and a fun read. She doesn't disappoint in Savannah Breeze. Bebe Loudermilk gets taken by a good looking man and vows to get her money and self-respect back. Best friend Weezie (Savannah Blues) takes time from her antiquing to help her out, while pushing her towards a new romance.You don't need to have read the earlier book, as this one can stand alone. It's fun reading and full of offbeat characters and southern atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Charm","review":"Excellent reading.

All the books that I have read so far are perfectly wonderful, perfect for a day by the pool or a light beach read.

Delightful scheming ensues as she plots how to get her fortune and life back after she is relegated to a dilapidated inn and an unlikely romance.READ IT! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"funread","review":"I love the women in Mary Kay's books, they're human, fun, and fiesty, and like all her books, the mistakes they make get them into trouble, but they always find a way to clean up their mess and learn the lesson put in their path, this book is the same and we get to revisit Wezie and BeBes friendship, and watch them help each other, as loyal friends should.I also liked that grandpa was included as an integreal part of BeBes getting back her life, and cleaning up the mess she got into by falling for a man and giving over her power and trust to the wrong guy.( the ones you think are to good to be true,usually are.right?)giving this story a Homey and multi generational touch, and wouldnt it be great if we all had family that we could count on to have our back even if they somtimes drive us nuts?Mary Kay makes me want visit the South and be friends with these ladies,and for anyone who's ever had yen to own a resteraunt,antique store,or bed and breakfast this book helps fullfill the dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"What I wanted was three men seeking monsters.

I found the book to lack any revelation other than some tall tales I hadn't heard before, which Redfern seems to leave with the reader as the reward for buying his book. It's a light read and more about his two buddies hanging out with him drinking than any serious adventure. This would of been the type of adventure you probably would of liked to have had in college, so it's not unentertaining...but I would not see this as a must buy unless you feel Nick needs the donation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read!","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was different. I have a whole library of books on Fortean topics, and no, this book probably isn't one destined for classic-dom. But it doesn't pretend to be. I got a kick out of the fact that three open-minded men traveled around England in search of monsters and then one of them wrote a book about it. Why can't I meet a man like that? All the men I meet are only into sports or worse, Republicans, and dull, dull, DULL! But I digress..... these guys had some intriguing and some fairly scary experiences, and my only problem with the book was that their trip wasn't long enough!

I honestly think that unless these CDs are all done as a club mixes, this series is a complete waste of money. Most fans of these artists most likely have these recordings already on the artists' own CDs. I felt ripped off & I won't even look at another part of this series. These remind me of those dorky collections you see for sale on those cheap, late-night TV commercials. I'll just 'change the channel' next time.

I am not an expert on plumbing or fixtures, and though my husband is (in know-how, not by trade), he still was confused by the intentionally vague description which dow not disclose that this does not include the valve, which most sets like this do include. We think the valve needed (which we found out AFTER we had already paid for and received this item) is actually discontinued as we can't find it ANYWHERE. Make sure you have, or can find the Danze valve D112000T or D115000T BEFORE you buy this. AND include however muuch you need to spend on the valve WHITH the cost of this item, because most any other set like this on the market WILL include the valve, and you can get deals on them for as low as $89... we're not getting any deal now unless we can find the right valve for $20 or less!

This isn't even fun for the gore because it's mostly done with computers and looks ridiculously fake. I think the fakeness might be intentional because at times the gore is more reminiscent of cartoons from the Monty Python TV show than anything you would see in an actual slasher film, but this thing gets monotonous fast. The Summer of Massacre is basically the equivalent of watching someone else play a video game for 90 minutes--it doesn't work as a gorefest or as a horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"This movie was so terrible that I watched it in disbelief.

The first one lasted a couple of months before being completely destroyed, the second is around a month old and he just managed to tear it open.The weakness is the point where the outer seam is joined.

I thought that this would outlast the others by months, based on other reader reviews. Unfortunately, he found the ring toy's weakness... the stitching! He managed to pull apart the stitching on one side and ripped out all the cotton within 2 hour of playing with it. I still have yet to find a toy that he can not break through. He does still like to play with it even though it is no longer stuffed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We purchased this item at Best Buy for our 9 month old 50 lb mutt.

Within in 30 minutes she chewed off most of the black trim tape on the outside edge and had the stuffing out.As an aside, we were at Kohl's and they had some large soft stuffed green birds on sale for $2.50. We bought one and that was several weeks ago. It is still going strong. I figured it doesn't have a squeaker she is trying to get too. The wife sent me back to get four more - best deal yet.

She loves squeak toys and so this worked in that department but she usually gets the squeaker out within seconds of an ordinary squeak toy. It took her a few weeks to get through the Tuffy Ring. The other thing that is nice about this toy is that it has multiple squeakers in it. And so even though she got one there was still two others to get! Well worth the money.

Well we got this toy for Christmas, thinking maybe he wouldn't be so quick to tear it up. He loved it, but the 9 tough rating was not enough, he destroyed the toy in 3 days! He chewed the black siding off, and ripped out the stuffing and squeakers. Not that he didn't love the toy and enjoyed tearing it up, I just wish it would have lasted a little longer!

She struck me as a whiny, spoiled city-girl, but I think Ms. Foster did a wonderful job portraying her character growth. The story is mainly Garvin's story, about her journey home and spiritual growth along the way. I found Meemaw, Garvin's grandmother, a delightful character that everyone can find inspiring. I really enjoyed watching the relationships between both Garvin and Meemaw and Garvin and Monique (a lonely child she is \\"mentoring\\") develop.

This book shows readers how anyone, regardless of success, failure, stubbornness and the like can trek a path back to a better self. Although I found this book repetitious and a little too \\"preachy\\" at times (and was shockingly surprised at how an intelligent lawyer like Garvin could be so clueless), Ain't No River is a good read and a feel good book that is very suitable in anyone's library.

Instead, every brand of wireless adapter in my home network works fine *except* for the WMP54G--every 10 or 15 minutes, the driver software pops up a dialog complaining about an IP address conflict. If you search the web for \\"wmp54g address conflict,\\" you'll find an endless number of similar complaints, all followed by well-meaning advice but few of which seem to be resolved.

Windows still didn't like the drivers, but I forced them through and the device changed status to Code 10, Cannot Start. Linksys tech support, which is in India, was less than helpful, assuring me it was a bad PCI slot. Removed the card and installed into a brand new Gateway desktop running XP Pro. Exact same problem. Read some reviews and did some research, then threw the Linksys product in the trash and purchased a Netgear WG311 wireless PCI adapter.

When I opened it up, and followed the instructions for Windows XP which is pretty easy, the brass connector that you screw the antenna on on the back of the PCI came off. It looks like that small SMA connector is pressed into the card, not soldered, and it can't hold the weight of the antenna. I called Linksys and asked if this was a known problem and they said no, and they made excuses that it was my fault. I got an RMA from them and I am sending it back.

The signal strength is good in my house, and the PCMCIA card version seems to work well in my neighborhood. Some of the other reviews show some very frustrated people, but I did not really have that many problems. The household pc's are kept up to date with the patches, and we have disabled many services in W2K and XP.

Connections would take a long time and would fail periodically. The fastest speed it would connect at, only two rooms away was 24Meg. Sometimes it would connect at 36Meg but quickly drop back down, sometimes to 10Meg. Someone around my house is running an unsecured WLAN as the card in my PC would get a week signal and pick up in IP address from somewhere else. Oops. I had to configure the PC end to look for my network only. If you follow Linksys's instructions, it will us the default configuration, which is wide open, and leave your network assessable to anyone around you.

They don't work. Yes, I have installed them in much newer systems running XP-Pro, and they worked. That's what prompted me to recommend this Linksys setup to another client running slightly older hardware. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! Linksys tech. support is absolutely horrible.

Joking aside, this is a terrific look at the consequences of the \\"culture of success\\" permeating the United States. Which is in fact no success at all, but mostly submission to bosses, bureaucracy and money. It is the law of the jungle in \\"Stuck\\", but when Stephen Rea, a victim of downsizing, gets stuck in Mena Suvari's windshield he seems still incapable to understand that his society no longer functions, and waits for her to get help. That never comes. I don't see this film as a black comedy but as an indictment, a suspenseful look at the effects of a socially inept landscape in some individuals fighting to maintain their status in the ranks of the low class (they are... stuck!).

I have almost every album by the group, by Danny himself, or any side groups by the band, ie. Food For Feet. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. The lyrics are very good, as Elfman has always been very creative and seemingly above and beyond the normal realm of thinking. I just feel that this album lacked the intensity and commitment of previous albums. I also missed the \\"horns\\" that seperated Boingo from the mainstream. I believe in a band maturing and exploring different areas of their musical ability and this type of maturing can be seen in \\"Dark At the End of the Tunnel\\", which I feel is probably their best album. The album is good, but it just seems to lack the true Boingo-esque quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Oingo?","review":"This album is by Boingo as Oingo was dropped from the title. It is not the only thing missing in this album. Oingo Boingo's music was always dark with a somewhat danceable beat to it. This album is just dark and really has no sing along songs on it. Not the kind of cd you want to play at a party. It is so different from other cds put out by Oingo Boingo that you scratch your head and ask yourself why would they release as this their last cd?

This is easily the weakest recording they ever released. Gone are the horns, the manic edginess, the sense of humor, and even the strong sense of melody. Where once we had a band with their own unique sound and vision, we're now left with a stripped down version of Oingo Boingo that chose to follow the darker trends of the time like NIN. There's nothing wrong with being dark, but little of it screams of sincerity. They even grew their hair long, got some tatoos, and sported the grunge look at the time in a feeble attempt to appeal to the current musical trends/fashion at the time. If there's one positive about the album it's that we see early indications of where Elfman was heading with some of his soundtrack scores, and I suppose it's a departure from their usual sound. It's not as bad listening to it today as it was when it first came out, but it's just not all that inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good thing they changed their name...","review":"I'm sorry, but I don't see the appeal in this album. At all. I think Dead Man's Party, Dark At The End Of The Tunnel, and So-Lo are examples of much better albums, but then again I prefer their more 80's pop-oriented side. Honestly, I can't find a single song here that I like and that's a pretty sad thing. It's a good thing they changed their name on this album, because this is the pits. I do give props for Elfman's songwriting skills, but the music itself just isn't enjoyable at all to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me","review":"Over 16 minutes for the song Change? Hey! is a track that sounds like Boingo just missed the grunge phase and desperately wanted to get in on the tail end. I Am The Walrus was completely butchered.

Yes, it sounds a great deal like later Beatles work (eg \\"Mary\\" could be the sequel to \\"She's Leaving Home\\").The album is loosely themed around the idea of society's outsiders-- and not attractive romantic nobly-tragic outsiders, but some really messed up, alienated people. To call it dark is being diplomatic.I did not warm up to this initially; there were too many surprises. But upon repeated llistenings, the album revealed all of OB's usual strengths-- nice hooks, intellgent writing, aural variety. And it added some sophistication and depth. Heck, who's had the cajones to record an oevr-10 minute opus in a while?And don't be too dismayed by the darkness. Like his cohort Tim Burton, Elfman rarely allows his darkness of vision to overwhelm his affection for the people he's dealing with. He may be looking into the darkest shadows, but he is still finding humanity there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"I have been a boingo fan for a few years, yes yes... I came in late.

The \\"hit\\" single, \\"I'm On Fire\\" stills rings classic after 24 years.

It brings to mind images of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 'Yellow Wallpaper', and Margaret Atwood's 'Surfacing'. It deals with the madness and aftermath of war, the unique subject of the experience of a female doctor serving in Vietnam, and the redeeming power of love. This is a book everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily's Ghost","review":"I was continually challenged by this work. While I could not directly relate to the recollected traumatic experiences of its protagonist (as a wartime physician in Viet Nam), I did find myself identifying with the dense, poetic imagery used to articulate her thoughts and reflections on what she was experiencing in real time as the book progressed...as Lily struggled so hard to integrate her excruciating past into her current life in a \\"normal\\" world. I often found myself pausing to re-read and ponder upon certain passages, eager to extract the gifts I knew they held for me.While I have \\"finished\\" reading Lily's Ghost, I know I will carry these gifts with me as a continuing, abiding testament to the value of something all too rare: one author's skillful rendering of what grace we can find as we all face down our ghosts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking reminders","review":"This brought the Vietnam era into the present for brief moments but through the eyes of a woman -- a truly different, impressive approach.

Take care of the child, take care of the mother, honor the father and his place in this picture and remember the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to NORELCO!?","review":"What happened to norelco?? I have had a norelco power shaver for years! and it has been great. It just lost its recharge ability and I think the blades are now just a bit dull, however, always a quick, close shave. This new, HIGHLY OVERPRICED shaver is TERRIBLE! Its quickness is like that of a snail, its shave is like that of a choppy lawnmower, and its charge is like that of an old used duracell! this is supposed to be the revolution in shaving!??? I think not. The only reason I bought it in the first place is because I had been so happy with my old shaver, at least 10 years old not, I expect this one to last a mere few months, if that, and never even come close to the shave of its predecessor.

Oh by the way all of them were Norleco's. Close shave, comfortable. Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco 1050CC","review":"I have owned this product for 2 weeks. Works great and gives a close shave. The only thing I don't understand is the cleaning system. It is the same as the Braun shavers, but the instructions tell you to unplug the power after the cleaning stage so it will not affect the battery life. If you look at the instructions it takes 2 hrs for the cleaning and drying cycle to finish then your instructed to remove the power. After the cleaning cycle if finished it automaticly goes to the charg cycle. If you are like me I am at work by then in the morning. Come on Norelco, whats with this. Poor design on Norelcos part. The shaver does give a nice close shave and is great looking.I'll only give this product 4 stars because of the cleaning/charging system. How many of us are going to remove the power after cleaning.

Recently I purchased their new 1050X ARCITEC shaver. I do NOT like it. The grip (motor unit) is too small and not comfortable to hold while shaving. The floating head unit is too flimsy. The unit requires that the shaving units be opened and cleaned on EVERY use - a pain in the neck. I like the basic Norelco units and really like their SPEED-XL series shavers, which by the way are much less expensive than the Arcitec units. I my estimation, the Arcitec shavers are not worth their expense and I regret wasting my money on one. Stick with their standard units and enjoy their performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest Shaver Ever Made","review":"I was skeptical that anything could top my former Norelco but this one is fantastic. 2 months later I still can't get over the closeness of the shave and ease of this shaver.

I used this razor for a week thinking I would give this a try with the money back offer. Here are my opinions:It feels like you have a piece of plastic in your hand instead of a sturdy shaving system. You cannot get a close shave on the neck. Even after grinding the shaver into my neck for several minutes it still looked the same. Forget about using the trimmer I could do better with my nose trimmer for my sideburns. Price...for what it delivered it was not worth it.Pros: I liked the cleaning system, but that is about it.Needless to say I switched to another brand (it was just as expensive) and have been very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a close shave and worth it!","review":"This expensive electric shaver is worth every penny. It gives the best shave I've had in 78 years (including a few early years when I didn't even have peach fuzz). The cleaning attachment appears to work well, based on a month's experience. I have had many electric shavers dating back to Sunbeam days and through earlier Norelco models and this is far, far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like my shavers to work","review":"I just bought this razor today and I'm kicking myself for not doing a little research first. It does look cool and the floating head made me think that it would give me a nice, close shave with little razor burn...not even close. I had to apply A LOT of pressure for it to even do what it's supposed to (which is shave hair off my face) and that gave me some awesome razor burn. Thanks Norelco! You will not get a consistent shave if you buy this razor. It's an over priced piece of junk and it's getting returned today.

It shaves WAY better than these higher priced models and it is on sale at Walmart for $39.99.

It did not shave nearly as close as my previous norelco shaver. This arcitec caused more irritation and razor burn than any other razor I have used including cheapo disposable single blade razors. Reason being is I found that I would have continuously pass over the same area over and over and couldn't get the hair Shaved especially on my neck. It literally took about 15 minutes to obtain an acceptable shave. Note that I do have sensitive skin and a tough beard. Anyway I returned the razor and purchased norelco 8260 with the jet cleaning system and I have to say the shave with it is amazing. I got a shave that is as close as a blade with very little irritation in about 5 minutes.

It took excessive pressure against the skin to shave. The trimmer does not pop out far enough to be useful. The only thing I liked that I didn't think I would like was the cleaner.

They are still my favorite songs on here, but there is nothing bad about this CD. I was watching the movie Pumpkin a few weeks ago (it was a terrible movie, by the way, in my opinion. I guess it was trying to be funny, but NO ONE really acts the way Christina Ricci did in that. Ridiculous.) and the song Stars of Track and Field is in it. There's really no point to this story, except it's a fantastic song and it sounded like it had been written for the movie. I worked as a lifeguard at a girl scout camp one summer and I always made them listen to this at the pool. I think they enjoyed that. Get Me Away From Here I'm Dying has one of the better melodies I've ever heard.

Now having listened to it, the stars of track and field, and Judy and her dream of horses, for me, are really the radio-worthy listenable catchy tunes. The stuff in between is, you know, indie-shlock, blah blah twangy nothingness. Though, don't get me wrong, would be very suitable for say, trying to seduce 20 something, depressed, slightly higher than average IQ, lonely, journal keeping, liberal arts degree program dropouts. (note: For Engineering degree dropouts, DEVO Hardcore Vol.2 suits this purpose) Oh, and hey, what's the deal with the singer?

It means everything to me.- - - But there is more than one reason to buy this cd. In fact, there are 9. Every song on this album is special.

Tracks 1-7 are flawless and some of the best music you'll get to hear anywhere. Songs 8 and 9 aren't bad songs they just dont stick in your head like the previous do. The last track picks up where the first seven left off. All in all this album is fantastic and very fun to listen to. If you just like good music and great songwriting then pick this one up. There are a variety of intruments used and every song is worthwhile. If you're new to B&S this is THE place to start. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Your feeling the need for a wonderful CD...","review":"In the same vein as Nick Drake, early Simon and Garfunkel, The Velvet Underground, and even a bit of The Smiths, Belle and Sebastian appeal to the melodic, yet artistic sensibilities of popular music. The numerous members of B-N-S have made some of the most enjoyable and heart-felt tunes I've heard since the Morrissey and Marr connection. Each of the three or four vocalist adds his or her emotion and personal insight to the lyrics of each song, making them instantly catchy and meaningful. I highly recommend all of their releases, including their 4 import EP's, which are due out as a limited box set in the near future.

That they are bright there is no doubt, but they don't apply themselves to their work. They don't make eye contact, have trouble socializing and have few friends. Perhaps there is trouble at home? I'm afraid the other bands find them to be an easy target for bullying and often steal their lunch money. Just the other day they had to be sent home after the Smiths tied them to a tree and refused to give them back their guitars. We've noticed some troubling self-esteem issues: the singer is so ashamed of his braces that he refuses to open his mouth wide enough to sing properly.

Belle and Sebastian just don't seem to cut it, their only attraction being that they started out as a relatively obscure group, enough for record collectors and indie punters to go gaa gaa over such a contrvied and unoriginal group.

The good: The melodies are very catchy. The songs are played with admirable restraint, with a clear head for what atmosphere they try to evoke; a wistful, slyly melancholy musical space that soothes the listener, while implanting some solid, hummable melody and subtle instrumental work. ...This music is well-played; the group know their sound and how to use it.

People rave about Belle & Sebastian as if they are innovative. If You're Feeling Sinister is just pretentious, \\"intellectual\\" ramblings. There is not true substance to the lyrics. It all just says \\"look at me! I am witty!\\" instead of having meaning. If you do want to check out Belle & Sebastian, buy the Boy with the Arab Strap or try and have someone copy Tigermilk for you.

Are we reading the same book?? Saturnian Snake is 700+ pages of dull prose, terrible dialogue, and wooden characters.I agree with all the reviewers that the premise of this book is good. Yes, the history of medicine over the past 35 years is fascinating. The idea of portraying it through the eyes of one man whose career spanned that era is solid. But the author was undecided on whether he wanted to produce an entertaining novel or a dry documentary. He tried to do both, and what he produced is a dull novel. Shorten it by 450 pages and you'd have a great, tight story against the backdrop of a period of incredible change. But as it stands right now, the reader plows through chapter after chapter waiting for something to actually happen.

The eighties was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws.

I mean Christ on a Cracker, this script actually went through executives that said, \\"Yeah, this movie is great, lets do this thing.\\" And how does a town that hasn't been able to dance for 6 years so good at dancing. Go figure. Also the song footloose is the 2nd gayest song in the world (The First is Jitterbug by WHAM\\"). If I could give no stars I would, but unfortunately I cannot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movies","review":"If you like movies about music and dancing then you will love Footloose. It also has an excellent Spiritual message in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a plain FUN movie! Guys, watch it with girls.","review":"Yes it's homoerotic, the dancers are too good, and there's so much silly about this film, but it's so much darn fun. Guys, this is the perfect movie to watch with girls. I've not seen a girl yet who doesn't love this movie (and even loves making fun of this movie!). Invite a girl to your house, have this movie playing, and she'll have a good time with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast!","review":"I ordered it as a surprise for my husband since he had been looking for this oldie. It was shipped very quickly & my husband was very happy I got it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Boogie","review":"This is easily one of the best films of the 80's. Kevin Bacon is a GOD in this movie. He plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil. When the Footloose song comes on the radio, my co-worker Tom and i cant help but busting into dance. Its films like this that can make you feel good and drunk with happy feet!! Buy this dvd for your collection and you'll be bursting into dance before u know it!!"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-c54052b7"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/52.md","filePath":"library/52.md"}'),H={name:"library/52.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
