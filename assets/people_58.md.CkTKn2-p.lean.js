First and foremost, you will need an appropriate sized home, with temperature and humidity guages, a heat source, dishes for dechlorinated and salt water, a food dish, structures for climbing and hiding, and enough substrate for your crabs to bury themselves for molting. They are great pets but not as simple to care for as you may have been led to believe. As you should do before getting any pet,spend some time reading up on their proper care.

The last song might be my favorite even though the horns in it threw me for a loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Kept Secret","review":"Secret Sphere are an Italian power metal band that are very similar to early Labyrinth. The songs are mostly midtempo, well-written and well-performed, and tend to have a somewhat 'romantic' feel to them (warm production, synths for atmosphere, flowing guitat work, etc). If you're expecting something akin to Rhapsody, you're in the wrong place. The songs on this album are consistently good, except for the juvenile and glammish 'virgin street 69', which is really out of place on this album. Only complaint would be that the songs tend to be very similar to one another, so they do run together. Their next album, 'hearts & anger', seemed to fix this problem by offering more varied song structures. Overall, a very good album for fans of melodic power metal like early Labyrinth or Magnitude 9, just don't expect blazing speed and fist-in-the-air headbanging anthems (if you want that, check out bands like Hibria or Dragonforce)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex Music","review":"Some how I got suckered into buying this piece of sh-- album,this is not metal this is sex music.There are only two good power metal bands Labyrinth and old Helloween.This album is pure gay,this crapy band is music that girls would like.This band isn't power metal they are sex pop music.DON'T BUY THIS CRAPY ALBUM OR ANY OF THERE OTHER ALBUMS BECAUSE THERE ALL THE SAME PROBABLY.AWFUL.THIS ALBUM DOES NOT GET A ONE STAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanical crock!","review":"This is another churned out horror flick that fails to deliver.After its promising start the movie spirals down into the farcical.It actually brought tears of laughter to my eyes.Wow,just writing this review brings the whole stupidity of it back to me.Save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I was very excited at the prospect of viewing this movie after seeing/reading all the accolades it had received.

Both are 5 star efforts in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie was excellent! I was a little scared to purchase at first, but then I said, what the heck I'll purchase it.

It's truly like watching a trainwreck...or a bad car accident!

The review I read said it was like \\"The L Word\\" and \\"Girlfriends\\" when in reality it was really nothing like either one of those shows. Again, the acting was so terrible it was hard to get into the movie and have any empathy for any of the cast members. I couldn't connect to any of them. I really wish I could give this film a 4 or 5 star rating, God knows there aren't many movies with the subject matter addressed for Black lesbians, but unfortunately it missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"home made","review":"It looked like a home made movie, I couldn't watch it for more than 5 min.

She doesn't use it like a wheel but has built a nest up there and loves to sleep there. She competely chewed up the steps inside but actually seems to prefer paper towel roll tubes instead anyhow. The ball is a little hard to clean but we just rinse it out and put it in the top rack of the dishwasher. So far it's dishwasher safe.

I just bought it and am trying it out for the first time today and here is what I've noted:1. the rug attachment doesn't do squat and while I have mostly hardwood floors, I do have a couple of area rugs that need to be vacuumed at least occasionally;2. the cord is VERY short. Annoyingly so. With my other vacuum cleaners, I've had to move the plug once while doing the house, but with this one, I'm moving it as much as twice per room. Why on earth didn't they give the thing an ample electrical cord????3. the handle/arm of the thing is way too short. I have to bend over to use it and this is hard on my back (and I teach Yoga!)

The vacuum cleaner shuts off after running a few minutes. (That is a feature, once the motor cools down,you can turn it on again. Takes 1 hour) I know you have to clean the filter and empty the dust bin. That is a bad design decision. I don't know what the problem with having bags is. Of course, I can buy a new filter for $20-$25, but it won't last before I have to do this again. I am spending far more money on filters than I ever had with bags.Today my vacuum clean quit after 3 minutes, even though I had just emptied the canister and brushed the filter.Today I am in the market for a new vacuum cleaner. I also will never ever never ever never ever buy another Dirt Devil product ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't skimp on a vacuum cleaner!","review":"That's the moral of my story.

There are pros and cons to this vacuum.pros: great suction, lightweight, has on board tools, retractable cord, no bagsCons: it is hard to maneuver. The hose is cumbersome and makes the head unit difficult to steer. The head unit is NON motorized so it doesn't move freely, you have to really push it. As for the noise level, I would say its average. My dogs don't go running from the room. The cord could be a tad longer.Edited: After using it for several months, I have stopped using it. It got to be too cumbersome to use around the house. Trying to vacuum AND pulling the canister behind you is a pain.

As well, I seem to be cleaning them out more frequently. But compared to the new vacuum, the handle with wands is longer, the dirt cup large enough to clean the whole house, and the permafilter lasts the life of the vacuum. This is the better product. I don't want to stoop to vacuum or clean the tiny dirt cup after each use on my wool area rugs. And I don't want to buy new filters. The suction seems similar.

I am actually quite impressed. We have mostly hardwood with some area rugs. On the hardwood it is the best!!! Picks up pet hair wonderfully (instead of just making it fly around the room like our old upright). It even does a good job on the area rugs (you just have to switch to the turbo head). I love the ease of emptying the canister with the push of just one button. I have the same complaint about the short cord, but I can deal with it since I like in an old house with small rooms! I also love that it is really quiet for a vacuum... no need to shout when it's running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for light duty...","review":"This canister vac might be ok for VERY light duty, but don't expect it to handle any \\"real\\" housecleaning.

I would save up and buy a better canister vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Hardwood Floors","review":"My house is one level and all hardwood floors. This vacuum works great for this. It is easy to manuever and fits well around & under furniture, unlike a stand-up design. I have never used it on carpet however.It is very easy to dump the dirt tray, but it is small so you have to do this a lot (especially if you have pets--I have lots of dog hair).The one thing I don't like is that the handle has the power switch and everything on it.

Great suction, easy to put together. Love the expandable rod. Love the retractable cord. My ten year old loves it and now volunteers to vacuum the house! Only one suggestion for the manufacturers...How about little storage box for the parts! All in all LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

Great service as usual!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret buying","review":"I've got hardwood floors and rugs, and this vacuum really doesn't get the job done on either. The rug attachment is very difficult to maneuver and takes several passes to get up all the small bits of lint, very little suction. I might as well just use a lintbrush. The floor attachment is cheap and made of hard plastic that I'm afraid will scrape up my floor, my cheapo swiffervac does a better job (and is scratchless). If my house had all tile or vinyl floors I'd be happy with this vac, as it is light enough to schlep. The upholstery attachment is decent, as is the crevice tool. On the whole, every other vacuum I've owned has been both cheaper and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' Barry","review":"I've grown so tired of all the hype surrounding Mr. Manilow. I mean, he's no Tom Jones. Sure, he's written a few good numbers but the bottom line is, he has not withstood the test of time as gracefully as Tom. I don't mean to start a rivalry but this myopic love affair with Barry must cease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, good for the non-fan too.","review":"This album is in a way different from most of the albums Manilow has recorded, in that he did not write or produce 9 of the 11 songs. Instead, Clive Davis at Arista records picked the producers that were hot in 1989 and the result was a rather slick, highly commercial album, full of likeable, AC radio-friendly pop ballads, which appeal equally to fans and more casual listeners. Incidentally, that is just the kind of material FANS HAVE BEEN BEGGING BARRY TO DO AGAIN (but co- writing and co-producing) This album yielded 2 AC hits (Keep each other warm and The one that got away), neared gold in America and went top 20 in the UK when it came out. \\"Some good things never last\\" is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album changed my music tastes forever...","review":"I was 14 when the likes of Rick Astley, Jason Donovan, Kylie et al had begun to nauseate me with their repetitive, formulaic jingles. Ready to move on to more mature music, I bought this album on the strength of a glowing review in a local magazine which carried the appealing phrase 'adult contemporary pop'. I guess it's safe to say I haven't looked back since.During this time not a single one of my friends had ever heard of Barry Manilow, much less find him 'icky' as so many seem to do. It wasn't long before a surprising number of my classmates were converted and became Barry fans. When he held a concert in Singapore a year later, we faithfully trooped down as a group and discovered to our amusement that we were easily the youngest fans in the 5000-strong crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soldier's Song by Ken Lukowiak","review":"Utterly brilliant, A Soldier's Song is moving and hilarious in the same breath. I'd recommend all of Ken Lukowiak's books to any readers who enjoy an honest tale from an enlightening, funny and frankly honest perspective. He is a real master and I'm sure that time will see him being acknowledged as a modern Robert Graves, having written a defining classic of war from an ordinary soldiers perspective.

She enjoyed them so much, and could not stop talking first about Cal and then Hunter, that I had to see what all the fuss was about.Well after two weeks, a book a day, for a girl who hated to read, it sparked my curiosity, so I started reading, and was surprised to find out how enjoyable a Teen book about Teen Witches could be. I am not really into Wicca, but these books are really enjoyable. I am on my fifth book, and my daughter read each twice, and is know on the Circle of Three Series.

In this book Alosa finds out about her background, which we've already read a little bit about in Sweep 9 (Strife).

Even at that price, these are STILL overpriced. The box is rubbish, the plastic cases secured by one thin piece of tape that disengaged as soon as I opened the box. No booklet of chapters, nothing except a self-congratulatory essay about the restoration. And HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES does indeed freeze up at about 1:08 on one machine, and freezes but then keeps playing on another. Unforgivable. Extremely shabby treatment of classic films. One star is pretty rough, but I'm sick to death of nickel-plated packages being priced like gold. When Warner puts out box after box of brilliantly reissued and well packaged classic films at less than half the cost of this on-the-cheap package, it's time to complain, and loudly. Note: I'm not criticising the films; I'm criticising the packaging and the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This blu-ray set quality was terrible, (at least in my edition).

The series is kind of like lawyers - some are better than others. But of the 14 movies made I have a 'top 5' list. This order is for the fact that sticking to the lines of mystery are much more preferred. Of the 14 Holmes' made you would be better off getting each individual DVD as follows:The House of FearThe scarlet ClawThe Adventures of S.H.The Hound of the BaskervillesTerror By NightI know MANY will dispute this 'top 5' but the WWII propaganda themes started to bristle after a certain point. Along the lines of this statement, the Jeremy Brett series stands taller for the fact that the 'films' stayed true to the course of Conan - Doyles writings. Many purists would agree along these lines. Rathbone / Bruce fans will dispute this review to no end.

As a group of several performances, I still consider Basil Rathbone to be the best Holmes, but that's just one person's opinion. The five star rating is for how well these films have been preserved. They are of almost the same quality as I remember them before they disappeared. While obviously not of today's standards, they are great considering the problems that had to be surmounted. I'm not a collector, but I would imagine this as close as one can get to having a collector's item in this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Suprised","review":"Better than excellent. I was worried about copies of old movies being copied from VHS versions onto DVD's, with poor audio and video.

In the booksWatson is not such a bumbling idiot.But Rathbone is 'spot-on'. The only one close is the earlyJeremy Bretts acting.These movies use bits and pieces of the books but most ofthe stories are new which is a little bit of a downer.

It is clear that even the \\"back-up guys\\" were working, as they often stopped counting or modified a move.I would agree that most of the moves were what I would consider classic, and I liked that this DVD relied more heavily on combinations of moves, rather than individual moves.I will do the tape again, although there were a few things I found off-putting:-The cues are pretty terrible. I have done Billy Blanks videos before, so I realize this is not his strong point, but I thought his cues were worse than normal.-They often got off beat. I find this very distracting because once I get the combination down, I don't typically look at the screen, and it is difficult to count when not using the beat.

The group of people working out with him are boring, lack energy, and even my favorite Shelly not only looks a mess (hair). Her energy level is not as high as it usually is. It's like he didn't want to pay the right people for the video. If you are a taebo beginniner then you may enjoy the tape. I said maybe. Otherwise this is one of my least favorite.

The battery lasts a good length of time and it pretty quick, even in the highest resolution settings.

The description says the sensor can be 100' away, but the directions state 50' to 60'. The most disappointing thing, which may not be stated for obvious reasons, is that the temperature range is -4 to 140 degrees Farenheit. I live in Minnesota and the -4 is not low enough when the temp. can be -30 in the winter where I live to lows of -45 in northern Minnesota.

The guy is upset because the girl was responsible for an accident that took the life of his wife and unborn child. She was 16 at the time and it was simply an unfortunate accident. The guy basically has her stalked till she turns 18 and forces her to marry him by blackmailing her. He threatened to ruin her widowed mother and her sister. He is a lot older and makes her sleep with him until she is pregnant. Once she is pregnant she informs him and he hits her, hard enough to leave a mark. Nice huh? Since this is a Harlequin you know she stays but would you have stayed with a monster like him? No amount of love can explain emotional and physical abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"why aren't there zero stars?","review":"I bought this book even after reading the review thinking there had to be more to it. Pretty much it is just a sick book.The H does hit his pregnant 19 year old wife because she told him that she thinks of her former boyfriend when they are having sex and not because she tells him she's pregnant. He later does apologize, but it didn't feel heartfelt at all. She does stay with him because he doesn't allow her to drive and she also is scared that if she leaves her hubby will ruin her mom, sis and boyfriend and she doesn't want to feel responsible for that happening.Without giving it away, I didn't like the ending of this book at all.

I almost want to write a photo-book myself of all the virtues of the place. Yes, Juarez has it's share of problems, but as the citizens will tell you, things are always getting better.

The book ends on a particularly low note with an \\"epilogue\\" set twenty-some years later, in which we find a remarkable and unexpected outpouring of venom for the author's one-time lover.

The design is flawed in almost every way. First it's hard to attach to anything other than a seatpost. The attachment is elastic bungee and as the elastic wears out, the grip on whatever you have it on will slip. If you hit a big bump while riding it may fall off altogether. Also it turns on and off by tapping the plastic fob against the red body. If you are riding and the fob accidentally bounces and taps the light, it can turn your light off. This has happened to me several times. The light only lights on one side, so if you tie it on a backpack or a bag it may flip to the non lighted side while riding or walking. There is really nothing good about this design, every part of it is wrong. It should have never made it out of the prototyping."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bicycle safety accessory","review":"This is a great bicycle accessory ...

The format of this book, oral histories in the first person, so personalizes suffering and cruelty that I had to interrupt reading many times in order to go on. There is so much pain here that I soon understood why many Japanese refuse to revisit such memories, even after sixty years. The book is a record of what happens when those in command plug their eyes, minds and hearts with mud. As such, it reminds us that we should not be silent about what happened, if we truly wish that it might never happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite informative","review":"Japan at War: An Oral History, is a unque look at the fifteen year conflict through the eyes of the Japanese themselves. I would have given it all five stars had it contained more interviews from people that weren't so apologetic and tried to stay away from the question of blame a bit more. Unfortunately, the book does as many texts and covers up the fact that many, if not the majority of Japanese favored the war and were not following like blind sheep.

The book contains a series of interviews with locals who survived the war and also with military personnel, even those who participated in atrocities against the Americans and Chinese. The book starts out slow moving, but it then becomes hard to put down. It is an excellent baseline compilation; in fact you see parts of this book quoted in other significant commentaries of the Pacific War. Some parts of the book will enlighten you and possibly make you feel terribly empathetic and sorrowful; other parts will dismay and disturb you. But, it you are a serious student of the war, this is MUST READING and a serious and significant contribution to Pacific War literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal stories","review":"I especiall like the personal stories of not only Americans, but also the Japanese.

How many other foreign actresses could do a full-length number like Cae Cae with her Banda de Lua?

Ms. Blackman's prose are like poetry, and the complexity of the story builds and really draws you in. She paints her characters with colorful detail, and the language is so authentic you feel like you are part of the family in her story. While some may focus their attention on the two S/M scenes, this novel is really about one woman's healing, as she comes to terms with her life and history as an African American growing up in the seventies.

I own more than a half dozen instructional videos. Besides this Huckabee dvd, I have others by Kaufman, Grossman, Sokolow, Keith, and Star. Although I have found them all to be helpful, I would have to say that the most valuable of the lot is \\"The Formula of Music.\\"This set of lessons is very well thought out and executed. Huckabee emphasizes the fundamentals of music theory rather than providing tabs of particular songs. He shows how listening and discerning the orderly structure of music is critical to the development of a good musical understanding. Because his approach is truly foundational, it adds leverage to all one's other efforts to learn an instrument. By teaching the art of music rather than simply presenting particular songs, Huckabee fosters independence in his students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrator kills, absolutely kills this","review":"A good narrator is essential for tutorial videos like this. Unfortunately, this narrator 'teaches' this course with the passion of a 95-year-old pensioner on double dose sleeping pills. Really, I've never seen such a wooden delivery, with monotone voice throughout, strained smiles as he gets to the point in his detailed script where, presumably, it tells him to smile. And, worst of all, how irritating is it to have a narrator looking at you, but in fact looking a few inches below screen level reading (and I do mean reading - you can follow his reading almost with finger on the page) a script. Did he have to read word by word? Couldn't he have improvised and been a bit more spontaneous?I honestly can't say much about the content, because I was sooooo put off by this dreadful, dreadful narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't read while you're eating","review":"I barely read non-fiction. I gave this one a try though, recommended by a friend. I did read it, and finished it in a week. That's a pretty long time, considering I read this during thanksgiving break.It is an historical narrative of the author, telling accounts of the infamous European plague, more popularly called, \\"The Black Death.\\"It is very interesting, considering I've surprisingly never heard of this plague. Which I have to admit was a little embarrassing especially now that I know how much this has influenced the entire European history and most likely, much of what it is today.Warning though, do not read in an empty stomach, while eating, or if you just ate. =p It will not do you any favors. If you have a weak stomach, definitely don't even try to pick this book up. Other than that, very great, interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous leftwing editorializing poisons an otherwise good book","review":"The author imposes a liberal/left outlook on every aspect of his narrative. Mr Kelly pointedly uses \\"a.d.\\" for \\"AD\\" when discussing dates, and constantly second-guesses the motives of anything Western or Christian in origin.One of the more outrageous examples is to describe a post-WWII US Army report as \\"admiring\\" the Japanese use of the plague against the Chinese city of Changteh. No attribution was given. Thus the reader cannot determine for themselves if Mr. Kelly's 'admiration' was real or imaged - or projected to fit an agenda.If an author cannot tell the difference between the facts, his opinions, and his feelings, he is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great research, but hard to follow....","review":"This was very well- researched but the timeline is all over the place.

One should not make the mistake of reading this book over lunch as the descriptions are accurately nauseating in their thoroughness. At times, a hint of monotony does creep into the tale as each country's encounters with the swiftly spreading disease is told. The tale does not vary much and is most interesting in the earlier chapters with the diseases first encounters with Europe in Italy. The book's strengths are its discussion of recent scholarship on both the origin and the nature of the plague. It is a gripping story of a most horrific and unimaginable event."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Mortality Teaches Many Lessons","review":"The Great Mortality is a wonderful book, full of fascinating stories about life in the 14th century Europe that was devestated by the black plague. We are presented with Europe one community or city at a time and view the citizens going about their lives unaware of what is about to descend upon them, and we learn an important lesson: our lives depend on interconnected variables, and the black plague was the \\"perfect storm\\" of things going wrong with climate, weather, trade, politics, and religion, to say nothing of science which as the author points out came into being as a result of empirical study of plague victims. I was struck by how similar we are today to the Europe of 6 centuries ago -- we are no smarter, even with our computers and technology, and we are just as arrogant and vain. I recommend this book to anyone interested in global warming, pandemic disease, human fashion, politics, or the effect of trade on history.

Filmed on a shoestring budget with mainly a Mexican cast, this howler focuses on the devastation wrought by a powerful and unexpected cyclone (I thought they were called cyclones in the Pacific, not the Atlantic?). The movie focuses on a tourist boat beset with stock characters and a dog named Christmas; a sailing vessel with scraggly fishermen; and the survivors of a downed aircraft. Meanwhile a band of vicious sharks (with no teeth?) attack and kill a majority of the actors. Carroll Baker (the sex symbol from BABY DOLL) plays the dog owner and veteran character actor Arthur Kennedy is the priest who objects to the prospects of cannibalism to stay alive.

This product was made very cheaply and poorly. The line is flimsy and not strong enough to hold more than 2 pieces of clothing without sagging. The line on mine is even tearing now. The knob that is suppose to keep the line tight doesn't work properly and the retraction will not pull the line back in correctly or evenly. Now I can't even pull the line out at all, meaning I can't use the darn thing at all anymore. It lasted me less than a year and I hated using it the entire time.

The drywall anchors that came with it promptly pulled right out of the wall as soon as we put any clothes on it whatsoever (leaving quarter sized holes behind). Plus, the first time we have ever tried to use it, the cord started fraying. I would've been better off buying 10 eyehooks and just stringing a clothesline whenever I needed to dry clothes.

When you pull it out, the lines all retract at different speeds causing some very tight lines along with some very loose lines. Also as a tip, make sure that the line is level or a couple inches higher at the retractable end. This way when the line pulls on itself, it doesn't pop off the wall you were trying to mount it on.

Getting the runner up to release the same songs seems really pointless and when you hear Gates' versions of \\"Evergreen\\" and \\"Anything is Possible\\" you'll wonder why Gates bothered. His vocals are weak, and the passion in his voice is lacking. These two tracks seems like an attempt of karaoke rather than a number one selling hit. Unchained Melody isn't much better. He managed to make a classic song as far from emotional as the orginal. This is definately a case of \\"don't touch the classics\\" and hopefully Gareth's original material will make up for this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"To me, Gareth Gates symbolises everything that is wrong with the world of manufactured pop. He may be a pretty face if that is what you are into, but there is no substance behind it. His vocals are weak and boring. He lacks passion and obviously has not had a deep emotional experience like the one described in the song as he doesn't have the capability to reproduce it. Definitely one for the under-15s. If it was slightly less bad it would be boring. As it is it is so bad it is kind of funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"very romantic","review":"This song is much better than I thought it would be.

A large majority of these new color episodes are little more than remakes of old honeymooners sketches from the early 1950's which were far better timed and acted.

Clearly, Taylor, nor mentor and producer, Peter Asher, had any involvement with this exercise in bad taste, and the results are beyond redemption. Also, as these demo tracks had been available in previous formats, additional tracks found on these releases have been left off.

I admire their tireless effort in getting their bikes to move across whatever tarmac, stones, mud, water, or any mere semblance of a road to see them through their mission. If you had to do it, chances are most would give up. But, they persevered.They are so UN-cool as actors, very grounded and very humbled when they meet common folk who generously helped them even without being asked.

A \\"get-away\\" adventure that would expose me to areas of the world I would probably never get to see and experience. The problem is, they gloss over where they are and the people they meet. Much of the book describes their own problems with being homesick and tired. They had a chance to teach us about the history or the areas, what people did for a living, about their abilities to help the people they meet--etc. But alas, the book concentrated too much on their own needs. The other thing that was a disappointment was that you realize how much of this trip was done through outside financing and the work of their support crew. It just becomes another story of the \\"rich and famous\\" and not realistic for the average person who dreams of that type of adventure.

It IS a story about a couple of pampered British Socialists who are riding bikes around the world on somebody else's dime. They have an entourage seeing to their every need--they don't even have to pick up their own bikes if they fall off. You won't be hearing anything much about their bikes (BMW's) or the ride itself, or about the nature of the countryside through which they are riding. What you will hear about is their activities in the evenings and whenever they aren't riding their bikes. From that standpoint their story is mildly interesting but I'm put off by their whining and worrying when, if fact, the major burdens of their trip are carried by others.

Here are these two rich guys, on the trip of a lifetime, and they are complaining constantly! While their side trips to introduce us to various charities were moving, the amount of time spent complaining about the roads (did you think the roads in Africa would be pristine?), the amount of time on the bikes (should have planned better!) each day and about each other (this isn't your first trip, so you should know about everyone's little quirks) made the book a bit unenjoyable.

It sort of works, sometimes, if you make a Skype call, hang-up, then quickly make a call with a messenger. Also, with the software that shipped in the box it was very buggy and pretty unuseable. Went to the website for a new installer (that software that it comes with doesn't have an upgrade button) and not it passably works. It still hangs up sometimes and I'm very aware that pressing too many buttons too quickly will crash it. That said, when someone calls me the attached phone I have rings and I can pick up and talk to them. And I can call out. So, in that sense, it's seems to be working.

I'm a big fan of the female chanteuse/engenue.I had never heard any of Marilyn's music but I trust my friend and bought her new one. Wow, what a great CD! I knew some of the songs, which was cool and I totally fell in love with her voice! Unlike Norah (who I love), Marilyn's smooth-as-caramel voice possesses a feeling and depth of soul that makes her unique and wonderful.When I'm finished with Nightcap I fully intend to begin exploring her back catalog - Avenues of Love, Take Me With You, all of it!

It has been butchered beyond belief!I would imagine that if the original negative copies still existed they would probably have a runtime of 26 or more minutes, and as an adventure show of this type, were probably very tightly plotted to begin with. Unfortunately it appears that successive bouts of editing over the years to fit it in increasing amounts of advertising have left copies so heavily edited that they are annoying to watch. To be fair, it appears that the epsodes have been edited in such a way so as to leave as much continuity to the plot as possible, but this still does not alter the fact that the editing leaves the stories far from intact.

The more gears you add on to the design, the slower they get. What doesn't help this problem is that the magnets are not strong enough and as the gears turn, the magnet slides right out of your design. Our Grandson still plays with the toy, but because of these issues, it doesn't keep his attention for long. We are always \\"fixing\\" the design to keep it working.

The titles are \\"safe\\" to give children / grandchildren unlike some so called modern children's titles out there that have crass content, at best, but are not previewed by parents / grandparents. The Happy Hollister's series are stories that contain good character examples with children learning to work for things and not just expect things without personal and honest effort.

I am a Generation Xer that actually has patience. I don't mind extensive dialogue if it has a point. You don't need special effects or action to make a movie, but a good story can easily be ruined by pointless minutes of footage. The DVD has a special feature of deleted scenes. That is really funny to watch after you have spent 45 minutes watching one scene of dialogue.

Robby Muller's cinematography is stunning. Ry Cooder's score is perfect.As far as everything else? Forget it. Didn't believe any of it. Harry Dean Stanton, usually very good in character rolls, is unwachable here. Why? Again, this director has a gift for being pretentious. His flicks drag on and on forever.

I don't know...frankly, I have no idea how this dull flick won anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Physically Nausious","review":"I just saw this movie for the first time and I am sickened by the positive reviews it has gotten. Are we living on alternate planets? This was a HORRIBLE movie. The storyline and the characters were all completely unbelievable. The acting was so bad I sometimes didn't believe they were professional actors on the screen. I muscled through it hoping that something would eventually happen to redeem the movie. Even though I spent no money to watch this I am going to send a bill back to the makers of this movie for compensation for wasting my time and brain cells. I hope I will be able to keep my dinner down tonight. Do yourself a favor if you see it on cable, keep flipping channels. The shopping channel would be more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD - widescreen version","review":"Wim Wenders' remarkable film is preserved in a wonderful widescreen format. Special features include commentary from Wenders, deleted scenes, and a short film depicting the actors making an entry into Cannes, where the film won top honors in the early 80s. Harry Dean Stanton's Travis wanders on foot through southern Texas and Mexico for four years following a devastating breakup with his wife Jane. Jane, at one time a wild spirit who sought a life of adventure, leaves their son, Hunter, with Travis' brother and sister-in-law. The film depicts Travis' return from his emotional abyss and his attempts to reunite his family. This is a story of guilt, remorse, and loneliness, which confronts honestly the complexities facing a shattered family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple story with great depth","review":"Why I like Paris,Texas and what makes it so moving and interesting after all this years. It's a simple story with great depth. It has a unique picture composition, in which almost every emotional movement of the characters is reflected. Here the language is not the dialog but the editing. I can't compare it with any other film. It's a sort of roadmovie with elements of western: the characters struggle against the great frontier of loneliness, to find some meaning with their lives. Two people forgiving each other and the choices they made, ending up accepting life as a condition of \\"to be\\" and not \\"to be someone\\". Wenders reaches the highest emotions without leaning on unbearable clich��s, and has made a great piece of film.Sensible and strong !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The describer of eternity and way where love can lead...","review":"I was just 9 or 10 years old when i saw this movie - parents said that too serious even for them but i was so affected and felt like i have some undescribable connection with this movie - the look of color combination in farmes , the way it was directed and the feeling of movie made me feel like i'm having some \\"splashes of memory from sort of my previous life or some other beeing in some other dimensions\\" that made me discover it like most delightful and eternal love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please bring it out on Video again","review":"I saw this movie on TV when I was 15 years old.

Having possibly had amnesia, he later reconnects with his past.The scene where Travis and his wife meet again is very emotional in my opinion the most memorable scene in the film.The DVD edition has two discs with the film and director's commentary on disc one.Disc two contains an interview with Wenders by Roger Willemsen, a 1990 documentary about Wim Wenders, Interviews with Allison Anders and Claire Denis, 1984 French television special about the film and Wenders, a Theatrical trailer, Deleted scenes, home movies with the cast and crew, location scouting photos, and other behind the scenes photos.This is the best fully English language film by Wenders I have seen to date and hope to see Criterion release more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Finish","review":"The period is one that interests me so I downloaded Forever His: A Time-Travel Romance.

The female character was a strong confident woman - chick power. The knight - a studmuffin. The pace of story was pretty quick too, I thought the author moved the story along well to keep me interested. I recommend this book!!! I do have 1 question though - if the lead female character left 1993 and arrived in 1300 then wouldn't that mean she's in a continuous loop? Dies in the 14th century and is born in the 20th century (not knowing she is going to travel back in time) then travels back in time lives the rest of her life, dies and then is born again in the 20th century.Which gets me thinking, wouldn't it be even more interesting if the author had her meeting different men in the 14th century so everytime she went back she had a new adventure??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Story","review":"I really enjoyed this story. OK, Gaston was a bit over the top, but his rival really was trying to kill him, Celine just didn't know that. The one little criticism I have is that it was stretching my suspension of disbelief to have Celine have had so many careers in such a short time and been a smashing success at all of them. I would like to read stories about heroines who are a little more ordinary and don't necessarily come from a celebrated wealthy family of over achievers who all look like super models. It seems a little lazy to me. An every day, cute nice girl who can really cook and is very clever would have made the story better for me. Otherwise, it's just tough to relate. Over all though, I liked it and I really loved the resolution. Also, the hero and heroine actually joked with each other, like real human beings. Nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I've read several time-travel books and there are just a few pretty good ones. I'm counting this one to the 'pretty good ones'. With most stories when you're halfway trough the story gets boring after the declaring of eternally loving each other and all that sappy stuff but with this one the story/plot goes on with a kind of suprising ending... it's not the usual I-love-you-but-there-is-this-super-evil-force-leaking-around the corner-that-threatens-it-bore... well anyway I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book, wish there were more like it.

I really figured it was going to be larger. I bought this as a Christmas present for my mother and was ashamed to give it to her.

The Jellyfish itself is pretty well done - fairly tall and broad and colorful, quite realistic. It almost looks like a real jellyfish. For the price paid (around $80 with shipping), I consider it a bargain. The stand sent with the jellyfish seems under-equipped to handle the weight of the glass jellyfish however. Mine started moaning and groaning (as it rotated) after a few days. But then you can use any non-rotating lighted stand for this item if you like as it's a nice decorative nautical item."},{"rating":"1","title":"These didn't work when I got them","review":"These didn't work!

Found it holds the third level of the series together nicely, giving hints of things he may reveal in the next books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"I find with Card that after a while the story stretches beyond his ability to keep it going. That was the way with Ender and also with the Alvin series. In both, he starts off with incredibly believable books, that keep you riveted to the stories and wanting to live the lives of the characters. But by the time I reached this volume I was becoming bored and then annoyed, and in the end just kept turning the pages because I wanted to know the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed...","review":"Something changed in Card between the previous two books and this one, the third in the ender series. He talks about religion endlessly rather than tell an interesting story. He seriously could have cut out half the book without it impacting the story, its slow and full of filler. The story talks a lot about sexuality and sex outright which is new to the series, its as if hes fixated on it all of a sudden but it doesnt feel like its inserted naturally into the world and storytelling style he has created. It comes accross almost as a fixation. Its bizare. Im just very unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating premise, ridiculous ending","review":"The book is full of really interesting ideas, but they are awkwardly crammed into a plot that cannot sustain them. Xenocide is nonetheless a fascinating read for much of the book. The biggest problems are, as others have noted, the inane exposition dominating the last 1/4 of the book and the ridiculously contrived deus ex machina ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series gets pointlessly longer, unfortunately.","review":"Ender's Game is fantastic. Speaker for the Dead is possibly the best SF book ever written. Xenocide continues the series, but it just coasts along without any of the punch of the first two book. Much happens, the plot moves forward, but in retrospect I wish I had stopped with book two. This book was too plot heavy and too predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card at his best","review":"As a devoted fan, of course I'm required to say that this is an amazing book. But people, this is THE amazing book of the decade, complete with tragedy, comedy, pain and love, desire, duty, the search for truth, the consequences and advantages that come with learning the absolute truth, and, of course, the further evolution of Ender Wiggin as a character and truly a human being. Of all the Ender books so far, this is the best.

Card really jumps around A LOT with the characters and their motivations, but, it must be understood that Xenocide is simply a bridge between \\"Speaker\\" and \\"Children of the Mind.\\" Obviously Card had too big a story to condence into one novel and wanted his readers to witness the slow development of his characters first-hand. The Ender books are certainly not everyone's cup of tea, but anyone with a good taste for human-based speculative-fiction won't be disappointed if they take the time to read all four. All great fiction must be read and re-read to be appreciated. There.

For a third time, Orson Scott Card has managed to capture the feelings and emotions of his charecters in such a way that the reader can hardly put the book down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not up to the caliber of Ender's Game, but good nonetheless","review":"I loved Ender's Game, certainly it is one of my favorite books. Speaker for the Dead, which introduced the piggies an Ender's post-xenocide life, was good but at times a little slow. I think Xenocide is second best of the three. I love the philosophical and scientific discussion of philotic threads, which often spans several pages. The parts with the Path, i.e. a Chinese colony highly involved with Starways Congress, were extremely dull at the beginning, but picked up speed later on. The chapters on Lusitania were overall better though. The main thing that I didn't like about the book was the seperation of Ender and Valentine and the way that Ender becomes more a part of his new family. I don't find Novinha's family (can't remember last name...) very interesting. I always liked the relationship between the Wiggin siblings, and this kills it a little. Oh well, good book, hope to read Children of the Mind soon and then on to the Bean series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only half the fun of it...","review":"This third Novel in the Enders Saga was perhaps the most long winded Philisophical Sci-fi I ave ever read. Don't get me wrong, it was a wonderful story, but it was also only obvious that Xenocide and Children of The Mind should have been one book. Yes, It would have been long, but The end of Xenocide left you with a sense of wanting so much! A worthwhile read, just don't read one without the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Ender's Game is fantastic fiction. One of the best. However, the Ender series has gradually lost all continuity from the fabulous firs installment.Ender has become a sentimental dead pan and worse. Card takes the Ender character, the ultimate leader and anti-hero, and turns him into a disfunctional, co-dependant, helpless character.Not only does the demise of the Ender character spoil the book, but the unbelievable, make-it-up-as-Card goes along, plot is so unbelievable it makes one wonder why there are so many subplots. It seems like Card has a bunch of ideas with no solution, so he resolves them by making up a new set of physics where he can pull resolutions from.The hive queen is the only thing that saves this book. The Path subplot is so redundant that I skippped many pages because it was so predictable.Advice: Skip this book and just get the plot summary from some web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Orson Scott Card has brilliant way of telling many stories within one story. Meaning, in Xenocide there is lots of depth. I really enjoyed the book. There were MANY times when all the philosophical talk got on my nerves. But by the end of the book I was satisfied. Execllent Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card drops it","review":"Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker. Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again. In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.And Card solves all these problems neatly. What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts. With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story.Oh well. Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me lose interest in the series","review":"Ender's Game was great, and I enjoyed Speaker for the Dead for most of it. But I stopped reading Xenocide halfway through. It's painfully slow, talks endlessly of religion, and has none of the character of the first two books.

The Lusitania / Star Fleet, etc. part of the story is typical, really good (maybe great) Card writing. It is perhaps a bit philosophical and maybe a little preachy for my personal taste, but I can appreciate the message. I just did not care for the whole Path angle. Xenocide really could have been a 500 page book, instead of 700, with most of Path eliminated. It is a somewhat interesting story, but it just doesn't fit in with the goings-on of Ender et al, on Lusitania. Of course, the story is woven to make it fit, but it isn't necessary. Also, until Children of the Mind came out, I always hated the ending. It just seemed to not fit in with anything else in the series. I suppose it served as a good lead in to 'Children,' but whether that was intended, or forced due to criticism, I don't know. Obviously, this is a great series, and I absolutely recommend it. I just expected a little, well LESS, from this installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally someone who attempts to expand the human imagination","review":"Everyone who wrote critsizing the story for its various ideas brought up are all a bunch of sheep you all cling to the belief that what you believe is the truth you all remind me of the Christian religion afraid to open up and think for a second that your beliefs may not be the only ones or even the right one's, Card on the other hand is willing to think, even if his beliefs are not accurate at least he is willing to ponder the ideas of the universe. A wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Qin-Joa is dumb bitch...","review":"whenever i read her part of the story I really want to QUIT reading the book...but I go on because it is really a good book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different..

But I still LOVED the sequels!This sequal, the third book in the series, is indeed a different kind of story, a lot more philosophical, touches on human morals, dilemmas etc.. And moreover, seems to move the spotlight from Ender to other interesting characters.. Personally, the \\"OSD people of the path\\" storyline has deeply touched me, and I thought was wonderful!!So, if you're reading this, you've probably read the AMAZING 1st book in the series, Ender's game. And you've probably, like me, LOVED it.The sequels.. Well.. Some people loved it, some hated it.. Because of all the reasons above.Personally, I loved it, maybe even more than Ender's Game.A word of notice though - The book ends in mid-story.. And continues in Children of the Mind..In conclusion - Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not only a S/F!","review":"Xenocide does have a very good plot, but not as good as the one Ender's game had. It's more about life, about people, about love! One thing bad about this book is that it's way too long! I mean that Card could have cut the book in half, and people would like it better. It has too much philosophical conversations that are not necessary. So don't be surpised if you find this book boring sometimes. But the book definitely has a good ending, very good. Everything came as surprise. What to believe and what not to, what is the truth and what is not. Love what you love, be what you are. Live as happy as you wish. Life is beautiful. Overall, it's a book that's worth to read. But if you are really busy and don't have a lot of reading time for S/F, I don't think you should buy this book, there are a lot of better books out there.

MAIN CHARACTER CONVERTS TO CATHOLICISM! BAPTISED ALIENS!Think of a negative personality trait and there's a character for each one in this book. People behave outrageously and are practically unchallenged. Love & faith conquers all.THIS IS NOT A SCI-FI BOOK. ITS BADLY DISGUISED RELIGIOUS NONSENSE.After reading I looked up Orson Scott Card.

The bulk of this book consists of the different characters talking in far too much length about things that do not warrant or serve anywhere near so many words and pages. That isn't to say there aren't cool and interesting ideas here. Card is always good at infusing his books with great philosophical, theological, and ethical depth. This time it's just lost in about 300 pages worth of excess material that detracts from the experience (the edition I read was just over 600 pages long).I absolutely loved Speaker for the Dead, Ender's Shadow, and Ender's Game.

For me, it's no doubt the best book of the saga and one of the best books I've ever read, so I took his following, XENOCIDE, with plenty of excitement... and the deception was equally amazing. It's sooooo boring it took me about _two months_ to finish it...

Ender spends a good amount of the book trying to make everyone happy, and not always succeeding.

However, the story also branches out to include a storyline with Chinese culture influence, which includes a strange subplot with a society which revers OCD like activities - claiming that the gods must talk to these people. There are a number of philosophical discussions, moral dilemmas and much character development. However, it just didn't feel like it was pulled together as well as in the first two books in the series. The ending was also a little off for me.All in all, the book was OK. I didn't like it nearly as much as either Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead. I did like it enough that I will probably continue with Children of the Mind. I've also heard that the Shadow series is much more in-line with the Ender's Game feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic, just very good","review":"Xenocide suffers from not being as consistent as the first two books; the first half in particular is very pedestrian, and it sometimes gets bogged down under the weight of its own ideas. Once it gets going, however, it reaches the heights of the first two books - even surpasses them on occasion. If you didn't like \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" you probably won't like this one either; in which case I would advise you read Ender's Shadow and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this is the same author of the first 2 books","review":"What a let down after the 1st 2 excellent books.

I can honestly tell you that you will not be disappointed. Orson Scott Card continues this story and adds new surprising elements along the way. I found myself growing to know the characters as if they were good friends. This is a terrific book, but you definitely shouldn't pick it up until you read the other two. Otherwise, you will be quite confused. There is never a dull moment in this story and it kept me guessing what would happen til the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy Preachy Preachy","review":"What a disappointment! I had to force my way through it. I think the author was as bored at the end as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step down","review":"maybe I shouldn't judge this book along with its excellent predecessors,butI couldn't help feeling it was a let-down.The book is far too long,tackles(or attempts to tackle)far too many subjects,and reads very slowly. One of the reasons I loved Card's first two books was his fantastic ability not to waste words on anything-the result being compact,entertaining and thought-provoking writing. This offering did not need 600 pages to tell its story.It is basically two novels in one, that intersect eventually,but,in fact,the \\"Path\\" characters and story could've been left out entirely,and the story would have been just as good and certainly shorter. I don't know yet if i'll be able to stomach another \\"Lusitania\\" novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed.","review":"As with many others, I started this book with great anticipation. I had figured it couldn't miss, after how good the first two were. I was, however, sadly disappointed. It turned out to be long and preachy, lacking the \\"fire\\" of the other books. Also I came to dread every chapter that contained \\"Gloriously Bright\\" and her Godlike Father. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing because it lost its credibility at the end.","review":"I enjoyed the Ender series. Ender's Game is obviously a classic. Once I got over the fact that Speaker for the Dead was not like Ender's Game, I enjoyed that book as well. Xenocide continues the story of Speaker for the Dead. I enjoy Card's writing because he often covers interesting moral ground. And Xenocide doesn't disappoint in that regard. However, the whole book fell apart for me, once Card employed a ridiculous Deux ex Machina consisting of some trippy paranormal physics. I don't want to give any spoilers for it, but I didn't think Card had to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Fast Paced as Ender's Game - Still a great read","review":"OSC is one of the best writers in the US today. In fact I will go so far as to say he is second only to Stephen King.This book is not a stand-alone book, it is a sequal to Ender's Game. I read this book around 1996. I heard about Ender's Shadow a month or two ago and have recently finished the series. I have read all of the Ender and Shadow series and will continue to do so as long as they keep being written.If you are not familiar with OSC, he is also the author/playright of the Abyss! Ender's Game is planned to be made into a movie by WB and the producer of a Perfect Storm.This book is about Ender's life off-planet after having saved the world. This book is very philosophical and has less action. It is a not as fast paced as Ender's Game. I would say more about the book, but I hate people giving away any information about books and movies so I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xenocide is a crime against its two predecessors","review":"\\"Ender's Game\\" was a great book, among the greatestin the genre of Science Fiction. \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" wasa completely different book: not as enthralling, but perhaps more original. These were high art. \\"Xenocide\\" defaces that art. \\"Xenocide\\" takes the characters Orson Scott Card created in his early art and changes them in order to spread his theology to the fan group which had hitherto (justly) respected his work. As a result, \\"Xenocide\\" is not only ponderous and preachy, it violates the both rational and dramatic sensibilities.Card has already novelized the \\"Book of Mormon\\" in his \\"Call to Earth\\" series. He should have left his theology there."},{"rating":"1","title":"it has three major flaws","review":"Overly religious, poorly explained, prohibitively slow. I think that, the religious background of this story gave a very personal touch and sometimes it was hard to digest. Besides it was far from convincing so, two stars to Xenocide."},{"rating":"2","title":"theological absurdity","review":"Another good, entertaining story from Card. He's a terrific writer; storyteller.That said, it's so evident that the author uses his writing to resolve his self-awareness of the absurdity of his own held religious doctrine. To be clear, not just his devotion to LDS, but all religious dogma. Perhaps one day, he'll realize that theology is scifi itself and he will let it whither away in his own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with IPod Nano","review":"Great idea but the yellow/green light on the unit kept flashing alternating colors and the Nano screen flashed on and off (not what it does when connected to a computer USB port) Nothing in the instructions and no web support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for my Garmin Nuvi 200","review":"Bought this to use as AC adapter/charger for my Garmin Nuvi 200 and it does just great. I've only used in the AC mode, so I don't know about the 12 VDC side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective from the factory","review":"The AC portion of my Zip Linq Power Adapter never worked. I only used it (read: tried to use it) on infrequent business trips, so by the time it had become enough of a pain to me to see about getting it replaced it was already several months after my purchase and I no longer knew where the receipt was or from whom I had purchased it. Bottom line: no receipt = no RMA# = no return = a total waste of money. Regardless of the well intentioned Receipt/RMA#/Return policy, you'd think a distributor/manufacturer would be eager to learn of the occasional defective product and the resultant dissatisfied customer in order to remedy the situation . . . unless, of course, the defects are more than occasional . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Ipod","review":"I like the design and function of the device.

Go get that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book HEAVY on Math","review":"The one thing for anyone considering this book is \\"this it is a college textbook\\" that is extremely heavy on math. As a matter of fact, it is hard to even find a page in this book that is not inundated with math formulas. Plus, the price is \\"college publishers price\\" that is horrible at $160-$180 dollars.If you are considering a career in \\"Electrical Design Engineering\\" and currently in college or considering college, then this book is a requirement \\"because\\" of all the math that is required for electrical design engineering. On the other hand, if you just want to learn about electrical components and are considering a career or retirement in \\"Electrical Component Repair\\" this book will be, for the most part, a financial waste and not helpful.\\"Electronic for Dummies\\" is much better for those not interested in electrical design engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible itching","review":"After searching over and over and trying 4 styles this one works the best. It takes a few tries to get all the hair off my legs. I have had two of these and the button is hard to push. The irritation has been horrible. It warns you that it takes getting used to but 3 weeks of redness and irritation was unbearable. I began scratching after a half a day of shaving. I never experienced this before. Doesn't hold a long charge though im not sure what the standard s but 10 minutes is the most I get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I'm on my second of these and really have had no complaints. I had the last one for a very long time - ten years at least or nearly. It just didn't hold a charge anymore. When I went online to find a new one, I looked at other brands, but couldn't find one that had good reviews. Honestly, there aren't that many out there for women. This one is a good size and weight for me and the only thing I didn't like was that it seemed to pull the hair under my arms when I used it there. But I never changed the cutters, so this may have been the problem. A good, reliable, easy to use and clean shaver.

It tore my skin and left me with a rash for days. After using it twice I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, close shave... That lasts for about an hour tops.","review":"I purchased this razor based on the great reviews that other customers gave it and the fact that I'm tired of constantly having to change razor blades in my manual all of the time. So I gave this one a shot. I was really excited to give this a try that as soon as it was charged, I got right out of bed and turned it on. It wasn't really loud like I expected, and it was great to get such a close shave so quickly. However, this close shave only lasted for about an hour or two and I could feel stubble on my legs. I thought that maybe my legs just needed to get used to shaving with something new, so I kept at it for a week with the same results:close shave for only a little while. I guess my legs are just different. This would be great for those of you whose hair doesn't grow back quickly, and if it does, don't mind shaving every waking minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn Monroe (Box Set) (Import) Great Performances","review":"I found this CD to be unique as well as entertaining.

Found the Firefly at the local scout shop, but had to return it as the hip belt was too big. However, saw it again at another local store, for some reason, that hip belt was smaller and this bag is perfect for his size and frame. Sidepockets come in very handy and it did survive a week of being tossed around in Boy Scout Camp. It is true that it is difficult to attach sleeping bag, mat and tent, although a mat can be strapped at the bottom, a non-bulky sleeping bag fits into the bag itself, tent on top. Not ideal, but than, if you want a sturdy backpack that is smaller than your kid yet surprisingly roomy, I can definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Do not purchase!","review":"I took this pack on it's first trip last week. I packed it with just over 30 pounds of gear. 5 hours into my hike one of the shoulder straps tore off at the seam. I used another piece of strap to rig the shoulder strap back together and carried on. The next day I was tightening the top flop down by the strap and it also tore away at the seam! I had to use a bungee cord to help keep that part of the flap down. Coming off the trail I noticed one of the internal pockets had completely ripped open, also at the seam. My hiking buddies couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculous pack I was using. Obviously this pack is very poorly manufactured and will not hold up under normal hiking conditions. It comes with a replacement guarantee, but why would I want another one of their poorly manufactured products? Fortunately Cabella's will give me my money back.

I am very happy with the backpack itself. The quality is good and the straps very comfortable. The only complaint I have applies to the two-toned backpack. I have found that the black coloring weeps into the rest of the fabric if it gets wet. I live very close to the Arctic Circle, so snow and rain are a given. Had I realized this before I bought the bag, I would have bought the solid black. Other than that, the bag is superb!(Also, even though Amazon does not ship overseas, it was worth paying a bit more for shipping from another merchant.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks, this is hard to find","review":"I love this shampoo, I only use it once or twice a week, but it really makes a difference with my white hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Wrong Item Sent","review":"I ordered Simply Silver for my mother who lives in another state.

You also get the amazing Otis Redding courtesy of his song \\"These Arms Of Mine\\". And let's not forget the Patrick Swayze songs, \\"Raisng Heaven (In Hell Tonight)\\" and \\"Cliff's Edge\\".

It is scholarly nonfiction, written in about 1903, accompanied by footnotes and cites. However, for those who like historical novels, especially about Henry VIII and the reality of why he had so many wives, this book is invaluable. This takes away the romance of Henry VIII, his personality, his policies, and gives documentary evidence of people's actions instead of creating heroes out of mere people. After reading this book, I will be looking at books of that era in a different light.

Jane Seymour is too limp to have any sins, and Catherine Parr was the perfect wife for the jerk. Hume does admit Henry was a jerk, but he seems to blame the wives at the same point he keeps saying he isn't blaming them.It must have been groundbreaking for its time, but Hume relates too much as fact that isn't fact (Howard's last words) and ignores other things.

An hour and a half of your life that you'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I normally enjoy Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon movies, but this one was boring.

Your time is more valuable than to spend it watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I spent money on this","review":"Since it was not a free Prime movie I had higher hopes, especially after reading some of the reviews.

Maybe not quite four stars out of five, but close.Plus -- if you're a Tim Roth fan, as I am -- well, he's in here and he's terrific as a disenchanted cop.Another old favorite of mine is in here, too. Remember Stuart Margolin? He of \\"The Rockford Files\\" fame? I didn't even know he was still around, so it was a treat to see him pop up as a savvy attorney (completely against type of the scammer he played on \\"Rockford').Anyway, \\"Arbitrage\\" certainly won't be the worst film you see, buy, or rent this year.

Remember Pretty Woman? He doesn't disappoint here either. I would describe this movie as more of a drama than a thriller per se although I was wondering what was going to happen to Gere's family due to his auto accident / involuntary manslaughter with his mistress. This leads me to the ending. The movie just ends and we assume that Gere works out everything with his family. I'm not sure if I missed something but this is what I got out of it. It was rather lackluster as I was hoping there would be a grand climactic scene. Thus 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought, except for the end...","review":"I'm not a huge Richard Gere fan but figured I'd give it a try anyway. While the story was predictable and there were no twists, it kept us interested to see how it was going to play out.I tend to stay away from Lionsgate films solely because their endings always suck and this movie stayed true to that thought. The ending SUCKED. I want a little more closure than what it gives. Not sure if Lionsgate people think they are being tricky with their endings or what but all they do is annoy me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arbitrage","review":"This movie has a great plot, full of twists and turns, and a somewhat satisfying ending.

Just a mediocre movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"gilgamesh","review":"This film was not up to the standards I expect from such actors as Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon; the plotting and dialog were the products of lazy tradecraft. In particular the repeated use of the F word by all major actors was not only off putting but unrealistic; I am a business executive and regulary engage in dialog with conpetitors and the use of the F word is almost non existent. Finally, the ending of this loosely woven drama was predictable from the middle of the film. Overall, I wouldn't even recommend the film as a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Richard","review":"As I was watching this movie I slowly became aware I was going to finish watching this movie only because I paid for it.

I have never been so disappointed. What the movie amounted too was this: Poor rich man makes bad decisions in money and love and pays off everyone to get himself out of it. This story line has been done so many times that its sad Gere and Sarandon wasted their time with it. The only Character I was interested in was Jimmy Grant played by Nate Parker, but only because there was nothing else to be interested in. I can't even relate how poorly this movie was done. Details are bad, acting was bad, story was bad, ending...well that went beyond bad. Please save yourself from wasting your time on this movie. Please, I beg you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Gere plays a jerk in this movie, a liar & adulterer!","review":"Richard Gere plays a jerk who comes home at night after work to briefly spend only 5 minutes (literally) celebrating his birthday with wife, grown kids, & grand kids at home. Then he lies to all of them to say he's going back to office for more work that night, but instead he goes straight to his much-younger mistress' place! I hate when people lie to spouses, much less kids & grandkids, to selfishly spend time with someone in adultery! I simply despise liars & adulterers! Disclaimer: No, my spouse never cheated on me. No, I never cheated on my spouse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting and storyline","review":"Great acting by Richard Geer and Susan Sarandon.

The protagonist, Richard Miller, as played by Richard Gere, has his Chappaquiddick moment, walking away from his dying girlfriend in a car he crashed, and fudges $461 million on his books so he can flip his company to become even more obscenely rich.At the end, is he on trial? Is he behind bars? Is he even the subject of derision on Gawker or Page Six for his excesses? No: he's accepting an award at a black tie dinner, a rich man who has gamed the system and escaped all consequences: America in 2012."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected much more from this movie.

It was interesting because he started actually rooting for Richard Gere's character towards the end and asked me if I did as well--no, I was rooting for the wife and daughter! Not sure if that's a difference between the sexes or just us. I'd be interested to know if others responded the same way.It's about time Hollywood put out a decent movie without relying on chase scenes and explosions.

This was a big disappointment, although the acting was excellent. Richard Gere is always a pleasure to watch; he's confidant, capable, and charismatic, giving a very good performance as a single-minded and unscrupulous man. The problem here is the script, which is confusing and boring, and gives us no one to root for. None of the characters are likable and most of the dialogue consist of muffled references to Big Trade Deals that we aren't meant to fully understand.The story paints a believable picture of a powerful man who can buy anything except, of course, his family's love. The movie is predictable and only interesting in brief spurts; basically, it's an unsympathetic and dull story.

And she's such a good actress.Brit Marling, playing the daughter, was an Ivanka Trump wannabe without the intelligence, beauty and sense of style and humor.

There's a rich guy who gets in a car accident and leaves the scene, there's bad business decisions that get covered up, there's infidelity in a marriage that both sides accept.

Otherwise, it's a story like we've seen many times before. I didn't find Richard Gere's character very likeable nor Susan Sarandon's for that matter. We watch the conflicts in their lives based on the choices they make. It all works out in the end and everyone is relatively unscathed from the events that transpired. There aren't any chilling thrills. There's only one slight \\"aha\\" moment when we learn how the young man was framed by the police.If you're selective about the movies you're willing to pay theater prices to see, don't put your money down on this one.

Gets quite complex. Betrayals. And, then it just ends ... it was like the producer didn't know how to end the movie, but he did it anyway. All kinds of strings left untied."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OUTSTANDING MOTION PICTURE","review":"Whatever you look for in a movie, this film has it all. It is BELIEVABLE! The story is captivating. The performances are extraordinary. Richard Gere's acting is a tour de force. The expressions on his face carry you with him on his life's journey of success and deceit and even evoke your sympathy, his misdeeds notwithstanding. You'll keep rooting for him 'til the cynical end. Gere will get an Oscar nomination,and don't count out his co-stars. A must-see flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigued","review":"I loved this movie. Richard Geer's performance was good. Susan Saranden is one of my favorite actors.

Great actors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arbitrage was above average","review":"Thinking this was going to be a movie about the life and times of Bernie Madoff, I didn't think I would last through the first half hour. Also, I have never been an avid Richard Gere fan (except for his role in Pretty Woman), however, Gere did an excellent job in this movie, and it was totally unexpected. The movie completely captivated me and I would highly recommend this as a more cerebral offering from the boys and girls in Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arbitrage","review":"Excellent movie. Richard Gere is a wonderful actor and I enjoy watching his action packed movies. It was a great watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"Great storyline with powerful character development executed brilliantly by Richard Gere.

I say that because Gere was[good in his role] a mess trying to cover up his lies about where he was taking money from and where he was putting it\\"arbitrage\\" at its best...the audit...the buy out-all very good. What I did not enjoy and the reason for the low rating were the three \\"boring factors\\" : the daugther, the lover and the end....it was kind of 'pushed' into the film and that part of the story line simply did not flow. For her(daughter) to be in her 20's and not get how the world works was silly, the fact that he walked away from a burning car with a young dead girl in itand then simply ended up at a fund raiser at the end?? Just a litte \\"TOO\\" surreal for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall review for Arbitrage streaming","review":"The movie was great. The service provided by Amazon was not great.

When it finally picked up the pace, the ending was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Richard Gere is really good in this movie. The story is a stretch but he is able to subtly convey the complexity of the character. I loved it and he delivers in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Thriller","review":"Richard Gere does a good job playing a rich, powerful hedge find manager who finds himself on the wrong side of a number of transactions. The character is easily detestable; Gere brings his good parts out. Fine supporting cast.

I only gave it two strs because of Sarandon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great thriller with excellent acting. I love the irony at the end, but I won't give it away. I thought Richard Gere did a really great job with this character, in that you know he's making bad choices, but you sympathize with him and understand his internal conflicts. Definitely watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This show was boring. I wondered why it was available to rent while playing in the theater. It would probably only be interesting to Richard Gere fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hummm..","review":"Let's just say this is not some of the better acting I've seen from Gere and Serandon. They make a lovely rich couple, and the scene with Gere cheating on her is, well... steamy and fun.The rest kept my attention, but only because they are my two favorites and I was waiting for something of significance from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Bond","review":"Very shallow plot, it read like Bernie Madoff from the beginning and then the ending was very anti-climatic.

VHS quality picture, no subtitles, no extras AT ALL (not even a text page) and a horrible cover.A film this good deserves far better. Sadly the fact that this dreadful release is already out there and widely available will presumably deter any other company from bothering to do a better one. A real missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitles","review":"Just a warning to those looking at the product specs: the Amazon description says this film is subtitled, but it is not. There are no subtitles (English, or any other language) available on this DVD. It is in Spanish (the original language), and I don't speak Spanish, so I guess I'm out of luck. Wish the product description had been more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not 5W50","review":"If you are interested in 5W50 do not buy this product. They will send you Hitachi 19210 which is 10W30. This oil has totally different parameters then 5W50. I called them couple of weeks ago letting them know about the mix-up and they told me this is the only oil they have and still keep the same description of the product. I guess the company has an overstock of 10W30 and just wants to sell it. They do not care that it can damage your compressor.One good thing about it is that they did not mind accepting the product back. Just remember to request the return lable for the shipment. Money for the product was refunded, but the cost of initial shipment was not (and in my case it was almost $10). It was them who sent the wrong product, so they should refound my entire costs, not only for the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product worked really well when combined with ...","review":"This product worked really well when combined with another migraine treatment, such as Excedrin Migraine caplets. But by itself I felt it just wasn't strong enough. I liked the re-sealable package and the fact that it didn't have a harsh medicine smell.

Liking Headline News I bought the God Shuffeled His Feat, and then Worms Life and now finally The Ghosts That Haunt Me. I just have to say that I LOVE THE GHOSTS THAT HAUNT ME! I wish that more of their CD's were like this. I love Comin' Back Soon, Winter Song, Thick Necked Man, hell, I like all of their songs. The only complaint I have is that it seems too short... of course that could just be because I love the songs so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"What a great set of songs. While some serious subjects are dealt with they are written with a real sense of wit and sly humour. Superman Song and Ghosts that Haunt Me were offered as the hits, and while they are good there are others I feel that are just as good, such as Comin' Back Soon, Country Life, Here on Earth and At My Funeral. I strongly recommend this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"Known by many non-hard core fans as 'the other CTD album', \\"The Ghosts That Haunt Me\\" gives listeners at the time a slice of the unusual CTD sound that was perfected later with the amazing \\"God Shuffled His Feet\\" release. \\"Ghosts...\\" starts out very promising with the up-tempo number \\"Winter Song\\" that boldly announces that this band's sound is really non-mainstream, a very good sign, but subsequent cuts steadily drag the album down with melody that just doesn't seem to hit its mark. \\"Superman's Song\\" ultimatly is the best cut on the album and a fine cut it is indeed. Production values are fine leaning a bit more 'violiny' and 'harmonica-y' than the later \\"God...\\" effort, which was given a more streamlined bottom heavy production. Overall it was a fine effort for the band, but pales in comparison to their next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dummies Here !","review":"inspired lyrics & brilliant cover artwork.

There songs are so diffrent from alot of bands and thats a good thing. This is a real good album. I am trying to collect all of there albums but some are really hard to find. If you are a fan of classic rock I think you should give these guys a try. Every song is really good. There is no other band like this band. I think they have there own sound to them. I looked at the price for this CD and its not much so you really need to get a copy of this great CD. Pick it up at amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you are going to expect...","review":"After the popularity of \\"God Shuffled His Feet\\", people may have an idea of what earlier music sounded like by the band. Well, this, their first effort, is not like their second album at all, not really. The wry wit, interesting stories and subjects, and impeccible musicianship is all there, of course, but the music is very different, very much more organic. It takes more than one listen to appreciate what is happening here.How good is it? That depends upon your taste in music, how broad your net casts when listening to different types and styles of music. While it is a well crafted album, it is not for everyone. If you can listen to portions of songs, I would recommend that as a way to get a sense of what this album is about, how it sounds.I credit the label for moving forward with this band because they really are worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, insightful and honest","review":"First: I'm a big fan of Team Roberts. But I was not expecting the depth of emotion and connection this book evoked in me. I'm a bit younger than Steve, grew up on the West Coast in a WonderBread world, but his descriptions of his background and growing up, full of all the anguish of the less-than-perfect teenager, were astonishingly affirming. I have passed the volume on to another, and expect it will continue to make the rounds. I'm hoping for volume two that picks up at the time they were married and carries on, since there are surely many more stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"Was great reading about the old neighborhood with many recognizable names.

The style is extremely engaging with a flippant tone that appeals to kids. At first, determining between fact and fiction seems a bit sticky, but after a couple of articles, the style begins to gain a clarity and coherency that allows a reader to know what is real and what isn't even in the most unfamiliar cases. The possible problem with clarity, though, is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.I've read THE ROMAN NEWS as well, and interestingly, while that one is certainly less confused about what's real, THE ROMAN RECORD actually contains more information, both historical and social, even though the books are the same length!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone","review":"This movie was very slow and boring for me.The character Alex was very creepy,and you could tell he was some sort of social path,but his character was hard to figure out.A few times I thought the movie was about to take of and we really begin to see some things about Alex,but then it would go back to being slow and boring.I love a action packed movie that has a plot that builds and keeps you guessing,and all I wasnted to was for this movie to hurry up and get to the end.This is one movie I wish I had not rented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good organizer, solid, efficient","review":"It is big, so make sure you look at the dimensions.

Mr. French was my big favorite and I had this wierd stuffed cloth doll (like a teddy bear but a man) and I named him Mr. French, I used to sleep with him and I'm sure it was a big comfort.

The only afrobeat here is from Fela Kuti and a Tony Allen remix. The rest of the songs are a combination of highlife, juju, soukouss etc. Some great tracks featured on the CD include Fela Kuti's \\"Fefe na efe\\", Kapa Dech's \\"Xihlaula mane\\" and \\"Funky hilife\\" by C.K. Mann. The standout track is \\"Synchro system\\" by the king of juju music, Sunny Ade. ..., find a way to listen to synchro system.I must confess I was not blown away by a couple of tracks and that's why I'm giving the CD four stars.

Okay, I'm just saying Patrick Dempsey? Uber-nerd from the 80s? As JFK? Well, I'm quite sure he's buried his past in film to be the right man to play JFK. Okay, just as long as JFK doesn't give money to the most popular girl in school so she'll look like she's dating him. Who knows - maybe Kirstie Alley will appear as Marilyn Monroe, so Patrick and her can have a 'comic-reteaming' after another movie they did in the 80s (Loverboy). Okay, okay, just as long as JFK doesn't hit it off with one older woman, and through the grapevine, become a gigolo of sorts who just talks to and dances with the older women - you know, what gigolos did in the 80s.

I love all the Christmas music between songs. \\"Because It's Christmas\\" makes me tear up everytime I hear it. Carol of the Bells, even tho it's an excerpt is so pretty. I wish that he had included Ava Maria on this. He does it on another cd and I love his voice on it-while not operetic perfect, it's just beautiful.

Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Because it IS Christmas!!","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Barry Manilow and was delighted to receive this CD as a gift. That is, until I listened to it! I think it's one of the worst Christmas albums I've ever had. Because, you see, it IS Christmas and I want to hear about Christmas. Many of the songs gave just a brief instrumental intro (Silent Night, The First Noel, Joy to the World, Carol of the Bells, We Wish you a Merry Christmas) and then went to his singing something else like When the Meadow was Blooming (Huh?????) or It's Just Another New Year's Eve.The only redeeming portion is the one track when he sings an excerpt from Handel's Messiah. I would have loved an entire CD of his singing portions of the Messiah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diplomat for The Dead","review":"This is a truly mighty compilation- a unique tool for the seasoned Deadhead to use for sharing great Dead songs with the uninitiated.As a life long lover of the Grateful Dead, I would be the first to admit that, although the Dead wrote some of the finest rock ballads and party anthems ever penned, they rarely recorded very well in the studio.This album is a chance to hear what some of their finest works could have sounded like if the Dead had been really good in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"Back in the days before there were tribute albums for every band you've ever heard of (and some you haven't), there was Deadicated, and it quickly became apparent that it would be a tough act to follow.

If you are a fan of one or more already, buy this CD and learn about the underappreciated songwriting talents of Garcia, Hunter, Weir, and Barlow. All we need now is a tour..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Epitome of a Great Cover Album","review":"Deadicated is a fun, exciting collection of Dead covers by artists who appreciate the great songs Garcia, Hunter, Weir, and Barlowe routinely cranked out. The highlights are many - Los Lobos and Jane's Addiction are great, Suzanne Vega's China Doll is eerily poignant, and Lyle Lovett lays down a great Friend of the Devil. When the album was released, Jerry was still alive and the band still touring. Now that Jerry and the band are no more, this album serves as a sad reminder of what a great loss Jerry's death continues to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I am a deadhead, but hated this cd.

The foam material of other brands just doesn't comform to the shape of your ear the way Flents does. When I use a brand new flents, it pretty much shuts out all noise, not the case with the others.

It is six minutes of drum bangs, and really boring. The disco house mix of Burning is included-too bad, considering there are some excellent harder progressive mixes of this female vocal track on the CD single. Track 3 is a dubby disco house track. Track 4 throws in a bit more female vocal. From there, it's a ride of repetitive funk house dubs with little variation, no real catchy riffs, and only an occasional vocal sample. You have to be a diehard Rivera or instrumental disco house fan to really enjoy this mix. For some of Rivera's harder stuff, check out Juicy Music volume 1. Track times:1. bangin the beats (6:00)2.

I later found out that woman was Candy Dulfer and a few years later I picked up this album after hearing the incredible track Lily Was Here. This track alone is worth the price of the CD but the rest of the album is just as good. Candy Dulfer plays with such passion and sexuality that it stirs up emotions within you.

Just straight-forward information about the travel and the animals - but the man just formulates himself so well, that it is a pure joy to read. Seldom have I giggled so much while reading a book - and yet I learned a lot about the situation for endangered species - and how not to travel to Africa ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful look into the lives of the endangered.","review":"Being a Science Fiction Comedy writer, Douglas Adams makes learning about endangered species a joy, rather than learning about them from a textbook.

He uses humor and great metaphors while he is informing readers of what is out there. Adam and Mark's message in the book is strong, it really is our last chance to see some of these exotic yet endangered species. They open your eyes and for some make you think about what is really going on, the rest is really up to you if you want to find any way to help.

My favorite creature was the defiant kakapo, whose determination is seemingly intended for the bird not to survive, with its finicky eating and mating habits. Adams and Carwardine do a splendid job describing the countries they visit as well as the animals. Anyone who has traveled to third-world countries will recognize the inconsistent border guards and troubled flight schedules, currency problems and badly-behaving tourists. As the troupe travels around the world, the reader is treated to a first hand glance of the experience as well an in-depth description of the endangered species and their particular habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of humor and knowledge.","review":"Last chance to see is a really interesting book that keeps you entertained through out its reading.Douglas Adams takes you on a great adventure around the world sharing his stories about searching for these endangered animals.He takes you to places like Kamodo island the home of the man eating kamodo dragon.Adams also comes face to face with a wild silver back gorilla and was so close the gorilla curiously reached out and touched his writing pencil. Not only is this book about endangered animals that can only be found in certain places of the planet, but Adams tells you about the funny chaotic stuff they had to go through in order to find these animals.I could picture someone like Chevy Chase starring in a movie about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FORGOTTEN ENDANGERED SPIECES","review":"To tell you the truth at the begining I really didn't like reading this book, but as I started reading it more I got more interested.At the begining of the first pages is really boring but as you get almost to the end of the story you start enjoing it. This book talks about how a lot of unkown endangered animals are at risk of being lost from the future. And if you really like reading about endangered spieces I recomend you to read this book because it gives you details on how humans have caused this to happend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to make you feel seriously bi-polar.","review":"One moment tears were streaming down my face, the next I was howling with laughter. The beloved author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy gets himself dragged around the world to see endangered animals -- and sadly, he may be the last author to view some of these creatures in the wild. His tale is evocative, humorous, and strongly moving. What do you mean I can ONLY give it 5 stars -- it deserves at least 6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Sad... witty yet regretful","review":"A race to document a dying species... Adams' wit and humor make an enjoyable read out of what could only otherwise be called a depressing topic. Still, through Adams' intelligent yet non-zoological eyes, we are shown areas of the world we will otherwise never see. The portrayal of the Kimono dragons, early in the book, is a shocking representation of what a a majestic reptile has been reduced to, and at the same time a morbid reminder of how wretched humans can be. Yet, due to Adams' skill we are able to feel his wonder and his fascination. We are able to get past the uncomfortable aspects of animal extinction, so that we can look it square in the eye and learn from it.As much value on a humanitarian, ecological and zoological level as on a literary one. Adams' himself calls it his most prized and significant writing (I'm paraphrasing, read \\"Salmon of Doubt\\" to get his words).I'd give it three thumbs up, but I only have two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, But This Book Should Be Extinct","review":"Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine are guys who guide you through unfamiliar territories of endangered animals in the wild. To name a few they search for the White Rhino, Komodo Dragon, and Silverback Mountain Gorilla, both guys gave me a humorous vibe but I just wasn't felling their story it was to bland and boring,boring,Boring!It was nice getting to know about the kakapo a bird that was crazy for sex I would had never known such a bird species existed. Other than that I did not care for the mood of the story it was written sarcastically with no excitement. No point to the book just because we common people will never see an animal in the wild doesnt mean we dont care about nature"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment.","review":"There are some insightful and witty observations about animals in this book. Unfortunately, they are buried in the mostly unfunny stories of his travels to the location of the animals. The condescending and sometimes racist attitudes Douglas Adams shares about people in other countries were disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and Confused","review":"Last Chance to See was a book about a group of people going around the world and taking pictures of endangered or nearly extinct animals. I thought this book was an okay read. I did not love it, but I read it anyway. It was fascinating to find out about all the endangered animals out there in the world. Some of the animals mentioned in this book I never even heard of before. I enjoyed the pictures also because I was then able to put a face to a name with the animals mentioned in the book. I did not like some of the parts of the book, because they traveled so much that I often was confused while reading it. The strange spelling of the words in the book, and the humor sometimes through me off. In the end I feel this book was written for a good cause to let people know about all the animals out theree that are near extinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice to Read","review":"After my first time reading a Douglas Adam and Mark Carwardine book for my English class has made a bad impression on them. Douglas and Mark have boring ways of telling stories when it comes to traveling and exploring animals. Another thing is that the book doesn't contain any action. I highly wouldn't recommend that this book be used for any school purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sux!!!","review":"We have been made to read this book for school this year and i think that it could be the most boring book that i have ever read and i have read a lot of books! Not only does it bore me but Adams and Carwardine have no sense of humor and should never write again. Adams has really let him self down on this book and it is going to take a master peice to get him back into my good books. I would like to say that when i am rich and famous i am going to buy every single one of these and burn them. that is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Book you have to read!","review":"Last Chance to See is a great book that I coundn't put down. In this novel, Adams writes about how he tracks down endangered species in different locations around the world. Although this is my first time reading a novel by Douglas Adams, he really made a great impression on this first time reader! I'm not a person that likes animals alot, but as I read further along in the book, I enjoyed learning about the different animals, places and cultures he describes with great detail. I enjoyed this book more because he found a way to make the book amusing, but also very serious at times. Douglas Adams is a great author, and this book is one that should be read by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be glad you got it.","review":"I was very surprised when, after the first 10 pages, I realized I had been laughing about twice as much as when reading the Hitchhikers Guide books. This is a nonfiction work based on his experiences (and those of his partners) searching for some of the rarest creatures on the earth. I couldn't put it down. A great, often educational, always entertaining book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"I loved reading this book. It is a must-read for all who care about the environment, love travel-reading and think Douglas Adams is one of the funniest writers ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Adventure","review":"The book is bery unique. I like the book because the narrator is a great writer. He makes the book more interesting with many of the embarrassing experieces. The book itself is animated with great descriptions of the many endanger animals they got to see. The many places that Adams, and the missionaries travel. The amazing adventures they when trough when meeting new people. The pictures and the places Adams describe when visiting gives a clear vivid picture. In the book, Adams take us the readers to a second world that none of us have ever been, but would be egger to go out and experience in our own.After I read the book I though in my mind of the many endanger animals and become concern. I would recommend the book to people who is very much interested on wild animals and like to travel. As for me it was interesting and fun reading the book. You'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Endangered Animals; Last Chance To See.","review":"This is a book that gives great detail and examples of endangered animals. It gives the reader an opportunity to see endangered animals and a glimpse into the world of zoology.Adam Douglas guides you through the problems that threaten the animals that he sees on his journey. Adam goes to many bizarre places in search for these endangered animals. While on his journey he also learns the way of how diiferent cultures live compare to ours.This is a good that has a lot of humor and a loving concern for animals going extinct. It tells you that there are steps that are being made to help these animals. There is good detail on animal behavior that finds you there with these animals. Towards the end of the book you find yourself wanting to help save these animals.This is a good book for those who enjoy traveling and love animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Time I Will Read this Book","review":"As an animal lover and enthusiast I was tricked into believing I would like this book. Two men searching the globe for animals that may someday not be here any more seems like it could be exciting, but it was anything but that. There was no point to this book. The only thing it did, besides bore you, was maybe inform you about some animals who are endangered. But you can just look at a list for that, there is no need to read a whole book. So just because you like animals, trust me it doesn't mean you will like reading about these men trying to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't charge well","review":"I had a lot of trouble with these batteries. The original pack that I bought had batteries and some of the batteries were defective. I realized this when I was on vacation in another country and my DSLR's flash was not working when I used these particular batteries. In any case, I had to contact Sunpak so that they could send me knew ones, which they eventually did months later."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning","review":"One is crazy NOT to appreciate Whitney Houston's music.

Everytime I hear that opening I just get the chills. I also like \\"I'm Your Baby,\\" a GREAT mood piece I play it everytime I feel lonely. I'd also like to recommend \\"I'm Knockin'.\\" It's not everyone's favorite but if you listen to it enough you start seeing where Whitney was really commin' from on this album. A very nice conclusion to a great cd. Highly recommended for those unfamiliar with Houston's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Dance Album is Platinum Hit !","review":"\\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" is Whitney's first \\"dance\\" album and it's a true sensation. It's no suprise that the album sold way over 4,000,000 album copies, as well as 2,000,000 singles, and not to mention spawned two #1 singles (\\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" [gold] and \\"All the Man That I Need\\" [also gold]). This album is a real gem. So get it now before the time comes when finding it will be like finding the Supremes third album. Remember the name of it? ... I didn't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY POOR","review":"Ms. Houston's performance here can only be summed up with two words- VERY POOR. From begining to end this endless stream of pop simplicity defies any logical connection to decent music. Surely, \\"My Name Is Not Susan\\" ranks as one of the most pitiful attempts at music in a long long time. \\"Lover for You\\" is not far ahead either. Ms. Houston's intense arrogance and immaturity is prevelant here. One so full of herself has never made such bad songs. \\"I'm Knockin\\" seems to be a metaphor for this pompus entertainer. Warning- if Ms. Houston happens to knock on your door with a free copy of this mess- tell her to leave immediately.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"This was a weak very weak follow up to her previous 1987 hit \\"Whitney\\".

I really would like to just send it back and get credit for my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"whitney misfires","review":"Aside from \\"Miracle\\", \\"Who Do You Love\\" and the incredible \\"I'm Knockin'\\", this cd is a waste of Whitney's awesome talent. In trying to please and recapture the R&B market, her producers have relied on cheap production tricks and faux sassy lyrics. Sorry, Whitney, but please go back to the classy songs you do best- songs like \\"Saving All My Love For You\\" and \\"Just the Lonely Talking Again\\", or later ones like \\"I Have Nothing\\" or \\"I Go To The Rock\\".

Although it was nowhere near the huge success of her two previous efforts it nevertheless was a hit album peaking at #3. It spawned two #1 songs, the title track and \\"All the Man That I Need\\". My favorite song from this collection is another of Whiney's power ballads called \\"Miracle\\" which would also be put out as a single and peaked at #9.Other greats here include her duet with Stevie Wonder called \\"We Didn't Know\\", \\"Anymore\\" and \\"My Name Is Not Susan\\".Although Whitney was nominated for 3 Grammy's for the album she unfortunately didn't win any."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP Whitney!","review":"I grew up on Whitney and needed to update my collection since I only had cassettes :).

Not the most diverse Ms Houston album Featuring some shocking extremly British influnced pop songs e.g \\"Who Do You Love\\" and but the least difintive is the duet \\"We din't Know\\" (featuring Stevie Wonder) which proves with the exception of \\"I Know Him So Well\\" (feat Cissy Houston) and \\"Count On Me\\"(feat Ce Ce Winans) duets are not Whitneys Style. But all in all Whitney Houston's third album is a good effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"really like them, but....","review":"I really like these, but... they are a little too \\"funky\\" for an everyday staple, I just didnt look at the picture close enough to see the slight dip in the heel.

They do look a little \\"plastic\\" and I kind of felt like Frankenstein when I first put them on, they are clunky,heavy. As other reviewers said, my toes do slide down a little further than I'd prefer. Again, I will wear them, I do like them, but I will continue to look for something very much like them just not as edgy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Platform Slide","review":"I like the extra height these platforms give me; I purchased them in my usual size 8, but I was sliding out of them too easily and was afraid of falling (that's why I gave them 4 stars).

Some of the artists on the \\"classica\\" disc (CD1) are Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque, Baden Powell, Jorge Ben, Djavan, Lenine, Carlinhos Brown and more.The second disc has more of the \\"new\\" club sound but is really quite diverse. Soem of the eatured artists are out of Brazil and Europe.

In fact it was intended to be two separate albums by two different bands... but both of them realized they were not able to cope without Jon Anderson's unique lead vocal, so they compiledit into one single album, a Union!The result is interesting and worthwile. It has a lot of the ABWH soul, influenced by the Rabin style. The inevitable hit Lift Me Up is the best example of this mixture. So is Saving My Heart, except that this one is not very good and would've been better off left out.The highlight is the extremely beautiful Silent Talking which combines rock and ballad in a rhapsodian way that nearly makes you think of the good old Yes epics. Nearly.A welcome release, a good piece of work - A Perfect Union."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"Well, this is not the outright disaster that many critics would have you believe it is, but that doen't mean its very good either. The ABWH songs are much better than Rabin's stuff (except for the really catchy \\"Miracle of Life\\"). However, they seem to be pursuing a completely different (and less interesting) direction than on the previous ABWH album.If the band(s) had taken the half of the songs on here that are pretty good, worked them into proper Yes epic lengths and dropped the rest, this would be a pretty good album. As it is, this cd runs way too long with way too much dross. It's shocking to me that between the two \\"bands\\" at work here they couldn't come up with more good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This had so much potential. The ABWH tracks sound unfinished, and according to Wakeman, were so doctored by the producer Jonathan Elias to be unlistenable. The merging of the 2 Yes camps onto one disc may have been good marketing, but the results were shoddy. The Rabin songs were less than standard, and no studio tracks ever feature all 8 key players together. So many extra people on it added to the confusion, and while it isn't actually horrible, it is probably the worst YES album to date. Has some moments, but too much filler, a good marketing ploy gone bad, Great tour , though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes interesting","review":"The most disappointing things about this album are Steve Howe's questionable solos and Rick Wakeman's virtual absense from the pieces he's supposedly playing on. The Levin/Bruford rhythm section redeems the Anderson/Howe/Bruford/Wakeman tunes somwhat. The Anderson/Kaye/Rabin/Squire songs are, I hate to admit, better. Trevor Rabin's sparse solos are fairly tasty, and he knows how to write a catchy song. \\"Miracle of Life\\" and Squire's \\"The More We Live\\" are perhaps the best tunes on the disc. I like the latter, because Chris Squire gets to sing some parts by himself...great voice! What's going on with Steve Howe? He didn't always play poorly like this. I think he lost it on Tormato, and never recovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song -- the rest is TRASH","review":"Hard to believe a band as great as Yes could release such poorly written, hastily recorded junk. The Trevor Rabin song Lift Me Up is wonderful, but virtually every other song is a waste of time. This is even worse than 'Tormato'. And certainly nowhere as good as the criminally-underrated 'Drama'."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, what a mess...","review":"I think it started out as a great idea that kind of gotten taken away with itself. I heard \\"I Would Have Waited Forever\\" as an advance on radio and remember being really encouraged. After giving it an initial listen on buying it, I felt a little ripped off. The disc has flashes of brillance here and there, but it could have used a lot more coherence. Completists only need apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible","review":"**I rated this as 1 star, not sure why it is showing 4**I'm a big Yes fan, I like the older Prog stuff and even such critically panned albums as \\"Big Generator\\" \\"Tormato\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" but this is easily the worst album I have ever heard. Union features musicians from both eras of Yes, plus about twenty \\"additional musicians\\" (apparently there were two separate albums that were implemented into Union, one Yes and one ABWH or something like that) making it a big deal and making Union way too over-hyped.As several people have said the only good song on this album is \\"Lift Me Up,\\" which is (unfortunately) overlooked because it happens to appear on this trash. \\"I Would Have Waited Forever,\\" and \\"Miracle of Life\\" are probably the only other decent songs on the album. Unless you're a Yes fan who is trying to complete your collection, this album isn't worth 50 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curioso, curioso","review":"S��, es curioso.

I DO like some of their eighties stuff, some of their weirdest, just because a few of the songs have that 80s charm but this here is garbage. Worse than the 80s stuff. The lyrics are so bad I don't even know where to rank it in their discography. When these guys write bad lyrics they do it with conviction! It's down there with Tormato, Drama, Open Your Eyes, The Ladder, etc. Just listen to this for a bit and then compare it to one of their classic albums. People who rate this 5 stars should be ashamed of themselves. King Crimson really does make these guys look like a bunch of idiots when you compare the same time periods, especially the late 70s/80s where Crimson actually remained excellent.

These four tunes are excellent; especially the enchanting instrumental, Masquerade. This album just shows you what happens when a lot of talented musicians all try at once to grab the spotlight (or the YES name) at the same time. Enough already. This album makes it clear that in spite of the valliant attempt at cohesiveness, individuality kills the group as a whole. Maybe the guys will realize this down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick Wakeman referred to this project as Onion....","review":"... because it made him cry. Bruford thought that it had so devalued the merits of a band he cofounded that it closed the door forever on any prospect of working with his former mates again.Through even a cursory listen, this is clearly the lowpoint in Yes's career. Indulgent, cliche ridden and corporately fueled and designed, it's an abomination. I don't know who Jonathan is, but hopefully by now someone has fed him to the sharks.To second Wakeman's observation, this stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excuse for a tour, not an album","review":"This is a really bad album. There's this story about how the two versions of YES were working on seperate albums at the same time, then joined together to release their music as one album. While that's probably true on the surface, this album sounds like the two versions of YES cashed in on their rejected songs from \\"ABWH\\" and \\"Big Generator\\". Most songs don't sound good enough to be b-sides.The tour for UNION was a blow-out three hour event in the round. Only one song from this album was played, listen and you'll see why.When Yes is at their peak (\\"The Yes Album\\", \\"90125\\", \\"Big Generator\\", \\"Fragile\\") they are incredible. Even when they hit their valleys (\\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\", \\"Talk\\"), they are still interesting and engaging.But this is easily their worst album. \\"Lift Me Up\\" and \\"I Would Have Waited Forever\\" made the cut on the recent YES Box set \\"In A Word\\"; but you can't tell me they aren't the weakest tracks in the entire 5 disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was good","review":"I thought this book didnt get into to to much detail but i thought it was still a good book..

He also should have explained the ending clearer and the climax should have been more obvious. Some of the characters were interesting and the storyline was good. It just was not written very well and had a lot of boring conversations and no interesting parts to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucky Book","review":"This book looks interesting to the naked eye, but trust me-its not! The storyline is not very in-depth and although the characters seem promising, they are not put to good use. Too much detail on the boring parts and not enough on the interesting ones, this book did not have any suspense. The resolution was foreshadowed very obviously and there was no climax. The bok was a boring read and I do not recommend it to anyone. I didn't have to sleep with the lights on and reading this book in the middle of a haunted house would not make it scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst book I ever read.","review":"This might have been the worst book I ever read. It had some characters, scenes, and plots that showed promise, but they didn't really go anywhere, and the \\"surprise\\" ending was just surprisingly stupid. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is probably good for fine hair but not for 4abc Natural Sistahs, use the SERUM instead.","review":"I like IC products, and I luv the Serum. I have 4b hair and this product just seems to dry it out. I think because it's in a spray form. I'm sure it's perfect for finer textured hair. Know your hair, then choose the best product for YOU.

O'Rourke, Stephen Fry, P.G.Wodehouse - they all fall into the category of authors who REALLY make me laugh. If you mix up Billy Connelly and John Cleese, you'll get the idea. In Blott on the Landscape (which was turned into a BBC television series), Sharpe's humour is as sharp as ever (pun intended) and his characterizations are an absolute scream. Of course, it helps if you appreciate British humour which, at times, can be quite black. (A woman getting a lion to eat her own husband?)Tom Sharpe's 'Wilt' books were comical enough but, in Blott on the Landscape and Porterhouse Blue, he excels even his own high standards of comic writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Works on Acura RL 2005.

His persistent commitment to living every day to the fullest, loving and learning through excess with the knowledge of zero accountability given his imminent death at his own hand is captivating to those who could not possibly live this type of life. Scandalous for the time or any time.Well done Mr. Wolff, my apologies for the late to the party read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Son","review":"Are there no more editors? This book is repetitive, much too long, and the organization is confusing. I am never convinced Harry Crosby is worth the time to read his story. As I read, I kept thinking, \\"Why bother?\\" Harry's life might be interesting as an example of supreme self-indulgence and self-absorption, but his writing (as quoted) is atrocious! Tighten it up, tell me more about Black Sun Press and some good writers, and less about Harry's decadence-unless you can make it more interesting than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived broken","review":"There are two stubs that stick out on the side that guide the depth setting. The front stub was apparently broken during shipping, allowing the assembly to shift left and right, breaking two of my $6 carbide bits for PCBs before I finally realized a screw in the top center could eliminate the shifting. Even if the stub had not broken, I wonder if there would still have been soem play in the left-right movement. I'll upload a picture showing where it broke and how I fixed it. My fix is only good if you're doing shallow drills.Otherwise, it serves my purpose for simple PCB hole drilling. I'm using #64 or #65 bits, 0.9 mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for PCB's","review":"I'm using the press to drill home-etched PCB's. It works well. Using the drill before etching, however, there is a bit of slippage. Maybe 1/20th of an inch. However, after the board has been etched, slippage is not a problem since the copper guides the drill. I'm using a dremel on its highest speed and resharped solid-carbide drill bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a poor drill press","review":"I ordered this as a drill press to use with my dremel for making PC boards.It is inadequate for that purpose. There is at least 3 mm of play in the press. What's worse, when you operate the press it swings the bit side to side one MM, which makes it extremely difficult to locate holes in the center of a solder pad. This also causes bits to break and wear prematurely.Additionally, the hardware that came with the stand did not fit. For instance, the bolt and nut arrangement used to secure the base to the stand would have been great if the bolt actually fit in the hole. I had to drill out the hole to fit the bolt, or drill and tap it (I had a tap the correct size, so I did away with the nut).If you're looking for a reasonably precise drill press, stay away from this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered New!","review":"I ordered this item, I thought was new.But when I recieved it, it was obvious it is not new and also not complete. The plate that that is supposed to cover the coil that returns the press to it's original postion, is not there and without it It is not safe and is an eyesore.Also it was packed losely, with no \\"popcron\\" or paper to hold the pieces in place. Just thrown in a box, so everything is dinged and scratched???I am seriously thinking about not ever ordering from Amazon again. This is the 2nd. Item that I recieved from them, that is not what they presented it as... and I am not a hard person to please, but if something is used and incomplete I want the option to decide rather I want it in that condition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality tool","review":"I bought the stand for testing it out to integrate it in my kit. The looseness is all over the place.It is practically impossible to drill an accurate hole with that thing. The base supported in three points so it rocks. Overall it is even worse then Dremel stand.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have been trying to drill polished rocks for quite some time....although, not perfect, this is an excellent tool. Suggestion: Drill before polishing...then you don't have a lot of time and effort in the stone if it breaks while drilling ...which happens at least 20% of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tightening screw","review":"The tightening screw on the press I ordered has no threads to thread into the carrier rendering the press completely and utterly useless. The carrier just rests at the base and has no support. Be wary and buy at the store so you can check it out first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotary Tool Stand","review":"This Rotary Tool Stand works fine with one of my three Dremel Tools. My oldest one. The new Xrp wont fit and do not see an easy way to make it work. Also my Battery Dremel also wont fit. I think the company needs to make adapters so that all Dremel tools fit. So the bottom line is make very sure you check and see if the tool fir a very limited dremels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, very stable.","review":"After using the Dremel-brand equivalent for a few years, I was thrilled when I recieved the Milescraft 1907. I always have had a problem with the way the Dremel-brand workstation had such horribly loose tolerances. If you want a hole in a spot the size of the bit you are using, it cant be guaranteed with the Dremel-brand. It floats to and fro, left to right so your lucky if you hit your mark. And if you do hit your mark, it can slide before you start to drill a hole. I thought it was the best things got. Until I received the Milescraft. It is SOLID. You will get such a kick out of the accuracy of this tool. ACTUAL precision. Im sorry, actual precision with the Black and Decker RTX. I use it to drill out gemstones, cut tiles, drill PCBs, carve and cut, and I use it as a stand when I am using the Milescraft flex-shaft. You can turn the tool 90 degres on the shaft to set the rotary tool up as a little rip-saw, grinding or polishing platform, and a lot more.A great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A turn for the worse","review":"First, let me echo prior reviews, this is a light duty tool stand, do not expect to do precession work with it. Milescraft seems to have \\"updated\\" (September '09) this product by dropping the clamp that gripped the rotary tool around it's midsection, this leaves the rotary tool only supported by the nut on it's nose. This of course is big trouble just waiting to happen. The good news is that if you are somewhat handy as a hardware hacker you can fix all these short comings in two or three hours of work with a power drill, knife, sanding drum(s) and a few tie wraps and some shim material. All in all I am happy with how this turned out, I am using this stand along with the rotary tool to drill PCB's, and it is doing that very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!! It might be cheaper than the Dremel, but...","review":"Poorly designed and constructed. The body is made of plastic, the stand and holder for the Dremel are made of pot metal.

Was it? Not really. Good things include: Small and compact, can take pictures and stores audio...but that's it. There is no zoom! There is no darklight function. It records to MPEG 4 format, which is very similar to a streaming video that you would see on the internet. So basically, the video quality is [bad]! The software is lacking everything.

It starts up slow, but you can get used to that. It takes good pictures, that I can set as a background on my computer. The video-making is ok, but it is limited. It has a very slow frame rate, making the video move strange, but for its size, it's not so bad. The recorder is good, but I am still trying to figure out how to transfer it on to my computer. I am not sure what program can read .vm1 (the file type for recording on this camera), but I know that I do not have it, this is very frustrating. It works as an mp3 player very well. It never skips, so it functions very well at that. The best part about it is it's size. It is so small that it can fit behind a business card! It can fit in my pocket, so I can bring it wherever I want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"u can do better","review":"sure this little fella looks pretty cool, mp3 player, camcorder, digital camera. Dont get this if u want quality or even semi-good picture. The camera is horrible and the camcorder is too choppy. All this is is one of those pen cams with an mp3 player and a screen. For the price of this thing and an ok memory card for it u could buy a low end digital camcorder that probably has 10 times the quality of this. You cant hold much high quality video on a 512mb card which can cost over a 100 bucks. I got a Sony DCR PC3 handycam. it can store 60 minutes of video and cd quality sound on a mini dv tape that cost like 10 bucks each.

The way it was formatted - as stated in the title, just for a weekend (which works great because it makes you want to actually finish it in a weekend, like I did!), is great and I had the book to pace my speed for me, which I like so that I know this book won't actually take me a few months to complete like some of these bigger books.In conclusion, I would suggest that all people to want to learn MySQL (and fast!) should pick this book up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little nuggets here","review":"While \\"So Close\\" and \\"Don't Hold Back Your Love\\" are definite keepers on this album, there are a couple more that make it very worthwhile. Notably, \\"Starting All Over Again\\" is a catchy remake worth hitting the repeat button for, as is the jazzy \\"Halfway There,\\" guaranteed to make you dance and sing along. \\"Starting All Over\\" is cool because it showcases John Oates' voice as well as Daryl Hall, who dominates on stage during their concerts.By the way, their \\"Rock and Soul Revue\\" with Michael McDonald and the Average White Band is a fantastic show, a must-see. The boys and their band kick some ass on many of your favorite songs, and if you stomp hard enough, they'll return for an encore of \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\\" and another song."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read!","review":"I remember reading this in high school (on my own, not for class) it was a book I had accidentally stumbled across in the library while I was browsing for something to read. i was so moved that a few years later, I read it again and found myself no less moved.Part of me craves a sequel to this fantastic book (or a prequel) and paet of me is happy the book was left the way it is.

And, in the event that you are a skateboard enthusiast, you'll sink your teeth into this one like a junkie on crack. Invigorating, illuminating, heart-warming, eye-opening, educational, depressing (Jay Adams...what could have been). All of these adjectives at some time or another are fitting throughout Dogtown and Z-Boys. Stacy Peralta writing and directing flows well with the superb narration of Sean Penn. Tony Alva and all of the Zephyr Crew join in to recount this larger than life tale that's almost too cool to be true.The invention of an incredible art form in emptied swimming pools along with the cool story of skating in the Dogbowl at the home of a cancer stricken youth skating enthusiast who simply longed as a last wish for the Z-Boys to skate in his pool truly make truth stranger, and in this case better, than fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory Daze","review":"I laughed out loud at the end of this documentary when I realized that \\"Dogtown\\" was made by the people it praises.

I do play the games and bought the soundtrack to THPS3. Unless you're a hardcore skater, I don't recommend this movie to anybody. Another negative is that the DVD doesn't even contain a widescreen presentation, its in full frame with 5.0 surround not 5.1 which would have made it better. I have to admit the 2 stars is for Sean Penn's narration, I tried so hard to stay up through it to see what he brought to this and it was quite a bit. The DVD case and disc artwork is cool.

We mounted them on a closet door that is used (I.e. it swings open and shut many times a day). The broom fell off instantly. Also, the screws that come with the holder are so bad they broke off when installing requiring me to drill out and use others.

I presume the sender decided to replace the items. I do like the Mop and Broom holders. They are quick and easy and gets anything with a long handle out of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"just works","review":"We are happy with this, easy to stick our mop into it with one hand but really needs two hands to remove it. So far it hasn't dropped the mop. We did use the screw mounting rather than the sticky, we thought the mop when wet might be asking too much from the sticky mounting tape or our wall. For a broom or dry mop the sticky mounting should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broom Holder","review":"This is a great product which anyone can install without any special skills or tools needed.

Just as good as any others Alan has done.

I didn't jump on the \\"Chattahoochee\\" bandwagon like everyone else did. I already liked Alan Jackson when that song came out and it almost made me a non-fan because country radio ran it right straight into the ground like they do Garth, Shania, Tim, and Faith these days. Here in the Real World offers several fantastic cuts that he has matched only a couple of times since. The title hit, Chasin' That Neon Rainbow, Home, and I'd Love You All Over Again are all good songs, but it's the second single that nails it for me---\\"Wanted\\". It's the best song in Mr. Jackson's entire career and it alone would make this album worth buying. All those others I mentioned are just icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every household","review":"Truely a magnificent piece of work to wiew the wonder of God's creation leaves you in awe of the beauty of the Earth.

I have no idea why amazon has it listed under Darkseed, but I pretty much wasted $18 for a band with constantly repetitive riffs and a horrible singer, that sounds almost like early cradle, but very much worse. If you like weird black metal, buy this, otherwise, its a waste of money. Maybe amazon.com will actually fix their name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Injustice","review":"This is the most compelling piece of literature that I have read in many years. Nanon Williams gives us a first hand account of the abuses he has suffered on death row while incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. This book is proof of Williams' great gifts, and the State of Texas should be ashamed for denying life to one so obviously productive and gifted. Until this book, we on the outside would have never guessed that the Texas justice system could be so negligent and barbaric. As American citizens we owe Nanon Williams gratitude for opening our eyes to the horrors that our tax dollars have been supporting. If this man dies, we should all feel accountable for standing by and helping fund the execution of an innocent man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer speaks to the heart of family.","review":"This is an excellect book.

However, this book reflects not only a jump of 10 years for Nancy, but a jump from the culture of the 1950's to the culture of the 1960's.

Modern Baptists is great, but North Gladiola is better--unfortunately it is out of print. Mr. Wilcox is really writing one huge novel, characters and situations from other novels are alluded to in passing in what is a meticulous and thoroughly realized fictional town. If I could, I would move to Tula Springs, maybe take one of those apartments above the Sonny Boy department store...Mr. Wilcox deserves a wider audience, and he deserves to become more than 'sort of rich' to borrow one of his titles, from his amazing work. Quick everyone, tell Oprah..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny take on southern living","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book the first time I read it, and find myself laughing out loud every time I dip into again (which is pretty often). Wilcox's powers of observation and satire are astounding, so much so that I wonder how much of the humor here will be lost on the non-southern reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer a good buy.","review":"I am a mom and a pediatrician and have been buying this and other Mustela products since my 7 year old was a newborn. I just bought two packs for my little one and to my surprise, the sheets were smaller, thinner and less moist than before. For the money, in this day and age I think this is the last pack I'll buy. I used to be able to swab almost a whole toddler bottom, poopy or not, with one sheet. No longer. The two stars are for the fragrance which is heavenly. You'll do better to mist your child's clothes with the Mustela fragrance spray and buy Huggies wipes instead. Much larger, and gentle on the skin and a much better buy for the money. I guess Mustela didn't think we'd notice the change, but this mom did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful for facial cleaning","review":"I used to buy the Mustela facial cloths for my baby's face- she has sensitive skin and I would use them after a feeding etc. in lieu of a washcloth and soap b/c they were more convenient. I saw these and compared the ingredients to those in the Mustela facial cloths and they are basically the same product- and with these you get twice as many for only a few dollars more- so worth it! I recommend these to anyone who needs a gentle disposable wipe to clean a baby or child's face. Oh- I also rip each wipe into thirds because I don't need a whole wipe for my tiny daughter's little face- and just push the remainder back into the pack for next time. They rip easily and it is a good way to make them last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave my baby a rash","review":"I would love to like these but each time I use them, they cause hundreds of bumps on my baby's skin.

As I was setting up the nursery this weekend I opened the wipes and was blown away by the stench of them! My husband walked into the nursery and immediately noticed the pungent odor. To quote him ; \\"Whoa ! Those wipes smell worse than the mess we're supposed to be wiping off the baby! What kind of chemicals produce that kind of smell? Why would we want it anywhere near our baby's skin?\\"'Nuff said. What a waste of money.

On the rare occassion when I've run out before I was organized enough to order my next shipment, I've had to make do with some Huggies or Pampers wipes, and even the sensitive ones leave a tackiness that you never have with Mustela. It has a gentle scent, and leaves my baby's skin soft but clean. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur about the smell - way too strong to feel comfortable using on baby!","review":"I originally bought these wipes from Nordstroms (figured if they are sold there they must be good) but have hardly used them because of the incredibly strong odor of the perfume the wipes are bathed in. Personally, I just don't feel comfortable rubbing that much fragrance oil on my baby's skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE odor !","review":"Ugh! First off, these get FIVE STARS for softness and moisture and cleaning-goodness. HOWEVER... all of these positives are 100% nullified by the terribly potent chemical odor they give off! HOW CAN PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKE THAT STENCH??? Those people must work for the company, because these are truly the most god-awful smelling things EVER! A stench like that could not possibly be natural... they must use strange and toxic synthetic ingredients to get that smell. AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aubrey tells it like it is","review":"Granted, Aubrey doesn't back his claims fastidiously by science. However, anyone who's ever compared aloe vera straight from the plant to that sticky-dry film that forms on your skin when you get synthetically-laced aloe vera can attest to the validity of his claims. Plus, it's good to read someone who's not exactly logical or concerned with being PC.

I enjoyed it and the ending was just the right touch.The only thing I didn't like was the OVA disk. Having to read subtitles for me takes me away from working on other things I do while watching a DVD. Since my players are in the Living Room, I feed the output from them to both the TV and computer in the front computer room so I can watch movies there too. This allows me to watch a good movie, etc. and work on computer related items at the same time. With a subtitled DVD, I have to \\"glue\\" to the monitor and that sort of takes away from other things I've doing. (Besides good titles SHOULD be watched more than once anyway.) That's my only complain re this DVD set. This OVA would have made an excellent way to watch a summary of the series if time was a consideration except for the subtitles.Well worth the money otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great comedy with wonderful \\"What if\\"","review":"All of us experince the whole \\"Men are from mars, women are from venus\\" or something like that. This space comedy throws you into a time where we were actually apart for a couple hundred yeas, slapstick comedy sexual jokes and the question of \\"will we ever get along?\\" are explored. Don't be turned off! This may be a comedy but it's also a great story. One of Hibiki and Dita two people with centuries apart that have wacky adventures and discover each other in the process and really says \\"We all must work together in order to survive\\" when all human life is threatened by the Harvest.It's one of my many favorites and i think it will be one of yours as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un gran disco","review":"Excelente, sin duda, un disco que mostr�� la maduraci��n de H��roes del Silencio y lo llev�� a convertirse en una de las m��s grandes bandas de rock espa?ol.

The album is truly a gem.I don't speak much Spanish. Almost all that I know I've learned by listening to HDS. I wasn't particularly interested in learning Spanish either.

I was a fan of this group since the moment I heard the beginning of the tune. It was so REFRESHING and EXCITING. Few months later, I got this album, and I can say that the rest of the material is equally brilliant. I even started studying spanish because of them! Heroes had (I say - had, because unfortunatelly, they split up) everything a great rock'n'roll band should have: passion, power, and originality. Unlike their later albums,there isn't much distortion on this one, but neverthless, it doesn't lack the power and excitement. EVERY song is a gem, but if I had to extract something, it would be Entre Dos Tierras, Maldito Duende and Con Nombre De Guerra.

The figures he places in that landscape, however, seem to more like first generation Califorians than the 4th generation persons d'heritage I've encountered in the Big Easy.

But I lost it toward the middle of the movie when the characters started to speak poetry instead of regular dialog. After that, it just all went downhill. Every one of the characters that opened their mouth to speak, spoke like they were on a stage (at a talent show) quoting poetry.

We all enjoy her!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God","review":"When this movie was over, I felt like a wrung out dishrag! (I actually said,\\"WHEW\\" when the credits rolled). If I'd seen it in the theater, I would have had to run out during one scene in particular that made me scream out loud AND cry. This movie makes all Black men look like so many bad things, except for 1 guy who was a cop. If I were to say any of the things the men do I'd be giving it away. But even men YOU DON'T SEE, that are just MENTIONED are horrible. This should scare any non African American women out of dating a Black man EVER. It made Black women look pathetic and helpless. I will say, everyone's ACTING was very good, and all the women looked very pretty. The directing was also good. One of the things you may find distracting was the way the regular dialogue would stop and they would talk in verse for a while. It's not a movie I'd want to see again because the subject matter is truly depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step ahead for Luke and pals","review":"A distictive change from Los Lobotomies, Luke once again brings top-notch studio pals into the mix, this time with Greg Bissonette and Phil Sousson.

I ordered it from 9Greenbox and it came in great shape, in a little pot (with roots and dirt etc. securely wrapped gently with a rubber band). I expected a little plant but it looks much like the picture (had 4 large leaves in good shape). I wish I could attach a picture so you could see how healthy it looks. I am honestly in disbelief!

The characters are so believable and the storyline is so well written. I was swept away on a journey to which I thought there would be no end. Even as I began to cheer - the writer would pull me into another dimension - never allowing the lovers to come completely together until she was ready for them to. I loved this book. Even though, at times, I felt I was being set up for the \\"kill\\", the writer still was able to keep me focused and turning the pages only to be surprised when it wasn't what I thought it would be. I can't wait to read another book by this author. Extremely well written. This was the best book I've read this summer. To me, nothing else can compete with The Color of Revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"It don't get any better than this!","review":"I truly enjoyed this adventure. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I was sad when it was over, I could have stayed with this host of characters forever.

Bravo, Millicent Hart, and thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I bought this book based on the rave reviews I read and was completely disappointed and incredulous that any company would even publish it. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were immature, not to mention the dialogue. I couldn't finish reading it which is a rare thing for me. I felt compelled to write my first review so that others wouldn't make the same mistake of wasting time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader from Northern California","review":"I, too, bought this book based on this site's readers' reviews. I am amazed that this novel is so poorly written. Totally disappointing. I cannot understand how it could have received all the 5 star ratings unless they were written by Millent's friends.(I noticed that many reviewers from the South.) The storyline is totally unbelieveable. It reads as though the author was attending a wannabe author's workshop. I have never written a review for any site but felt compelled to do so in hopes that others won't buy in to the five star ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love with Seth McCullough!","review":"Oh my God!

Thank you, Ms. Hart, for a wonderful few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - GREAT","review":"Let me catch my breath and I'll tell you all about The Color of Revenge. I really admire this writer. The boldness that she displays in the love scenes is magnificent. I hate it when people say, \\"I'd rather use my imagination.\\" Well, I'd rather read Ms. Hart's. What a storyteller. There are several different plots going on in this book, but she successfully manages to keep them separate yet entertwined at the same time. In other words, you don't get confused. The characters are great! And I loved the way she described everything right down to the smallest bit of information. I like to know what the character's home looks like, I like to feel their success. If she hadn't ended this with an epilogue I think I would have called for an uprising. Thanks, Ms. Hart, for a great read. I'm eagerly awaiting your next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and although I don't normally read novels I really enjoyed this one.

Dymond was way off in the descriptions of Moya and most of the crewmates, which leads me to believe he hasn't seen much - if any - of the actual show. During my reading, I felt as though it wasn't even about Farscape at all.The storyline was rather boring, and it dragged on into a long, confusing chain of events. I found myself wishing the book was over numerous times. It took a little effort to just pick it up again. However, I finished it anyway, as I felt odd abandoning something from my most favorite show.There are so many inconsistencies in the book, that it is almost an insult to the Farscape fans. I have actually read better fanfics online."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"This is really a disappointing book. Having read \\"House of Cards\\" I couldn't wait for this to come out. I should have just read \\"House of Cards\\" again. The main character is Rygel--not the Rygel of the series but a Rygel--and he has some depth. The rest of the crew are only there to take up space. The underlying premise had some potential but it just died. There is basically no plot, no character development and the ending makes no sense. The book is just an incoherent mess. Hopefully Andrew Dymond will not write any more Farscape novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say, this book was bad","review":"I give every book I read the benefit of the doubt, but I started to have problems in chapter one. The characterizations were completely off, which makes many pivotal moments of the book unbelievable. There were some good scenes but I can count those on one hand.There was one point near the end where the point of view switched to a character that we had never heard of before, right in the middle of the chapter. This is just one example of the poor construction of this novel.I loved the first Farscape book, and I appreciated that Keith R. A. DeCandido picked a point in the show timeline where the story could fit without causing conflicts. There is no way this could fit anywhere without disrupting the overall story arc.My husband and I both read the book, and we were both extremely disappointed. I don't understand how this got past the editiors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful Literature","review":"Granted Fan Fics rarely make this list of greatest written works, but this one was actually painful. Most of the previous comments about this book were right on the mark. Inconsistent facts, unbearable (if any) dialogue, mismatched personalities. And the icing on the cake is the fact that almost every memeber of the crew (Moya included) dies at least twice, only to be later revived through some miracle cure or another.Any maybe I'm being picky, but I doubt Farscape 1 could last very long in an extended firefight with dozens of gun skiffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was pretty bad.","review":"I really liked the first book, but this just couldn't live up to it. The characters personality's were all wrong. Firstly, none of the crew think of Chiana as a helpless little girl. Rygel being out done in haughtyness WAS a good touch, but any true fan can hardly imagine him NICE. The whole thing about Crichton's recorder using CD's and the fact he had music from the 80's is kinda hard to believe. I mean this is supposed to be the future, right? Also, Andrew Dymond could seriously use some lessons on elaborating. Show, not tell. The plot itself wasn't half bad, but the way he developed it needs major re-editig. And you have to wonder if the guy even WATCHES the show. Hopefully \\"Ship of Ghosts\\" will be much better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this book but was disappointed. It would have been nice for the author to at least watch the series. I can not recommend the book. I frankly want my time back that it took to read this \\"dren\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If I could, I would give this book 0 stars, but that wasn't an option! I read this book when it came out in the UK and was horrified that the powers that be at Farscape would allow this piece of \\"dren\\" to be published. I doubt that Andrew Dymond ever watched an episode of Farscape. He seemed to have missed the most basic of points, including what the interior of Moya looks like. He made it blue for Pete's sake! If you want a good Farscape novel, check out House of Cards by DeCandido, but DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I couldn't even finish the book, the characters simply bore no resemblance to the people on the show. To make matters worse the author's writing style is choppy and the plot was very difficult to follow. This book is not worth buying for the story and the characterization is so poor that the \\"Farscape\\" characters are practically unrecognizable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the frell?","review":"Having read all of the other reviews, I feel a need to add in my two cents/vent. I've never written a review before this, that's how strongly I disliked this book. Farscape: House of Cards was amazing. Dark Side of the Sun was just painful to read. In my opinion, if Dymond saw any Farscape eps at all, he must not having been paying any attention. In addition to all of the other details everyone's already mentioned, he repeatedly says that Chiana is white. Did I miss something? She's gray on my television. And doesn't Rygel have eyebrows, not ears? These are just two of the many things that make this book so far off base. The alien in some distant part of the universe talking like an inner city youth (\\"flipside\\") just made me want to scream. I couldn't even follow Dymond's cryptic way of writing. I still have no idea how Moya's crew escaped from the PK's. There's only one thing that this book is good for. Torturing scifi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness has reached new levels with this \\"book\\"","review":"I've read SF and Fantasy for over twenty years and I've watched every episode of Farscape. There are so many discrepancies the book should be made of Swiss cheese! I read the author's apology but really, to actually have to pay for this book is unbelievable. I read the first 100 pages, then began to skim along through page after page of tripe. The characterizations were iconic in their extremes. I got really tired of all of the Crichton-isms that NEVER stopped. D'Argo was portrayed as a mindless bloodthirsty savage, etc... Did the author watch the show...ever? I hope the publishers read these reviews, which have all been negative, and get a good SF writer to write the next one. I've read so many good Star Trek novels...what about David Gerrold? Bottom line to you other non-believers like me who thought the book couldn't be THAT bad...it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"*OUCH*","review":"I have to say, this was absolutely horrible. I am ashamed to have spent money on it. The charachterization was COMPLEATLY off. First of all, Rygel is polygamous he has no 'one true love.' Second Zhaan would never trade /sex/ for something, or at least she would not be so blunt. Third there is no mention of John having CD's. Fourth Chiana was /never/ married, and she left Nebari Prime with her brother. Fifth, Pilot's den is not located in Command. Sixth, how can Moya's corridors be her arteries? Shall I go on?

It borrows footage from other films like Triple X and other movies. The lead actor looks nothing like Kazuya from the game. It has little-to-no originality and borrows ideas from other films. The settings looks like it could be or is part of the Universal Studios backlot tour and that's a bad thing in this case. The villains are 1-D at best. It also takes itself too seriously for it's own good. There are better fight scenes but they fail to help the film in the long run. While this is better then the anime verison,it's still a bad film. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video game movie","review":"I must say that I have seen several if not all of the video game made to movie attempts and this one was a welcome suprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of the game","review":"This is a great movie for fans of the popular video game of the same name.

Unfortunately, it was as bad as Street Fighter. It also makes me think of the Dragonball: Evolution fail. I only gave it 2 stars because at least Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa visually made a good Heihachi Mishima. Lateef Crowder was a good Eddy Gordo. Jon Foo made a decent Jin but he's not even Japanese. The fight scenes were wack. This movie was so low budget, they couldn't afford Donnie Yen to play Marshall Law. If you do watch it, then there is something after the end credits.

As is, it makes a case for Aerosmith once being great, then becoming commercially savvy and then becoming really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"remeber when aerosmith had fans?","review":"it was in the 70's when people actually gave this band respect and worshipped them! now aerosmith has not that much money left(since they are using it to buy protools and hard drives galore)so they milk the fans dumb enough to buy this junk! aerosmith even decided it would be cool to release the album with a total of 5 different album covers which means some memorabilia collectors are going to have a field day with that!\\"girls of summer\\" the song sounds like it was made in mintue!this band are sell outs and has beens!skip this album steven tyler already has enough ice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best of their best of's","review":"Don't waste your money on any other CD set of you are an average Aerosmith fan.

Same Old Song & Dance, Seasons of Wither,Sweet Emotion, Dude (Looks Like a Lady), Janie's Got a Gun, &Love in an Elevator are my favorites on this compilation. Thisactully goes better together with GNR Greatest Hits and more.Buy the whole collection today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A+","review":"Better than BIG ONES, & GREATEST HITS. Covering from being to end, as of 2002. All the right songs, skipping the druging years. These are all the big hits, and a few radio ones throw into. Both new songs are on par to there classics. So skip there other two hits collections and go pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing tribute to a legendary band","review":"Aerosmith's definitive greatest hits collection is staggering. It's unbelievable that these guys have had so many hits over such a large span of time. It's also great to see lesser-known \\"Ultimate Hits\\" like Big Ten-Inch Record, Seasons Of Wither, Mama Kin, and even Deuces Are Wild included on the collection. Would have been nice to see songs like Train Kept A Rollin', Toys In The Attic, and Come Together on the set as well, but I guess that's what the Japanese import is for (includes those tracks). Every other song is imbedded in American rock 'n' roll history and a must for any true rock fan. OH, YEAH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd for the uninitiated","review":"It's great that (almost) all of the hits are included on this compilation, but I just like the \\"classic\\" feel of Pandora's Box a lot better.PB had better packaging, notes, and, most importantly, songs! There might not be as many recognizable songs as \\"O' Yeah\\", but that doesn't mean that the old gems weren't better. Maybe it's just me, but when bands are still at the early stages when they have something to prove and have the hunger to be something really great, that's when they seem to be at their best.Don't get me wrong, I loved Just Push Play as much as the next guy, but 70's Aerosmith is still the best Aerosmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH my holy hits of all hits","review":"Not much to say other than you couldn't put together a better rock cd if you tried!

The only thing that is missing is kings and queens..A gem in my book.Buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best compilation for the passing fan","review":"For the passing Aerosmith fan, there was a state of confusion - 9 studio and live compilations of their material, 6 from the Columbia years (1973-1982, 1997-present) and 3 from the Geffen years (1985-1994), for a band that has only 13 original studio records! On the plus side, this new compilation represents a joint effort by both companies to put together the very, very best of Aerosmith on two discs. Although any hardcore Aerosmith fan would take issue with three or four choices, for the most part, this is the single best compilation for a passing fan.For the hardcore Aerosmith fan like me, there is just enough to warrant a purchase - 2 new tracks and 3 remixes. Still, I am disappointed by cheap marketing ploy of putting out multiple designs of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"AEROSMITH FOR BABIES????","review":"This is it...Aerosmith's Oh Yeah Greatest Hits, it's not all that great. It has some really irritating, simple, and boring songs, why do I have to always hear Walk this way or Sweet emotion on the radio???? They get old. Aerosmith are really overrated, plus they've only made like 3 really good songs. The 2 from Get Your Wings, and Janies Got a Gun. Other than that, this is junk.......and Aerosmith are for babies.

Because of you, I have forsaken rock-n-roll music completely. Because of you, I don't even bother to tune into FM radio anymore.

Ridiculous and senseless to leave out these classics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Again?","review":"Don't they have enough greatest hits already? Is that how they make more money in between albums? This album has already been put out, just with a different name and a different cover......about thirty times already!Don't get me wrong, I love Aerosmith and these are good songs, but I think it's a pathetic attempt to make money. I'm sick of all the greatest hits. That's why I give this 1 star. If they had've re-recorded all these songs and gave them all a more modern sound then that would've been cool.

However, this is one CD I will not buy. Why, because it's just another so-so compilation. Joe Jerry has been quoted as saying something to the effect that these are the ultimate Aerosmith tracks, the ones everyone wants to hear in concert. Unbelieveable! Where are Train Kept A Rollin\\", and Toys In The Attic. For that matter, if I were puttig togething an \\"Ultimate\\" compilation, you'd better believe it would include the above 2 tracks as well as F.I.N.E., Fever, Rats In The Cellar, Rattlesnake Shake, and a few more I don't have the space to mention. My advice to Aerosmith fans is to buy the original albums and make up their own mind what the \\"ultimate\\" compilation is for them. For early and true Aerosmith fans, this just isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST SAY NO!","review":"This is just another collection slapped together to gouge Aerosmith's fans. 10 years ago I would have wasted my money on this and the Young Lust collection despite having virtually every song 2 or 3 times on CD anyway.It's a shame that record companies are destroying some of the best talent out their by continuously repackaging, recycling, and reissuing the same songs over and over again. And just to make sure our biggest fans buy this, we'll include two new mediocre songs that Steven Tyler composed in a couple of days using ProTools.Do yourself a favour, pick up their studio albums (even the new ones) and find out what you're missing--real rock and roll. I can't wait until Aerosmith finishes their SONY contract and starts to chart their own direction again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation -- as great as possible...","review":"Aerosmith came out with so many greatest hit-worthy songs throughout their career.

I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Aerosmith","review":"This is a solid collection of some of the best songs from America's greatest rock-n-roll band. Disc One features some vintage Aerosmith. You can't go wrong with the classics....but if there is one complaint, it is that midway through the first disc, we start to get Permanent Vacation stuff forward. For my tastes, I could have used more of the classic stuff. Disc Two picks up were d the first disc left off....PUMP!!!! The second disk is full of radio favorites from the 90s and 00s. This collection provides a decent snapshot of my favorite rock band and is a great way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Anti-Greatest Hits Collection? Who put this together?","review":"As other reviews have mentioned, all the classic material from the band's heyday is absent.....How you could issue a collection and not have Toys in the Attic is beyond me.........What a let down...they should have called this Greatest Hits from the bands reunion...forward.

The free standing ones were always in the way on my workbench until I discovered these handy sky hooks. Now I use two of them and whenever I use one it is just a short reach to grab the one I want and then hang it back up when I'm finished. The hook came with two extra length of pole which were too much for my hobby bench, so I only use one length of pole. This is a great way to keep those fabulous Dremels and right now (2/11/07) Amazon has them on sale for only about $12 each. Great buy for a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milescraft 1096 Rotary Tool Sky Hook Support Arm","review":"I am happy with the Milescraft 1096 Rotary Tool Sky Hook Support Arm I purchased. It is one of two hooks I purchased at the same time to see which one I would use. I use both and The Milescraft unit is taller by about a foot, non-adjustable in height after assembly, where the other is adjustable with a twist. The hook is sturdy, not a professional grade hanger, but good enough to hang my rotary tool and flex shaft on to work with the handheld collet. The clamping base is molded plastic with two extra sized differently holds to put a screwdriver or other under 1 inch dia. tool in when not needed. The only verticle shaft adjustment is made with a clamp on the base to move the nonpolished dull finish shaft up or down.

Granted, it might get more exciting further into the book. However, I quickly grew tired of the memior-like style of the story, which lacks imagination in recreating Darwin's early 20s. I can tell where Stone is pulling directly from Darwin's writings, letters to and from family members, and musings in his diary. If I wanted that in a book, I'd read a biography; this is a novel. Conversation comes across as stilted and unnatural, with ... thrown in at odd places. I know many of you out there are fans of Stone, but this one doesn't quite make it as a historical/biographical novel. It lacks imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, hard-to-find marinade for wild game meat","review":"Picked this up on a whim one time and my husband was hooked. Of course right after that, we could never find it again. Fortunately Amazon has plenty in stock! :)One bottle will cover about 2-2.5 lbs of meat. It has a liquidy consistency, looking almost like french salad dressing. But when cooked down, it gets much thicker and turns into a sauce.We use this for marinading wild game meat. Typically duck from my husbands duck hunting trips. They sit for a night in this marinade and the next day we use the meat for duck fajitas. It does a nice job of ridding meat of it's strong gamey taste.Everyone we know who has tried this marinade has been hooked and is always on a look out for it to be in stock in the grocery store. It gets used enough between all of us that buying it from Amazon in a 6 pack lasts us about 2 months, so it's a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite improvement","review":"Got a fair price($185). Local shop wanted $100 more + $1000 to install. From all the install's I read about on a Ranger forum many people said they installed in 8 hours. I did this completely alone & it about 28 hours. Seems every bolt holding the bumpers or body to the frame was rusted & lock tighted & required heat & some serious blood sweat & tears. I finally came to the conclusion that an impact wrench may be worth the investment, So I purchased one for $119 & the seemingly impossible became possible. The truck looks great after the 3\\" lift & 285/75/R16 Cooper STT tires installed for an overall gain of about 7\\".

This narrative is quite different than your run-of-the-mill sea fiction in that it treats a civilian's perspective of the war at sea and charts the development of the protagonist from isolated merchant skipper to a driven privateersman. It is particularly noteworthy in two respects--Kite is very much a real person and does not suffer from an incredible/implausible list of infallibly heroic traits--Kite sees the American \\"patriots\\" in a strikingly de-mystifying way.The book's style is influenced by Victorian writers in general. I sniffed a particularly strong dose of Dickens, which is, of course, a good thing. Highly recommended for those interested in a meaty read before the fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic locale, adventure, horses, FANTASTIC","review":"I loved this book as much if not more than the BLACK STALLION.

They are no Grisham, that's for sure. Book starts out really slow and took much effort on my part to stay with it until it started to get good (when the trial started.) Almost no character development imho but interesting characters are part of the story. I should disclose that I am a trial attorney of some 30 years and with over 100 civil and criminal trials to my credit so my appreciation of the book (or lack thereof) may differ from a layperson's. I didn't even come close to figuring it out by the way. Despite my somewhat lukewarm reaction to this book I have ordered another one in the series, willing to give them another try. I am hoping that they improve as they go along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea bad book","review":"I was intruged by the concept behind this book, and the book starts out fairly good, but the qaulity of the book drops quickly.

There is no cover for the teeth for storage, and during cutting there is no protection for the hand that is holding or stabilizing the vegetable.I cut myself badly on both occasions I used it, even though I was being careful. Really badly. The second time, I needed stitches.After that I threw the peeler into the trash without hesitation. Next time I'll go for a julienne slicer or mandoline that has a way to grip to the vegetable that protects the hand. It's too easy for it to get out of control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool instead of pulling out the Mandoline","review":"I don't understand how someone can require stitches using this tool. It is so much easier than using the Mandoline and cleaning up after. We use this primarily for creating \\"spaghetti\\" strands out of squash as opposed to true pasta (sadly pasta has too many calories, carbs etc for more than the occasional serving). Serving squash this way is a major hit with people who think they don't like zuchini. I have also used it for strands of egg plant. For harder veggies like carrots, a mandoline is the better choice. I have two of these devices for each house. My sister and best friend have them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp little puppy","review":"This got more use in the summer for making zucchini pasta, but it did it very well.

It is so hard to decipher what songs are played on soprano and what songs are played on tenor. It all sounds the same. As one reviewer has already stated, there is no life in this album. It is bland, soulless, and will make you take up smoking, drinking and biting your nails.

I usually listen to Rush, Zeppelin, and Floyd, so I can truely appreciate good playing. That is why I bought the CD (used) just for the solo.

With about 10+ min of effort I finally forced open the toes and identified the dent in the metal as the cause. It sticks up and catches on the wood when fully closed. While its now functional, the shoe tree has limited mobility, and if I were to close it again, it could easily lock up.I would otherwise identify the material as sturdy and the price as fair, however the dent in the metal is hard to ignore.

And why they are starting to act like they use to when they were alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Aren't Ordinary Zombies!","review":"I love zombies! I wasn't aware that this was an installment of George A. Romero's collection, so I have to go back and watch the others. I like this zombie movie, because they were not just lifeless drooling idiots. They seemed to still have knowledge of who they were and their occupation.These zombies were smart and taking over. Since, I have only seen this one I have more of an uninfluenced opinion.

They know how to run,use weapons and understand humans. So they attack a city full of rich people while the army tries to save them.Sorry, but I thought the storyline was way to-out-there for me.

It had a fantastic cast for a Zombie movie, with Dennis Hopper, John L and that guy from the Mentalist. Oh well. It still has lots of zombies craving human flesh and lots of scenes of zombies attacking. So it does have some redeeming value. Just don't expect a great story here folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing.","review":"Highly disappointing. Absolutely nothing new or inventive. I simply can't understand how this is the same guy who did the original. Granted I'm in the minority in wanting a \`serious' zombie movie, but none of the guys at \`guys movie night' had anything positive to say. Neither campy enough to be funny nor serious enough to be interesting. Our final tally was 0 liked, 7 hated. Maybe I'll get luck and someday Ridely Scott will do a zombie movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The....","review":"This movie was so bad.I cannot tell you readers anymore but that.It was silly, stupid and a horribly made zombie flick.Very disappointed in Romero who gave us \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\"Why did he do this to us?"},{"rating":"1","title":"C'Mon You People!","review":"You and I all know this movie was crap! Escape denial and face up to reality.

The series has definetly tanked. This movie started out as a bunch of people, very few, who are left in the world as the dead have apparently inherited the earth. The rich live in mighty sky scrapers while the poverty stricken masses are huddled at the bases. Then, as if by some weak giveaway that they were running out of ideas, one character demands that he be let into the rich buildings or he'll blow them up. Not only that but he wants money. And a lot of it. Quick question: What's the point of asking for money when the dead have taken over the earth?!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's very simple, if you like horror movies, you will love Land Of The Dead!","review":"Take it from me,(huge horror movie buff) if you like horror movies, you will enjoy Land Of The Dead. What makes this different from the horror films released in the past few years is:1. Very, very little CGI,(thank you Romero) feels like it was shot and made in the 80's.2. Characters, and story come first. Something current horror films are desperately lacking.A great movie, give it a try, chances are you won't be disappointed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What plot?","review":"Land of the Dead has to be the worst out of all of Romero's \\"Dead\\" films. There is no plot hardly at all, and a lot of plot holes at that. Why are the zombies after Dennis Hopper? How do they know who he is? Those are just a couple of question out of the movie that are left unanswered. The only reason to watch the movie is to see zombies eat and destroy, but how many movies have we seen that are like that? This movie offers nothing new and is the same old thing that has been done a million times. We have even seen a zombie figure out how to use weapons on Day of the Dead, so zombies using weapons on here was nothing new either. Good special effects and a cameo by Tom Savini are the only thing that this movie worth watching. Everything else is very forgettable and not really worth watching again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 1st","review":"Dawn of the Dead is the better title. Thought sequels are supposed to get better.?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Land of the Dead was not altogether a horrible movie, but it could have been much better. Especially because it was made by George A. Romero. The first three films, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead were all superb. However, Land of the Dead did not live up to its predecessors' greatness. In fact, Land of the Dead was a big disappointment. But it is not so bad that you cannot sit through the whole movie, unlike other reviewers have posted. Although not a great film either, the remake of Dawn of the Dead (2004) was actually better than Land of the Dead in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun But Full Of Flaws","review":"I think Land of the Dead ranks a close fourth in all four of the Romero zombie films. We had high hopes for this movie. The budget was obviously there, the acting was better and so were the effects and the pacing. What went wrong?!? Well, the characters were morons again and Romero is still pushing his outdated Sixties message of power to the people, capitalism is bad, and so forth. The group mind zombies were presented as the real good guys. At one point, they have the leader zombie dead in their sites, they can kill him, but they decide no, he's too noble, let's just let him go!!! We totally didn't believe that!!! Then the big bad guy decides to run away with a bag of cash instead of taking any food or guns!!! Why!?!?!!! Even with all of these flaws, though, this is a fun and scary movie and a good addition to the Romero library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice paycheck, Romero!","review":"This \\"movie,\\" and i use the term loosely, seemed like George was phoning one in just for the money.

It just seemed like a couple of good actors came together with a bunch of what seemed to be brand new actors and had someone role a camera while they were practicing their lines.So the movie starts out with these cops driving around in an armored bus with guns and stuff on it. They go around killing zombies. I really don't know what else to say. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and I wish I could say he was the best part of the movie, but everyone was too horible to say that they helped the movie at all.So if you are looking for a movie that makes no sense, has no character development, but does have some really good gore, then you should check this out.And at the end of this, am I supposed to believe that the head zombie guy just became smart all of a sudden and figured out how to blow stuff up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw the wrong movie","review":"I thought this film was going to be Herbie the love bug.

You see we fist made out to the original Herbie movie and thought we could recapture some of that zing. We must have gone into the wrong theater but it was too late to wheel morty out once the film started so we wouldn't bother everyone...I shouldn't have taken Morty to see it, at one part he screamed so hard his falsies flew out and smacked a young man's head in the seat in front of him.

However, it seems to be black and blue (Ha! Ha! I unintentionally made a pretty good pun) now. Really, I have been noticing how there are so many movies lately that are only filmed with a combination of blue on top of black. No other colors show through except extreme amounts of red will penetrate the dominating blue color and sometimes even green when they showed a computer screen.This is annoying. I suspect it has something to do with filming in the dark and being too lazy to overcome whatever technicalities it takes to actually create movies set in the dark properly in color.As for the movie, I don't see any progression in this. I should know better but I always watch these stupid movies hoping that they get creative and comedic with the gore.

He's the father of the zombie genre and this flick proves modern Romero is better than those he inspired.

Yes there where some pretty cool scenes but Big Daddy drove me nuts . The moment they became \\"aware\\" it was so lame and laughable it ruined the rest of the movie.As to the acting .

This certainly wasn't supposed to be the fourth installation of the Dead series. It wasn't even scary just gross. I fell to sleep trying to watch this snoozer. B-Movie actors, stupid mind-numbing plot and characters that were so undeveloped that you didn't care whether they survived or not. The zombies were unbelievably annoying as well. it makes you wonder why everyone involved in this garbage decided to show up for the first day of production.

You can keep the thinly veiled social commentary . . . we get it. None of the characters were remotely interesting and the special effects were nothing new. As a matter of fact, the copious use of CGI really put me off. If this film were to have been made 5 or 10 years ago it would have been amazing. It's not quite fair to compare this to the Dawn remake (a much more dynamic offering) or 28 Days Later (which was technically not even a zombie flick). Using Romeros previous efforts as a unit of measure, Land of the Dead is more of a step backwards than forward.I really wanted to like this movie more but, after repeated viewing, it just didn't cut the mustard . . . history will not be kind to this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only idiots couldnt enjoy this.","review":"Okay its close to being the perfect movie. Does it have zombies?? Well duh. Does it have lesbians ?? Two chicks making out only to be eaten by zombies. Does it have midgets ?? Hell yeah and hes wearing a PURPLE PIMP SUIT.Does it have Ninjas??? Sadly no. 3 outta 4 aint bad though.I guess since I saw Batman thatll have to do. This movie is like Road Warrior with Zombies.Oh and Tom Savini dressed like Sex Machine from From Dusk Till Dawn and the original Dawn of the Dead as a zombie wielding a machete and cutting a guys head in half if pretty sick too. OHHH YEAH.The guys from Shaun of The Dead are the guys in the photoshop booth. As zombies of course. The giant moblie tank Dead Reckonging is pretty sweet too. If you like blood guts and any of the above mentioned things with lots of intestines then go see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its been done before","review":"I liked all the other movies in George Romero's \\"Dead\\" series. My main complaint with the movie is the intelligent gas attendant zombie. Why? Because the notion of the intelligent was done before (and better) in Day of the Dead. Bub (the zombie in Day) has been worked with over time with Dr. Logan, when we are given no explanation for the gas station zombie's intelligence. I liked a lot of the movie other than that, but I cringed whenever he was on screen. It ruined the movie for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money on this.","review":"If you like having your intelligence insulted, go ahead and waste your money. Zombies with rotten necrotic brains able to think? Give me a brake. Romero went from explaining that these zombies are able to live by pure intincts to feed to being able to pull a trigger on humans is retarded. A city full of people with automatic weapons that can't even hold off zombies is pretty lame too. Romero's a Vietnam Vet, for him to show soldiers getting bested by a bunch of slow walking stiffs is ridiculous. Common civilians maybe, but not soldiers. I think somebody out there should make a Zombie movie where AIRBORNE RANGERS (75TH RANGER REGIMENT)just annihilate every zombies out there in la-la land and end these stupid Zombie movies once and for all.And Romero, please end all the melodratic political - social messages in your movies.

This movie was very dumb, but with a group of friends it is fun to see the bad make up and death scenes. Not enough action, since that is all that really matters cuz zombie movie plots are pretty dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"George A. Romero is an excellent film maker whose films have a wider goal than just gore and scares. The political side of this film is very intense with Dennis Hopper's character representing the Bush administration to its fullest. The class issues in this film are true to some extent, the rich get everything, while the poor get nothing. The film also tackles evolution of the zombies who become their own force and fight back on their enemy, man. A bit gory, but still good fun. Excellent performances also by Simon Baker, Asia Argento, Robert Joy, and John Leguizamo make it a good film. Also includes guest appearances by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) as zombies and also a special appearance by the legendary Tom Savini (Dawn of the Dead, From Dusk Till Dawn) as his character from DOTD as a zombie. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Max imitation with zombies","review":"This is an unnecessary movie really. It beats me why Romero felt like making another zombiemovie after I watched it. The story line of the dead picking up some human tricks like shooting guns looks very silly. I think last year's remake of Dawn of the dead should have been a nice conclusion of the zombiemovies for the next 10 years. This movie isn't even scary anymore...it is like watching an action movie with zombies. Was this Romero's attempt to show everyone he still can make a better zombiemovie then any other director? If so, he shouldn't have bothered. (SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romero the Hack","review":"Last year, in December I wrote a review on this movie. I since deleted that review.

I watched every stinking frame of this loser of a movie. It's so ridiculous. I'd like to just forget he made this stupid movie and remember the 3 dead movies as they were. Night, Dawn and Day.

To many, director George A. Romero is a horror guru, a living legend, a genius.I simply can't relate to all of this, as EVERY Romero zombie flick is the same movie with the same plot outline...1. Humans barricade themselves inside some setting (eg a house, shopping mall, bomb shelter).2. The humans can't seem to get along, and are too busy fussing among each other to keep an eye on the ghouls.3. Zombies break into the barricaded setting and kill everyone.4.

While Dawn of the dead is one of the best horror films ever made and Night of the Living Dead way ahead of its time, here it just seems laughable because it is not scary. It not only compares poorly to other films in the series, but it appears Romero is washed up. If they polled people on what scared them in the year 2010, I bet that \\"zombies\\" wouldn't be near the top of what scares people. But the wait finally is here, but what a disappointment. Shaun of the Dead was a much better zombie film in many respects. Romero fails to tred any new ground as a director.

If the point of the movie is to say that all rich or above average income white people are evil and that the murderous crimanals are really the victims/good people....well I got it, thanks for the heads up Mr. Romero, I'll quit my job tomorrow and burn all my money.

The acting was good and the premise of the plot, I thought, was very interesting (a view of zombies after 40 years and the ways humans have succeeded or failed in keeping them at bay). The problem was all in the way the zombies were portrayed.. they just weren't scary.. at all. The idea that zombies would evolve is kind of far-fetched anyway (when do they have time to evolve when they're constantly decaying..) The zombies were very slow moving but not in an aggressive or menacing way. They almost seemed too human and that took away from a lot of the terror of the film.Overall, I'd recommend checking out one of the better Zombie films if you're in the mood for a good scare (Night of the Living Dead or even the hilarious Shaun of the Dead would both be better bets)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romero at his worst is still leagues above every other director who takes a stab at the zombie genre.","review":"Not the best of the series, But still a Romero flick.

They're dead humans reanimated, they only think about eating brains and human flesh, and when they're not thinking about that.... well... they're never NOT thinking about that. That's what makes zombies so great. They're mindless shuffling relentless flesh eating machines. So when they start communicating in grunts and primitive gestures and formulating a plot to take over one of the last human cities you kinda throw the whole allure of the zombie out the window. Now you have a movie about a group of stupid cannibles attacking a town. Or basically vampires (zombie's undead cousins) without fancy abilities. The acting sucks, surprisingly, even though the cast consisted of quality actors. It sounded like a good idea in theory but it ended up falling WAY short."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong???","review":"Before I get into Romero's \\"Land of the Dead\\" let me mention a few things.When I first heard about the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake directed by Zack Snyder, I was the first one to put it down.

I thought this would be the ultimate zombie movie. Once again I was \\"Dead\\" wrong!! This movie sucked!! There were no dynamics, terrible characters, and the whole evolution thing didn't work.

The leader zombie, who is learning to be a rambo, I thought, was corny.I realized people raved about it...but I found it dead all right--dead as in dull: What and where is the originality? And the rambo type of acting is soo corny.Some of the eviscerating scenes were very good, but where is the originality in that as well???I hope this is the last one of the series.

Well all I can say is I was waiting for Michael Jackson and the dead to start doing the dance from Thriller. It is my opinion and I have watched hundreds of Horror movies one of the worst. I am not sure what Romero was thinking when he did this one. I am sorry I bought it because it is not even worth renting.

For example, there are some places where I THINK it was supposed to be the greek letter phi, but it comes out as a left parenthesis and a right parenthesis. At least with that you can figure out what it was supposed to be. There is much worse--places where symbols are completely gone. E.g., there is a place where you just get a capital sigma with a subscript giving a summation limit, a blank space, a less than sign, and another blank space. So, the proof is saying the some of *something* is less than *something else*.This is a shame, because the book itself, from what I can see, is EXCELLENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT get the Kindle edition","review":"The Kindle edition of the book is missing or misrepresenting math symbols in so many places it makes it completely unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"Great Quality.

While my children (5 and 3 1/2) do enjoying playing the game they are frustrated that the games are the same everytime. There are three games to play on the dvd, but they are not random in nature. The \\"gumballs\\", moves, and character narrative are identical every time you play. After only two days of play my children could tell you what was coming next in each game. I purchased this game because my son has difficulty sitting still for a board game, but loves games requiring physical interaction. I wanted a game that would utilize directions for him to follow and this game does do that, however I could have gotten the same result by playing \\"simon says\\" with him myself and saved the $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad execution","review":"The idea behind The Candyland DVD is great. However, a moron designed it. Your children cannot do this game alone and will get bored halfway through. A parent or older child has to press the 'enter' key on the remote every 90 seconds or so. So you can't even run to the bathroom, take a phone call, or get dinner started while your kids are playing the game.There are also lots of annoying segments throughout the game that have nothing to do with the game. For instance, \\"Lord Licorice\\" makes an appearance occasionally to bother the host, but my kids just stand there staring at him wondering when they can play again.If you are looking for an activity your kids can do by themselves or with minimal parental involvement, this is not the game to buy! Or if your kids are used to more high-energy, fast action games, this is not for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the High Price Tag","review":"I bought this game for my 3yr old daughters as a birthday present (Dec) thinking they could get some physical activity while indoors on these cold winter days w/ a fun game. NOT WORTH IT! As other reviewers have mentioned, you first have to sit through at least 5 minutes of promos that you can't fast forward through. The games move much too slowly and you have to constantly press the remote for them to continue. My daughters and I got bored very quickly. Save yourself some money, make your own colored squares and play Simon Says and other color games with your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"So slow paced - not worth the time OR money","review":"I agree with the people who say the pace is too slow and the controls are terrible. You can never skip ahead, even if you decide to play a different game within the dvd - you're forced to wait through the entire game cycle. And trust me, kids will often want to bail out on a game before it's finished, because they're just not much fun. The board game version is ten times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on the DVD version!","review":"I asked my mother to get the DVD Candyland for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. I thought she and my older daughter (5 years old) could have some fun physically acting out the game. Little did I know how boring and repetitive it actually is. The characters spend too much time talking, explaining things, and waiting for someone (usually me) to push a button on the remote to move things along. I wish I had asked for the basic boardgame."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one.","review":"my kids actually enjoy playing this game but I find it so annoying I encourage them to do something else. you have to use the remote far too often, and our DVD player is situated above the TV so the kids holding the remote doesn't work. If you want a game like this, try Hullaballoo, by Cranium. Same idea and so much more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a commercial than a game","review":"The underlying games could be fun, but the pacing and DVD controls are terrible. You're forced to wait for 5 min of commercials at the start and you can't fast-forward (FF) or skip them. In the games, the characters talk too long and you can't FF there as well. An adult has to sit there to press the right remote key every two minutes. My kids, 2 and 4, liked the game at first but got bored in 10 min because the pacing is so bad. Very disappointing, especially for the high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"We returned it to the store today. The commercials and pacing of the DVD was just way too long for our 3 1/2 year old. I planned on playing this with him and hoping we could both get some exercise but we did a lot of standing and waiting for the next thing to occur. Quite annoying in that respect. This would be an AWESOME game if you could have a little control over the speed, rewind, fast forward, etc. This might work for you and your family but for us it just wasn't a good fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for tile or dogs,cats or small children","review":"this game looks like fun but I don't want 10 four year olds in my living room bouncing around like there's no tomorrow around my furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WHITEWASH!","review":"I bought this book hoping to get some additional insight into one of the finest musical groups to come out of American pop. Instead this is a book that avoids any of the tough issues of the development and life of this band, and seems to have been constructed of Motown press releases. In fact, this seems like a book that was commissioned by Motown itself. It's a pretty rosy and peachy picture that seems to avoid any of the drama and heartbreak over the ouster of Florence Ballard from the group in 1967, or the events that led to it, or the additional tensions from which now well-known stories have come. Get it right from the horse's mouth and take a look at Mary Wilson's DREAMGIRL AND SUPREME FAITH, for a much more accurate and heart-rending portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An imaginative, inventive and brilliant collection","review":"Girardi does what so many of today's young writers eschew; he tells a dramatic and entertaining story. And in this new collection of two stories and five novellas, he shows that he's striving towards his imaginative peak. This book reminds me of the new Wilco record. It feels as familiar as an old friend and yet you know its completely new and relevant, golden. Do yourself a favor and read this book. And pick up that record. Noteworthy for collectors is that the hardcover editions of A VAUDEVILLE OF DEVILS are limited numbered editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so stories with several errors","review":"Only the first story in this book held my attention, though the ending was predictable and not very inventive. One story is supposedly set in modern-day Seattle, but Girardi has several glaring errors regarding names of local sports franchises (it's not \\"Sea Hawks\\" but \\"Seahawks\\") and local place-names. He should have done more research if he's never lived here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable book","review":"I found this book to be highly engaging. Some of the stories are more compelling than others, but overall, the author is a fantastic teller of fantastic, imaginitive stories. The stories are rich with detail and vivid characters, but none of it is too \\"hokey\\" to be credible. The variety of the stories and main characters is what makes this book so impressive -- each story is unique and stands alone well. I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and disappointing","review":"This collection is a terrible disappointment, for at least two reasons. First, and less important, is Girardi's sloppy writing. He commits elementary errors -- like referring to a safe deposit box as a \\"safety deposit box\\" -- leaving the text littered with annoying little mistakes that any careful writer or observant editor would have eradicated. Second, and far more important, is a failure of authorial will that permits Girardi to invent wonderful, nuanced characters to whom nothing illuminating happens. The voiceless German diver, for example, whose handicap is neither a metaphor for anything nor a plot device. It's just there. Like these stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girardi's images will haunt you","review":"I haven't ever read anything written by this author aside from these short stories, so I cannot make any comparison's for you, but I was impressed with Girardi's ability to create suspense and \\"mood\\" with his words. Several of the stories ran through my mind for days after I read them. I guess I don't agree with the other reviewers. I think that this book is great BECAUSE the stories are disturbing and BECAUSE some of the scenerios are so far-fetched. Plus, the plots seemed very different to me despite the fact that they all dealt with similar issues of choice, fear, and regret. I look forward to reading one of Girardi's novels. To the other reviewers I say- instead of feeling threatened by the melancholy atmosphere of the book, perhaps you should figure out why it bothers you so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dark writing about moral decisions","review":"Aren't we all fascinated by seeing another person's moral compass at work? Girardi's short stories show the twists of fate and choice that move us all forward in life. Good scene setting, too, particularly for our visual age. An easy read that keeps one thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may be biased, but I'm not stupid","review":"OK, I admit it. I've also written a book on the impact of the Internet on branding, so that may make me somewhat biased. But in my research, I read dozens of books...summarized hundreds of articles...interviewed many senior managers and Internet insiders...and still find it hard to believe that this book is getting any attention at all. Its arguments are gossimer and its conclusions vapid. However, the Immutable Laws(tm) series itself is a good illustration of the power and longevity of a deep brand: this book is selling based upon the prior good works and reputation of its creator, not because it delivers any real value to readers on its own. The next Immutable book had better be a big improvement, or you can expect this literary brand to become even shallower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionnable book","review":"This book, conveniently adding the word \\"Internet\\" to a title of a previous book has some hideous mistakes in it. First, the site DRKoop.com is represented as JRKoop.com - how can the authors and editors miss that? Plus, the site FogDog.com is another - listed as FrogDog.com. For a book to boldly label itself as an Internet survival guide of sorts, you'd hope they could demonstrate some better knowledge of the net.This book also makes some pretty bold statements that would be better placed on a discussion forum somewhere - they are sure to be questionned and disputed. If you are looking for a good branding book, read Al Rie's book from 1980 - Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"will the real Tim Sanders please stand up? this book rocks","review":"ok, so we don't all agree @ the yahoo=land.

The other 10 laws were simple mutations of that one law. If you are in a rush, you need only read the first part of the book.

When Al Ries and Jack Trout first wrote the book \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\", I thought that the book was very well written. I bought this book thinking that it would be the name. Alas, it is not to be so.Still, the authors have explained the difference between a good Internet brand versus a bad one. The Internet is an Interactive Medium. As such, the marketer must realise the interactivity of the medium and how it affects branding. The lessons learnt have been quite interesting.

I suppose some of the information is somewhat good such as rules for naming a company (why I gave it two stars). I felt like most of what was said could have been distilled into 20 or so pages.

As I read through it, I was so happy to see that the approach I had taken for my business as it relates to marketing on the internet was correct. My favorite chapter is the one about the differnce between a business who markets on the internet and a true internet business. I also loved the information about picking a domain name.

I wanted to glean newfounded information on how Internet business works. I wanted to find new insights that were practical to furthering new business ideas.None of these hopes were met by the book. It was a disgrace. For example, chapter 9 talks about how the Internet is going to \\"unite the world\\" by bringing products and services to everyone. In Chapter 10 they preach how technology doesn't nicely converge, it diverges. Inconsitencies abound!The worst line I read in the entire book was: \\"eToys.com, eTrade.com, and Buy.com are all WEAK names.\\" What are the authors smoking?To sum it up, the book's thesis is WEAK. The backup of their incredulous theories are WEAK. This book is WEAK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toad Is the Uncle of Heaven: A Vietnamese Folktale","review":"My children love this book!

TeenApe is a white kid in a mask, imitating some confused idea of what a black teenager is like. There's also a guy in some kind of rat/animal mask imitating a hispanic teenager. And they're ALL idiots. The \\"raunchy\\" parts sound like they were written by people who have never been in a room with actual boobies, the \\"hilarious\\" parts are more like a bunch of hyper-active 13 year olds making poop jokes.

Certain things metioned in the book have stayed in my mind since then. There are many accounts of near death experiences. Many things have been revealed to saints throughout time. If you don't care to believe in purgatory or hell well then i suppose you won't like what is said. I thought it was an incredible look at what journey awaits us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"One man's opinion","review":"This book is the latest in the 500 year old tradition of scaring people into submission. The bottom line is that neither this author nor any other human being that has ever lived (or died and returned after a near death experience) has any idea what awaits us in the afterlife; because no human being has ever completely died and come back. His quotes from \\"mystics\\" and a few saints who claim to have seen purgatory are ridiculously non-credible. He actually directly quotes the Virgin Mary at one point! The book is pure speculation on the author's part but delivered in a self righteous and dogmatic manner reminiscent of some 15th century inquisitor. Purgatory incidentally is never mentioned anywhere in the Bible but is a medieval Catholic invention. This book is strictly the author's personal speculation and agenda with nothing backing it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Travel","review":"I have used this book often to give me patterns/ideas for gifts and accessories for myself and others....I sew lots and this is one of my favorites!!

Composed and arranged around 1995 the album takes you into a journey of many electonic sound delights. What I find so special is the obvious lack of continuous numbing 70 bpm bass beat. Each cut is new different and refreshing. The music is energetic and mesmerizing. Trance has gone through so many changes yet \\"Nirwana\\" still stands out as the best and my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful little gem","review":"I have to first say this is one of the best trance albums out there.

Not a typical ballad, these songs really touched my heart.

To be fair I read a lot of books, and a share of them are not stellar examples of literature. This collection of dis-associated and cliched ideas, horrible non-cohesive characters, random voice and beats make this, well, collection of words an absolute travesty of story telling, authorship, and heck- rational thought itself.The best part? Morbid curiosity. The unending stream of horrible editing (including, I think, randomly deleted sections) makes for an interesting game of what was that supposed to be? Actually, you know what? That is is the summation of my review. What the heck is this suppose to be? Yes!

I'd be embarrassed to put my name on a product with as many typos and grammatical errors as this book. And many reviewers have noted that there is a page or two mixed up. Not sure how that happened but you really are thrown a curve ball when you hit that.

I purchased the Ebook version for kindle online and it was a BIG disappointment as well as a disservice to customers in my opinion. This is not altogether uncommon with OCR scans of older books available through Amazon. Also some errors in translation and no disclosure that this was originally published in 1961. I think it's deceptive to give the digital publication date and not the original date of the actual work.

It arrived earlier than the shipping date. I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because I had to force 1 of the 2 AA batteries into the holder. Might have been just my unit. I tested the ZAPPING capability personally, since it's still rather cool here, hence very few bugs. Not a pleasant expierience!!!!!Imagine your worst static electricty shock X 100. It actually stings! After I tested it with a finger, I decided I'd try it using a metallic object. I used a small Phillips head screw driver to check whether it would actually produce a spark. Very nice white 1/4\\" spark and noise. One word of caution: after pressing both buttons, without a discharge by swatting a bug, this unit will retain a charge. Not sure for how long though. Great product for the price. HAPPY ZAPPING! ENJOY THE LIGHT SHOW!!!! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reccomended","review":"Great price and thought it would work based on some of the more positive reviews. But...either this unit is low powered or the flys in my part of the country need 220 volts to kill them. (I live in northern calif.) I have shocked flys with the accompanying sparks and smoke only to have them power up and lift off out of the unit and fly away. One benefit not listed on the packaging is its abilty to bring happiness. My wife has had no lack of humor laughing as she watches me chase, shock and then rechase and shock the same flys who defy death. Oh well, from a physical fitness aerobic standpoint this unit cant be beat. And rather than invest in costly pulse monitoring equipment using this unit puts you on the move making every attempted kill event an experience just shy of your target heart rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bug Zapper","review":"Product received promptly.

Put your feet up. Pour yourself a glass of wine. Turn on this score. Close your eyes. Relax.By far, one of the most relaxing, yet not cheesy, jazz albums released in recent years. I can't tell you how nice it is to relax to this soundtrack. I haven't seen the movie yet (though I'll be buying the DVD the day it comes out), but heard the soundtrack generating buzz because of the snubbing by the academy. So, this review is of the score as an album, not as an accompaniment to the film.From the opening piece, to the closing track, this CD is a delight. Easy listening, soft jazz. The kind of stuff that makes you close your eyes, shake your head, and tap your feet. Give it a listen, and you'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tastes like summer","review":"When I saw the movie, I immediately was absorbed by the score that sets the perfect mood for the story.

In its short space it can not do each fully, but nonetheless, she does an excellent coverage of history, philosophy, and applications. Although this is not the ideal book for learning to do probability, I suspect many students would find it helpful. As she herself demonstrates if you have not studied probability, you are doomed to misunderstand it even if you are otherwise mathematically sophisticated. Consequently, this book is ideal as an introduction to the subject for people at all levels. (For those who want to learn to do probability calculations, I would recommend two books. If you have not had calculus you might try the book by Samuel Goldberg. For those with calculus, I would suggest either the book \\"Probability for Engineers and Scientists\\" by R. W. Hamming or the book \\"Introduction to Probability Models\\" by Sheldon Ross.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Shallow","review":"This book does two things: It surveys the history of probability and randomness, and it teaches some insights about how people think about randomness and probabilities. It is a short, light read, but it disappoints on both fronts. For history, \\"Against the Gods\\" by Peter Bernstein is much better (more detailed and more interesting). For insights, \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" by Taleb is much more insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Science of Randomness!","review":"I believe that Dr. Bennett's book, Randomness, helps explain the science of it to the novice learner. Randomness is quite a science even though the results can differ from time to time. If you are in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, the science of randomness can help explain the roll of the dice. This book is interesting and easily read for those who are not so keen on mathematics like myself. Bennett's writing is to the audience and not at it which is essential in reading a book by this mathematician and college professor. Mathematics is not one of my favorite subjects but I recommend this book strongly to college bound students or anybody interested in broadening their minds to understanding the situation of random events and circumstances. Not everything can be explained by science, then there is randomness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever heard of Godel?","review":"You can ignore the stars. This is written in response to \\"mrbigbeast\\": His statement that Zeno's Paradox and other paradoxes like it have been \\"debunked\\" are totally ludicrous. Hasn't he ever heard of Kurt Godel or Alan Turing? It has been mathematically proven that real logical paradoxes without any resolution exist. There are several accessible books on this subject like *Godel, Escher, Bach.* It's a disgrace that such stupid reviews have weight in the rating process."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit disappointed","review":"I must confess that I read this book with the intention of sharpening my trading skill. I was attracted by the example quoted from this book in a trading book \\"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life -- by Nassim Nicholas Taleb\\". Definitely I had made a wrong inference.To me, this book is quite academic. Out of the ten chapters I only found the first and the tenth interesting, with both comprised mainly of life examples and paradoxes. Unless you are really interested in the topic \\"Probability\\" in an academic or mathematics sense, this might not be suitable for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent translation","review":"St Ignatius spiritual classic is brought to life by this translation. The well presented additional information on the life and times of the saint is very helpful. St Ignatius' method of deepening ones spirituality and closeness to God really works. I had a few problems with some quirks deriving from the dark side of medieval Catholicism. Nevertheless this is an excellent book and the exercises are profitable if adopted sensibly. A good read for the church historian and Christian believer alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Usborne First Encyclopedia of Our World","review":"This is a colorful and interesting science text for a first to third grader and definitely worth the price.

The filter ring adjusts easily, yet doesn't creep from where you set it. The threads on the main ring have been solid through a bunch of removals. And my shots looked great.

Now Lil Dap knew how to ride the beat better than Nutcraker but still... Anyway, I think this is Premos best album just because he was SICK on the beats. Like DAMN!!

DJ Premier does not produce a lot of albums completely. He was just, at this point, perfecting that Primo signature sound. The beats on this album are some of his dopest. I cant say he wasted them on Melachi and Lil Dap but I will say that those beats deserved someone better (Could you imagine this being the Gang Starr album that filled the '94-98 void?). These two rapping over Primo's beats is like a Rolls Royce with a bad paint job. Melachi says, \\"It's a wonderful world, a world of wonder, I thunder I thunder I won't go under\\". I laugh out loud at some of their lyrics. They are the weakest rappers to rap over Primo beats. That's loyalty for you though. It's a 5 star album for beats but a 1 star album for lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the East is in the House","review":"This is another DJ Premier Productions so you know the beats are hot.

That being said, there is no better introduction to the Hip than their stellar live album \\"Live Between Us\\".This CD offers hit after hit and really captures some of the tremendous energy of the Hip live. Ive seen them 4 times now and those have been some of my favourite concerts ever. Ive never been disappointed by the Hip live, and you won't be disappointed by this.I would hesitate to recommend this album to the seasoned Hip collector, as it doesn't add that much to the studio versions and there are many, many great live Hip tracks widely available to download (\\"Killer Whale Tank\\", anyone?).

Of course there's a few tracks missing, but this does include \\"Grace Too\\", \\"Springtime In Vienna\\", \\"Gift Shop\\", and \\"Ahead By A Century\\". Plus it's got the excellent and moving \\"Courage\\". Most people should like \\"Gordon Downie's\\" ramblings between songs, but everyone should like how good this sounds. It's one of the best sounding live albums I've ever heard. Near studio quality, but with the crowd noise of course.

This years garden turned out even better than the one last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Meant for Beginners","review":"I bought this book because a lot of people recommended it. I think its great if (1) you're up for ALOT of reading (its 432 pages long), and (2) if you want to know EVERYTHING there is to know about container gardening. Personally, I felt this book had TOO much information. I found myself swimming in information about how to choose the right plant container for the deck of a boat - seriously, that's in there. Wayyy too much information for someone who has killed 4 \\"oh so easy to maintain\\" ivy plants. All I wanted was a small container garden with some peppermint, sage and a few tomatoes. This book however is so overwhelming. If you're a newbie like me, go for \\"Easy Container Gardening\\" by Pamela Crawford. Loved it! Simple and to-the-point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"Item received on time and in condition as described. Would do business with this seller again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference","review":"I reference this book all the time. One thing I've noticed in all the gardening books I've ever read, though, is the vagueness with watering info (frequency, amount). I am a BEGINNER, so 'keep the soil damp' or 'moist to the touch' is useless to me. If I water 20 times a day or once a day, with ANY amount of water, the soil is going to be damp and moist to the touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired my Garden","review":"This book helped me plan my container garden for two years. It gives lots of suggestions for using different types of containers. This is good because everyone's space is a bit different and exploring different solutions to the lack of space issues that most container gardeners have. It also provided good suggestions for maximizing space by putting multiple plants in one container. And the authors also give advice for each individual plant so that you understand what each plant needs and how to optimize their growht in the container environment. I love this book. it is very useful and laid out in an easy to navigate and understand format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Container Gardening Resource","review":"This is, hands down, the best container gardening book I've ever read. It has a variety of information on container gardening as a whole and the individual plants you'll be using in your garden.

Candid and real, the content is not always pleasant, but always moving.An excellent index rounds out this fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son Of The Rough South","review":"My granddaughter recommended this book to me. She is studying the civil rights movement at Rutgers University. It is one of the most outstanding books I have ever read. It is sad, funny, colorful, and true.Karl Fleming is my new hero. I am also from North Carolina, went to the same college, and am only a few years younger, so I can identify with many of his experiences. He is a very brave person to have taken a stand against segregation when he did. Many of us cringed at the mistreatment of Blacks in those days but were afraid to speak up.In addition, Karl's ability to describe surroundings and provide details made me feel that I was there. Sometimes I was there. I, too, took modern dance from Joy Kirchner,the red headed teacher at Appalachian. I knew the English professor who was crazy about Shakesphere and had liquor on his breath. But, that is not what makes the book outstanding. Karl Fleming is just a great, great writer. You will be glad you read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I was hoping for an informed history of the civil rights movement in America. Instead, I found this book to be Fleming's catharsis. I don't care about his sexual experiences, and although they may have scarred him or contributed to his personality quirks, they have nothing to do with the civil riights movement. The \\"I was a poor orphan\\", while touching, could have been reduced from 300 pages to about 30.

This software should be illegal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey","review":"\\"On the other Side, African Americans tell of Healing,\\" was an amazing book. I loved the art, the testimonies, and how everything just flowed. I love the fact that the author was on a journey and each testimony helped get her from one step to the next. The stories were about real people with real problem who met a real God who gave them real healing and victory. As I read this book, I was inspired, motivated, healed, blessed, and amazed.I believe that this book was absolutely amazing because it touched my heart in such a way that it has brought about change in my own life. The author's journey was my journey as well. I would recommend this book to everyone I know. After reading it I am renewed, refreshed, and ready to contiue and endure whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor imitation of Wilton Armetale.","review":"From its description it's obvious that Lenox tried to copy Wilton Armetale quality and design. They achieved the look, but not the quality. The butterly meadlow metal line is pretty, I own four pieces, but unfortunately they have stained and look horrible after a few months of use. I guess they are just meant to sit there on the kitchen counter and look pretty without daring to put something in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitchell Tree - Touching","review":"I got this cd because I had read about Mitchell Tree's inspiring story. From dealer to healer is a long way to go in one lifetime. Upon listening I was more than really surprised to find myself putting it on over and over again as I drove to work or anywhere else I had to go. This stuff grows on you like moss. Passenger after passenger asked who it was and where they could get a copy. Why? The music has a pulsating, driving sound to it and the lyrics are simple, clean and true. What else can you ask from a cd? This guy is a serious guitar jock and unlike alot of the rabble out there, he has something to say. Finding form and content in a music cd is rare today, Mitchell Tree delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, great songs","review":"Tamally Maak is such a hot song, it has been ripped off by both Pakistani and Indian singers.

Even if you don't know Arabic, you will enjoy his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"http://www.geocities.com/ada_pr/AmrDiab","review":"Amr Diab's voice is magical! There is something about it and the way he projects it, that even if you do not understand the language, you can still feel him and what he conveys when he sings.Amr Diab is my favorite Arab singer!!! I came across his music a few years back, almost by accident. One day, while surfing the Internet looking for Arabic music, I found a link for this handsome artist. I listened to one of his songs at a site and decided right away to buy his latest CD at that time, Tamally Ma3ak (Always With You). After listening to the CD in its entirety, I was hooked! I then ordered his previous recordings, Amarain and Awedony. I invite you to be receptive and listen with an open mind and open heart and I assure you that you will feel what I've felt each and every time I listen to this unique and wonderful voice...Mei-Ling (PR)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip shaker from start to finish...","review":"I stumbled upon this disc by accident and what an amazing find! Amr Diab's soaring voice coupled with the consistently infectious dance beat of this disc, make it a must have for all fans and a great introduction to his music for those who are new to the scene--like me. This disc is superbly produced and delivers a delicious mix of the exotic with a keen sense of what makes a pop record really POP. Take a break from the painfully average and ordinary and buy this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clint still the magic - Good movie","review":"Since other reviewers have already gone into the story, I'll skip that and only add that I really enjoyed this movie! Clint Eastwood is superb. As is Jeff Daniels and Wanda DeJesus.The script is good with a solid plot. I disagree with the reviewer that compares this to Dirty Harry. Seriously, can you imagine Harry Callghan collapsing in a chase with a heart attack? Don't think so.Eastwood still looks in incredible shape and still has that acting charisma. His acting days are far from over.Good movie. Looking forward to more from Clint Eastwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie was less interesting than the synopsis on the back of the case. I figured an Eastwood movie would be better, but it was way too predictable, old, boring, and didn't keep my attention garnered to it.Unnecessary cussing makes the film even less of an enjoyment.I regret spending a dollar to rent this. Please skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget Bomb","review":"Terrible plot, terrible acting. It's a low budget bomb! Give it a half a star. The theatre was airconditioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"blood work","review":"this is the worst detective movie i have ever seen. in twenty minutes i solved the crime that it takes clint eastwood's character the rest of the movie to solve. the motive, the crime, etc., are completely given away by the first clue. yet the movie keeps draging on as clue after redundant clue fail to yeild any progress. it's like watching wheel of fortune and all but one letter has been revealed, yet the contestant can somehow not solve the puzzle. absolutely horrendous, please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Silly","review":"Taking Ridiculous to New Levels!! First off, Paul Rodriguez should NOT have been cast in this role. He's a no-talent hack with the personality of a 2 by 4, and his presence in this movie dragged it down to the point of unwatchability. Jeff Daniels was an annoying boob too, if ya wanna know. The dead girl's sister could not act either, and the stiff acting on everyone's part taken in conjunction with the plot holes and story defects.......anyway, get the point? Whole thing was just a stretch to me. Watching an 80 yr. old bag a 30 yr. old is a joke. Guess that's the only way Clint can get some action, huh? And the shootout in the street was so stupid and would have never happened. I almost turned it off there. Clint failed miserably on this one, and I think he's one of all-time American greats in cinematic history. While the story should have been interesting, it was not. Fails even as light entertainment, as there's just too many faults to overlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is another example of Hollywood predicability. The movie is so transparent that within the first 15 minutes 90% of the world's population has the killer figured out. What a waste of a good actor (Eastwood). My advice is don't bother watching, renting and especially buying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"Bad, bad, bad. This was a lackluster film that seemed so formulaic it may as well have been written by a computer program designed to churn out a \\"thriller\\". The dialogue is laughably poor (especially the supporting cast, e.g. the cops). I'm still scratching my head and wondering what on earth enticed Clint to direct this, and fine actors like Anjelica Huston to appear in it. It's even more depressing to realize that the screenwriter in question was responsible for one of the best films of the 90s: LA Confidential. How the mighty have fallen."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMBARASSING","review":"I ALMOST DIED WATCHING CLINT EASTWOODS LAST MOVIE, TRUE CRIME,OUT OF BOREDOM, BUT THIS MOVIE HAS TAKEN MY SOUL. WHAT EXACTLY IS CLINT TRYING TO PROVE? THAT WHEN YOU GET OLD, LIFE SUCKS. THAT WHEN YOU HIT 60, EVERYTHING YOU DO IS BORING? I SIMPLY CANT BELIEVE ANYTHING CAN BE AS HIDEOUS AS THIS MOVIE. AS FOR EVERYONE WHO GIVES THIS MOVIE 5 STARS, GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF CLINTS A$$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint, stay away from thrillers","review":"Just avoid this movie. A cheesy plot; horrible acting for the most party. A bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to Be Checked For for a Pulse","review":"For the first time in years I decided to forgo my antipathy toward CE & watch one of his flicks. I actually thought that the lame plot described on the box was the result of poor salesmanship. Also I thought that there would be no trouble finding a good script for a major box office draw like Mr. Eastwood. No such luck.This film is a clunker from stem to stern & the presence of old Clint just scuttles any chance of rising above the script's limitations. I am stunned that such a major presence in Action Cinema would turn in such a paint-by-number episode.I rank this film as neck & neck with Stallone's \\"Cop Land\\" for sheer boredom & paucity of surprises. Not being a fan I'm certain it's the last time I'll look at one of this clowns movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is fascinating; the movie fails it.","review":"I'm a retired attorney. I enjoy crime novels and the movies that bring them to us visually. However, this movie simply is a pain to watch, IF one enjoyed the drama of the book. The book \\"Blood Work\\" is very detailed and the solution to the \\"who done it\\" is very well hidden. I won't bore you with details but if you want to know how the movie compares with the novel, read the review by \\"km southern\\" dated Oct 19, 2004, that is available below. She is right on. The movie has so many flaws that even without having read the book upon which it purports to be based, it is a poor choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Eastwoods best,In-need of a much better script","review":"Kinda a slow movie just talk talk talk and talk and only a 15 min of action in a 2 hour movie, I like Eastwoods acting alough it will remind you very much of Dirty Hairy.I think it would have been more intresting if the killer would have been more like Dr.Lecter (Hannibal) have some sort of tourture and mystery behind it instead of a guy running in and instantly shotting at someone. But cant dwell on our loss's.Rent it I dont think it will be something you should buy, This story should have just stayed a book not have been made into a movie wihtot adding any action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Boring","review":"I bought this DVD and wasted my money. Clint's acting was wooden and I thought he was doing that because of his character's heart transplant. But when the whole cast's acting was the same way, it was pitiful to watch. If anyone couldn't figure out who the killer was after 20 mins plus a crispy creme comercial plus the plot was just a generic serial killer B- movie type."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth","review":"For those of you who have read the book first, Im sorry you had to see this movie.Shall i tell you how it really goes.Terrell McCaleb is approx mid 40's and had a virus which damaged his heart and forced him to retire from the FBI as a serial profiler. HE WAS NOT AN OLD MAN WHO HAD A CORONORY!The book is surperbly written, and was then completely hacked up and filmed. They even put in a different murderer!! What happened to James Noone, the actually murderer..????How dare anyone take a brilliant piece of fiction and destroy the whole story is beyond me.If you like the book - DO NOT WATCH THE FILM."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughably lame script","review":"I have never been a fan of Clint Eastwood, but my friends wanted to get this movie from the video rental store, and it had the encouraging two thumbs up from Ebert and pal, so I gave it a shot. Clint still totes a gun, and still gets the girl, a young Latina, even younger than his real-life wife Dina Ruiz who makes two brief appearances as a TV reporter. The intracacies of the murder plot are fine, though not any better than an average episode of \\"Boomtown\\" or \\"Law and Order,\\" leading up to the usual climactic firearm battle. However, the script gives these poor actors a long list of laughably ridiculous lines which really can't be delivered with any realistic authority. Watch at your own risk, this is bad, bad stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Book","review":"Don't expect Connelly's Blood Work in this movie. The story starts out nearly word for word from Connelly's book, however the Eastwood McCaleb is probably a good 30 years older than Connelly's McCaleb - what a disappointment. I cringed every time I saw Eastwood run or fire a gun. At one point in the movie, McCaleb and cop Winston recklessly blast out all of the windows of a speeding car for no apparent reason and then act as if nothing happened. Huh? Somewhere along the line, the movie diverges drastically from the book to the point where the real murderer turns out to be a completely different character. Too bad so much of the original book was lost in translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Watcher All over Again","review":"I sat and watched this movie only to discover towards the end that it was just The Watcher which stars Keanu Reeves and James Spader. Blood Work's story must have drained the blood from the scriptwriter's head.If you want to watch a better remake of the Watcher watch this movie. But I have to warn you that it's not that much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE...","review":"Since the movie didn't cut to the chase, I'll try to. What an awful waste of time. Exceptionally bad writing (and execution), unbelievable attraction between Wanda and Clint, and overall, and extremely lackluster movie. Don't waste your time on this snoozer...I was generous in giving it one star, but only because I couldn't choose zero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As obvious as a brick in the eye","review":"I wanted to like this movie, so at the beginning I said, \\"Please don't have the Jeff Daniels character turn out to be the killer.\\" Alas, it was to be. Alas, a plot as unimaginative as the wooden persona of Clint's character. Alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer butchers book","review":"Connelly's Blood Work is a pretty good novel, tightly plotted, quick-paced. This movie butchers it, adding nonsensical plot elements and overly wordy dialog.The opening scene is already absurdly cliched, and ruins the atmosphere. Throughout, the dialog, acting, and directing borders on the inept. Veering between pointless additions to the book and overly literal interpretations of key scenes, this movie is unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a terrific film","review":"It is hard to conceive that this film could have been done better. Eastwood is excellent as an actor and as the director. The story is based on a novel by Michael Connelly who is a marvelous writer. The disclosures, little by little, are masterly done. There is no wasted moments. The film moves forward without fluf as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"They ruined the book","review":"I just read the book and it was full of suspense and twists and I loved it.The movie...Ugh.Too many unnecessary changes. The story didn't flow at all. And there was no chemistry between the leads. Very hard to believe they'd start a romance. In fact her whole part was rather cool and unemotional for someone who was trying to find out who killed her sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracking down a killer","review":"Terry McCabe has received a heart transplant. Now he is tracking down the killer of the woman whose heart is beating in his chest. He finds himself up against an old adversary (he finds that you can't be sure that a person is dead unless you have his cold body on a slab in the morgue, and then you might wnat DNA tests to be sure). The story has the usual Clint Eastwoor typd action, using characters out of the Harry Bosch series of novels (although not Harry).I found that the story started out a bit slow, and you have to figure out exactly what is going on. That was the main distraction. You get drawn in once it gets underway. It's an older Clint Eastwood playing an older character, and a good motion picture in its genre.For a sequel to the story (with Harry Bosch back in action) read Michael Connelly's \\"The Narrows.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Piles on the cliches","review":"The innocent black man mistakenly convicted of murder; the last-minute attempt for a reprieve. Been there; done that. All that was needed was a close-up of the telephone at the gas chamber and a close shot of the warden sweating before throwing the switch. Oh wait, we got those too.If you want a nice antidote to these cliches, may I recommend \\"Just Cause,\\" which, although filled with plenty of cliches of its own (including a hysterical flickering-lights-while-the-electric-chair-is-turned-on scene) ends up with an unexpected bad guy and a few innocent bodies to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic plot, stilted acting","review":"I don't know what happened to the plot in this movie, but it certainly seems like some crucial bits of information got lost. Eastwood and De Jesus give performances that are worthy of an amateur theatre group. The leaps of intuition that Eastwood's character takes are beyond belief, while the systematic whittling down of suspects is expected, and of course, the true villain is revealed just before the end, in all his glorious insanity, he has kidnapped De Jesus and her nephew, and uses this to keep Eastwood's character from shooting him. The movie ends with the typical 'good guy chases bad guy around empty, creepy place', with de Jesus getting in her revenge by pushing the dying villain's face under water. Full of bad lines, and worse acting, I would recommend skipping this one. Instead, watch Insomnia with Al Pacino."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly useless","review":"Man, seldom I've witnessed something like this movie, which was supposed to be a \\"thriller\\". Nothing against CLint, much on the contraty: he chose a script and adpated it to his real age,a honest and clever movement.But the trouble is that seldom I've witnessed a thriller where you can DEFINITELY know who is the killer the first time he appears on the screen!! Amazing! SO obvious, so ludicrous! I'll not give his name (Spoil), but I guarantee you'll see it also... Sad...THis made me angry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Blood","review":"This is just another killer-obsessed-with-cop movie; \\"Dirty Harry\\" as an old man with a heart condition. Poor old Clint should really retire from both acting and directing. His voice has grown so low and horse I could barely understand his lines. \\"Blood Work\\" is a flat-out depressing movie to watch and at times horrifically dull. The only thing that kept me awake was my astonishment at how perfectly sappy and overly sentimental the script was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"I read this book as a child and I still remember how much I loved it...which is saying a lot since I am now 32!

He clearly identifies the prime issues with each group and explains those issues very clearly and succinctly. Beyond that though, West falls short. The primary problem with this book, and the reason I only gave it four stars is that there are no solutions to these problems that are clear and concrete.The final reason I only this book four stars is that the majority of the people who need to read this book (i.e. those who produce the variant of hip-hop that West identifies as being nihlists) won't pick it up, and while the book is eloquent, a good chunk of the Americans who should read it, simply won't understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An off target polemic","review":"After enjoying Cornwell West on Bill Maher I was encouraged to buy this book. Unfortunately, I found it to be poorly researched -- essentially West has invented many labels to categorize the current state of affairs -- there is little in the way of empirical data to back up his assertions or recommendations.Secondly, everything comes back to race with West. Race may be his shtick but it isn't the most important lens for evaluating the current state of democracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"0 stars would have been better. Dr. West is obviously a very angry man who lacks a proper dictionary, a working knowledge of free market economics, and a comprehensive understanding of any political system. In short, this book is a laugh riot not to be taken seriously! West does not even mention the ties between capitalism and political freedom which are so well documented by Friedman, Hayek, and others, nor does he mention that his ideal system bears strange resemblence to many dictatorships around the world(Venezuela, Cuba). The simple fact that this book lacks a definition of capitalism before Dr. West attacks it is evidence enough that Dr. West should resign himself to intellectual obscurity. We had to read this book for a diversity class, funny thing was all of the books were written by liberals! How diverse is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"Cornell West is the Shakespeare of our time. His book is unreadable; you need cliff notes and a dictionary to get through it. I can sum up this work in three words \\"Plutocratic Imperial Nihilism\\" translation \\"Rich White Guys are taking over the world and they don't care.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"walking contradiction","review":"how this man has any credibility with anyone i will never know. he makes over 300k a year while bashing capitalims and calling america a racist place. he lives in a neighborhood that has a black population of 2%. why is he here if america is so bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless and second-rate","review":"Intelligent people who read his book will discover for themselves what a second-rate ideologue and empty intellectual suit this man is. I threw the book out after I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuanced and Brilliant","review":"Cornel West's book covers numerous issues that our nation is struggling with today. In a nuanced yet clear fashion he demonstrates the connections and roots between our current problems - of youth depression, religious strife, loss of democratic power and civil society, and much more. He also offers positive visions of how we could begin to heal these wounds to our nation's consciousness. I think this book is one of the most brilliant pieces I have read in ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Democracy does matter, this book does not.","review":"If you love America, then avoid this book. It would seem that yet again we have a book written by a very educated man who fits the quote by Ronald Regan. \\"Liberals are not stupid; they just know so much that isn't so.\\"It would seem that this man sat down to write a book about something that he has no idea about. When he starts with some wild ideas about how the world works and along the way gives no evidence to back up his warped ideas.I do have one nice thing to say about this book. The typesetting was done very well. Unfortunately this is the high point of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"Just as good as I remember Trigun being. If you like Trigun the TV show you will Love Trigun the movie. It has all of the elements that we all loved from the original series."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected of a Trigun Movie","review":"This is a nice little side story in the Trigun Universe. Vash, Meryl, Milly, and Wolfwood all appear in this movie. Like most movies based on series, it doesn't really fit anywhere within the timeline of the series, so the problems that are introduced within the movie are solved in the movie, the new characters introduced in the movie go there own way at the end of the movie and the main characters are pretty much the same at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning. This works well for Trigun, since a lot of episodes from the series are like this also.If your a fan of Trigun looking for something new, I recommend this. If you've never seen Trigun, the series is a better starting place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy for all anime lovers","review":"This is a great DVD.

He really likes anime and he wanted to have the complete collection of Trigun. When I saw the complete series and the movie, which he wanted to see, I bought them immediately. He says that is the best gift ever!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story compared to the series.","review":"I loved the 26 episode series. It has a great mix of comedy and serious story telling. I own all the DVDs and have had many repeat viewings. This movie is pretty dull. There are a few cool Wolfwood action scenes toward the end but Vash kinda sucks in this story. If you've never seen Trigun before, watch the entire series first, don't start with this movie. If your a huge Trigun fan it's still worth watching at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trigun Lives!","review":"Trigun is an amazing balance of comedy and drama spiced with action. Trigun has tons of entertaining humor but there remains an underlining of serious issues. Trigun has a western type feel to it with the addition of some futuristic technology place within it. I watch lots of anime and out of the hundreds that I have seen Trigun stands out for it humor and action. This is worth the money you pay for it.For those of us who have seen the original TV series and liked it, this is a must buy. Nearly as good as the the TV series.For those of you who have not seen the original TV series of Trigun, this movie still offers quite a lot of entertainment and does not require seeing the TV series to understand the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Cookies","review":"My order arrived late and the cookies were not fresh.

The music is soothing, elegant, and intriguing without ever crossing the line into vapid elevator music. While Spanish guitar and Mediterranean influences predominate (in my unschooled musical opinion), Daveed doesn't limit himself to those traditions only and that adds a pleasing element of the unexpected to his compositions. Listening to Daveed makes me exceedingly glad to be blessed with hearing and very sad that there are so many calories in so many of those tapas because I think Daved plus the wine and tapas might even be better than Daveed alone.And for those of you who do the FIRM, track two is the music used for the stretch segment in Lower Body Sculpt 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. *Spoilers Maybe*","review":"This story (as brought out in other reviews) is about a college student enlisted as a government agent...who is then double-crossed by his lover, working for the same people as he.While this story has been done many time before, it was interesting for a first and last time read. The story doesn't really have a middle that goes into depth, we just learn that the main character dislikes his life as a spy, and suddenly he is marked for death; there is no drama, no mystery of who is going to do him in. Moreover, we don't really see the main character change. Sure, he thought he was going to be James Bond, but he 'wants out' since he feels the job is boring; and he only sees 'action' when it is clear he doesn't want to live the life of espionage.I am a fan of 'Powers' and 'Torso' by the same author, Brian Michael Bendis.

You stay with this woman and her son and watch them strive and struggle, and at the end it all seemed fruitless. I was sorry to ever have begun this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Quite simply, this is an overated mess of a novel that says nothing new about a serious issue. The characters are thin, particularly poor little generic Robert and his cardboard cutout friends. The biggest mistake is reading to the end expecting something important will happen - it doesn't. I guess it produced some response because I threw it at the wall promptlly after reading the last miserable page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't tell me what he USED to say - Do something smart!","review":"I get angry at characters who continually do stupid things (such as marrying a man who has hit you, not getting psychological help for your child that you KNOW needs it, or not even explaining Caller ID to your kid, when you're on the run). Because the protaganist was (finally) smart enough to leave, I kept hoping she'd make other good decisions; however, she continued to wallow in the past, and mostly do dumb things, all the way to the end of the book. (I've learned from my friends at the local Women's Shelter that \\"real life\\" stories in this area SOMETIMES have normal, happy endings -- not always, but sometimes, if the woman decides to make healthy choices.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Quindlen at Her Best","review":"Anna Quindlen is truly one of our great talents.

Everyone has faults. If not faults, then at least quirks that make them an individual. I also didn't like the stream of consciousness writing where she would jump to her past then back to the present then remember an incidence with Robert then back to the present. Phew! my head was spinning. I think Quindlen should go back to writing her column...I have both of the collected volumes of her column and I love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written disappointment","review":"Very poor use of grammar.

A typical Oprah favorite - each one's more depressing than the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait for the book to end!","review":"I picked up this book because I have read Oprah's other picks and have been very pleased, but this one was so so boring...... It took me months to finish this book, I dreaded picking it up but wanted to finish it because i spent the money for it. The characters were boring and the whole narrative was repetitive and read like a diary as another reader said. I just couldn't get into this book at all, the only time it was exciting was when I was getting close to the end knowing that I was almost done! Bad pick Oprah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book a lot","review":"I was asked to pick a book for my college class and I saw this book on the reading list. When I was reading the review on the inside of the book I know it was it. It was so breath taking about how she(Fran) had to change evrything and pick up her life with Robert and move. It is so sad how even today there are women out there who have to deal with this sort of situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"The plot was good and the begining was also good but after the first few chapters the story didn't seem so interesting.

I cannot understand what these readers want from a book and how they judge a book as good. Fran/Beth is a true chararacter who acts and thinks like a real person not a MFA candidate or a pain in the butt from Rutgers. I feel that I know and care about the characters in this book--The main character, Fran/Beth is now a part of my life and will stay in my heart. This is what I consider the measure of a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving disturbing and powerful","review":"I read this book in three days. I loved it.I particularly loved the line towards the end of the book that you can't have regrets about a relationship if children were a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change the ending","review":"This was one of the better Oprah selections that I have read. It grabs your interest and you can't put it down. At first you feel sorry for Fran and then you become hopeful that things will turn out well for her and just when it looks like everything is going to work out - there's that ending. It's depressing for Fran to have gone so far and then end up in that situation. It was sad! I passed this book on to some of my coworkers and after quite a bit of discussion, we all agreed - good book, don't like the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"\\"Black and Blue\\" by Anna Quindlen is quite simply put, an amazing book. You're wondering why, and that's what I'm here to tell you. The book deals with Fran Bendetto and her husband Bobby, and their son Robert. After being abused all these years, Fran finally gets fed up and takes Robert with her to another town to start a new life. The end of the book is suprising, because something happens that you'd least expect. I highly reccomend this book to anybody, especially people that have been victims of abuse, because this book has is full of great moral points, and it is very well written to boot. I read this book in one sitting, it was just that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tries too hard to tug on your heart strings","review":"This book starts off with Frances Benedetto explaining why she has to leave her husband. It seems more like a documentary, almost, because of the little dialog. It's attention-grabbing, and keeps you intrigued; it's a great book overall, especially the ending, which is heart wrenching, but this book tries so hard to build you up to that point, to try to tug on your heartstrings and make you cry, that it gets pretty pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the time, but still disappointing","review":"Anna Quindlen's Black and Blue has a dramatic, often quoted beginning that pulls you rapidly into the story line---which is dramatic by the nature of the subject matter.It is compelling to experience the fear of domestic abuse (which Quindlen describes well) but the rest of the story line, character development and the ending are disappointing. Oprah's selections are generally excellent at character development and the best have the supporting characters who help the protagonsits's development; this one doesn't.It's still an important read, compelling in it's sujbect matter, but as a total work, it is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly- quite boring","review":"I can understand that the subject of the book is quite a sensitive one, however I felt the story line was quite slow moving and did not feel the story gripped me until about the last fourth of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"A friend of mine is taking a Criminal Justice class at our university and this was part of the required reading. Sitting in his room one day I picked it up and started reading it. I was immediatly drawn into the text. I could not believe how real the whole story felt. Several times throughout the novel my heart was racing, and I could not put the book down. Quindlen has done a great job in her character development, which places the readers in the shoes of the character. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great read. Just as a warning, it is a hard book to read simply because of the abuse that takes place. It is not for the faint-hearted. (however it is very realistic.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, long winded and pathetically predictable","review":"The title of my review sums it up. Quindlen went all over the map, describing people, emotions and scenarios that were empty. I skipped dozens of pages of yawn-infused diatribe to get to something...anything...that would be interesting. The ending was so predictable it was laughable and an insult to her readers. Not her best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to see I'm not the only one...","review":"Apparently I'm not the only one who found this book to be disappointing. I wanted to feel something ... anything ... for the main character; but after all was said and done, after summoning so much inner strength to take such a courageous step, she simply gave up. And I lost respect for her as a character. Everyone else in my book club raved about the book, but I could not get past the lack of character development, the rambling train-of-thought prose, the predictable plot, and the apathetic ending. It seems as if the author also lost interest in the plot, or maybe she too was disappointed with the turn of events her heroine allowed to occur, but whatever the reason, I found the denoument to be empty, shallow, and deflating. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but I don't think I can really recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book, cardboard characters, predictable","review":"I would never have believed that this book was written by the author of One True Thing. This book does a pretty good job of showing how Fran feels about her husband, but the plot after she leaves him is very weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, emotional, a roller coaster of a novel","review":"It's unusual to find a novel that grips me as this one did. I was unable to put it down, and at the same time afraid to read on. The emotional toll felt like a trade-off for the privilege of reading about these characters. Anna Quindlen is an incredible writer, and the ending of this story left me feeling desolate and hopeful at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK WAS OVER RATED!!!!!!","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I found it to be uterly boring and slow. It kept taking you back to the same events over and over and I didn't enjoy Anna Quindlens writing. I had to make myself finish this one. After watching the Oprah review on this one I rushed to get it thinking that it was going to be a gripping depiction of spousal abuse, but I was not that touched and I felt like it lacked a lot of feeling. Don't get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good!","review":"I have read every book on the Oprah list except Paradise, and have found all of them too be good. I was expecting more out of this novel than i received. It was a wonderful novel, but could have been more.WHen I began reading it I had a hard time getting into it but once i got in it, I couldn't get out. I felt the pain and abuse that \\"Beth,\\" had endured. The ending was a little expected and I was able to figure out most of the book before it happened.NOnetheless i recommend the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising storyline let down by mediocre prose","review":"In a world where one can be judged by the company she keeps, the author makes the catastrophic blunder of creating an uncaring lead character. With prose resembling a 3rd grader's blackboard scrawlings, Ms Quindlen paints a surpisingly unaffecting, as well as uninspiring landscape into the horrific problem of domestic abuse. Conjuring up dark images, with dry underpinnings, may work for those of the narcisistic pursuasion, but is not the most effective way to develop a heroine. What should be a bitter, albeit important lesson in life's hard knocks, turns into an ordeal for the reader, rivaled only by that of the lead character. Even more disturbing is the macabre humor Ms Quinlan attempts to inject into an otherwise dark story. we see two forces at battle here for control of the novel's direction and unfortuanely the less enlightened side won out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener, sad but honest","review":"It felt like it was me going through the whole ordeal of Fran. Very realistic, but I felt it was too quickly condensed towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"The beginning held my attention: an abused housewife starting over with her son. However the mood of the book never went beyond from self pity to hope for the heroine. Read Kiss Mommy Goodbye by Joy Fielding instead. At least the abused housewife had a more fighting instinct in her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quindlen's best","review":"Having loved everything I've ever read (both essays and fiction) by Anna Quindlen, I eagerly picked up this book. While curiosity about how the story would resolve kept me reading, I was very disappointed. I found the narrative repetitive, and the main character wasn't developed enough for me to care about her (and given her horrific experience, I wanted to care about her). When I read \\"One True Thing\\", I really felt that I had lived through the experience; this book made me feel that I was eavesdropping on a not-too-interesting conversation. Note: there were so many irritating typos in the first chapter that I was tempted to just put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious topic, but I really disliked this book.","review":"I do not want to diminish the seriousness of this books subject matter, and I hope a similar story will be told again by a more capable author, but this was a terrible read. The writing style reminded me of the endless essays we had to listen to in Writing 101 back in college, where the professors would try to teach us how to be descriptive. I am convinced that the ability to describe for readers a given situation is an art form that is from nature, not nuture.I know very little about the author, but I hope the Pulitzer she won was for her columns and not her novels. I will be greatly disappointed to know that a masterfully told story like Angela's Ashes, that so deserved the Pulitzer it won for its author, could be sharing the same level of achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche rendering of an important topic","review":"This novel felt like a tired tale, which is unfortunate considering the subject matter. Domestic violence is all too real an occurence for many women in this country, and Quindlen makes light of it by offering bland, uninteresting characters. You don't believe the story, you don't care about the characters, and it doesn't succeed in raising awareness or educating readers about domestic violence.Boring. Not worth the time it took to read. If Oprah hadn't graced it with her name, no one would've bothered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Blue is empowering!","review":"Anna Quindlen is able to spin a captivating tale of a battered woman who runs away from her abuser. Quindlen is talented and entrances the reader in this novel by using elegant descriptions and suspense. I recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey more than Anything","review":"What is striking about this book is that it is far more about the emotional journey of the character than anything else. The plot is simple and uninteresting on its own. This novel is more like a Van Gogh painting of ordinary life. It emphasizes the elements of the characters lives that are, on the surface, nothing, and Quindlen's writing spreads all of the color out of each dull moment. This is not to say that the book is colorful or cheery. It's simply rich and filling. When I picked up this book I couldn't put it down. It's honest and it doesn't need flash or Hollywood style glitz to make it a valuable read. Succumbing to these things would have dumbed down the intelligence of the storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This is well written and not as predictable as one would think. If you have ever lived in a dysfunctional relationship with fear, you will appreciate this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"I want to begin by advising others to be wary of reading the review from Chicago!! The reviewer felt compelled(?) to reveal the ending of the story!! That said, I found this to be a compelling tale. Quindlen at her best(so far...) Days have passed and I can not seem to shake the story or its characters, both mother and son, from my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I have to give the author credit, the book was mostly well-written. For not having been abused herself, she did a decent job describing, without too much gruesome detail, the main character's plight. However, the ending of the book left more questions than answers and I was surprised that she ended it when she did. It wasn't as good as it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Hyped-Up Oprah Loser!","review":"While the story behind this book may be compelling, the manner in which it was written is not. Too bad the author never took an English grammar class.

It really helped me to feel what it is like to be abused"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"Anna Quindlen hit the topic of domestic violence head on. The fear of living the fine line between love and hate, always anticiapating the next blow....what a nightmare! Ms. Qindlen brought to focus what it must really be like to live with a man who gave you the child you adore....a son she so cherished.....and the trauma of being possesed and controlled by a maniac. No wonder so many woman stay in such abusive relationships. An excellant book for anyone who ever said, Why does she stay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The reality of domestic abuse, it can happen to anyone.","review":"This book was excellent!

I just had to know what was going to happen next.I whole heartedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Couldn't put it down!","review":"It's been a long time since I have been able to start a book and not put it down until I finished it. I felt like I was a part of their lives. I wanted to help Fran get away from that monster. As a mother myself, I could not imagine being in that situation with my daughter. Children love their parents so much no matter what they do. To make the decision to run away with your child would be bad enough. Then on top of that, the fear of him finding you. I can't wait to read all the books that Anna Quindlen has written. I hope they're all this good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Inner Thoughts","review":"Like \\"One True Thing\\", Anna Quindlen takes you inside her main character (Fran), revealing in such a real and down-to-earth way her thoughts and reflections on the events that shape her life.

I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did, it was sad. The author jumped back and forth between past and present too much. The ending was sad. Guess that's how life is sometimes...it doesn't always have a tidy way of working out, but I was hoping for more after enduring this boring story. It had trouble holding my attention, but I kept reading waiting for something interesting and maybe even happy to happen. It never did. Sorry if I'm revealing too much of the plot to anyone who hasn't read it, but be warned before investing too much time or money in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is plagerism among popular fiction writers acceptable?","review":"Stephen King did it first: abusive husband, mortal terror, sudden epiphany, protection by a strong group of women, etc, etc. It's called Rose Madder. The detailed beatings are just as graphic/realistic, if that's your cup of tea. As I said, he did it first. He also did it better. However, the day Oprah features Stephen King is the day ALL of our spirits will need healing!! King may venture into the 'woo-woo' territory in Rose Madder, but it's STILL infinitely more entertaining AND thought-provoking than this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for parents","review":"I just finished reading this book last night and went to bed with a huge pit in my stomach. The first section of the book gives you the history of why she needs to get away and how she does it and then it goes into how she manages her new life with her son, but the ending is absolutely horrible. Yes, it some minds it could be called a reality check, but for myself and other parents, it's the unthinkable. I couldn't get this book back to the library fast enough this morning. And I couldn't hug my son enough times before leaving for work. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Waste of time and moneyThis book was good at first. But had such a bad ending and was so disappointing. I liked Anna Quindlen's other book - Object Lessons. But this one is just plain ridiculous. I don't recommend it at all. I'm tired of getting books recommended by you-know-who's Book Club. Some are good, but most are very disappointing. They're all the same sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Unless you are a victim of abuse or expect to be (and who does?) I don't think would be a book you'd like to read. It was informative but I'd call it 'a how to' book not something you'd pick up to read. I wish I had read the reviews first, I wouldn't have bought the book. Just because Oprah selects doesn't mean it will be wonderful, this one wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book deserves a negative rating!","review":"This book is like Stephen King's \\"Rose Madder\\", except poorly written and without most of the excitement. The plot is essentially the same, minus the supernatural elements. I cannot imagine how it made any list, let alone Oprah's, unless no one bothered to finish reading it. It was incredibly predictable, and unimaginably dull. It was hard to even finish. The ending was trite and obviously a ploy to inject some life into a story that was dead from about page 2. It was a total waste of my money. I threw it away, as it was not worthy of shelf space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been reading books on Oprah's book club list and have been quite happy with my choices thus far. Black and Blue, I must say, was very disappointing. I couldn't wait to finish it only to be done with it. I was very disappointed with the ending. I thought Beth had an answering machine AND caller i.d.????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but lacking.","review":"I have read about 70% of the Oprah Book Club Books (more of the early choices than the recent ones). While there are some I dearly love, and some I like but am not quite as enthusiastic about, there has never been one that I just couldn't wait to finish--until now. I had to push myself through the last half of this book to finish it. I found myself not caring about a single character in this book, and I quickly tired of Beth's incessant whining.Now before someone reads this and thinks I obviously know nothing about abuse, let me assure you I do. I grew up in a household where my father beat my mother AND my brother. I am no stranger to abuse, and yes it is a horrible horrible thing. But while Ms. Quindlen may have done a fine job at portraying the horrors of abuse, she failed to make me care anything about the people involved or to pull me into their story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRING!","review":"I picked this up for no particular reason. I saw it in the Bestseller section and figured \\"How bad can it be?\\" Well, pretty bad. Perhaps \\"bad\\" isn't the correct term, since the author writes fairly well. It's just that the story was so slow I felt like I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen to keep me going. Reading shouldn't involve that much work. I liked the characters a lot, but I need more action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Blue","review":"Read it. . . hated it. This book should have been the screenplay for a TV movie. Too predictable, unsatisfying. I can't believe this was given such a high rating by Oprah's Book Club! She must be kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw & Riveting","review":"What a fantastic book! From the moment I started to the very ending I did not put it down. Anna Quindlen weaves a complex tale of an abused woman on the run with child from her abusive husband. The plot starts with her escape and proceeds to show us the beginning of a new life for her provided by an agency that helps out women such as herself. The main character Fran/Beth is sympathetic mainly because she seems to be a real human being with flaws just like the rest of us. Her frustration in building the new life and worrying about her son really hits home. I admire the fact that Ms. Quindlen did not sugar coat any aspect of the book and gave us a realistic view as to what it would be in a relationship so horrific as well as the impact it could have for all involved. Definitely recommended if you have a few hours to spare - this book cannot be read in stages for it is impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener to violence with not-so-great ending","review":"This book was a great eye-opener to the world of domestic violence and abusive relationships by portraying the life of a woman and son in hiding from a wife beating husband. The gradual adjustment to a secretive life and the horrors of such an experience for both mother and child gave the reader a compassionate view of the struggle suffered by battered women. I do, however, have to say that the ending was disappointing and I would have chosen a much different way to end the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"I started reading this book one evening before bed and finished it the next evening. So utterly realistic in every detail and feeling it is hard to believe that it isn't autobiographical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-wrenching...","review":"It is usually my policy to lean away from this type of book and dive into classic literature. A couple days ago, however, my mind just wasn't up to the challenge. So I picked up this book instead, for a change.WOW! Well, it was a change alright. Anna Quindlen's use of the first person really allows you to get right into the story, to feel like you could be Frances Benedetto yourself. I had to stop reading more than once just to reflect on the intensity of the situation. While the style of writing isn't perfect, it works because spousal abuse is far from perfect itself. I cried through the whole last thirty pages or so. This book is accessible to anyone, both young readers and old. It's definitely not a \\"must-have\\" in my books, but it is recommended. It'll turn your insides black and blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow, predictable, unrealistic","review":"Don't buy this book. It took me forever to finish because I didn't care how it ended. You don't feel for the characters. It's so flat and dry. It's so boring, I can't even find words to explain how boring. I was so happy to finish this book, so I could start reading a real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another typical Oprah pick","review":"More abuse, more difficult situations, more broken families, I think the bookclub should move on.

I was riveted by the book, yet a bit turned off by all the descriptive prose that Ms. Quindlen seems to thrive on. However, kudos to her for writing a captivating novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get what all the fuss is about?!?","review":"It took me several months to read this book! I just found it very easy to put down and dreaded picking it back up again. I found myself noticing the writing and the style more than the story. I guess it just never \\"hooked\\" me. It is interesting because I love Alice Hoffman and Anne Rivers Siddons--and their styles have some similarities, but I just don't get why so many people raved about this....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love a book that brings you so intensely into the story!","review":"When I heard that Anna Quindlen had a new novel out, it was like hearing from an old friend. Black & Blue is not only about a battered woman; it is about how women see the world--our loves and joys, our regrets and disappointments. Although my husband loves me very much and has never been abusive, I related to Beth and Cindy and the way they dealt with the blows life handed them. Our humor, friendships, and children are our anchors. They provide us with strength and selfworth and show us ourselves in a way we would not see in our own mirrors. Thank you, Anna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting story","review":"What!I will never allow my husband to beat me up.Frances benedetto, thirthy-six years old woman, ran away just to avoid her husband.She forgets about her nursing diploma to work as a home health aid.This is terrible!she even changes her name, her son name.Beth, the new person, thinks she could have her peace of mind,start her new life.However she has to face her son who asking her for his dad.I am so happy to read sarah Quindlen's book and it will not be the last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"black and blue","review":"this book is a very good book.

I didn't care that her husband beat her and really, she deserved it for being so dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Blue Made Me Blue Too","review":"As painful as being beaten by your husband must be, reading this book about it hurt too. Anna Quindlan harps on and on about the same issues over and over and over again. The woman's new life and the life that she subjects her poor son too are so depressing and bleak that it's hard to see the light. I felt like I was reading a documentary rather than a novel. If the author wanted to get a point across she should have done so through a voice that is less stuck in the past, less self-absorbed, less pathetic really. Finishing this book made me feel black and blue. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convincing, too predictable","review":"This book was a disappointment. While it starts out well enough, in the aftermath of an abusive marriage, it never fulfills its promise or even comes close. The ending was predictable, and her new marriage and relationships were not well defined. The last few chapters reminded me of a firecracker that just fizzled oout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oma","review":"I just finished this book and must say was quite disappointed. It's predictable, long and drawn out. There is not much substance to any character and really no message. The story would have been ok as a magazine article but much much too long for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably One of the Most Depressing Books I've Read","review":"Thankfully, this book is short. If you are interested in battered women, divorce and upheaval, then this is the book for you. I found the book depressing and sort of going no where. This lady never seems to get herself together and is constantly running from something. Maybe I just didn't get it, but maybe you won't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"pulls on your heart-strings","review":"This is an excellent book, and a very quick and easy read. This is a page turner, and too easy to relate to for too many women. This story will bring tears to your eyes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Blue","review":"To predictable and very anti-climatic. The charactars are not that interesting and very \\"fit the moldish.\\" The stereotypical wife-beater mold was nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a terrible book!!","review":"If I could give this book a negative rating, I would give -10. I think \\"Black and Blue\\" might be the most terriblebook I have read in several years. I expected so much that I read till the end.(Kudo to my patience!!)OMG. What a disappointing ending!! What was the author thinking? Were you drunk, Anna Quindlen?You know how excited I was when I picked up your book? I regret reading your book.I really don't understand you. with your weak character development, ridiculous ending, and incohesive plot, Youturned a grand topic- domestic violence/abuse into a boring, predictable disaster.Ladies and gentlemen (Boys and girls) Don't waste your precious time in this book. If you are a person with limitedpatience and some anger issue, don't even look at this book. You might end up punching your wall. I mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photorealism","review":"Reads like a thriller, keeping you on the edge of your seat all the way, but unfortunately, this story is a daily reality in too many families and relationships. What impressed me was the way Quindlen dealt with the frequently asked question of why the abused person doesnt just leave. Because they may become fugitives, afraid for their lives every minute, because they cant ever lead a normal life, because the abuser is likely to stalk and trace them and do further harm, including killing them. In this story the abusive husband was part of the legal system: a police officer. The system sides with the abuser and the spouse has nowhere to turn. I agree with another reviewer that this story should be told more often. Two others with similar plots are Sleeping With the Enemy and Whispers (by Belva Plain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it-probably will become a bad movie on Lifetime","review":"What a disappointment! Both this and \\"The Deep End of the Ocean\\" just rehash old stories. Worse, there is no unique point of view, no stellar writing, or anything to hold the readers attention. It's NOT the WORST book ever written, but its hardly worth the effort. The message is important, but the plot leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, for an old story . . .","review":"This type of story is almost overused, but Quindlen depicts abusive relationships in a way that isn't stale or cliche. Very suspenseful in places, with an appropriate sad ending. If there was a happy ending, it wouldn't be as good. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"intense","review":"an amazing book about a woman and her child escaping an abusive home....shocking ending left me crying....this book isn't for everyone....it can tug at your heart if you have ever gone through anything like what the book is about. A mother's love to keep her son safe from a horribly abusive husband....it's not a happy read because it's about a subject that's intense and not something to cheer about. But it's a glimpse into the reality of what some mothers and women face when confronted with abuse.I really love Fran's character...So strong...but doesn't know it! The story is about how she leaves her abusive cop husband and begins to make a new life and a new identity with her little boy...and she also begins to learn how to trust and love again....but wow...what a shocking ending! The book was so gripping and intense...but to leave it like that?? Don't know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction or Real Life?","review":"I found this novel to smack heavily of realism and it kept me coming back for more. I hardly put it down while I was reading it. Anna Quindlen's novel of this abused woman and her struggles to start a new life seemed all too real to me and hit all too close to home with her vivid descriptions of the suffering Fran Benedetto endured at the hands of her policeman husband. I've seen too many of my friends go through some of these same situations not to recognize how closely art imitates life in this novel. Ms. Quindlen has brought her characters to life for me with her colorful descriptions of their struggles to over come all the adversities they've faced through their life. I never felt as though her characters couldn't have been real people that I might come in contact with everyday. I find myself wanted to read more of her work to see if I would enjoy them half as much as I enjoyed reading \\"Black and Blue\\". I would highly recommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anna Quindlen could have written this story in 50 pages.","review":"The story seems interesting, but the author goes on, and on. I did not enjoy the extra information at all. Most of the book is fluff that is very repetitive and pointless. Wally Lamb adds background info to his characters, but I cared about them and the info. was relevant to the story. It had about 2 exciting points, the rest put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know I should give this a positive review .. but ...","review":"give me a break, what a short sighted and basically unlikable protaganist. I mean this girl, yes she may have suffered an abusive relationship, but, she looks down on the people that want to help her AND worst of all really expresses a doubt that when her son grows up and beats his wife, well, she won't really care since it's been done to her.Some people interpret this as tragic, I interpret this as stupid, shallow and with no redeeming grace. I mean why write about her 'that bites the hand' that feeds her mentality... I have never read an Oprah's book club selection before ... well ... nuff said !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED this book!!!","review":"What a lousy read! I expected so much from it; I'm a regular IMUS listener --- and for some unknown reason, he promoted the hell out of it. Well, it was a terrible book. I couldn't wait for it to end. Agony! The book is a feminist take on a tragic topic. Liberal themes abound. But beyond all else, it is terribly written! Quindlen may have been a fine newspaper writer --- may still be --- but I for one will NEVER read her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"women that are abused","review":"I was aware that woman are abused but not to the extent that this bookenlightned me. It is a very real problem in todays world and should be addressed. I can understand why Oprah picked this for her book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough subject; easy read","review":"I liked the style of writing; it was an involving story. Fran is very sympathetic. However, I always felt at an arms length from the characters, not much depth. I would have liked to have had a persepective of the other victims and of the abuser. Also, the reflections got a bit repetitive. Story had a 'surprise' ending...for me anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I love Quindlen's novels too...","review":"I cried the day Anna Quindlen gave up her op-ed column in the New York Times because her essays were my absolute favorite things to read. When she came out with her first novel, I read it eagerly only to be dissapointed. One True Thing was better. But Black and Blue made me feel the same way I felt when reading her essays...enthralled, emotional, believing. This is a great book, wether you're a Quindlen fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troubling topic, familiar voice","review":"Anna Quindlen tackles the subject of domestic violence with sensitivity and intelligence. Couple this with her Pulitzer Prize winning style and you have a book that grabs you and pulls you into the maelstrom that is Fran Benedetto's life. For the reader who is uneducated in the area of domestic violence, the character of Fran brings to life the ambivalent emotions that beset abuse victims. Minor problems that detract somewhat from the book's impact are a confusing time-line of events and the fact that the wonderful visual imagery that Quindlen creates serves more to embellish the setting for a particular scene than to strengthen its emotional value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who was abusing whom?","review":"This is quite possibly the most depressing book I've ever read, mostly because I know that it's written about a life that many women lead. I am disturbed by the fact that Fran seems to calmly accept her beatings, all the while dreaming about Bobby's wonderfully buff \\"bod\\". She cannot seem to accept, even at the end, that Bobby is evil incarnate and he would be very likely to kill her just to punish her for not opening his beer. The person I feel the most sorry for in the book is Fran/Beth's second husband, Mike. I wonder just how often, when she is making love to Mike, she is fantasizing about Bobby. The part of the book that really got to me was how Fran/Beth tries to save her son from his father because she thinks he needs saving. Robert never really accepted what was going on with his mother and always wanted to be with his Dad more. The book never tells us what happens between Bobby and Robert, but we can only hope that Bobby doesn't use Robert as a substitute for Fran."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable,after initial stirring opening book becomes dull","review":"Book grabs reader in the beginning as mother and son go into a sort of \\"witness protection program for abused wives.\\" However, the story then gets duller and duller and more or less predictable, with a contrived ending to gain reader's sympathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EYE FOR AN EYE","review":"THIS BOOK BRINGS BACK THE OLD BIBLICAL IDEA OF AN EYE FOR AN EYE.INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY OUR ABUSED WIFE AND MOTHER SHOULD HAVE KILLED THE BUM-IN SELF DEFENSE.WOULD A JURY HAVE CONVICTED HER?THEN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE ALWAYS LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER-THIS BOOK REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY(YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO MR WONDERFUL IN THE END?

Issues like domestic abuse are (many times) either trivialized or exploited for plot development (remember \\"Sleeping With The Enemy..?)The main character (Beth) and her plight are written so believably that one can easily imagine a friend or relative going through the same ordeal and reacting the same way. More importantly, the ending is (unfortunately) more plausible and realistic than the contrived ones that we've been force fed for too long.Although I take issue with the term \\"chick book\\" (or \\"chick flick\\"), I do feel that women will take away more from this story than men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really like the book very much.","review":"I read this book because of the Oprah Book Club recommendation.

However, after reading the book, I found this not the be the case.I thought the basic story was very good. I was horrified most of the time and I am sure this was the plan.

The two, under the help of a battered wives agency, flee to Florida and try to start new lives with new names and new appearances. But Fran's husband is a smart man. And he will stop at nothing to find her and take back what he thinks is his.A truly extraordinary author, Anna Quindlen chronicles on womans journey into the unthinkable. The characters are terrificly strong and believable. The ending is so heartbreaking and terrifying that you wonder-and know that this can really happen. This is a masterpiece, an important book that should be read and learned from. Anna Quindlen will live on through the face of literature and will be read and loved in years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story","review":"This is a sad story, very well written, about the not so popular and still quite taboo subject of domestic violence. Quindlen tackles it beautifully, with a lot of humility and her writing reflects the conflicts in the main character's feelings of uncertainty, fear and absolut need of breaking free. This amazing story will make you hurt and cry, but it is so well worth it. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Blue - an Overview","review":"I found this book to be a more than interesting insight to the plight of abused women. The appreciation I feel, being in a healthy loving retlationship, still makes my stomach clench with the not-too-descriptive details of abuse within the book. I saw, more than the focus on abuse, the ability for someone to overcome the physical and emotional odds, and continue on in life. Continue on with hope, love and even fear. I also admired the author's insight at what individuals make of their own lives - including re-creating much needed relationships and bonds, with entirely different people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Anna Quindlen book","review":"I've read most of Quindlen's book and have been a little disappointed every time. This was no acception. The characters are your typical stereotypes of Italian/Irish/Catholic New Yorkers, the circumstances are uncreative, and the story lines tend to drag on as you suffer through constant repition of the character's thoughts over and over again. As several people have already mentioned, the editing was quite poor in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How depressing.","review":"A story about an abused wife who runs away with her kid, assumes a new identity and moves into a drab apartment in a boring nowhere town in Florida, starts a boring relationship with a boring guy.

Like, why did Bobby have to be a \\"dark, brooding, Italian,\\" why couldn't he be the All-American type; some of them beat their wives. Then there's the accident at the carnival and she happens to appear on TV. And why, why do female characters always have to find some new man to help them \\"forget the past and start a new life?!!\\" I can see if this were a Danielle Steele novel or some Movie-of-the-Week.

The book was written after many years of psychotherapy with the young Jung, and reflects (symbolically) the inner turmoils of Hesse's struggle and his own personal growth.

As a child I was enchanted by the beauty and wonder these stories inspired.

I figured that the wagon would be about as big as the two smallest flower pots I have seen. Well, when it arrived I was baffled. Those flower pots must have been from a doll house. The actual item is about 1 inch but 2.5 inches. I was very disappointed. I paid the price of $7 (I notice it is now $3.50, a more appropriate price since it is about the size of a match box car), and then paid almost $10 in shipping. If I send it back I'm sure I'm still on the hook for the shipping PLUS a 20% restocking fee. I would not order this item unless I wanted it for a doll house.

Worse though, the material used for the connector tubing, the part that is colored, it has a terrible odor that has not gone away with time.

Even to the point that she tried to bullishly pressure another woman into not going public when that woman had been raped by the (then) Governor - all because it could mean an end to both Bill's <therefore> her ambitions for power.I believe the author's purpose in detailing Hillary's lack of hygiene, choice in associates, and hardcore/self-deserving attitude was to explain that they were (are) assoicated tell-tale signs/symptoms of a greater evil plaguing the former First Lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Rubbish","review":"This book is complete trash. It references incidents (Clinton getting a haircut on Airforce One that caused delays at LAX) that have proven to be false by all reputable journalists (NY Times).I listened to Ed Klein get interviewed about this book and he got clobbered.

The last thing anyone wants to do is buy a supposed fact-based book from someone with no integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash for Cash","review":"If Ed Klein's sourcing in this book was professional, he could put himself in Kitty Kelley's league. But since he hasn't managed to meet even the weakest journalistic standards of two verifiable sources (Kelley uses three), the title of this review says it all. You've heard it all, seen it all and read it all about Hillary Clinton before.Yes, she's ambitious. Sure, she can be ruthless. You bet, she has gall! These are all qualities that are admired in men and villifed in women. If you want to read criticism of Hillary Clinton, at least get it from Peggy Noonan's books, or Barbara Olson's books. Surely, Ann Coulter will be coming out with something before 2008.

She has a lot of negatives -- not a damn one of which was mentioned in this book.This book is so full of lies, inaccuracies and innuendo that even the conservative echo chamber has, for the most part, panned it. There is nothing new here, every scrap of this brain dead drivel has been published in other, BETTER, books and articles.

This book is a great resource of how NOT to live your life. Negative examples are just as powerful a teacher as the positive ones, sometimes moreso. On the playground I see how children gravitate toward the mean kids, just because it's easier to be their friend than their enemy. Perhaps this is the situation here. Hillary is the meanest kid on the block, and the weak ones, out of fear, are catering to her every whim and need. Queen Bee Hillary, and the Wannabees.

But entertainning too.","review":"I got this book because I am not a big fan of Hilary, and my Fiance is a big Fan of Hilary.From what the author protrait of Hilary Clinton, it didn't make me dislike her more or less, but it gives a little more reasoning why she behaved the way she did. I guess you can call that clarification. There are a few parts that I actually find quite amusing, as someone described our former President as a Golden Retriver that behaved badly.However, after showing only a few lines of the book to my Fiance, he said he is not as fond of Hilary anymore. I don't think the book is a defamation, I think it is more of a gossip. I don't think the book is of any harm to Senator, even though I will not be voting for her in 06' or '08.

For I've never known a man who could be so catty. It is like this : the facts are one thing, a slant is how you present them. A man with a positive slant would write : Hillary stood by Bill's side, beaming at him in obvious pride . A man with a negative slant would write : Hillary stood reluctantly by Bill's side, smiling nonetheless. Now a catty woman (or Ed Klein would write) : Hillary, dressed in a lavender two-piece suit that obviously was meant to make her eyes look more radiant (but only ended up accentuating her heavy legs), fidgeted at Bill's side, trying to smile as she had been told but ending up looking like the Frost Queen she really was.

What are the standards of a publisher that doesn't require fact checking, especially about someone who is a senator? This book deserves a huge libel suit and not much else. It's a thinly disguised hack job by someone who obviously got paid by the Right to put out any dirt on Hilary he could find, even if he had to lie about it. Remember David Brock? He was hired to do the same thing and couldn't find anything, so that's when he turned into a liberal and now runs Mediamatters.org. Even Conservatives are bashing this one.

I learned enough facts, (that I already suspected) to not EVER vote for this person. She only cares for the people to get the vote to be President. Once voted in office, then it's all about her. She has the love for power that is unprecedented in American history. The author backs up everything he writes with interviews and publications, so the reader can be certain they are reading a factual account.

Hillary is not a nice person. It is disgusting how our government, which is supposed to be comprised of \\"our country's leaders\\", can turn their eye from this immoral behaviour by our very top official and his wife. She may not have had an affair but she sure did know about it and tried to appear as the unsuspecting wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Crap","review":"If you think this is factual, you're either a right wing nut or an idiot. Come to think of it, that's the same thing. This book is so poorly researched it's fiction. Totally designed to cater to the prejudices of the ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID the audio!","review":"Authors should rarely read their own works (Myla Goldberg's \\"Bee Season\\" is a very rare exception). It may be unkind, but Mr. Klein pretty much drones his way through this one. That having been said, it is a worthwhile read (in print!) along with Dick Morris's book. Between them, the reader gets hit-over-the-head with the pattern of Hillary's behavior, her sense of entitlement, that she is \\"owed\\" not just by Bill, but by society in general.I was put off by Klein's habit of speaking from inside the head of Hillary, her family and friends. However, for those who say it's just a re-hash of \\"allegations\\" - there is SO MUCH circumstantial evidence around the Clintons that can't be discounted altogether. Think patterns, not isolated incidents with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good, Easy Read","review":"Most of the reviews here seem to be more a vote on Hillary rather than a review of the book. I'll try to avoid that.The book is an easy read, and is, in my view, well written. The photos alone are worth a look (especially her and former President Clinton's dating years), and the writing is concise and easily understood.There isn't much \\"news\\" provided--most every fact is a recitation of other documented sources (as attested to by the hundreds of footnotes). But having the whole story of an ambitious woman rise, fall, rise, fall, and try to rise again compiled in one source made the story easier to follow. I was fascinated by the number of daliances of our former president that were documented in the volume. I was also intrigued by Hillary's reactions (or non-reactions) to them.I'm glad I bought it, and found it an interesting book. It didn't change my political views much, but it made it easier to understand what makes the woman tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Journalism","review":"Edward Klein is getting rich off of \\"shoddy journalism.\\" Anyone who reads this book and takes the opinion that it's a good read or he did his homework and research on Hillary Clinton is a fool. It may contain entertainment purposes for some, but it's only pure garbage. The only reason why this book is selling is not because Edward Klein's name is on it, but because some writer's and journalists find it imperative to attack a woman who has a very good chance of being our first female American President; not to mention the huge profit factor involved for Klein and the publisher (s).I completely disagree with this book and the \\"facts\\" (if you can call them that) in this book. Poor writing, deceptive research, plagiarized and just an insult to anyone with an ounce of intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Klein???","review":"At one time Klein was a real journalist/writer doing credible work, but this, this is re-hashed stuff from other books (mostly already discredited) and his new stuff is pure speculation. Are we suppose to believe Clinton is a lesbian because she knows lesbians? or went to a school that some lesbians go to? The stupid neocons aren't even trying anymore to dig up dirt on Clinton. Someone must have driven a dumptruck load of money to Klein's driveway to get him to do this piece of shabby research and gossip. I expect this tripe from Kitty Kelly, but I never would have thought Klein would take the money and run. But alas, he's a sellout too. Klein offers up proof that there is no credibilty left in his pen, just another hack writer looking to score on a silly made up story book for haters of Clinton, who'll believe anything, if it's bad, about the woman. So go ahead Hillary haters, spend your money on this fiction and become absolute suckers. The joke's STILL on you. You just don't get it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is about neither the truth nor Hillary...","review":"Not a big Hillary fan but this book was written for one purpose; to make Mr. Klein a pile of money. Unless you're a foaming-at-the-mouth neocon, don't waste your money. This book is poorly written and there's nothing new here. Even if you are a neocon, I'd suggest that you wait about three months.

I DID read this book, as much as I could stomach, at our local library, and am appalled that a reputable publisher would give credibility to such trash. Not only is the book poorly researched and written, many allegations in this book have been investigated and found to be untrue. Sadly, this is probably only the first of many such books designed to scare ignorant Americans about the future of one of our great leaders. Hillary, brush off this attack as you would a nasty, blood-thirsty flea from a dirty dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes One to Know One....","review":"Hmmmm....Klein spends the majority of the book speculating about the sexuality of the subject, as if it is terribly relevant-- or as if anyone cares. What, she is responsible for her husband being a whore? Ohhhhh, questionable financial and fundraising practices. Big \\"revelation\\"! HELLO. This is PAC-land and find me a politician who ISN'T engaging in at least questionable or shady fundraising (if not technically illegal practices). It is built into the system and if you don't engage in it, you won't be elected. The author rips on her for her lack of taste and for her decorating. Sounds like the rantings of a biased 'mo with overarched eyebrows and too much makeup to me. Which you will see in his picture on the interior sleeve. Methinks the \\"lady\\" doth protest too much. And yes, I read the book, cover to cover. And yes, the irony of my criticizing the author on superficial qualities is intentional, but if it is good enough for the goose...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give this \\"0\\" stars?","review":"What a colossal waste of time it was to try reading this trash. I've read other books by Klein and I always thought he was a smart but gossipy yenta. This book confirms that he is a liar too. I struggled to get through page 131 before I just HAD to stop. I'm ana avid reader of diverse points of view. I read the National Review and the New Republic among the many politcal journals and blogs. I'm not a fan of Hillary...and I never thought I'd vote for her... but she IS looking better all the time and I'm beginning to believe there IS and WAS a conspiracy to bring down both Clintons.

(And this wasn't written by a member of the GOP!) Ed Klein has taken great care to cite numerous sources and give a \\"clear\\" and \\"total\\" view of Hillary. So, if you've wondered how on earth this \\"intelligent\\" woman could not know what was going on with her husband - for many, many, years, let alone with Monica - and if your own intelligence was insulted by her claims of \\"knowing nothing\\" (in her own book) sit down and find out about the \\"real Hillary.\\" No \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" indicated here - and Hillary KNEW IT!I, for one, wanted to know just why the Hillary camp was protesting so much.

I am only sorry that I had to click one star...it deserves none at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tunnel Vision for Republicans","review":"A book for people who don't like the headlines they are seeing lately (a little thing called reality) and need to turn to fiction for validation on issues they have with their own feelings of misogyny. Mr. Klein should write a book about how the war in Iraq is really going great and all the missing WMD were really refurbished into schools for Iraqi children because a mere trace of their existence would have been too scary for Americans. Just think of how many people he would make feel better about their decisions.***Oh yeah, I didn't actually read this book (boo hoo, what a biased travesty!). I prefer non-fictional reading, like the Downing Street memo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Political Innoculation of Hillary","review":"The author's evidence is so weak that this book must be an attempt to politically innoculate Hillary prior to 2008: get out all the dirty laundry now so it's old news come the election. Hillary can then again claim victimhood status. This book has everything you've heard and more, making it a complete innoculation.Two stars for mindless-entertainment value, though it's perfect for raising the blood pressures of die-hard Hillary lovers and Hillary bashers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogynistic, Homophobic, and Untruthful - I Pity You Who Believe Ed Klein","review":"It's funny how easilly we (the American public) accept things as fact just because they show up in print.

Check your facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"I have a difficult time giving this publication even one star. I try to read both sides of an issue or an individual, but this book was so poorly documented and written, and so blatantly partisan, it tends to close ones mind to its content.I hope that in the future this author will try to be more objective and control his intense personal dislike for Hillary Clinton or anyone else he chooses to write about, for the sake of his own credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad for you chumps","review":"This book is terrible.

While reading this book, I decided to do some of my own research to verify the facts, and believe me, just about everything was wrong, or out of date!

If confirming that Hillary likes decaf and didn't shave her legs in college is worth plowing through over 300 pages of rehashed 1990's-era trivia, this is the book for you. Be forewarned though - it's not even well-written.There's a certain type of person who will buy anything derogatory about one side or the other of the political spectrum. They have more time and money than brains apparently, and there's no hope for them. For those of us who have some literary and factual standards regardless of our political leanings, this book doesn't make the cut.

Klein purposely leaves out critical points of information to prove points that are simply not true.

This book belong in the humor section of any book store, or better yet, the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's Obsession With Lesbians -- Pathetic","review":"Edward Klein must have some strange preoccupation with lesbians: throughout this book he frantically obsesses about the sexual preferences of Wellesley students in 1968; the sexual preferences of Hillary's friends; the sexual preferences of her White House staff; and of course, Hillary's own sexual preferences. This made for an excruciating read as the book revealed far more about the author than it ever could about Hillary.Other parts of the book were relegated to hearsay, rumors, and as many feminist pejoratives as this man's little brain could conjure up. Don't waste your time with this poorly written, prurient invective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important read before 2008","review":"I much preferred \\"Rewriting History\\" by Dick Morris since he was a Clinton confidant for 20 years and knows Hillary better than Mr. Klein. Klein also showed me that he did not research so well - had her going to South Main HS when I know it was Maine South HS. This makes me wonder how much is factual and how much is prejudice. He does show her to be what I expected her to be, but it really was not until I noted that Dick Morris also presented many of the same stories that I thought this book was also useful. If you are a hardened conservative who just wants to hate Hillary and who doesn't care about facts when spewing vitriol - a la the left wing fanatics - you will love this book. If you want to feel secure that you are being told the truth, read \\"Rewriting History\\" by Dick Morris.

What this actually is is a tepid rehash of other Hillary books. She likes power. She wants to be president. Her respect for the truth is shaky. She looks the other way when it comes to Bill's adultery. She started out as a radical liberal and is moving to the center for political reasons. She has had rumors dog her that she may be gay. Nothing new here. And that is the gist of the book. No bombshells. No new revelations. Since I already thought that Hillary was a values empty yuppie who lusted to be president at any cost, this book did not offer me anything new. I feel that I fell for the hype when I preordered this with overnight shipping. I think I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about Hillary","review":"At last a book that tells the truth.

Anyone with an open mind can read this story for themselves and make there own judgment on who's telling the truth and who has a long history of false claims, corruption and deceitfulness.

If you are a rabid Clinton hater and you need something to satiate your irrational obsession, be warned that there is absolutely nothing new here, and certainly very little that can be considered factual.

At least one of the sources whom he cites, Michael Tomasky, has noted that Klein excised part of an article by Tomasky from a quotation, in an effort to make former Sen.

It certainly reinforces my own hope to see her in the White House as its first female President."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Tripe!","review":"Edward Klein is a desperate man who just wants to make money and unfortunately the republican party has fallen hard for this tactic. Obviously this man is more intrested in selling controversial material more then writing something of artistic merit. I think this Book is a tragedy and it shames the political process. This book is nothing more then Garbage from an author who is out there looking out for himself and not for the good of the country. Look, I am going to review each book here fairly and honestly this book is garbage. After what Mr. Bush has done to the United States after many years. No one and definitely not Edward Klein would convince me that Hillary Clinton is more dangerous then the man we have now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edward Klein is a HACK!!!!!!","review":"If you want to read comedy, and not a biography about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, please read Klein's book! After reading more than half of it, I couldn't suffer through it any longer. Klein writes for a second-grade audience. He repeats over-used buzzwords, like, \\"far left,\\" \\"left wing,\\" radical liberal\\" to describe Senator Clinton. He also favors the words,\\"lesbian,\\" \\"asexual,\\" etc. Query: How can one be \\"asexual\\" and a \\"lesbian\\"? And, how can a woman give birth to a child and be \\"asexual\\"? Help me, now! So,... Senator Clinton is ambitious; intelligent; and cares more about politics, and her and her husband's careers more than hair and makeup. Does that make her less of a woman? NO!!!! It makes her..... my favorite candidate for the U.S. President in 2008!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"What an incredible disappointment! This book really is junk. Save your money and go to the library if you want to read it. This is just a bunch of junk that intelligent people wouldn't be interested in and 'scandals' that have long ago been debunked. Unbelievably heavily footnoted, it appears that the author is just slapping together snippets from other sources just to compile something for the purpose of making a quick buck from the Hillary haters who will part with their money for anything as long as it bashes her.As I say, I recommend saving your money and go to the library if you really want to read this. I guarantee, if your local library has been foolish enough to put this on their shelves, it will be readily available for you. Most people won't even finish reading it before returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Haven't Read The Book, But From The Title It Sounds Mean And Bad-Natured","review":"All my life, I have respected and agreed with Hilary Clinton. Bill Clinton was one of my favorite presidents (Jimmy Carter, Abe Lincoln, etc). When I read the cover for this book, it really sounded like an insult, not just an opinion. I read the back, which said something about how Hilary acted like she cared but really didn't, and that she had an evil scheme to make herself powerful. I know the author/s of this book have their opinions about certain people. But I don't think they need to go around telling people what a bad person she is. I think that books should be about positive things, not negative things. Although the author feels deep resent for Hilary Clinton, he needs to mind his own business. After all, people are people, no matter what their opinions are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book of quotations","review":"My my my, Mr. Klein can stretch his imagination further than a used condom. This \\"book\\" or more apparently a collection of suggestions from the rightwing echo chamber puts forth the contention that feminism, or most any belief that females are of equivalent intellectual status with men, springs from Hillary's alma mater, a supposed hotbed of lesbianism, a concept clearly invented in the overheated brain of some adolescent boy deprived of the use of both hands. The fantastic recycling of other people's \\"facts\\" apparent in the footnotes fails to promote a single original insight into the woman or the ideas she champions. Misogynistic garbage is being foisted upon the reading public by Penguin's massive lapse of editorial oversight in allowing this tittilating collection of lies, supposition and prurient design through its presses."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Right Wing Drivel","review":"More garbage from the VRWC. I managed to listen to this muck raker on the Hannity Show when he drudged up some old story about Bill Clinton selling tainted blood to Canada from the Arkansas prison system when he was governor. Of course, Hillary was behind it too, but he never explained how. Of course, frantic righties called in asking \\"what he found out about Vince Foster\\" (hint: Hillary whacked him). He was smart enough to stay away from that one. What did Hillary know and when did she know it? Who cares. To all rightwing nutjobs: please waste your money on this garbage. This trash work gets a big \\"10\\" on the rightwing orgasm chart. To normal people, its not even good for wrapping fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillary","review":"This book just makes me want to vote for Hillary more in 2008.

However the actual text of this book contains far from it. While I did learn more about Hillary than I previously knew, I found very little to justify the title of this book, which deceives the reader into believing this will be more than just a rehashing of things that the media has already cited. In fact, the majority of this book deals with the Lewinsky scandal, which by now bores me to tears.The book is somewhat well-written, however the best writing in the world can't cover up for a lack of good content. It seems like Klein decided to jump on the \\"shocking political tell-alls\\" bandwagon and release this book, which is anything but \\"tell-all.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Character Assassination and Egregious Lies","review":"There are myriad examples of stale gossip and discounted lies that are treated as fact in this book. I recommend both Joe Conason's and Peggy Noonan's rebuttals to this book to all those readers interested in how truth and genuine journalistic ethics played no part in the authorship of this tome.Ed Klein is a media whore and a professional \\"Clinton hater\\" who will use any tactic, twist any truth, to sell more books.This exercise has the same redolent effect as the earlier \\"Swift Boat\\" book..it is character assassination, plain and simple, motivated by a perverse greed and rapacious mandacity.This book has been rebuked and debunked by both liberals and conservatives alike. It serves no other purpose than to fatten Klein's bank acccount at the expense of truth and simple human decency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treatise on Hate","review":"If you want to learn about all of the ways that you can criticise another person, deserved or not, please read this book. The author criticizes Hillary for sleeping, for not sleeping enough and for sleeping too much. He criticizes her for being too sexual and not sexual enought. It is crazy! He occasionally mentions her politics.I voted for O'Bama, but Hillary is an incredible person. It is bizzare to criticise her for being a person and sleeping! All of the rest is equally as illogical and self-contradictory.It is nothing but treatise on hate which is necessarily illogical."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"I am an avid reader of books on political figures on either side of the isle. I have to say this is one of the most poorly written and researched books in this genre; and it's an embarassment to the right. The strident and superior tone may be considered a giveaway to the fear that some may have regarding a Hillary Clinton run in 2006. Most of the issues highlighted, even if they had merit, were overshadowed by the overt misrepresentation of 'facts', many of which had only vague support. At least the book was a gift, and I didn't have to spend money on this one~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book ever written.","review":"Riddled with factual errors and blatant lies; this is hardcore porn for the average right-wing extremist ONLY.

But by page 22 she had a torrid affair with Vince Foster. So which is it? This book is so full of unsubstantiated rumors and out right lies the answer is obvious - neither.In other interviews, Mr. Klein has described himself as an author of popular non-fiction and has stated his goal is to sell books to make money.A cottage industry is springing up on the internet debunking his lies. This book is not worth your time unless your goal is to be an uninformed, rabid Hillary hater. You can do that with a lot less mental exertion by watching Fox News."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Move it to the Fiction Shelves whenever I'm in a bookstore","review":"The only difference between Penthouse Forum and Kleins rag of a book is that neocons more rabidly use the latter for jacking material. Klein has been proven to be a money grubbing shill for the right wing and has admitted as much. But keeping up the pretense that this is a book of 'non-fiction' and not merely a money making scheme for Klein is simply revolting. It is poorly researched, rehashed fictions designed to maintain the polarization of this country and make Ed Klein a buck. This thing has been vilified by even Hannity and OReilly. Flies linger on dogshi+ because they are tired and feel dirty from having landed on Kleins 'book'.I urge you to move this book to the fiction shelves whenever you see it in a bookstore, or recommend to the employees that they do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many inaccuracies to be credible.","review":"The quality of the writing and \\"storytelling\\" aside, this book cannot be taken seriously due to so many easily checked errors.

This made for an excruciating read as the book revealed far more about the author than it ever could about Hillary.Other parts of the book were relegated to hearsay, rumors, and as many feminist pejoratives as this man's little brain could conjure up.

If you have ANY moral fiber of what America use to be then don't bother to read it.But you ask,,,,why did i read it? My answer is i read parts of it in the book store because of all the publisity and from what i had heard other non-trash throwing people.

Sadly, there is the America of the haters and this book is a good example of that America.I don't know Mr. Klein but I do know that when someone sets out to write about a subject, that person researches the subject matter.

Some results of more mathematical sofisticated nature are adressed to \\"Int to Spectral Theory. With Applications to Schrodinger Operators\\", by P. Hilsopand I. Sigal.In this way some of the main ideas of Quantum Mechanics are explained in this text in a clear way for someone with a mathematicalmind. It is apropriate for a person that does not knowwellthe physics of Quantum Mechanics.I believe any mathematician with some background in Functional Analysis and some basic knowledge of Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Analysis will enjoy this book.There is some other books in the subject which contains all proofs,all dificult technicalities, all mathematical details, but, in my opinion,for a mathematician first lecture on the subject this the the one.A.

It doesn't go to great lengths to debate whether or not drug use is good or bad for you, but rather examines how drugs have historically fit into our society and what the world would be like if we made changes to our restrictive drug policy.

Certainly there are people who are more likely to become addicted to various substances, whether it is alcohol, marijuana, heroin or even gambling. But for the great majority of people it is clear that limited recreational use is possible. Given this, the war on drugs is an absurdity.

Neither the hero or heroine were particularly likeable characters and the plot and the 'secret' were unbelievable. I may have found enjoyment reading about the hero if he had been raised in the West, particularly North America, for his language usage was that of an American and not of a European.

The table of contents follows no particular order, and unless you know exactly the recipe you are looking for [who does?] it seems to take forever to find the page you want, and there is no index. The book is printed on textured brown paper - ment to be 'cutsie' and unique, I am sure - but the red print is far too difficult to read at a glance.

The color scan is very nice, I tried to scan some old pictures which about 30 years old and they turn out wonderful. I have not figure out the fax feature works yet. The only draw back I can think of when using fax is that it may be slow since you will have to fax one page at the time so it may take longer to fax if you have multi pages.

There is absolutely no Mac driver support (not even just for printing) with this model. I search on the internet and on Canon website without any success. It's hard to believe that a USB printer will not work on Mac at all in this day and age. The Amazon website only mentioned the OS compatibility after you click on \\"more technical information\\", which I missed when ordering... My rating is for the lack of OS X support rather than for the quality of the product, which I think is adequate for the price. If you are using Apple computers, look for another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT DEAL!","review":"I was shopping for a new laser printer, when I ran across this amazing deal on Amazon.

They do not include updated software with the printer. The driver does not support WIN 7--64 bit. It took me 2 hours of searching and trying different ways to get the updated driver. I finally ran across the following web tip which was easy to follow and had me set up in a few mins!

The speed is excellent, the scanner, printer and fax work well. Only negative criticism is that it doesn't hold an entire pack of paper at once. It only does about a half of one.I just wanted to add though, when I bought this, I watched it for a few weeks for pricing it. There were different vendors that would change, and with it, the price. Sometimes it would change five dollars, sometimes twenty or more. I'd just suggest holding off until you feel that the price is low enough for you because it does change (as well as the availability of free shipping)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this product if you have a 64 bit Vista operating system!","review":"Be forewarned: if you have a Vista 64 bit operating system, the scanning function will not work.

First, the printer does not work with Macs, meaning my wife can't use her computer with it.

I use other software which was in the Canon Toolbox (i.e., OCR, Scanner, etc.) so I had to use Windows Office 2007 tools for OCR and Windows 7 supplied Scanner / Fax programs for that functionality.

As well they claim to be Sateen, they aren't like any sateen sheets I've had before and nowhere on the packaging label does it claim to be sateen.

I just run a hot iron over the embroidery before I fold them.

The story is an amazingly detailed timeline tracking Hatcher through his many run-ins with Law Enforcement all over the West and Midwest.

I was hungry for this type of sound. Being from the midwest, the predominant music style on the radio was classic rock, oldies, and country. I bought this because it had a sort of underground style to the packaging -- I had no idea who any of the artists were, but I'd been burned by flashy packaging on techno/rave CDs before.To make a long story short, this compilation changed my musical tastes forever.I'd long since lost the CD but today I found an MP3 I made of one tune from the disc in 1996 back when I was experimenting with the new-fangled MP3 software my friends were telling me about.Just bought the CD and am looking forward to the nostalgia... What a terrific sampling of the early 90's scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great album","review":"This is the 21st time to buy this album.

Using her own experiences she takes us on a journey towards coming to terms with being naturally psychic. Anyone with clairvoyant or mediumistic abilities will both empathise with Palin and breathe a huge sigh of relief as they hear and recognise the strange things that she has dealt with and realise that they are not alone in their experiences. Anyone who is perhaps not as gifted will read on in amazement at the true story of her unusual life.This book deals with all that is paranormal, including past lives, spirits, meditation, and even alien encounters. However, it deals with it in a very matter of fact, unsensationalist way. Which is exactly what a person coming into their own power needs to hear.I applaud Palin for discussing her life, and risking her uniqueness being labelled the rantings of a eccentric. They are not. They are extremely useful and fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalizing on the Good Stuff","review":"Recently I received my long awaited copy of \\"Jamarama - Live\\", what a rip off! Much can be said about the amateurish production of the DVD. Despite the fact it was a live event, focusing and tracking for this DVD seems to have been a lost art.Yet, the worst part of this recording is hype used to promote DVD. Laurie Berkner who by the time of the issuance of this recording was an established star of the pre-school set was presented as the principal artist. Well if principal artist means doing two songs which she had better recorded on her own much heralded DVD then ok. The rest of tracks and their attendant artist can best be summed up with one word, boring.I won't belabor my criticism of this DVD. I'll end by saying save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sorry we wasted the time & money...into the trash!","review":"Awful! The quality of sound is super bad and the songs are unknown by my daughter (who know tons of songs and sings along). We didn't like the Ohmies at all!! Hadn't heard of them before and certainly won't be spending time with their squeekiness again. We barely made it through the video one time and I tossed it. It certainly didn't pass my rule that mommy must enjoy the video, too. If you want enjoyable sing-alongs for children (and the adults that are subject to them, too) choose Laurie Berkner or Raffi or even Dan Zanes for a change of flavor. We have yet to get sick of those awesome musical DVDs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jamarama STINKS!!!!","review":"I would have given this no stars but they made me pick at least one. I can't believe I paid $15.00 for this DVD. I bought this because my daughter loves Laurie Berkner. The quality is just horrible. And Laurie only plays two songs. Are you kidding me?

My 3 year old who loves the We Are The Laurie Berkner Band was very excited when we ordered this CD. We were both VERY disappointed! I allow her to watch the 2 DVD's only when I am walking on the tredmill in the same room as the TV (only time she watches any TV) but I have to say that I can not stand this DVD. My 3 year old is glued to We are the Laurie Berkner Band but as soon as this CD came on she was up off the couch and ready for me to be finished. We now skip right to Laurie and watch her 2 songs and then turn it off.

I could only stand about 5 minutes of dvd until I had to forward it. My daughter wasn't interested in watching it at all. The quality of the video wasn't the greatest.

Instead we get mostly The Ohmies: saccarin-sweet boring music. My child left the room after about 5 minutes into it. There's a reason I've never seen this band on Noggin-they're terrible! I agree with many other reviewers that the sound quality was not great and there were only maybe 2 songs of Laurie and 3 of Milkshake. If this show were playing close by I would never go to see it. Save your money and get Jack's Big Music show on DVD or We are the Laurie Berkner Band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"My toddler is not very interested in this.

But Mr. Jasper had a very interesting and unique topic to write about. His writing skill is still impressive, but \\"Dark\\" was 100% better than this book. The main character was lame, kept fighting between tough guy vs. corny guy, and there were too many Cinderella and Superman scenes.

This disc almost doesnt deserve the two stars I've given it. There may be some talent shown on this disc, but honestly, unless you think its cool to buy a CD filled mostly with 1 to 2 minute space fillers, then this is a wate of your money. Initially the CD is almost impressive and even slightly interesting, but as time has gone by, not that much time really though, this sorry excuse for an album has shown its true colors. The bands previous release is far better based on songwriting, but the production is really quite dismal. If you were going to buy on of this bands releases, I would definitely say don't go anywhere near this one. It's terribly boring and an utter waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad... for what it is. But ultimately junk","review":"I give it 2 stars because the music and arrangements are above-average for the genre (Euro-Metal?). However, the individuals behind The Haggard don't actually play the instruments! The biggest problem here is the absolutely ridiculous vocals. Please...the 'roaring like a monster' is just SO BAD and so *SILLY*. This CD begins with some promising music & drama but quickly descends into some kind of cheap adolescent nightmare. I could have given it 4 stars if they avoided such obvious marketing gimmicks. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"This is an awsome cd. Hard to find but was very reasonable on here. It was a used cd, but looked new when taken out of the case. Great cd though, I recommend chapter three."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive, whimsical, and informed look into California.","review":"Unlike average travel guides that list tourist traps in a droning disinterested voice, the author imbues California with life using a charming, very witty writing style. Simply put, he brings California to life for the reader. The guide he provides is unique and thoroughly enjoyable. The photographs selected are great in capturing the beauty of the state. I would recommend this book for anyone looking to explore California or just intersted in travelling through the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"Interesting. If you are new to California, it's totally a good read. The author gives many tips on where to go, who you can contact, and what's fun to do in California. It's also just a good cultural read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!!!","review":"Ok, the first time I read this book was for a 7th grade reading assignment-and that was well over 20 years ago, but this book has stayed in my heart ever since. Its a very well written story about a young girl who came over from England on the Mayflower and lived through the struggles that the Pilgrims went through in their first years of Plimouth Plantation. This is for the most part, a true story, written by Patricia Clapp, who's husband is an actual descendant of Constance. The story has adventure, romance and I felt the pain that these people went through during one of the most important times of our history. This book opened in me an interest in life in Plimouth. I was lucky enough to live in New England and visited the Plantation often. I highly recommend this book to young teens, as well as older. Somewhere I still have my copy (that I bought back when I was in 7th grade), and its a book that I would read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical-Fiction At It's Best","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 5th grade, which wasfive years ago, and I still love reading this book. As one of thebiggest fans of historical-fiction novels, ranging from books written by Ann Rinaldi, Karen Cushman, Michael Shaara, Charles Dickens and Nathaniel Hawthorne, I would have to say this is my favorite. The setting is one of history's most fascinating time periods: colonial America, and is narrarated by an intelligent young woman. The hardships of colonial life are written in detail, and you feel as though you are with Constance and her family the whole time you read the book. You experince everything from the trip on the Mayflower from England, to building a town and encountering Native Americans for the first time. I would recommend this book to any reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Read","review":"This book was given to me when I was nine, and is a long-standing favorite. I'm now in my late teens, but every November I read it again for old time's sake around Thanksgiving, and every year I love it. It speaks many truths about life in general, and Constance is an engaging and highly relatable character. I looked online out of interest to see if it was as widely read as I thought it should be, and thankfully it appears to be. This book would make an excellent gift for a young girl; it is gaurenteed to be a book she will read over and over again and always hold a special place in her heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a 13 year old","review":"I loved this book.

The scroll wheel and middle button are easy to use.Yes. The left and right buttons work fine.Yes. The size is perfect for toting around.NO. It is not as durable as one might think.The cable right at the base of the usb connector has some sort of short in it. The mouse goes in and out if this area is agitated by movement. Now, with that said, wrapping the mouse up will probably make things worse which shouldn't be since wrapping and unwrapping the mouse should be the most flawless operation. However, Logitech seems to have made the mouse cable too weak to seriously be used over and over again. If you never plan to wrap and unwrap the mouse over and over like a regular on the go notebook user then this is a fine mouse, albeit one with a short cable. If you plan on going around the world with it, no. It's terrible. Logitech has better mice that are wireless to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cable is too short...","review":"Everyhing is good except the cable but that makes it too bad.

There really is no point to the game. In addition it is incredibly confusing, to both the children and adults. Honestly, this could possibly be the absolute worst choice of any board game available on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked Goodkind","review":"Unfortunately Terry Goodkind has become tedious and repetitive. A story line that once was new and refreshing is now becoming old and needs to be put to rest. Borrowing from the style of Dean Kuntz the passion for suspense is overbearing and stifling at times. It feels as if the story is being drawn out and the \\"good coming from behind\\" is once again played out. If you get this book feel free to skim it. You will get about the same as if you read the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst book in the series","review":"The only thing I can come up with is that Goodkind must be trying to sabotage his own series... unless you _must_ read the entire series, I suggest you pass on this one. The characters that we know and love are neutered from their previous incarnations, and unless he's got some miracle plan worked out, I fail to see how this contributes to the storyline (at least the other books were exciting). Goodkind's preachy, but this book is like an 800-page gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may not read anymore of this series.","review":"I enjoyed the earlier books in this series. This book however, took me three starts before I was able to read through it. It was very low on plot and character development. The story took a back seat to political views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot or not?","review":"Did you read the inside flap and find yourself disappointed when an outtake from the book was given and not a plot summary? That's because there was no plot...well...no new plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.I feel like the characters have lost their voices. The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books. Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books. I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone. I tried to start the next book, and it was worse. Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Empire (Sword of Truth, book 8)","review":"This series of books are captivating and what I would call cliff hangers that move you from one book to the next. They hold your interst and compell you to locate the next book then the next. If you ever read the first you will have to read the rest of them. A must read for those of us that enjoy a good romance, mystery, adventure, with realistic fantasy. Just a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever?","review":"A horrible book that did nothing to advance the story in the series. By the end of he book the characters are at the exact same spot they were at in the beginning. If you are reading the series, feel free to skip this book and you won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objectivist Tripe","review":"Terry Goodkind was (and I emphasize was) one of the greatest fantasy writers of this day. He did not lose the focus of his storyline in fantastic races, magical spells, or sweeping godlike powers.Now, though, his books have become lost in the extreme and uncompromising conservative philosophy of Mr. Goodkind. Richard is no longer a hero, or even a human character. He is, in every sense of the word, an fanatic. Goodkind no longer has his characters smile, or laugh, or even talk. Now, the book is about the evils of communism, of civil disobience, and of idealism.I thought this book was not worth the paper it was printed on, which served no other role than to voice a much more poorly written version of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost its way","review":"I don't write reviews often, but I really wanted to warn people away from the Sword of Truth series based on the last 2 volumes. It is such a shame because, like many of the reviewers here, I loved the earlier books and saw real promise to the series.Why is this one so terrible. Well, have you ever read a book where 80 pages are dedicated to one speech? I counted them. From the point Richard assembles the crowd he wants to talk to, to the point where the conversation finished - it is a staggering 80 pages! In fact, more space is given to that than is given to building to the conclusion.My Goodkind seems to be using these latest volumes to preach at people, and frankly, it makes for a very boring read.Please, please, if you are considering reading the Sword of Truth series - don't. You will only end up disappointed like so many of the other reviewers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its my moral obligation","review":"Well, I really did learn something from this book. I used to be a dyed-in-the-wool pacifist but now I have seen the light and I am thinking for myself. Here is what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that authors who hook their audiences into a series with a few excellent books and then proceed to write a bunch of self-indulgent trash are wasting my hard earned time and money. These authors are evil people! And from this book I've learned that it is my moral obligation to murder all evil people :) So watch your backs Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, I hope you don't sleep too well because you know I'm coming after you with a bloody axe or perhaps just a sharpened stake..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milking it to meet the contract...","review":"I'll start by saying I absolutely loved the first four books of this series. The last four books seem only to be filler to meet the quota contracted with the publisher for the series. I have to say I am getting more and more disappointed with the way things are going with this series. For those of you who are new to SOT, my recommendation would be to read the first four books and then wait for the last one to be published so you can have closure. My only hope is that George R. R. Martin doesn't go down this path with his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series - which, in my humble opinion, is an EXCELLENT read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (as expected from Goodkind)","review":"Excellent book. Deals with current issues (such as the tough choices between \\"necessary violence\\" and pacifism). Brings back some old beloved characters from earlier books. Very good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a fantasy book....get over it!","review":"The book was much much better than POC. He returns to the characters that we know and love. I like the premise of the Wizard's eight rule and it was over all a good read. This book is not intended to make deep philosophical statements or to be a mirror of our present conflicts. This is a fantasy book, for people who love to read about different worlds, with there is MAGIC and good and evil are clearly defined. And for the person who says that the bad guys in these books are TOO evil, did you think that the Emperor in Star Wars was too evil?If you are trying to read these books to understand life, war, today's politics, good vs evil in real world etc....get a life. This is entertainment people, just like going to the movies. This is not a guide for your life or the world today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Talk, Little Action","review":"Terry's latest book is a little bout of dysentery in the Sword of Truth series. He spews out a 50 page rant in the mid part of the book about thinking for yourself and other noble ideas, then he goes on to repeat that same rant again in another twenty pages. What a huge waste of my time!! And in the end we're no closer to the demise of Jagang and Imperial Order. For all the preachy talk I found this book had the least amount of action in the series. I'm reluctant to give this book two stars because I've come to expect more from Terry Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"What a disappointment! The novel series (as every series seems to do) has been getting steadily worse. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this book is repetetive, preachy, and unimaginative. If you MUST read it, get it from a library and save some bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"spare me the lectures","review":"Entirely too many pages of this book are spent with speeches and lectures on morality. The story is a good one, when they finally get around to it. Two thirds of the book is Richard talking to people about how they should value life and on and on about right and wrong. I was annoyed with it in Faith of the Fallen and I am not impressed with it now. I sincerely hope that there will again be a focus on the story and the characters, not these cardboard cutouts that keep coming into the story to be lectured on the black and white of life as Richard sees it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original villians please","review":"The book was pretty good. The philosophy was tedious--I got it in the previous books. The thing that is really tiresome is the villians. Often they appear from nowhere and are members of the Rahl family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill","review":"This series seems to be following the pattern of the Wheel of Time. It started off fantasticly, with storyline and charcters that grab and hold you. But as the books go on.....and on..... it just starts to get worse and worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the series headed downhill?...","review":"Unfortunately, this book was mediocre. The first 5 books were great ... but then Faith of the Fallen, Pillars of Creation, and now Naked Empire are here. I don't know what happened, but it appears that Goodkind has become more interested in writing about philosophy and sociology, and has forgotten to write a good story. I didn't say HOW TO write a good story.... I just said he's leaving it out. At least I hope.... Naked Empire, although some cool stuff happens, is lacking in good writing, and full of explainations about how, as cincibookworm puts it, dogma on how bad collectivisim is. This is what I was saying to myself:Ok. I get it ... collectivism can be bad. Ok. I get it. No really. I get it. Ohhh ... I see. No, but really, I had it about 400 pages ago.Honestly, if you're into the series, go ahead and pick up a copy, or borrow one, as I did. Read it. Skim it. Get the gist. And pray for the 9th book... :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Circuit Rider","review":"Enough with the preaching! Way past time to kill off the evangelist and get on with the story. First book in the series is a classic but could not get past the \\"Sermon on the Mountain.\\"Shudder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you lost interest in Richard and Kahlan?","review":"A person has to wonder why Mr. Goodkind droned on and on about Richard's view on violence and what is the difference between right and wrong. Although Mr. Goodkind has an amazing imagination with no doubt, unmatched writing ability, this book was still a major dissapointment. Naked Empire lacked the amount of excitment that this reader had anticipated, as well as the growing conflict that should have left this reader wanting more. Richard was to preachy, Kahlan followed Richard around like a puppy and what happened to the subdued Mord-sith? Thank goodness for the chapters on Zedd, they were well written and stayed true to character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooriing !!!","review":"I was disappointed. Story is boring and very slowpaced. Same lectures about evil and choice are going on and on and on... At this point The Naked Empire is the worst book of the series. I have to reconsider reading more from Mr. Goodkind. Quantity does not mean quality, this story could fit in 200 pages instead of nearly 700 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, you mean evil doesn't go away if you close your eyes?","review":"Shocking. Whether this is an analogy to U.S. politics these days or just a not-so-new revelation, this concept is pounded into the reader's head until pounding one's head against a wall to drown it out sounds like a good thing. Or an easier alternative is to just stop reading. Unfortunately, I couldn't as I always read his books to the end.There were some good things in this story, but the one thing this book revealed to me is that Terry Goodkind has taken a page from Robert Jordan -- the new trend seems to be that series no longer have a distinct beginning and an end anymore. You can write about a set of characters for years with no end in sight, and make lots of money doing so. Maybe we shouldn't expect an end, but that's why we read -- a story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. If we wanted a never-ending story, we'd just pay attention to real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too preachy","review":"I wanted to write a review saying this book is too preachy, but it looks like other reviewers have already covered this point. The whole book is contrived to give Richard, the protagonist, chances to lecture other characters, friend and foe, as well as the reader.The book is not without its good points, but you've got to wade through a lot of sermonizing to get to them.It sounds like Goodkind has heard this complaint, but doesn't agree with it. Well, its his series and he can do what he want's with it, but if he stays in this vein he'll be losing one of his following pretty soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind is proving the Wizard's First Rule","review":"For every person that shells out good money for this tripe, for every person that comes here and gushes about how great Goodkind is, he is proving his own First Rule.Here's an alternative to buying Naked Empire. Go to the nearest large city and seek out a crazy homeless guy preaching the evils of the world-wide reptilian space-beast conspiracy on a street corner. It's free, and I guarantee his rants will be more entertaining than Goodkind's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"Yet another novel in the Sword of Truth series that has completely failed to live up to expectations. Terry Goodkind seems to have forgotten that he is a fantasy writer and instead moralizes for about 800 pages. Understandably, I'd rather not buy a fantasy book to read all about Terry's moral value system. It's a pity that a series that started out so strongly in the fantasy genre has degenerated so far to produce a novel such as this one. Hopefully, the author will note this criticism and improve the quality of the series; however, I will never know since I will not be persuaded to ever pick up another Terry Goodkind novel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped in \\"Robert Jordan Syndrome\\"??????","review":"Poor Terry Goodkind, the publishing company wants lots of pages from him but he hasn't quite figured out what comes next in the story. Well, just put Richard in danger, take lots of pages to get him out, explain how killing actually supports the value of life and use about 4 of those pages to move the bigger story a baby step along. Oh, and since it is the eighth book, be sure to mention the Wizards Eighth Rule, just in case someone is nostalgic for a worthy book.It all sounds a lot like what Robert Jordan has been going through the last few books. Save your money. Hopefully both authors will get past the celebrity and get back to telling us the real story. I still have hope but it's fading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Sermon, Boring Book","review":"I am first off a huge Goodkind fan, and I have read every one of his books. This book however, is by far the worst in the series. The plot is nothing more then a thin vehicle for what has to be the most boring preaching I have ever read in a book. As other reviewers have mentioned, the world and characters Terry has created are wonderful, and full of promise. This book makes me wonder if we will ever see any of that promise fullfilled. If you have read previous books in this serious, you can skip this book -- you won't miss a thing in regards to the underlying plot created by the other books. If you are new to Goodkind, go read the first few books. This one stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away, run far away","review":"I really enjoyed the rest of this series, but this book was just awful. Pages and pages and repetitious, pretentious rambling. All of the sudden our interesting woodsman-to-warrior character stops wrestling with any moral ambiguity, and starts preaching about the necessity of bloodshed. Heck, he stops doing much of anything. The main character pretty much walks around talking and coughing for 800 pages. It's amazing he could talk so much with lungs so damamged. This was just sloppy, rote writing. I think Goodkind needs to get out of the amateur philosophy business and write a fantasy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculously preachy","review":"i think goodkind is running out of ideas and words. he spends chapter upon chapter repeating the same sermon. this series has ground to a halt. don't bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"This book is the shotgun blast to the fallen horse that was a good book series, which should have happened after the Temple of Winds. The book is boring, uninteresting and is a perfect sequel to the tripe preceding it \\"The Pillars of Creation.\\" I loved the 1st 4 books, but there has been an uneasy decline since then. The decline has turned into a serious cliff with this book.Do not worry about spoilers, since nothing happened in the book. No action, intrigue or though provoking questions.I am glad to hear that Goodkind is ending the series soon. It is just to bad that he did not decide to end it a few books ago. Do not read this book, for it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy perversion","review":"This series is now officially dead. I finally finished Naked Empire... In fact it is some of the most uninteresting writing I've ever seen. He has more preaching in this book than all the previous ones combined. In fact there is no action in the first 400 pages. The only breaks in boredom you get are when they shift focus from Richard to Zed (which is very few times). At around 200 pages I felt wonder and shock as to why the pace was so slow. It was as if Goodkind wanted to intentionally punish his readers with his kindergarten philosophies. In fact Richard keeps cycling through 3 speeches, all the same with different words. At around 300 pages despair. After 400 anger. He's going off on another tangent in this novel and it is painfully obvious he will keep avoiding the main plot until he has spent the series and people stop reading. Very dissapointing. In my opinion far worse than Pillars of Creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God, Save Me","review":"If you read any other book in the series, then you have already this one. The first few books in the series were fairly good, definitely not a series that will be loved for years to come, but an ok read. Terry is definitely not of the same par of writer as Robert Jordan or George Martin. His big downfall is that he rambles on and on about the same worthless stuff through every book.The main characters, Lord Richard Rahl and Kahlan are by far some of the most unlovable characters you will ever meet. People follow these two blindly, yet they have no leadership skills whatsoever. They only are focused on one another. Their people are dying by the 1000s while they run around the world trying to save each other.This is the only series I have ever had to give up on because it is so god awful boring.Save yourself alot of trouble and buy something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over editied & overly philosophical","review":"One would hope that an author would have a good story to tell as well as some deeper take-home point. The story in this book is good. Unfortunately, the authors ruins it. Forcing a reader to endure page upon page of adolescent philosophies is a bit much to ask of any reader. The author also seems to have taken a challenge to see how long a description can be dragged out before the reader slips into a coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can only read part of this series","review":"If your amazon account is tagged to Canada, too bad, so sad, you cannot buy the last 4 books in the series. Since all the books are one long story, that means you don't get to read to the end. Amazon says it has something to do with the author or the author's publisher but they don't respond to email enquiries. Amazon were stand up though and reimbursed the cost of the books I had read.As for the books, the stories get stretched on without any conclusion and are filled with insipid morals, values, and very predictable narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow - do NOT buy.","review":"This book is not just bad - it's embarrassing. What happened to the author of Wizards First Rule?One piece of advice for Terry would be to stare clear of philosophy. In this book, Richard somehow manages to lead himself to the point where he ends up encouraging the slaughter of a bunch of misguided, weaponless, passives who are doing nothing more than trying to prevent a war. How he gets there I'm still trying to figure out.This book is just a disaster. Goodkind had created a believable world - it's amazing how quickly he has managed to uncreate it.Another piece of advice for Terry - the formula he's been using for the past six books - it's dead. I actually can not believe that he has shamelessly used basically the same plot yet again. I'm sick of it. This is not advancing a story - this is the same story told slightly differently (and slightly worse) over and over again. I waited for this story to go somewhere. It doesn't.Read this book only if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless side trip on the way to ending the series!","review":"Once again Richard is forced to detour away from the end of the story (presumably the final battle with the Order). Most of this book is taken up with long explanations as to why we have to choose good over evil, freedom over slavery, etc. The new characters are completely uninteresting, the old characters are becoming more wooden. The stinking pet GOAT is mentioned (and reacted to by the characters) in nearly every paragraph! We know more about the goat than Tom who had some potential as an interesting character. The sister is a beautiful halfwit who needs EVERYTHING explained to her. Basically, don't waste your time with this book. Watch the reviews and when people start saying the series is moving along, you can safely 'get back in'."},{"rating":"1","title":"its kinda lost the magic","review":"I enjoyed this book when i read it, although i felt it wasn't nearly as good as some of the others. i probably would have given it 3 or 4 stars, until i recently reread wizard's first rule. it hardly even seems like the same series anymore! i mean books 1-4 and 6 were fantastic. but 5,7, and 8 it just seems like goodkind lost his focus, making them into books of nothing but political rants rather than the magic we see in the first few books. There are a lot of really good plot lines that goodkind could expand on, but he doesn't! lets just hope chainfire has more of the elements i used to love about this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book from a great author","review":"First off, the ideas expressed have nothing to do with conservatism and liberalism. they are objectivism. even if i wasn't a liberal, I'd find your review inflammatory and baseless.Anyway, this book was wonderfully written. If you look at it as just a story, and disregard the philosophy, its actually a good book. but even if you read it and are offended by the philosophy, why debunk the book? the story itself was good. all in all i liked the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am very disapointed in Mr. Goodkind. I find his constant preaching of his own quite conservative republican ideals to be annoying and out of place. I was very pleased by the first four books of the series. Fast-paced romantic exciting, if a little uninspired definately four star books. Since then Mr. Goodkind's writing has gone down hill, to hit rock bottem in book eight Pillars of Creation. It can, will and has gotten worse in this book. Mr. Goodkind unless i read some glowing reviews about your next book you've lost a customer. The preaching in this book is worse than ever. Charecters seem flat an dull. If your looking for an exciting fantasy read i'd recommend Robin Hobb or George RR Martin. If you'd like to see our war with Iraq justified eighteen times while reading a (rather stupid pointless) fantasy novel stick with Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard's On His Way...","review":"In the Sword of Truth series over two years have passed since Richard first met Kahlan that memorable day in the Hartland woods. Naked Empire was written as a continuation of The Pillars of Creation and follows the same characters through yet another story of perilous intent. Here we find Richard Rahl struggling with his ability to balance his tremendous gift as a War Wizard. That he is seemingly unable to control this awesome power and prevent his own death was the man vs. self slice of irony that kept me reading.Most of the reviews that you will read on here absolutely drag this book through the mud, and I'm not really sure why. This is a fantasy novel and a pretty good one at that. Richard Rahl wields the Sword of Truth with a ruthlessly unrelenting purpose throughout Naked Empire, and let me tell you, it's good to have him back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"End of the line for Goodkind and me","review":"With Naked Empire, Goodkind finally cemented his place in my mind as a wingnut with nothing to say that hadn't been said more strikingly by Ayn Rand and, more importantly, as a novelist with no good stories left to tell. This book destroyed my admiration for Richard Rahl as a likable main character and for Goodkind as a writer. Gone are the sense of humor, interesting characters, and intricate storytelling of Wizard's First Rule, replaced by pseudo-philosophical rambling and characters painted with a childishly broad brush. I had loved Wizard's First Rule when I was in middle school, and quietly, almost without my noticing because of the slow decline of the SoT series and my utter disgust with Naked Empire, this book broke my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Worm","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed reading this book. I feel that one of Goodkind's strengths is his ability to write great stories that revolve around very interesting characters, and he certainly delivers with this book. Goodkind also reveals more of the back story from the time of the great war, which took place 3000 years before this series.Fans of the series, who did not like Pillars of Creation, will find this book much more enjoyable since it returns to story telling that is centered around the main characters(i.e. Richard, Kahlan, Adie, Zed, Cara, etc.) and brings back some long forgetten characters(but I don't want to spoil the surprise).I must say that if you chose not to read Pillars of Creation, then you may want to do so before sinking you teeth into this one. This story answers many of the questions raised in Pillars. I really liked Pillars, but I think that Mr. Goodkind should have merged Books 7 and 8 into one novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book in the series","review":"Goodkind's writing has become flat, the dialogue bland, and Richard is overly preachy. His new characters are boring, and Kahlan and Richard barely changed, other than some of Richard's big revelations about his gift. This book is pretty much a 667 page argument for the death penalty. After a stunning 6th book, I was looking foward to the continuation. Both book 7 and this book are far bellow what Goodkind is capable of. And after everything Richard and company has gone through, they aren't even one step closer to getting rid of Jagang. Hopefully the next book actually advances the main plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The first four books of the series were the best. They have gotten worse with each one since.Goodkind has taken the annoying habit of repeating everything three, sometimes four times within a few pages, sometimes the same paragraph. The book was also very preachy. He's past books have been preachy, but nothing compared to this one. He has Richard pulling out the soapbox at every chance and giving his philosophy on life and anything else he feels like.Naked empire could have been cut to a 350 or 400-page book.It hardly progressed the series.It read like a first draft.The dialogue was stilted, almost robotic.If you have been following the series and have to read this book, wait until it comes out in paperback or better yet, borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julian May was much better","review":"Check out Julian May's 'Many Coloured Land' series. A great story with characters you can empathise with, that read well from start to finish and really ended. Goodkind started out well but has now become too confused in my mind with Robert Jordan, plus he preaches too much and too simplisticly.Very disappointing - borrow it from the library if you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much philosophy - too little story","review":"I have enjoyed every one of Goodkind's books. Despite popular negative views on Pillars of Creation, I thought it was one of the better books of the series. Naked Empire was terrible. Every time Richard opened his mouth it was to give a speach about some aspect of Nietzchian philosophy. There's nothing wrong with integrating your philosophies into a story, but don't forget about the story! The plot was terrible, you knew Richard wasn't going to die but the way that he survived was ridiculous. Richard being able to randomly use his gift to do the impossible is getting too convenient. If you want to read the same philosophies only written better, pick up a copy of Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzche. If you want to read a good Goodkind epic, stay away from Naked Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked Empire","review":"This was yet another good book by Mr. Goodkind but it still leaves so many problems unresolved. I know that this can't all be done in one book but it would be nice if Richard couldn't ever get back into the New World or if Richard could ever at least tap into some of the powers that he has been blessed with. I give this a two becasue while this book is interesting, it leaves the reader with a want for more. He preaches too much we already know everything he has to say and we have memorized it the 3rd time he says it. Come on Terry. The First Book splendor and glory is unobtainable but I hope that Mr. Goodkind will take his time for the 9th book and give me 1000+ pages so that it will really be worth reading and taking some time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Goodkind is loosing it!I was a fan of the first 6 books in the series, but last 2 have been a waste of time. Far too much repetitive lecturing on his psuedo philosophies, and not enough plot or action. If Goodkind feels he needs to put some of his 'big ideas' in the book fine, but rather than repeating them countless times he should just make the book 200 pages shorter! or better still stick to what he is good at and fill the 200 pages with some good fantasy writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, great finish","review":"Yeah, the book definitely starts out slow. It seems like \\"blah, blah, blah\\", switch to someone else, then back to \\"blah, blah, blah\\". I personally found that there was too much going over of the basic principles of the series (shields, chimes, the link between worlds)...we've heard it before, we don't need the two-by-four. However, once everything gets going, the book definitely pleases. The hallmarks of his earlier works are there...an act of desperation bringing victory (or at least snatching them from the jaws of defeat), the need for creative methods of solving their problems when \\"traditional\\" solutions fail, and of course Richard using his charisma and conviction to open the eyes of those blind to their own problems. Far, far better than Pillars...but not nearly as good as Faith of the Fallen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodkind","review":"Great book. I would have given it 5 stars but that gones to only the most engrossing of tales. The story is new and refreshing. My only complaint is the ending, which is only a person preference. I didn't think that a certain villan should have died as easily has Terry put it. This book is very much an improvement over the his last book, Pillars of Creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book","review":"Terry Goodkind has another amazing book. If you are a liberal (or even somewhat left leaning), you will be annoyed with some of Richard's speeches...but those of you who have read the last few books of Goodkind's will be expecting that.He does an excellent job of mixing is philosophy (based off of Ayn Rand) with the fantasy story. If you want a great story, and enjoyed the rest of the series you should pick it up. However, if you have disliked the more philosophical nature if the last few books, this one is likely to bother you as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one - It's a sermon disguised as a book","review":"I really loved the first books in this series. Completely blown away.Pillars of Creation and now Naked Empire were a complete disappointment. After reading POC I was sorely tempted to skip Naked Empire. I wish now that I had. The repetitive thumping the reader over the head with the sermons is beyond excuse. There is a good story in there somewhere. Every so often I would see flashes of the old brilliance. Too few to save the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"from breathtaking to boring","review":"I'm not going to get in a rant here about how much of his personal philosophy he has jammed into this book, since there are many other reviews here that have already done that. To be short and sweet: The series started out AWESOME, I devoured the first half of the series, not minding his occasional lectures on philosophy. Then, after half way through, the lectures started to get longer, and longer, and longer. Now, in the Naked Empire, you will literally come across many sections that have 15+ pages of his opinion on life. This book has bored me too much to go onto the others, which is a shame, the series was SO good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!","review":"I could go into all of the good aweful things that made this such a wasted read for me. But I won't. I will say that overall I am a huge Terry Goodkind fan and have loved his books (excepting Soul of the Fire which I hated, and Pillars of Creation, couldn't he have waited until AFTER the Sword of Truth series and written it as a stand alone Fantasy). This book does do something Robert Jordan (haven't read 11th book yet)hasen't for his last three novels, actually move the story along, but what a terrible story it is. So finally here is the one thing I'm going to say, for anyone about to read the book, remember these words \\"pristinely ungifted\\" then take an aspirin. After you read this book, I'm sure you will never want to here those words again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Boring, Ridiculous Philosophy","review":"This book is terrible! So extremely boring. The characters break into long philosphical discussions at the worst times. It's totally unrealistic. Goodkind rants about Freedom, but his readers just want a good story. This is NOT a good story. I stopped reading 3/4 of the way through. I'm done with Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy.","review":"I don't know why I do it to myself anymore. Goodkind brought a real gem into the world of fantasy novels when he wrote Wizard's First Rule. Unfortunately, as with most novel series I have read, it was all downhill from there. The most common complaint in the reviews I have read seems to be that Goodkind's novels have become thinly-veiled philosophy essays, and I concur with that. I'd also add that the story is predictable, the characters behave foolishly, and (how can I put this in a way that won't spoil the ending?) things just seem to work out a little too conveniently. After this one, I don't think I'll continue to torture myself with any more of Goodkind's work. I no longer care what happens to Richard and Kahlan, and as much as I liked them in the first book, that's pretty depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave all the others 5 stars","review":"I had been a staunch defender of this series until this book. I will admit that while I have read through all of the books in this series (some more than once) I couldn't get past the fourth chapter of this one. While I had taken a while to read this one and unsure if I would be able to pick up the plot I had grown tired of the recap of the characters basic characteristics within a page.I don't remember if Mr. Goodkind's writing has always been this way but I also just found his writing style on par with middle schoolers. The narrator staunchly backing up every thing that the Maine characters put forth dissipates the suspense before it ever existed.Mr. Goodkind vastly over compensates for his unnecessarily brutal descriptions by making the Maine characters light and fluffy when not in danger. I mean a goat for God's sake come on. I won't even get into how preposterous the dominatrix torture ladies are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shame...","review":"A great storyteller. Great characters. Good plot. When the series began that is.From Soul of the Fire onwards, everything has gone downhill.Whatever happened to the Terry who wrote the first few Sword of Truth novels. This is a sorry excuse of a story and even worse is the constant preaching that goes on and on and on. Richard is not the likeable hero he once was. Terry has tunred him into a poor man's version of John Galt. He used to borrow plot lines and ideas from Robert Jordan but now he has decided to rip off Ayn Rand. It's a shame all good authors who show such promise stoop to this level. The only saving grace for the fantasy genre seems to be George R. R. Martin and his A Song of Ice and Fire series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"This series had such potential, and it is now being run into the ground with silly rambling attempts at philosophy. He did such a great job creating these characters, making you care about them, empathizing with their inner emotions and struggles, their physical danger. The first few books were so deep and cleverly written that you could feel it. Maybe I've gone cold-hearted, but I just don't care anymore and I'm not feeling it. Trying to be more than it was has diluted this series tremendously. Stick with what people liked instead of being so ambitious it comes out a convoluted disarray of pontifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"Wasn't the same person who wrote the first five books. Terry Goodkind needs a un-reality check. I read fantasy for a reason and that is to be entertained. Not to be bored to death with constant philosophical preaching of what is easily seen as the writers current views of todays problems. If he wants to lecture go on tour or teach at a college but save his book characters from permanent damage of being so very boring. If you take out the constant lectures of current morality and the 300 pages of plot review that you already know if your a fan; you get about 150 pages of good reading out of 600. I say shame on Terry's publisher for letting him publish this horrible book; when Mr Goodkind is such a good writer as we've seen from his earlier novels. I just hope he gets it together for the next book, but I won't be buying hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad...","review":"It is the same plot structure as the majority of his other books. As someone else has stated here in a review, the same sequence of events happen in this book as they did in his others. Richard goes on adventure. Richard can't control his magic and has no idea how to use it. Richard gets sick. Zedd is once again not with Richard. Zedd and Adie get in trouble. Kahlan gets captured. Richard comes to the rescue of Kahlan. Richard finally meets up with a wizard to help him understand the magic, but he runs in the other direction yet again. Richard gets better. So we are right back where we started..almost exactly where they book started.Anyways..it is still a good read..I just hope that he breaks from the current plot mold he is stuck in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm....","review":"Well it wasnt a BAD book it just kinda lacked a really in depth plot. It seems that unfortunatley Terry Goodkind is dragging out his, once execellent, series into something that seems to be going nowhere... reminds me of.............. ROBERT JORDAN! Hey whaddya know.anyway thats my two cents"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable","review":"...but only just. It's very rare for me to find a book so bad that I can't finish it, and this book isn't THAT bad. Hence, two stars.Visit the official website, terrygoodkind dot com, and read the Philosophy and About Terry sections, including all the letters and interviews, to learn about why the Sword of Truth books are the way they are.Other reviewers have pointed out the particular flaws in this book very well. I'll just add this: Reading \\"Naked Empire\\" will make you feel like you've just been chewed-out by your dad for mischief you didn't commit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Let me first say that I love Goodkind and his books - the first handful in this series are some of the best in this genre I have ever read. If you haven't started reading this series - do so immediately! However, I have to agree with several other reviewers that this book is a major disappointment. So much of this book (not just here and there, but just about all the time) contains long rambling sermons about right and wrong, good and evil. Only here and there does Goodkind's excellent (adventure) writing shine through. This book is not worth reading - and since the storyline barely moves forward - not even to keep up with the story itself. I too, will give this series one more chance and then give up. Perhaps something happens when a series becomes too long; for me the same thing happend with Jordan's Wheel of Time series. If you haven't yet tried George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" - don't wait any longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the book that made me stop reading Goodkind","review":"I had already thought about stopping after reading \\"Pillars of Creation\\", which was overall a rather nice book, until Jenssen suddenly has that Richard-clone speach at the end. However, after having read 7 books of this series I still wished to give the 8th one a try. After 6 chapters I stopped reading, and this is why: for 7 books, Goodkind was able to get the action started and the main chars in life-threating danger by the end of chapter 2. In this book, all that happens in the first 6 chapters is the chars walking around, talking and exlaining all the greatness of Richard and his view to Jenssen, and two obnoxious baby goats getting killed by some predator birds. Also no Zedd in these chapters. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"I hear an echo...","review":"Three words describe this book. Repetitive, Repetitive and yes, repetitive.This is not a single title book, it's a series. Therefore why do we need page upon page of reminders as to what happened in previous books? It's annoying to say the least and I feel, as a writer myself, ripped off.Where are the artfully written story lines? Where is the dialogue that keeps you up until 3am telling yourself, just one more chapter? They are not evident in this and the last volume, Pillars.For an author to stoop to this sad level of repetitiveness is such a disappointment to those of us who used to love the series.I will continue with reading the series but I have to ask, Mr. Goodkind, where are you? Please try and return to what once was. The well written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it Goodkind!","review":"When you think about it very little happened in this book. The majority of it was spent with Richard espousing some Smith and Hobbesian philosophy of individual right over the \\"Evil\\" collectivism and pacifism. Then the actual freeing of Bandakar took hardly any time at all. Insurrection against a occupying power can be a fairly interesting thing, but Goodkind seemed like arguing for pages about philosophy (In a very poor manner mind you) is more interesting than actually talking about how the battle was fought.I feel almost ripped off after reading this book. Much of it was completely uninteresting and the interesting parts were fleeting. I will most likely read the next book in the series because I have invested so much time in to the series. But, there is no way I'm going to one of his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop","review":"This book was light years ahead of Pillars of creation as far as quality, but would have been MUCH better if it were a stand alone book without Richard or Kahlan... it could be in a new world, or a story centered around the more minor characters (such as Nathan or Verna)... it would have only taken a few small changes to make this a stand alone book so we dont have to see another \\"Villain of the week\\"I am a little tired of the first 50 pages reminding us where we are...then some bad guy comes out of nowhere and causes problems for our hero and then they are dispached... maenwhile i guess Emporor Jagang is just waiting miles away eating food and drinking beer waiting for the end of the series...These are rapidly turning into pulp books that resemble a serial much more than an epic saga...Please take 3 years off and write a good book Mr. Goodkind. I know you can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In a word \\"Disaster\\"! This book was terrible! I agree with the reviewers that stated TG was preaching at us. I skipped over all the boring lectures and didn't miss a thing! TG needs to get back on track or give up writing. My recommendation is that you borrow this book from a friend or get it from a library. Do not spend money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A trifle disappointing","review":"Oh Terry, where did you go wrong?The start of the sword of truth series was absolutely fantastic, it draws you in and you can't put it down. But now you have become all philisophical on us.This book will be a disappointment to all those that enjoyed Wizard's First Rule, but I'm sure that most fans will opt to buy the novel anyway out of shear hope that Terry will dig himself out of the hole that he created with Pillars of the Earth. Coincidently, if you enjoyed that, you should enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been an enthusiastic fan of this series since Wizard's First Rule. I dislike the fact that neither the characters nor the plot are developing in any meaningful way. I found Naked Empire to be wordy, preachy, and spending WAY too much time reviewing the previous 7 books in the series. If the author had something NEW happen, he wouldn't have to explain all these old story elements. I love these characters but this book felt like filler. I stopped reading Robert Jordan when he started writing 'filler' in order to fulfill his dream of a 12 book series. I'd hate to see Mr. Goodkind follow in those footsteps. This was my least favorite book in my favorite series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of the political and moralizing.","review":"Enough of the moralizing, there was only about 100 pages of story here. Same as the last book. The first four books in this series were outstanding, but downhill after that. I want to see big armies, wizards, action, Richard winning some battles, this is going nowhere. To sum it up, we have 100s of pages of downtrodden and sick Richard with all the political stuff, and then about 20 pages of what you expected at the end of the book.This is the last one of this series I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock Bottom","review":"Friends, I have read all and re-read some of the books in this series. Goodkind has a stack of great books. This is not his finest hour. I know you have read the other reviews like I have. I tossed this book in the trash about page 400. I really tried to like this book. It literaly ground to a halt. I came to the decision that no matter where the author took it, I didn't care anymore. It is a shame because I have invested a great deal in Richard and Kahlan like many of you have. The characters have become flat. The plots are predictable and series stale. Wait for the reviews before you buy the next one and skip this effort. I can't say it any more plainly. I will buy the next one because of Goodkind's body of work and not the last book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The adventures of a overly powerful character and saving the world are classic stories. But this... this is garbage. I admit I had not read the previous books to these, but the philosophy that Richard holds and his thought processes on what is good and evil sickened me. Sometimes I felt the need to, and had to, skip pages to get somewhere. The killing of Pacifists did it for me though, that is what made me finally put the book down.Down right awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, once again","review":"Another book in the Sword of Truth series and another disappointment. Once again Goodkind has occupied countless pages with his philosophical discussions on good vs. evil and the need to fight for freedom (I happen to agree with him but this is a STORY, not a lecture!). I found myself actually scanning past these paragraphs frequently since they were already so comprehensively covered in previous books of the series. There were times when the story became interesting but, in my opinion, Terry doesn't show us any wonders as he did in the first few books. There's nothing really new here plot-wise if you've read the last few books. A lot of people have claimed that Goodkind ripped off ideas from Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. While there are definitely similarities between the two, the worst idea he has ripped from Jordan is that of turning an otherwise very good fantasy series into a cash cow. I don't think I'll read the next book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my .02","review":"After having read the book I came to the conclusion that this particular series is already one book too many for my interest.Mr. Goodkind is a writer and a good one, but the progress and substance of the series at this point in time no longer provide the appeal that I found within the first few books.I do however recommend buying at least the first four volumes of the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series since they introduce a fantastic, original and creative setting full of rich characters and problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"politics","review":"Please keep your political paranoia out of this book. If you want to read the father of preemptive strikes read Modesitt. He thoroughly explores the pros and cons, while Goodkind coats it over in simplistic fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please remember that your a writer, not a preacher","review":"Terry Goodkind is an excellent writer, but his latest book had me screaming for something to happen. He goes on for pages preaching his sociology views and such. Thats all good and everything, but not for pages on end.Some things that I did like about the book are: He got back to the story of Richard and Khalan and didn't get himself distracted with secondary characters that don't really play an important role. He also had a well planned and specific plot for this book, unlike his last book where it seemed like he was just throwing in things randomly to fill in his half formed thoughts.If your a die hard Goodkind fan then go ahead and get this in paperback, not hardback. For people that have never read his series before... you'll probably put this book down really fast because of a lack of loyaltyhappy reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry terry but this one is just bad","review":"yeah, im being generous by giving this 2 stars. i like this series, but this book is just really bad. the only reason i didnt give it a 1 is because the badguy nicholas the slide is pretty awesome. other than that, this book is awful. this is where terry really just went overboard with shoving his philosophy down the reader's throat. before in the other novels, i could bare it, because it was mostly disguised, or he was more focused on the story, but in naked empire, he really lost it. this book was bad. but! atleast the one after it is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story Continues","review":"At first I was a bit distracted by this book, but as I got into it the more that I enjoyed it. Terry Goodkind did a great job of introducing us to the group of people known as \\"the banished\\" and told a wonderful story about what had happened to them. This is not the best book in the bunch, but a story is being told that is rich with history and culture. One thing I enjoy about Terry's writing is that he truly tells the story, and doesn't just give his readers quick action scenes that are interesting but leave one wondering as to why something was done. I really enjoyed learning more about how the country became divided and how it is all unraveling and the long term effects. This is a good addition to the story, and at the end, you understand why it needed to be written, but we did need to find out what happened to Nicholas.... at least I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More naked less empire","review":"Just finished the seventy third installment of the sword of truth saga and it shows no sign of stopping. Sheesh, this author makes Homer look like the zen master of brevity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have read 8 of the 11 in the series, and recently purchased the last 3. I have really gotten wrapped up in the characters. This is the best I have read, on good verses evil battles. Richard and Kahlan have survived the most extreme situations beyond imagination. Richard also befriends the most unlikely creatures and enemies to his advantage. I will soon be finished with the series and I truley regret not bieng connected to them anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"redemption is good","review":"i just started reding this eigth book (im about 250 pages in) and i must say that where pillars of creation was an ok individual novel its good to see a sword of truth book from goodkind again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy or Philosphy??","review":"I have finally found time to catch up on both the SoT and the WOT series. Now having worked my way through Book 8 of SoT and Book 9 of WoT, I am determined to end my own series in 5, possibly 6, books.Ok about \\"Naked Empire.\\" I enjoyed the parts with Zedd and Nathan and Chase. And it was good that Adie was back in the story. Those vibrant charaters basically saved the book. Having said that, the book could have easily been reduced by 200 - 250 pages. All authors, myself included, tend to inject our life phlosophies into our stories. Unfortunately, TG went overboard in Naked Empire. I found myself skipping over Richard's pedantic preaching. Hopefully TG will rediscover his story-telling abilities in Book 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"End the series...PLEASE!","review":"Goodkind's excellent, multi-faceted and stunning book, \\"Wizard's First Rule,\\" hooked me into the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series. However, \\"Naked Empire\\" stank. Political and philosophical views aside, I got plain tired of reading the author's painfully repetitive and boring descriptions, narratives and philosophies. \\"Let's read several MORE pages about how Richard feels about this subject...AGAIN\\" It's as if Goodkind had to quickly fill a quota of required pages to meet a deadline. He did this by desperately stretching out the the story thin with a lot of repetitive and bland drivel. Goodkind has run out of ideas and needs to end this series quickly (PLEASE!). Otherwise, it's like beating a dead gar. Which this book has already done - over, and over, and over again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"now he goes after the hippies with the communists","review":"I like the series as a whole but the quality of the books has been falling off as he does the same theing over and over again. Unlike almost every other reader of the series, I loved The Pillars of Creation. It was a breath of fresh air in a series that is stagnating. The aspect of the books that I can't tolerate anymore is the constant preaching. There wasn't much of that in the early books, but it happens every couple of pages now. Could Goodkind be more of an obvious card carrying Republican? From the anit-socialism, to the anti-peace movement, he continues to spout political ideaologies. My favorite by far is the whole \\"don't take away my magic\\" thing. This reminds me a little too much of the NRA. \\"Don't take away my magic, I needs it to protect my family. I don't want the evil gov'ment messin' wit my rights.\\" If the next book isn't less preachy, I don't think I'll bother to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to 5 year olds","review":"This book is without a doubt the worst of the series. The author not only regurgitates many of the events contained in previous books, he fills the pages with the same monotonous drivil over and over again until one just wants to put the book down never to pick it up again. In addition, not much new material in the entire book. Most of it is spent walking on the same trail day after day until the reader is left wishing it would just end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks, and I really liked Wizards First Rule","review":"This is a horrible book. Seriously, just stop reading the series.I like Wizard's First Rule a lot. It was an excellent book. And then each book in the series got progressively worse. But at least the books before this one were readable.This book moves extremely slow (don't want to spoil it for those who might actually read it), but is very lousy. The book tries to compare Richard's empire to democracy, and the Imperial Order to communism. Really, one of the worst fantasy books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really like this series, but.......","review":"I've had trouble actually getting through book #8.Normally I stay fairly interested the entire book through, as things continue to happen, and the storyline progresses. But this book has just been about walking, and more walking, and even MORE walking. Then, a talk about philosophy, and being good or bad to people for pages on end. PLEASE just make the constant rambling stop and continue on with the story.I probably could have skipped this entire book & not really missed anything. About halfway through the book, I almost couldn't stand it and actually just skipped several pages at a time. I just don't understand how this really relates to the story & plot as a whole. it's just talking about the same thing over and over.I'm hoping Chainfire is better than Naked Empire.... I'm still waiting for the paperback version... Hardcover is too much to spend on a book. But that's another matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same","review":"If you like the series , it is more of the same. I like it .My only issue with Terry Goodkind writing is TO MUCH review of what has happened in other books , its like 1/3 of every book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end for a great series","review":"This was the first book where Goodkind made me stomach through one of Richard's adventures. Pillars was subpar as well, but it was missing its star characters, so I made due. After \\"Faith of the Fallen\\", which was my favorite, there was very little left in this series (note: I didn't bother with Oomen Machine,nor will I ever). From this book on you will not miss much if you just decide to move on to Martin, Rothfuss, Sullivan or Abercrombie.This was the first series I read besides Tolkien, and the moments from Wizard's First Rule to Faith of the Fallen will stay with me (probably forever), but unless you have OCD or just have to know what happens you're likely to be disappointed by what's to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Empire","review":"I felt that this book was very well written. I will be reading on in Terry Goodkind\`s series of The Sword of Truth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the weakest up to this point","review":"Background: I really enjoyed the 1st book (Wizard's) and loved 2-6. I was a little disappointed with book 7 (Pillars), but still thought it was worth reading. This book (Naked) is not a good read. It's very long-winded when re-stating the same old philosophy and retelling history--what happened in the previous books--to new characters, however some action scenes are completely glossed over with the briefest of summaries. There is almost know character development and no interesting/likable new characters.I considered giving up on the series because of this book, but I'm going to stick it out for one more novel. When I review that one, I will probably make a decision on whether or not I should have stopped with Faith of the Fallen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this book was the best yet in the sword of truth books it pulls you in to this world of magic and war you root for richard and all the other s involved with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I was so excited.... =(","review":"Well folks, I do believe that Mr. Goodkind has lost his edge. I will make this review short because it doesn't take much to see how much one was dissappointed.If you don't like slow books, don't read it. If you hated that stupid little goat, don't read it. If you had a MILLION questions after the last few books ended and are expecting some answers, don't read it. If you hate books that have chapter after chapter of one charcacter say the same stupid thing over and over again, don't read it.At one point I even said out loud, \\"OKAY! I get it Richard! get on with it!\\"The ending is so lame I laughed out loud.Good luck. I hope you get more out of it then I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully tedious","review":"The author is fond of describing pain and suffering in excruciating detail. Well, that is nothing compared to what you will endure if you try to read this. It is one thing to instill moral, ethical, political, and economic beliefs and values into a story but it is unbearable and unacceptable to wade through this brutal repetition, and redundancy. I feel like the same basic concept has been rehashed half a hundred times from every possible combination of possible outcomes and perspectives.Spare yourselves. If you want a book on ethical decision making...buy one, there are lots of good ones out there. If you want to read about what comprises a freely governed society consider reading the Federalist Papers. If you want to read good fantasy, stick with the earlier books or look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of the Sword","review":"The first 6 books of the series were fun to read. Filling his tales with magic and serpentine plots, the reader could ignore his sophmoric writing, but with 'Pillars of Creation' the series started coming apart. 'Naked Empire' is the final nail in the coffin. (I hope) The first quarter of the book is nothing but a retelling of the first 7 books as the characters move from the middle of a desert to it's edge. The plot twists are transparent, the writing dull and repetitive. It reminds me of the Hardy Boy books I used to read when I was 10 years old, except for the extreme violence. Mr. Goodkind has a creepy fascination with rape and violence and that disqualifies this as a children's book, but that is basically what it is. The author spends hundreds of pages saying absolutely nothing and I for one, was insulted. To quote Terry Goodkind, \\"Dead is Dead\\". Let's hope he heeds his own advice and spares us any more trips to this very dry well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Ayn Rynkind chokes again","review":"Okay, I really like the first few books of this series. Interesting characters, good plot, above average writing. My wife and I even enjoyed listneing to the audio version on a long drive.I refuse to buy another book.Things have gone downhill on a fairly steady slope for the past three books. Kahlan calls it right when she said all the trouble started with the chimes. The last book was a cut and past of Atlas Shrugged and this book continues to brow beat you with garbage. And the worst part is that he repeats himself repeatedly. (Ha) If you need to remind people of relevant plot moments in the past...that's why the preface was invented!What is the problem with fantasy these days? Jordon is DOA, Goodkind is following. I hope Martin is able to shoulder the burden and demonstrate how to move a plot forward.Boo hiss. How do these things make it past the editors?Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags, what a steaming pile!","review":"Violence begets violence! Blah, blah, blah! Piffle and snot! What ever happened to sci-fi fantasy for fantasy's sake? What's with Richard preaching for page after page to these dimwitted morons? I get it, already. I got it the first time Richard explained the need for righteous violence and self-preservation. No need to keep repeating the same message, over and over, throughout this boring tome.You are losing me, Terry. I took this book on vacation with me, looking forward to an improvement over PoC. Boy, do I have SUCKER written on my forehead. Please don't tell me you are taking your \\"sci-fi fantasy series writing\\" tips from Robert Jordan. He hit bottom and then started digging.Don't do it, Terry. Put the shovel down and step away from the pile of crap that you are digging into. You will pass Mr. Jordan on the way down, if you are not careful.Your reputation as a respectable writer is worth much more than the money your are trying to milk out of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Terry...Why????","review":"Why are you doing this to your fans Mr. Goodkind? What is the point to this book? If you read Book 6, you could skip book 7 and this one, #8, and not be at all lost. There is no overall plot advancement in Naked Empire. Richard preaches, Kahlan and Cara worry about him, the New Order is still stuck outside D'Hara. This story is the equivalent to a sidequest in a fantasy RPG. There are also inconsistancies with previous books. Why was Richard's sister able to detect Zedd's Wizard's Fire in book #7 and save Jajang by getting in front of it at the Confessor's palace, but none of the other pillar's of creation can see it in Naked Empire? Mr. Goodkind should try getting off the soapbox and going back to writing a good fantasy story. If you haven't yet read this book, don't bother. You don't miss anything important to characters or main story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Straw","review":"Good Gracious. What a mess that was: six hundred odd pages of \\"Don't compromise with evil, it makes you evil\\" repeated over and over and over again. At least the \\"moral\\" was learned by all (Gee whiz, thanks for the lesson, mister), and the bad guys got it in the end (evil soul snatchers and silly hippies alike). Sheesh. I echo the question of where did the plot go? It doesn't matter the politics Goodkind pushes, without plot who really cares? While I'm complaining, he pulled the \\"war wizards' magic responds to need\\" trick one two many times too. At least Goodkind did me the favor of saving me [from] each subsequent book in this series: I am officially done."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more","review":"The loss of quality that this series have suffered is staggering, just as with Robert Jordans books. I feel saddened that these two talented authors have turned into this. What is worse with Goodkind though is the horrible political message - masquerading as philosophy - that is hammered into the reader at all opportunities.It's terribly hard to stop buying these once excellent series of books that many of us have invested a decade in following, but for my part I can no longer pay for this utter rubbish. If you haven't read George R.R. Martin, Steven Erikson or Robin Hobb turn to them for salvation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Terry run out of ideas?","review":"I really enjoyed all the other Sword of Truth series and I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunatly this was the most boring repetative book I've read in a long time.We get it. Stop repeating yourself over and over. I couldn't believe how many times Goodkind repeated the same thing. The only part that was the least bit interesting was when Zed got rescued.Thats the last one for me. Too bad I really liked the Mordsith and Richard. TOO PREACHY!! AND A GOAT???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing political rant!","review":"Having loved the first 4 books in the series I had high hopes that Goodkind might have learned to refrain from pushing his political/social views and focus on giving his loyal readers a great story and great writing. Unfortunately not. This time it isn't \\"greed is good\\" but that \\"might is right\\". Although I might disagree with his extreme and simplistic preaching on these topics , that isn't the real problem. The fact is he lets it get in the way of telling the story and developing the characters. You also can't help but wonder if Goodkind isn't a serious misogynist - the female characters are timid or stupid or as an alternative evil.It's a shame to see a story and series that left me eagerly awaiting the next installment - reduced to something I almost dread to read. Shame on you Mr Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...a Robert Jordan repeat","review":"I used to read the Sword of Truth till my eyes started to bleed...but that was when I was ten, and had not quite discovered the world of truly awesome literature. Honestly, I haven't touched the stuff since I heard that there was a 6th or 7th book out. I went down that road with Robert Jordan, and...well...thanks but no thanks. There is only so much I can take, and anyone writing beyond five or six books needs to do us a favor and just cut it out, or divide it up into different series, as David Eddings did in the Belgariad and Mallorean. Eddings, while not an overly sophisticated writer, at least figured out how not to bore his readers to tears.I agree with earlier reviewers: Read George R. R. Martin. Although the series is a long time in completion, it is totally worth it. Can anyone say amazing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, kill this series.","review":"Man, morbid curiosity and the hope that Goodkind kills off Richard, Kahlen, Zeb, et al in one fell swoop and promises that he won't write another fantasy novel, are what keeps me reading this miserable series.Wizard's First Rule was scripting by the numbers but pretty good. Stone of Tears was good, as was Blood. Everything else was bad. While it would appear that this series has quite a lot of followers, I can't explain how Martin, Keyes, Eriksson, Hobbs and Marco aren't more read more than this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked Empire","review":"Though still good reading, and I will continue to read Terry's books, it appears he is running out of gas. This book is wordy beyond belief and could have been pared down to half the pages and been a five star book.

What I have taken away so far is: Freedom good. Enslavement bad.I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. If you're annoyed by my repetition, then you now know how I feel about this book. In fact, I have been losing interest with this series for a while now. Goodkind pounds his philosophies into each book with infuriating tediousness.The story interested me in the beginning, although I sometimes felt like I was being talked down to like I was a kindergartener. I wanted to stick with it, though, despite the long-winded narratives / dialogues. The only reason I am still sticking with it is because I've already paid for the rest of the series on Audible.com. How very sorry I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic, just preaching ideals.","review":"I'll be short and to the point. This books lacks the magic and intrigue of the previous ones. It's a bad Ayn Rand knock off. I love Goodkind's earlier books and I love Ayn Rand, but if i want to read Ayn Rand, I'm going to read one of her much more interesting and well written books.Predictable, preachy, and lacking any magic.I strongly do no recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left for a newcomer!","review":"In the beginning, I thought this series was awesome, but just like Jordan, this one seems to just roll along without generating the excitement and anticipation it once had. I long for the good ole days of battles and scenes that get your heart pumping and you read until you suddenly realize it's 3 in the morning.There's always parts to every book that I do enjoy, but this one just didn't have enough of them for me. Some of the scenes were good, but there were too many I simply didn't care for.Those in need of epic fantasy which will excite should try The Unsuspecting Mage. This is a first book by a new up and coming author who knows what it means to be a reader! It left me saying wow! when I turned the last page. Magic, gods, secret pasages, enigmatic creature, what more can you ask for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sword of Rust","review":"First let me say I am a Goodkind fan from his very first book. Any true fan anywhere hangs on through thick and thin to support the team or in this case, the author. These, I am afraid, are thin times indeed. More soup in this newest story than meat or even vegetables. I got the audio book this time around so I could fast forward through all the philosophies expounded on to the inth degree. In the future Goodkind must decide to tell me a story, as only he can, or teach a class on philosophy. Goodkind, please do not try to do both again in the next book. Have mercy on your true fans who walk the worlds of your vision cheering and booing the population you have unleashed there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Needs to Be Put Out of My Misery.","review":"After Pillars of Creaton I was hoping Goodkind would get back on track, and concentrate this newest book on Richard. Unfortunately, he did. Don't get me wrong, there were good parts too; every section without Richard in it was good. Goodkind is becoming absolutely obsessed with having Richard do nothing more than spew out Goodkind's own philosophy on life. Every time Richard started \\"preaching\\" his doctrine of reason, I got a mental image of Goodkind wearing a filthy monks robe and foaming at the mouth while screaming at the top of his lungs that reason will be your salvation, and anyone who doesn't agree should be put to the sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Empire","review":"I'm happy with \\"naked empire\\" since it didn't continue in the horrible path of \\"pillars of creation\\". There are a lot of good parts in this book where Mr. Goodkind creates new ways for Richard and Kahlan to suffer. Of course they come out all right because hey we can't lose the main characters right? If you are an avid fan of the sword of truth series then you will love this book for continuing in those footsteps. However if you had any trouble reading \\"faith of the fallen\\" or thought it went on and on about the morality of everything... you won't like this book. With all of the cruddy fantasy authors out there Terry Goodkind offers hope for the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another challenge from Terry Goodkind.","review":"I own all the Sword of Truth books and I love them all! True to the typical Terry Goodkind style of writing, this book is full of the kind of stuff we've all come to expect from him. Unfortunately, though, the plotline suffers sometimes from his over-use of details. In a few places, he goes on for pages describing Kahlan using her power or how Richard uses the Sword of Truth, which, for those of us die-hard Goodkind fans, don't need to be explained in such depth. It almost makes it boring when you reach those parts. Other times, though, the story is exciting and I could hardly pull myself away. Over all, it's a good story, if you don't mind the occasional rambling of Richard, as well as the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a shame","review":"It's a shame that every time you start to get drawn into the storyline in this book, that you're interrupted for a 3 or 4 page lecture on Terry Goodkind's political views.Terry, if you happen to read this: We don't give a flying whatfor for your political views. Somewhere between Blood of The Fold and this current entry in the series, the whole thing turned from a great fantasy adventure, with outstanding character devlepment, into a platform for you to give dissertations on your opinions.We. Don't. Care.Get back to storytelling, and save this series before it becomes utter trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Philisophical","review":"I have nothing against philosophy, in a philosophy book. I have enjoyed all of Goodkind's books up till now. Some have been better than others, but all were enjoyable.The main problem with this book was the philosophy. The philosophy he is putting forth is objectivism. I like objectivist philosophy, but from the original writer, Ayn Rand. While it is OK to have a certain philosophy for your characters to work within, Goodkind slaps it on way to thick.The writing style itself is good as you would expect from Goodkind and the actual story line that has a villain and a fight between good and evil is solid. The problem is is that nothing happens. The action is slow and boring; Richard is once again sick, a recurring problem that has to me been used too much; and the book spends way too much time talking about philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is ENOUGH","review":"Wizard's first rule was really good, however the pace of deterioration fastens with each book.The last two books were horrible.Count me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissappointment","review":"As many others have said... This book is one big philosophical rant. I really thoroughly enjoyed the earlier books, honestly I did. This just did not do it for me. Too much political ranting... Too little character developement that REALLY made the earlier books so totally amazing. I read it because I want to finish the series, but unless you're into that, I don't really recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"The first book in the series \\"Sword of Truth\\" was great, after that it has only gone downhill. From copying whole ideas from Robert Jordan's books, to now just taking a detour. The whole book is a phylosofical detour, nothing related to the plotline happens, and if you skip it good for you.

One year he took me to see the Nutcracker Ballet and I remembered the whole story from this book. Now that I am a mother, I looked for this book for my own daughter and immediately recognized the cover even though it has been over 20 years! I was so pleasantly surprised to realize it was Maurice Sendak who had illustrated it. He is also the author of my other favorite book from my youth, Outside Over There, of which I have a signed first edition that I will pass on to my daughter. I was sad to have lost track of this book, but delighted to have tracked it down again. I hope my daughter cherishes it as much as I did, and I look forward to reading it to her when she is a bit older."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting story in a beautifull book!","review":"This interpretation of Hoffman's Nutcracker is unlike the traditional ballet that arrives for the Christmas holidays. Maurice Sendak's magical illustrations coupled with a unique story makes for an exciting evening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I think most people are familiar with the story of the the Nutcracker. Although I have seen the Nutcracker ballet and read some simplified versions of it, I had never read the full story until I was given the chance to review this copy by E.T.A. Hoffmann and illustrated by Maurice Sendak. It is actually a much longer book than I thought it would be! There are scenes that I never new about from my previous reading or viewing of the story. I found it very interesting! It is nicely broken up into shorter chapters, and my kids enjoyed listening to one a day. Maurice Sendak is well known for illustrating the book Where the Wild Things Are and I think he did a very lovely job with the Nutcracker as well. There are some full page illustrations as well as small ones on most of the other pages. If you are looking for a good version of the original Nutcracker to add to you bookshelves, I highly recommend this one!I received this book free for review from Waterbrook Multnomah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kids","review":"We purchased this book after attending the Pacific Northwest Ballet��s famous Stowell & Sendak Nutcracker.

LaCie uses these for several larger size external drives. LaCie was not cooperative to help me since I was a few months out of warranty. In looking into this, I was surprised to find a useful page at MacinTouch.com which had literally hundreds of negative comments regarding this type of power adapter failing, dating back to June of 2005. If interested, read the comments at this website and judge for yourself - before buying your next LaCie product:http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/harddrives/topic2190.htmlLaCie might have rightfully issued a \\"product recall\\" for these overheating adapters (round plug with 4 prongs), but they have elected to ignore hundreds of complaints, while continuing to sell the adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy, hot and now, toast","review":"I bought this product for the same reason as many others - its design works perfectly with the Mac Mini, more so than other external drives with similar form factors.But (and this is a HUGE but), I found it to be very noisy and hot. My roommate complained that it should be turned off at night as it kept her awake...from the living room to her bedroom.

At home I stack two 250gbs under my Mini and they are silent.I am considering returning it, but I like the usb and firewire ports, the design, and it's half a terabyte!

Even my MacPro is quieter than this! The drives run quite hot as well, to the point where you don't want to touch them. Other external enclosures, while not as spiffy looking as the MiniHub, keep my drives much cooler and are far quieter.

From reading the back cover, you'd think that you could fire up the ol' soldering iron and actually get some work done. Definitive repair guide? Definitely not.Information is too general, with circuits as block diagrams only. Considering the complexity of TV circuits, this is a no-no. Included schematics don't tell you what ICs or components do, with general references like IC304 and D101. You'd be hard pressed to make sense of a circuit even if you have electronics as a background. What more if you are a beginner?Better information, guidelines and help can be found over the net in the form of usegroups, independent and manufacturer's web sites.Bad way to spend 30 bucks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not for Beginners","review":"Certainly there are quite a lot of information in this book. But to say it's for beginners is misleading. The book lack organization. Many technical jargon is just put out without explanation. Sentences that need explanation are not explained. If you wanna start from scratch this is not the book for you, you may need to look for another book. However the book may be good as a reference for solving specific problems as done in the later chapters. But frankly I couldn't get any good understanding of TV inners from the first chapters. Also the figures are horrible. Name of ICs in the diagrams do not match the text description. And many diagrams for vital components are just black and white photographs that doesn't show you anything but confuse you.Again, not recommended for a beginner or as a sole reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good way to start tv repairs","review":"The book teaches general knowledge on tv repairs its good for a layman not for professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for a Cards fan","review":"If you have this fridge and love the Cardinals, there is no alternative!

My 11 year old son was NOT using this as a practice sword, and there are no obvious signs of misuse, like he was hitting trees or rocks or anything! However, when I contacted the seller, they indicated that they only give refunds or exchanges within the first 30 days. I am very dissapointed! I'm not sure how this sword would hold up to actual daily practice by a martial artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It's just not the Orbital I'm used to. The album, also known as the 'Green Album', is actually a collection of singles and tracks made from 1989 to 1991. I don't want to be taken wrongly - this is a good album. There are 'Satan', 'Chime', 'Belfast' and 'Midnight'. These are great songs that are \\"carrying\\" the Orbital trademark that the latter albums have. And taking a closer listen, well... it doesn't have the emotions and the \\"atmospheric landscape sound\\" of like, let's say 'In-Sides' and 'Orbital 2'.If you're an Orbital fan and don't have the 'Green Album', than don't hesitate for a minute - this is a must have, so you'll be able to listen to the early sound (late 80's/early 90's) of Orbital's work. But not a good place for a start; rather than this get the two albums I mentioned earlier ('I-S' and 'O2') to get the full listening pleasure of the ethereal music of the Hartnoll brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album That Can Hold Its Own","review":"When people talk about the great albums of Orbital, they always talk about the brown album or Orbital 2 where Orbital really came into their own or In-Sides which features Orbital at their best in experimentation. However, the \\"green\\" album or Orbital 1 should not be overlooked. This is great, happy house music at its finest. Some great tracks abound here including Chime, Ooo Laa, Belfast, and Satan. The last track would have 2 different versions that would pop up on the bonus CD of In-Sides. However, my favorite track may be Speed Freak as it has an absolutely unreal re-mix by one of my all-time favorites and techno God, Moby. This CD is worth buying just for this one track. So, the next time people are trying to tell you what the best Orbital CD is, just sit there and smile and say, \\"Yea, the brown album and In-Sides are great, but the green album is just as good. It is definitely the most danceable.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Orbital?","review":"Brilliant as their last few albums have been, Orbital's self-titled debut is not worth your attention. Maybe it hasn't aged well, or maybe it was never any good to being with, but this album simply sounds like fifth-rate techno. God knows there's already enough of that around. Some of the sounds they use are so hackneyed that it will make you cringe, and even the harmonic high-points are marred by limpid beats. The only evidence that this was made by the same Orbital that is so high above the crowd today is the name on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again Dj Waxxy is very stupid.........","review":"This cd was pretty good. I had some of orbital's later stuff before i got this and its neat to hear how they started off.

He is dumb and has no original ideas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series I've ever read","review":"Wow! These books are phenominal. The characters are rich and the pace is non stop.

The best series of books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the suspense, humor, and light horror one could ask for","review":"Anita Blake is a character you can't help but like. She's tough (but not too tough), she's witty (gotta love her remarks when she's in trouble), and she knows how to find trouble.The writing is well-paced and has humor sprinkled throughout that really touches the right spot for me. Perhaps we think alike, but I find that just when things are getting too serious, the situation is lightened by Anita's wit.I love vampire stories and I especially like that these stories don't get wrapped so much around the sexual side of things like Anne Rice's stories so often do. A major change of pace that is most welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok.","review":"i was pretty bored at times reading this. i am going to try the next book hopefully it gets more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, just don't get it","review":"This was the first vampire book I ever read.

I watched and owned all seven season of Buffy, never like Angel (series, not the character)so I was left with a big hole after buffy went off the air.I tried Rice before but never liked it, so this book was going to be a new try on the genre.I was gladly suprised. The story is quite interesting and the way it flows at times it is a bit hard to follow. I blame this on so many characters for an introductory book.The main character most of time did not know what was going on, but the reader was quite aware of the situations. I was gladly surprised with who the killer was, but not happy with two of the deaths in the book (human and vampire, no names so no spoiler here)I give it four stars because it had too much info at times and too little on some.I will try the second and third book in the series to see what really happens with Ms. Blake.Nice reading for Horror / Vampire genre"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sci-Fi series around!","review":"The only reason I didn't rate this book 5 stars is because the rest of the books in the series are even better! The beauty of this series is you can pick up any one of the books in it and be transported into the fantastical alternate universe of Anita Blake without feeling as if you've missed something by not reading all the books. Not many series can boast that! Laurell K. Hamilton out did herself with \\"Nightseer,\\" but she went over the edge with Anita! Long live Jean Claude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Entertainment","review":"The Anita Blake series by Laurell K Hamilton is an excellent read if you are looking for mild thrills and romance.

This is beautifully written novel, that grabs you from the first paragraph, and holds on tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic escapist trash","review":"This book is from the literary equivalent of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer genre. Think humourous and light-hearted and you won't go far wrong.

This series is a perfect read for those times when you don't have the stamina required for a Booker prize nominee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome - give me Jean Claude","review":"Wow, what more can you say? Violence, romance, vampires, and Anita Blake made for many hours of enjoyment. I found it hard to lay the book down but decided to pace myself so I could enjoy it longer.

Thank you Laurell, my mind is enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a Mercy Thompson, Kate Daniels and Rachel Morgan fan, and I was so hoping to add Anita Blake to that list but, alas, it was not meant to be. I kept feeling like I was not properly situated in Blake's world as though I missed a book preceding this one, and a lot of what happened did not make sense to me both from a background perspective and based on logic (why did the vamps keep trying to kill her when they needed her to find the vamp murderer?). I then read synopses of the rest of the books in the series to see if anything intrigued me enough to continue, and it looked like an utter train wreck.

Hamilton has made an alternate world seem real.","review":"Having read \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", I was starved for more on Anita Blake, a 5'3\\" vampire executioner who must now go by the book instead of just killing the blood suckers on sight. Ms. Hamilton's characters seem real, they walk and talk like anyone you might meet on the street, but they could be lycanthropes, vampires, witches, fairies or zombies. I loved it so much, I jumped at the chance to own all 6 tales contained in 2 anthologies and I can even see this rich character driven tale on the silver screen. Tom Cruise, you've played Lestat, how about trying Jean Claude? The hardest part of course will be casting Anita Blake, but maybe Julianna Margulies will consider the role. If you like tales of the dark side, of witches, goblins and werewolves, Anita Blake will take you there. You won't regret the trip. As a long time reader and hobby writer of horror fiction, I have now found a new \\"favourite author\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the hype?","review":"The current avg. rating for this book is 4 stars. I don't know why. I had a difficult time with liking this book. It was just not appealing and didn't capture me. This is my 1st Hamilton novel and I'm afraid I'll have to past on the rest of the series. Especially if she continues the use of fragment sentences. It was a little too much. Hard to understand at times.Ms. Hamilton dives right into her story without taking any time to clarify what the world is like. She mentions the issue of vampires wanting legal rights and proceeds to introduce a handful of crazy, murderous vampires, leaving you to wonder why anyone would ever consider lobbying to give them legal protection. Most of the characters in the book are strangely inconsistent and erratic. The Master Vampire demands that Anita help her solve a mystery and then spends most of the book terrorizing Anita and preventing her from making any headway on the case. Just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly entertaining","review":"I really wanted to love this book because I'm a big fan of both classic pulp fiction and horror/fantasy but unfortunately, when Laurell Hamilton collided these two genres together, I wasn't crazy about the result. Although she creates a new, alternate universe where vampires and other scary creatures are a regular part of our world, I feel like I've seen all this stuff before. I almost put the book aside after I finished the first chapter but I stuck with it and I have to admit that I'm glad I did. Although I didn't love the book, it kept me turning the pages to find out what monstrous situation Anita Blake would find herself in next. The book ended up being fairly entertaining in a \\"mind candy\\" kind of way. There's an outside chance that I might pick up another Anita Blake book someday if I'm really yearning for another vampire underworld detective story (especially if someone tells me they get a lot better after the first book), but I kind of doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised : not a romance","review":"I was sold this book as a racey romance. It was really a fairly stupid vmpire hunting detective story. Don't be fooled, unless you like light detective stuff.

The book looks like it has been in a library for many years, to the point where the pages are falling out of the book, it doesn't even appear that all the pages are even in the book to begin with. I'm beyond angry, and glad I only paid 5 dollars, but at the same time I should have just went out and bought the book for 7 dollars and gotten brand new.

I wish that I not started this book and series right before finals week haha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series Through First Several Books","review":"The first 6 books about Anita Blake were great! Unfortunately, after a great start the series starts to lack a plot or creative story line. The author's focus on group sex is initially exciting, but quickly becomes the focus of each book. After book 8, the erotica is very repetitive and consumes the majority of each novel. I feel Anita needs to put her clothes back on, get out of bed, and get back to work being a necromancer. Many readers agree that the series takes an unwelcome turn but the faithful do antipate a change back to Anita's original moxy. We aren't seeing it so far, as her latest, Mika is more of the same. I'm concerned that on Ms. Hamilton's website, she pretty much tells her disappointed readers too bad, if you don't like it, don't read it. Money can do that I guess. This edition is a re-print. The original can be found through your library network. I will keep watch and hope that her next book in 2007 reverts to the original form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!","review":"A real exiting book! Rivals Buffie any day!!

The only thing that kept me from giving the book five stars is they tend to be a little bloody for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read in one day!","review":"I am a big fan of Buffy, and when my friend recommended the series to me, I can see why he did. The character of Anita Blake is like Buffy, only tougher! The way Hamilton writes is entertaining,the plot is easy to follow, and I love Anita's sense of humor. I also like that we can see the vulnerable side of Anita too. She is not a one dimensional character by any means. I am reading the second book in the series now.. and I am wondering what is going to occur between Anita and JeanClaude. Seems rather promising. I am sure that I will finish the series all the way up to \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" and it is definitely the best Vampire series I have read since Anne Rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Blake is the BOMB!!!","review":"This book really, really drew me in.

I just could not get into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"It's a shame we can't rate on less than a star.Maybe I'm just not a vampire story fan, but this book was awful and I can't even bring myself to finish it. I loved the Twilight series, and even Buffy was ok. This is not even bordering on ok. I would rather sit down and read bad romance novels than this garbage.The dialogue is lame and forced. The angry bad a** b***h thing Anita has going on is so annoying I'm hoping she gets killed off. Even the mythical creatures are cheesy. Vampires being afraid of crosses = lame. Yes, these things are part of typical legend, but the more recent books have broken out of typical legend to produce some really great stuff.I'm sure this book was ok when it was written in 1993, but in comparison to some of the Anne Rice books (which I don't care for personally but are well-written), the Buffy TV series, and the Twilight series, I really hate this book. It's like reading bad Buffy fan fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiobook: Loved the book, but the narrator was awful!","review":"First off, let me say that I've read the entire Anita Blake series and thoroughly enjoyed the first 9 or 10 books - after that, the books dropped in quality, both storyline and editing.It's been a few years since I read Guilty Pleasures, so I decided to listen to it on audio this time. *laughs* The narrator is fine when she delivers Anita's part, but she really shouldn't try so hard to do other characters' voices. Jean-Claude's French accent, and his magical enchanting voice, sound like a cross between a whiny lisp and a sinus infection. Other characters are just a bad Peter Lorre impression. Really, it would have been better if she just read the dialogue without imbellishing!Five stars for the original book, but gotta take one off in audio format!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Ideas, Poor Execution","review":"This may be someone else's cup of tea but it's not really mine. The world Hamilton has imagined is really quite interesting, very little time is spent explaining it in this first instalment but I did manage to grab on through the characters. What I couldn't get past was the writing style; there are so many sentences that are four words or less as well as many short paragraphs that feel like nothing was actually communicated to the reader. My eyes started to glaze over while attempting to get through such sections. I also felt nothing through the characters, not fear or squeamishness with the major villain, no anticipation or excitement with each new dangerous situation Anita jumped head first into and sadly, no subtle intensity with Jean-Claude and his connection to Anita.The world itself piqued my interest and I will give the next instalment a shot but if the writing doesn't improve then it will be a shame that I wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I started reading this series last year, and am anxiously awaiting the newest in this series. Now, I am re-reading. Anita Blake is one tuff cookie, that I haven't grown tired of. She narrates the book, in the old detective, Jack Webb, \\"Dragnet\\" style, which I really enjoyed. The characters in the book are so interesting, that you hope to hear more from them in future books (which, most do reappear, if they survive). Start with this book, if it sparks an interest, then keep going with the next. Anita's world,just gets more and more interesting, and relationships grow between her and the sups, especially Jean-Claude (now that's one interesting vamp)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book, and amazing author!","review":"I have never had a book character affect me in the way Anita does, she's amazing, sexy, funny, and professional! I just LOVE her! Anyone looking for a great read that hooks you from the beginning, and has everything ranging from your typical vampires, to wererats, to zombies, this is the book for you! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read, but be warned","review":"I liked this book. It isn't great literature, but it definitely good for some fun.I LIKED the main character, hard boiled, kickin' butt and takin' namesthe idea zombie-raising as a corporate enterprisethe police officers and Anita's interaction with them as a preturnatural consultantDISLIKED the weak plotcharacter inconsistenciesTHE WARNINGif you like these first few books in the series, if you allow yourself to become attached to Anita Blake and her development as a person, a necromancer, and a killer DO NOT READ any part of the series written in this century. Hamilton's sensuality becomes blatant sex and eventually turns into farcical sex romps with monsters. World, plot and character building are thrown aside and the plots become thinly veiled excuses for increasingly bizarre encounters with increasing numbers of nubile hotties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Vampire Book","review":"There are so few vampire books that are fun to read. I almost missed this since vampires are typically in the Horror section rather than the SciFi section. Glad I saw it.Anita Blake is so cool and tough. The action and sexual tension in the story keeps you right on edge. The vampires are vicious monsters, but something more. And Anita, who feels vampires are MONSTERS, is now attracted to one.Its nice to have a female vampire killer that is not totally inane and aimed at the younger crowd. Soooooooo much better and totally unlike Buffy. Repeat, this is not even close to Buffy. Yay! So much better than Anne Rice!Unfortunately, later in the series Laurell goes overboard on the graphic violence and sex. Especially the sex. If I want soft porn, I can get Playboy. Hopefully, it was the editor/publisher's idea and not her's. If you liked this, try Mercedes Lackey's Diana Tregarde novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proud over myself for finishing this book...","review":"... because it took a lot of effort! Nothing ever happens and I couldn't get myself to feel anything but irritation over the characters. The back said \\"what the Da Vinci Code has done for religious thrillers Anita Blake has done for vampire novels\\" (or something along those lines). What? Are you kidding me? Even though the Da Vinci Code isn't one of my favorite books at least it is entertaining. This one hasn't got anything on Sookie or the BDB. The review on the back also said that the book was \\"sexy\\"? What? Where, it was boring as hell! If you are looking for a good vampire novel read Sookie Stackhouse. If you want something more adult, read the Black Dagger Brotherhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I have read both Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series as well as her Merry Gentry series and I can't get enough of either of them! Can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider this series ~~ I did ~~ and I am glad~~~ !!","review":"Let me start this review by saying that I have read many discussions about this series - and have been hesitated to start it due to some of the feedback. I have owned this book for about a year and I have picked it up a couple times to start it and decided against it.Then I was talking to a fellow reader, who has similar taste - she recommended that I give it a read. I am glad she talked me into it - I finished the book in one day.I love to read different authors and genres, and my first experience with this author was great.I have requested the next book,The Laughing Corpse (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter), in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series from the Library - I hope to pick it up today.If you are like me and are hesitating to give this series a try - I would recommend taking a chance - I wasn't disappointed and I think you will agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"I'm too lazy to write a \\"real\\" review, so here's a list of things that annoyed me:- Horrible use of first-person point of view. Anita's constant internal monologue was obnoxious and confusing.- I feel like this book needed a prequel. I spent 3/4 of trying to figure out what the heck Anita was rambling about (her scars, fears, her profession, etc).- I realize this was written in 1993 (or thereabouts), but I'm really getting sick of vampires. Really.- I kept wondering if perhaps Anita would be in a better mood if she got laid (call me sexist all you want; I'm a female and that's the impression I kept getting from the book).All in all, I'm glad I borrowed the book from my roommate instead of buying it. It at least kept me busy for a few hours, and that's something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series!","review":"I can't believe I haven't read this author's books before but now that I have read the first book and loved it, I have ordered all the rest in the series. Anita is great. She's a strong character and she is all business in the first book. She is going to teach that little vampire girl a lesson if it kills her...and it just about does. Jean Claude is cool and is wanting to \\"woo\\" Anita in the worst way. Yes, \\"woo\\" is the word he actally starts using in another book of hers. I accidentally read the 3rd book first which is why I'm jumping ahead a bit. If you like the Charlene Harris series of Sookie and Kim Harrison's books, you will love this. I don't usually read vampire stories but I read a lot of mysteries and the character here reminds me of Kinsey Milhoun by Sue Grafton. She's very upbeat and funny and the action just keeps on moving along. Not a dull moment. Anita raises zombies as well as slays bad vampires so she is a very busy girl. Read them, you'll love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and Simple","review":"I bought the four book set of Hamilton's Novel and I have to say the other three better be more in depth than the first. This novel was extremly simple and not at all graphic. I really don't understand all of the reviews saying that these books are erotic and violent. I didn't find either in the first installment. I was able to finish it because it is a pretty simple read and the lead character ( a sort of no-nonsense BUFFY) sort of grows on you. But the story has NO DEPTH at all. I hate to compare novels but after reading \\"Let the right one in\\", which is probably the best vampire novel since Rice's \\"Interview\\", I found myself day dreaming of another installment of that book while I was reading Hamilton's first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rapid and Enthralling","review":"It took me forever to finally get into this book. I am constantly reading vampire novels, but this one seemed different because of it's main characters point of view and her entire outlook. Right now, am almost done with the second of this series \\"The Laughing Corpse\\". If you enjoyed this book, then read \\"Kiss Of Shadows\\" which is also by Laurell K. Hamilton and is SO good. Good luck future readers! No other vampire books will be like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked On Anita Blake!!!","review":"I am not a fan of vampire novels and so when a friend recommended this series to me, it was awhile before I ordered the first book in the Anita Blake series. All I can say now is...WOW! I AM A FAN FOR LIFE!!! *laugh I just ordered books 2 - 4 in the series and will order the rest once those arrive. This book has everything: horror, romance, laughs...it's all here! I really enjoyed this book and can't wait for the others to arrive. If you're not a fan of vampire reads, trust me - after this one, you will be. And if you are a fan of vampire reads - this one will be a welcome addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, quick, enjoyable read","review":"Great believable characters, good gutsy copy, a quick, enjoyable reading experience. Leaves you wanting more but DOESN'T leave you hanging, plotwise. Intelligent and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"\\"Look at me, I'm a bitchy whore who shags vampires\\" No thanks. You would be hard pressed to find more unlikable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires that sweat? Come on...","review":"I LOVE the vampire genre. I did not love this book. I picked it up on a whim and was quickly disappointed on page 43 when I learned Hamilton's vampires have pulses, heatbeats and sweat gleaming on their upper lips. Her so-called tough-chick heroine uses phrases like \\"fudge buckets\\" (p. 114) and sexist sentences such as \\"she fought like a girl, all open-handed slaps, scratches and flailing arms.\\" (Frankly, I punched when I was a girl.) Also, the author is a bit repetitive. (p. 115 - \\"The smile he flashed me was full of potential, a little evil, a lot of sex.\\" p. 118 - \\"There was a tinge of evil to it, a lot of sex, but under that was a boy peeking out...\\" I snored through this book and will not likely try this author again. Just thought you vampire fans should know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also Dissapointed","review":"This book was the first vampire novel i couldnt get into. Too many charachters, Unstated backstory that i didnt follow. Uncomfortable prose and a slow moving, convoluted story with very litle motivating the charachters that i could beleive.It was very contrived.sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I really tried to read this book. Really. I've read all of the Twilight series and the Night World books. I've watched all of Underworld and like many things supernatural, but this book didn't do it for me. I didn't feel any connection to the main character and I feel like I wasted a lunch hour trying to read it again. I've read 11 chapters and I'm about to donate it to the library without completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!!!","review":"I decided to read this book after the many comments that were left in the Rachel Morgan series saying that Anita Blake is a much better read. So I was very excited to start reading this book. I was greatly dissapointed!First of all, the character is not described in enough detail and is not presented in a way that you want to connect to her. I felt nothing when I read the book, I didn't feel sorry for her. Secondly, the story is so plain, I mean there are no side twists - NOTHING, just a straight path to the end (which is very predictable by the way). Then, there are no other real characters developed well enough in the book to create a little world - the author just scratched the surface without even trying to dip the reader deeper to create a connection. Very cliche, language is too grave - no humor. Did not enjoy this at all and will not continue with the series. I like the Rachel Morgan series and Sookie Stackhouse Series much much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAG","review":"Such pitiful writing. This was just a sad attempt at story-telling. Overly sexual, but in a cliche and unbelievable way so it just comes off cheesy. I feel like I wasted way too much of my time attempting to get through this novel. I think I'll leave it at that, because honestly, I really don't want to spend any of my time writing about it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning to a series","review":"This is the very first book in the Anita Blake series, and I think it's quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Here for a Wonderful Series","review":"I stumbled onto Anita Blake somewhere around \\"Blue Moon\\", which is another excellent novel in the series. It took me a while to track down Guilty Pleasures, and I was eager to read it to get a better understanding of the characters and where they'd come from.While nicely characterized and well-written, there was a lingering feeling of incompletion at the end of the book. I'd not felt particularly enlightened about certain relationships, or how some things came to be. I gathered information from context, but I really was no more informed than I'd been from \\"Blue Moon\\".However, don't let this little quibble deter you from picking up this series, and this book in particular. Anita makes tough choices, and while you can't always agree with her, you can usually understand her actions. Start here, get a feel for the world, and a tough-as-nails, smart-alecky heroine who's a nice change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little misleading, title-wise","review":"Hamilton says she wanted to get away from the ubiquitous \\"sexy-vampire\\" story. So then why does her book have the very sexy title \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" rather than, say, \\"The Vampire Executioner?\\" There's some minor sexy scenes in the book, but the main character is all business. My other gripe is that there is some lazy writing and/or editing going on, wherein the same phrases will be used more than once in the same book. The wry joke \\"I would bet my life on it...and maybe I was,\\" is used in two different situations, and it's not the only example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Anita Blake","review":"I'm just starting this series (currently on The Lunatic Cafe), but I really love it. I own all of them and cannot wait to read them all. Great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comparable to the latest and greatest","review":"This book may have been something fresh and different when it was published in 1993, but now it reads like fan fiction. And not very good fan fiction at that. I've been reading the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, which are great. After devouring four of them in a row, I decided I needed a break so I picked up Guilty Pleasures because I'd heard interesting and outrageous things about the series. But after struggling through the stale prose and thin characters, I'm not sure if I can read any more of them. Does Hamilton's style improve as the series continues? Or is it the ever increasing eroticism (which was not present in the ironically named first novel) that brings back the vampire fetishists for every new release? I may never find out. I'm back to reading the Dresden Files, where I found myself sighing with pleasure at the words written by a true novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy with bite","review":"Unwillingly coerced by the master vampire Jean-Claude, Anita must seek out the loathesome individual who is killing vampires in the city, a task which stretches the reader's imagination as well as the wits of our heroine. Let's face it, this is not the stuff a Booker Prize is made of, but one does not live on creme brulee all the time, nor struggle over Proust. Still, with summer coming, there is nothing I could think better than to sit by the pool with a gin and tonic and an Anita Blake novel. Graphic but not excessively so, sensual but not pornographic, I wouldn't have angina if I found one of my adolescents reading it. Read it in an afternoon while you get a tan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"The start of an interesting series. Anita Blake must balance her life between being a vampire hunter, and a legally licensed one at that, a private necromancer, and her own repressed catholic schoolgirl self.With all this to do she finds it hard to have healthy relationships, but she is good at solving crimes that relate to the supernatural population, and putting an end to their unlives permanently, if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely discovery!","review":"I have just discovered Anita Blake after a recommendation from a friend that lives in St. Louis that has been a fan for awhile. I owe her a big thank you for giving me Laurell's name. I owe Laurell a huge thank you for a character that has caught my fascination more than anyone has in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!!","review":"This is what I love about my kindle. I get the change to read great series like Anita Blake. Can't believe that this book was published in 2004 and I only start reading it now. On the plus side - I don't have to wait for the next book because all the books are available!!I love Anita Blake's character. Although she raises zombies for a living as her night job and being the executioner of vampires as a day job, she is still human with human emotions and feelings. She's even got the common sense of being scared of vampires. In Anita Blake's world it is legal for vampires to exist in society. I love the humor in this book, the detail that every scene is being described so that you don't miss a thing!! And I mean ghouls and were rats, come one it can't get better than this!!! There is enough action, romance, horror, and suspense in this book for everyone. And what is a vampire book without a 1000 year old master vampire and a gorgeous vampire by the name of Jean-Claude."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of an addiction","review":"The first of the fourteen (so far) Anita Blake, Vampire Slayer books is very much like the first piece of fine chocolate you ever ate. You are spoiled for any other kind. This is the intro book of the series, I like the way the story picks up with Anita established as an Animator and Vampire hunter, you pick up the back story through out this book and the others. I read this book in September and have now finished all the series that is published. I don't usually read all the books in a series at one time, but once you start on these, you find yourself transported to another, more dangerous world and you just cannot get enough of it. If you like books that literally take you to another place, you will love this one and all the others"},{"rating":"2","title":"GUILTY PLEASURES","review":"HAVE L.K.HAMILTON'S COMPLETE SERIES ON \\"ANITA BLAKE VAMPIRE HUNTER' HER BOOKS WERE VERY BLOODY READS.

Boy, was I glad I did. It's not often that you find an author who can combine a great sense of the macbre with a terrific sense of humor. If you're looking for a sassy heroine, with a wicked sense of humor and a 1940's style film noir feel, then this is definitely the series for you. She has some terrific characters; Jean-Claude, who has the hots for Anita, Nicolau, the master of the city, the Wererats that inhabit the sewers of St. Louis, etc. And to top it all off, it takes place in St. Louis, an city that you normally wouldn't think of as a center of vampirism. All in all, it's a terrific read and great fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most entertaining reads in its genre.","review":"Hamilton's \\"tough-as-nails\\" heroine Anita Blake takes the reader on a wild ride through the streets of St. Louis as she battles vampires, were-rats, AND humans in a classic struggle of good-against-evil. Blake's fierceness makes her a force to be reckoned with among things-that-go-bump-in-the-night and is balanced by an unrelenting razor-sharp wit in the face of danger. A page-turner to the last, GUILTY PLEASURES, is an action-packed adventure that will have the reader scrambling to read Blake's further exploits in THE LAUGHING CORPSE, CIRCUS OF THE DAMNED, and THE LUNATIC CAFE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly As Good As Sookie Stackhouse Novels","review":"This book was ok. I kept feeling as though I came in the middle of the story. I even went back to Amazon to insure I bought the 1st novel in this series.

I finished the book, but I won't be buying anymore of the books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"re: Bloody & Muddy","review":"As much as I wanted to like this book, I did not. The plot never emerged. As they say, \\"the plot thickens,\\" but in this books case, it thickens into a paste of mud. In order to get me interested, I really should be enticed into liking Anita Blake from the start. I don't or perhaps I've not been given enough info to form an opinion. To me, it was just a slightly gory horror book with some kinky vampire fantasy thrown in for good measure. I picked it up because I was told, \\"If you like Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, you'll like this.\\" Unfortunately, I didn't. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will agree to disagree","review":"As the starting novel in the Anita Blake series, it was pretty good. Although, I couldn't get over the fact that she was scared all the time. I mean if you're scared of someone, then I don't think that you should crack stupid jokes. Nikolaos is the wrong one to piss off. For a thousand year-old vampire, she does not have a sense of humor. The dialog, however, was a lot better than the other books. Aubrey and Theresa are really well thought out characters and I like that. I also liked the scenes between Anita and Jean Claude, they brought a little romance to the book. The end has a nice twist to it that I wasn't expecting. What I didn't expect was for the next book to be so SORRY, but enough about that. If you like vampires, ghouls, and zombie's, then this is a good book to start with. It's not an excellent book, but it'll get you through the weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know this was a lady's room","review":"I didn't know this was a lady's room. As a male reader, I just couldn't relate to any character in the book, particularly the heroin, Anita Blake. She is always so tense, so angry, I failed to see any depth in this character. As for other characters, well they are nothing but stereo typical B-movie characters. This is the first of the Anita Blake books and characters may develop as the seriese develops, but I am not attracted enough to try find that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Harlequin Romance\\" by Stephen King","review":"I bought Guilty Pleasures at the recommendation of a co-worker. He is a fan of the Anita Blake series and thought I'd get into it too. The background is well written and defined, but the characters are shallow and sexual thought/desire/memories/plans simply take up too much dialogue and the plot drags along. I'll avoid the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Not Guilty....","review":"I didn't like the book.I just didn't fine it very apealing.I know that there are alot of fallowers or the series however it didn't captuer me.I found the characters too over dune and not very apealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"after reading *dead until dark and living dead in dallas* by:Charlaine Harris..i searched for the same kinda stories..and read that Laurell K.

Don't want too."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Anita Blake novel...","review":"I had read all the books in Hamilton's series except this one-and I am quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong, she is a great writer, but I wouldn't waste my money on Guilty Pleasures. The plot was weak and VERY predictable, from the first chapter I could tell you how it would end and who would die. If you want a really good read, and haven't read the Anita Blake series yet, start off with Circus of the Damned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth","review":"The other reviewers who gave this book 2 stars or less have already summed up the weaknesses of this book nicely. The storyline definitely had potential but lacked that depth that makes for riveting reading. I finished the book but only just (wanted to see \\"who dun it!).On the whole, I did not find the undead legions in this book very scary or evil (when compared, for example, with the exquisitely horrific vampires in Brian Lumley's books). I won't be reading any more novels in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great disappointment.","review":"If you were to buy this book based on all the praise it gets in its opening pages (as I did) you are in for a horrible surprise. This is one of the most poorly writtne thrillers I have had the displeasure of reading. Bad noir-esque narritive, bad dialogue, not at all erotic, not at all interesting overall, a fairly uninteresting effort by \\"the next Anne Rice.\\" A waste of $$ and precious time.Try something else.Anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, mediocre execution.","review":"The idea behind this series is a good one, but I'm about four books in (very easy read) and the execution just isn't that impressive. I find the character of Anita Blake to be generally unpleasant- she's the cliche hard-as-nails detective, and just because she's a woman, I don't find it any less cliche. In spite of this, the supporting characters are far more interesting and amusing, and make the books palatable, but they're still somewhat two-dimensional. In addition, the dialogue is a little flat. Lastly: There are about ten thousand better ways to convey sarcasm than writing \\"Ri-ight\\" at the end of every third paragraph. To sum up, they'll pass the time, but there are much better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love L.K. Hamilton book!","review":"I started this series by reading Blue Moon(one of my favorites) Laurell has a great sense of humor when writing these books. I have read all but the Circus of the Damned and I have to say I can't wait. Gulity Pleasures was by far the best in the series next being Blue Moon. There is a great combonation of seriousness, humor, love, and gore in these books that is hard to find in other super natural books. Anita Blake is one of the best characters I have read in book involving vampires, weres, ect. She is frightning in a safe sort of way. I would love to see this series made into movies! I would be the first person in line at the theator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"My mom bought the first two Anita Balke books for me because I have always been a fan of the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles (and the Witches). Now to her credit my mom usually picks out good books- not this time. I found the story to be lacking in somewhat important background details- some things aren't fully explained, for example in the beginning we find out that she is supposed to \\"reanimate\\" some dead guy, but then the story just moves on. I also felt that the sentence structure was very simple and basic and I particulary did not like the use of \\"words\\" such as 'kinda' and so on. Does this woman have an editor? I can appreciate the attempt to make the speakers sound real but I think they sound like teenagers. And finally putting it out there that this is a \\"sexual\\" novel is far from the truth. I would certainly not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An action-packed page-turner.","review":"Laurell Hamilton's \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" is definitely a \\"pleasure\\" to read. It is fast-paced and straight to the point, just like her main character, Anita Blake, the animator/vampire hunter. Anita is hired (somewhat against her will) to investigate a series of vampire murders. Her client is the most powerful vampire in the city whose need for Anita's talent surpasses the desire she has to destroy her. In an exciting series of events, Anita recruits the assistance of humans, wereanimals, and vampires but, as the ending proves, Anita works on her own. Hamilton creates an interesting alternative world where we are \\"not alone\\": there are vampires, ghouls, zombies, wereanimals, and humans who coexist and even interact. Hamiliton also creates a main character who can be admired for her physical and emotional strength, as well as her vulnerabities which makes her character a lot more believable.I have not met a person who read the book and did not like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Twilight or Sookie Stackhouse","review":"I only bought the 1st book in the series- and now I'm glad. I was looking for a next step from the Twilight/Sookie Stackhouse genre. This wasn't it. It's like Sookie Stackhouse but completely without the romance and sex. Some might say that makes it less \\"trashy,\\" but that's what made those books so good- that it had that balance. I won't be buying the next one. Very disappointed because I really really wanted to like this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should feel guilty for thinking THIS is a pleasure!","review":"Hated it, hated every moment. Yet another angry heroine like Tanya Huff's Vicki of the \\"Blood\\" series or the wolf girl from Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson series.The were-rats who feel themselves up, zombies, vampire strip clubs - bleck!There's nothing sexy or romantic about these books. It's another \\"look at me, I'm SO tough!\\" brass-bound-b***h novel. I'm a woman, I appreciate strong female leads. But, if you really want to read a GREAT vampire novel, read Robin McKinley's \\"Sunshine\\" it's my most favorite vampire book of all time. Magic, romance, taking on an ultimate evil, etc. Well thought out, very easy to relate to and deep.Anita Blake simply comes out swearing, guns blazing, and gets bruised and cut a lot and nearly loses her temper and tries to maim \\"people\\" several times. I've read it before, and it's probably not the last time I'll see something like this, unfortunately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST BUY NOW!!!!1","review":"This is a must buy. This is the first installment of the Anita Blake series. If you like horror, humor and a good sense of writing you have to buy this book. Get it used or get it brand new. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"I don't like vampires and I don't think they're sexy. They do, however, make fascinating reading. One of the things that make the vampires and other supernatural creatures in this book so darn creepy is that the darn things are all over the place, even living with ordinary humans. Sort of like gangsters and drug dealers are all over the place in real life; always around somewhere, and nobody can seem to get rid of them permanently. I really like Anita Blake. The danger she faces is overwhelming and I, for one, was on the edge of my seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alternative perspective of vampires","review":"Anita Blake is a stud-ette. These books are written on the premise that vampires are a recognized \\"minority group.\\" The executioner, Anita Blake, must now follow the laws of the land when taking down a vampire or other supernatural creature. Well written and funny as well, I would have given this book 5 stars if not for the inability to suspend my disbelief to such an extent. However, if vampires did exist and were given rights like the rest of us, there is no one I would rather have taking care of us than Anita Blake. Pick up this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I love the world that Anita Blake lives in. It is as if people have always known that vampires existed and are learning more about them. I love how Anita thinks because its how I think, which makes her more realistic to me. And the action is enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I had this book recommended to me by a store clerk. I thought i wouldn't like it, but i read the first few pages and could not put it down. As soon as i finished, i went and bought the rest of the series. These books have everything! Sex, romance, action and some gore. Laurell Hamilton knows how to pay attention to detail. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bloody Fun","review":"I'm a sucker for \\"tough chick\\" books, and these definitely qualify. Good writing, even if the series does get a bit repetitive after a while. This is the first book, though, and it's quite fresh.The main character, Anita, is a necromancer who has a sideline hobby of hunting vampires. She starts out very black and white: people good, vampires bad. This book begins her slide toward a world populated with a few more colors: shades of grey, and quite a bit of red. Although, granted, even her shades of grey are a bit more black-and-white than real life... but hey, the books are really good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of MY guilty pleasures","review":"Laurell Hamilton has done something other authors have done before her - created a series of books that combine the basic elements of mysteries and horror novels. But where most efforts at this combination have fallen flat on their collective face, Hamilton's first novel shows a great deal of promise.Don't get me wrong here - the writing and the plot are very simplistic and Hamilton uses a lot of standard mystery and horror plot devices. But there's something about this first in the \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter\\" series that just takes you up and pulls you in.If the rest of the series is like this first book then I have a lot more \\"guilty pleasures\\" to read through."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I love series and especially series involving the supernatural. It was mentioned in reviews of Charlaine Harris's books (which I love) and I wrongly assumed (you know what they say about assuming...) that the Anita Blake books would be similar. Hamilton introduced an interesting universe but it went down hill from there. I didn't particularly like the heroine and the book was just so inconsistent. A group of vampires hire Blake to do a job for them and instead of actually letting her do the job, they keep trying to kill her. Doesn't quite make sense huh? Honestly this book just annoyed me to no end. When I was finished with it, I threw it away rather than inflict it on unsuspecting people at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable - more action than sensuality","review":"I came to this series after greatly enjoying the Anne Rice vampire series. Guilty Pleasures lacks the history and voluptuousness of the Rice books. However, the plotting is much more urgent, and it's more of a page-turner. Not disappointing, just different. Anita is an interesting character, and there is plenty of room for development. If I thought that this was the only book, I would have been disappointed not to know more about the background of the people involved. As it is, I know I have something to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Stars Plus 1 For Wanting-More Quality","review":"A shock, if you're used to aesthetic or brooding vampires. Refreshingly down-to-earth, and what a DIFFERENT earth! This book -- and the series -- is good fun, laced with mysteries and preternatural critters galore. Groaners aplenty for fans of the easy pun. Anita Blake is a hero unparalleled. She may be scared witless throughout, but action conquers fear and Anita most definitely reigns.Guilty Pleasures (a more apt title, I've not heard!) is the first book in an open-ended series. Not a serial, each book stands alone, but like most others, reading in sequence is recommended. Hamilton's characters mature as you go, she doesn't set them up on pedestals and doesn't give in to the compulsion to explain everything. (For example, book nine focuses on a major recurring character and at the book's end, we STILL know almost nothing about him!) First person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-stop read~With an awsome plot!","review":"I absolutly loved this book! I read it in 4 day after I got it, I could not put it down it was jsut soooo good..omg!I love Anita Blake she is so cool and spunky, she has awsome catch phrases, and an ending line that makes the book!I definitaley recomend this one.. I cant wait to read the next (the laughing corpse)...yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This is the first book in Hamiltons? Anita Blake series &, if you like the genre, it?s well worth a read. A little superficial, & we never feel that we get to know the characters all that well, but these earlier books in the series are extremely original, & fairly entertaining (sadly the later books just turn into supernatural porn).Anita Blake, our heroine, is an Animator ? she raises the dead. She?s also a licenced vampire executioner, & she works with the police to solve crimes that seem to fall into the supernatural category.In this first book Anita is hired by a vampire to find out who is ?killing? the undead, which puts Anita in an interesting position considering she rather sympathises with the killer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good stuff.....","review":"Okay-so I picked this up after reading a Maggie Shayne book and realizing that the Vampire plot line was an interesting one. I thought it would be fun to try out a new series. I have to tell you that this book was pretty good. I wasn't sure if I would like it but now in the past two day I have read the 2nd and 3rd book in the series. I am hooked! I love how sarcastic Anita Blake is. It absolutely amazes me that someone hasn't killed her by now. She just doesn't back down when it comes to dealing with the \\"bad\\" guys. Funny stuff, I laughed out loud at some parts. I thought there could have been a little more romance stuff, but by what the other book reviews say it looks like that will be in the future books.Overall I was impressed with this story and I am now on #4 and can't wait to read all 10 (Soon to be 11!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Grafton but with vampires","review":"The book reminds me of the Sue Grafton series except in this case, Kinsey (Anita) hunts vampires. Anita shares Kinsey's one main weakness too, namely, she's much too ignorant to have been doing her line of work for so long. Hamilton subjects Anita to moments of abject stupidity to force expository dialogue. I know that it's good to \\"show\\" rather than \\"tell\\" but there are times when a simple interior comment between narrator (Anita) and audience (reader) would suffice and strengthen the character and keep the plot moving. As it is, I sometimes had to wonder how the \\"Executioner\\" had stayed alive for as long as she apparently has. It's not like she has Buffy's slayer enhanced skills to keep her afloat while she learns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomesauce","review":"Wasn't sure I would like this. Vamp stories are normally not for me. I hated twilight and wasn't really fond of Sookie at all, but I really enjoyed this. Anita is a bad ass with a cuddly side. Hamilton really makes u believe in the world she created. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book","review":"I did not like one thing about this book. I selected it because it had been recommended in a review about another vampire series of books. I wish that I had taken a pass on it. If you really like the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, the Carpathians Dark series or the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, I don't think you'll like this series at all. It's old-style, Dracula view of vampires, ghouls and zombies is just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy Anita's tough guy style","review":"I prefer reading romance novels and bought this thinking there would be romance in it, but there was none. This is a mystery thriller with Anita who is human trying to solve the mystery of who is killing vampires. It is written in first person, as told by Anita. She talks in the style of a 1950's private detective. She sounds like a jaded, tough guy making sarcastic remarks to almost everyone, including those about to kill her. Her ability to kill vampires and others could be described as follows. She is fighting creatures who are tougher than her or outnumber her, but she keeps fighting, doesn't give into fear, tries to distract them, and usually gets lucky and wins, using knives and guns. I did not enjoy reading this. I kept wishing it would be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashion comes and goes. Mostly goes.","review":"The detail in which Ms. Hamilton goes into when describing the clothing in each and every scene keeps on running long past the line marked \\"exhausting\\". This narrative journey through the fashions of the late '70s and early '80s is encyclopedic in its accuracy and punctuated by trite analogies used ad nauseam. I skimmed huge portions of this book only because OCD tendencies prevented me for just lighting it up in the cheesiest conflagration since the Fondue Fire of 1975."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Blake","review":"I absolutely love LKH. The Merry Gentry series is very good, so I decided to give Anita Blake a try since I've heard so much about it from friends.I cracked open the first book and it took me over a month to read it. This book is so horrible, I would recommend anyone with any taste to not read it. If you like vampires, don't sully their name by buying or reading these books. The vampires in this series are so irrationally emotional and childish I could barely stomach it.Truthfully, I'm surprised that this series has continued this long. I don't know why she wasted her talents on this series, but thankfully we have MG to make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Title for a Perfect Book","review":"This is the best first book of a series I have ever read. Laurell K Hamilton creates a wonderful new character. Anita Blake is tough as nails and as moral as a nun. She makes raising the dead as ordinary as selling insurance. While introducing this new character the author is very wise. She does not tell us everything about Anita and her friends. So at the end of the story the reader wants more. I know I was. The story of a serial killer of vampires is refreshing. The action is non-stop. The romance is delightful. Even Anita's friends are dangerous, so you are never sure whom she should trust. I recommend this book to all horror and alternate history fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read!","review":"Guilty Pleasures definitely disappoints. I'm a huge fan of paranormal romance, J.D. Ward, Kresley Cole, Sherrlyn Kenyon - being my favorites. After reading the reviews for Hamilton's series it seemed right up my alley. WRONG! There is NO romance whatsoever and the paranormal is more freaky and gory than mysterious. Just to make sure I hadn't judged too soon I also read book 2, The Laughing Corpse. I must say it was even worse than Guilty Pleasures. Too much gore and not enough romance, humor or character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as toast.....","review":"I was very shocked when I started reading this book. It was highly recommended and I couldn't get through the first 4 chapters. If you like a series that is not funny and hard to relate to, this one's for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This was by far, one of the best vampire books I've ever read!! It's my hope for Anita Blake and for Laural that this be brought to either the big screen or a premium pay cable channel. Only these mediums would be able to do it justice; of course it would also highly depend on the screen play adaptation. Live long Anita Blake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a review?","review":"well this my first time reading one of laurrel k. hamiltons books, and i didnt find it at all mind blowing.I usuwally can say at least three nice things any book or thing, but the only item i find interesting in Guilty Pleasures is that Anita is a vampire HUNTER.I find Guilty Pleaasures extremely slow paced. the begining and the verry ending are interesting but the middle is pointless.Anita Blake is a vampire hunter. I find her character strong but a little unrealistic.considering the fact that everyday she gets beaten up and but the next day half of the bruses are not even there. and in most cases she should have broken a bone but its like nothing afterwards.Im sorry Hamiltion but i just dont find it verry gripping.well maybee its just my weird taste.(ok not the best review ever but hey im just warning y'all)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected something else entirely","review":"I started reading her first book, this book \\"The Laughing Corpse\\" and with no one to cheer me on I set it down and picked it up several times. I guess what turned me off was the lack of the thundering first chapter of \\"another\\" famous vampire writer that starts the book of with \\"I am the Vampire _______....fill in the blanks, you hear echos and thunders and a beautiful powerful vampire that pours his heart out to you. Instead I read what seems like an Inspector Morris novel explaining all of the stupid little problems a private detective would have that is so trivial it couldn't keep my attention. I guess with the unnamed writer above taking a big break from our favorite vampires, I was looking for a replacement series to read. This isn't going to do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Dissapointed","review":"I bought this book based on the back cover description which promised a mystery. The author spends the first two hundred pages introducing everyone and trying to scare us with some vampire rituals, then casualy says \\"oh, yeah, the killer is....\\", and then goes back to the rituals. I was hoping that the idea of solving a crime where vampires were the victim would be an interesting idea, and I still do. I hope that one day someone writes that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 hours of my life I'll never have back","review":"Oh, my what a waste of time. I loved Sonia Blue, and tried this because it seemed there was extensive cross-pollinization between that reader group and this one. So I gave it a shot, and was rewarded with plastic characters, a transparent plot, and uninspired writing. I give it two stars because it did keep me interested until the end, mainly to see if it would get any better and because I do enjoy the genre. Just not this telling of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy this book.","review":"I normally love vampire books, but this one was lacking. I will not be reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"normal fantasy fans won't like this","review":"Don't start on this series. The first couple aren't too bad though there is more sex than I like in even these. They get worse as they go. This isn't paranormal fantasy it's just sick. Fantasy is supposed to have righteous heros/heroins. Anita would make a better antagonist than heroin because despite the attempt at portraying her as good she is just evil. I attempted to just skip the perverted sex parts but the later books are almost all that so there is nothing to read. Hopefully I'll be able to get this stuff out of mind because it isn't something I want there. Someone obviously reads this stuff because she keep writing them but they aren't fantasy readers they are sexual perverts. There is no fantasy story here other than sexual fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seiko Men's Arctura Kinetic Auto Relay Watch #SNG041","review":"I got this watch for my boyfriend and he is very satisfied with it.

Her voice is like a bell and it's very sweet and beautiful. Tara Charendoff's voice is lovely too! The song named \\"For a moment\\" which Jodi Benson and Tara Charendoff sang together was beautiful and enchanted, I felt warm inside when I heard it.

My daughter loves the tethered toys which are just small enough for her little fingers to grasp. It has a noisy/crinkle backing so she also plays with the 'petals' as well.

The classics range from my personal favorites, \\"Cherry, Cherry\\" and \\"Thank the Lord for the Night Time\\" to his more contemprary songs. Neil Diamond is a virtuoso. He plays moods, settings and ideas and combines them very effectively as does a painter mixing colors. Neil Diamond is strong and sensory; his music nonpareil. He is still rocking and this collection is proof positive of that. Neil Diamond is a purist in every sense of the word. He has set high standards for himself and this is evident in his music. He has nothing extraneous in his works and in listening to interviews he has given throughout the years, it is his genuine respect for the medium of music that comes through.Please, please listen to this.

This is a mere 23 minute long introduction shot in old video-quality burned onto a dvd-rom. It's worth maybe $5. They ought to be ashamed of themselves for charging $60 for it. As far as content - it's a pretty good 23 minute introduction. If it were $5 i'd give it a good review. You need to look elsewhere for more in-depth information - something like a 4 DVD set that's really worth $60.

Rygel with his \\"army\\" of DRDs was rediculas. The villan was weirder than Scorpius, but totally unbelievable. Ghosts have never been introduced in the show, and frankly the science fiction and spritual worlds are very difficult to cross effectively. Even good crosses are a little off, but this was the worst example i've ever read. Some advice to the author: If your gonna try something like this, at least make the characters match. The one cool part was the going into the PK world. That was one thing the other novels did not accomplish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for Farscape literature","review":"I've bought and read both House of Cards (EXCELLENT) and Dark Side of the Sun (poor), but I must say this one truly takes the cake. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. It goes from wildly inaccurate characters (Rygel saying \\"Oh Dear\\" and \\"Fiddlestickoids\\"?!?) to the bizarre end of a medieval fantasy run amok. At one point, Aeryn and D'Argo ride a mechanical Dragon piloted by some sort of ghost! That's right, a robo-dragon in the middle of the uncharted territories. That's when I put the book down for good.If you're looking for a good adaptation to text from the screen, I highly recommend House of Cards. If you're somehow able to look past the obvious mistakes, assumptions and flat out idiocy presented here, you may get a kick out of it, but I sure didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but forgettable.","review":"I actually liked this book in spite of only giving it two stars which might lead you to believe otherwise.The characterizations were alright, not outstanding.

For example, some stories leaving you thinking about them for days/weeks/months...even years after you read them, this isn't one of those stories.If you're desparate for a Farscape fix though, you'd be better off buying this than \\"Dark Side of The Sun\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well researched","review":"The author of this book obviously had never seen the show before. He did not use any of the words or phrases that made Farscape the show it is. He used the \\"earthling\\" mode for time management i.e. \\"second\\" instead of \\"microt\\" or \\"hour\\" instead of \\"arn\\".

I'm a big fan of the series and this book was sooo disappointing. The characters are completely off and left me wondering if the author has actually seen an episode or if he just looked a picture of the characters. The plot is uninteresting... Don't waste your time. I threw my copy [away]--couldn't even stomach selling or giving it away. I give this one star because of the cool bookcover artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish behind an overused publicity photo cover","review":"I liked Bischoff's solo material well enough to look forward to the new Farscape book, Ship of Ghosts. What happened after I started reading was a different tale. The book is hideous. I had just finished reading House Harkonnen by Brian Herbert, which was a fantastic book. Going from that to this was like going from Bugs Bunny to the Teletubbies. Horrible and shocking. The characterization was very off, the mannerisms of our favorite characters were over the top when they were at all accurate. The story was boring, and I put it down a few chapters shy of the end. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The previous FS book was horrid as well. Come on, Keepers of the Farscape Franchise, let's do better next time! They're already fleecing us by releasing only 2 episodes per DVD, this latest insult is almost too much to bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another flop","review":"House of Cards...Excellent. Dark Side of the Sun...reviews so bad I didn't bother. Ship of Ghosts...bought it without looking at reviews. The reviews here? Accurate so far. When Rygel starts talking about controling the DRD's with some sort of wireless Ethernet device...well, that's not very creative, especially for something supposedly in the Sci-Fi genre. I've never written a book, but I'm betting I could do better than these last two Farscape books. C'mon Farscape book editors...get it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Farscape","review":"David Bischoff did a great job with the descriptions, but at times they could be overwhelming. Ship of Ghosts almost crossed over into Fantasy, which makes it a different type of writing then the other Farscape books. The storyline was very well written but could be a little confusing. The story of Rygel was hillarious and shows you just the kind of personality he has (although some might consider it overdone). The other story of the Peacekeepers seemed to be only a background but at the end of the book they all came together, which makes it such a great ending. However, I didn't like the very end because it seemed almost like a way to write off a part of the story because he didn't know quite what to do with it. However, I would still reccomend this book to the Farscape lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark Album that brought Trance to the masses","review":"Fantastic!The two Standout tracks are:Sandstorm (a MONSTER track)Feel The BeatNot sure if the others were released as singles but these two are also quite excellent:Calm Before the StormTouch me feel me (this is invitingly sensual).These four tracks are different... no repetition here.

In the tradition of the folky coffeehouse singer songwriter, Mr. King sings from the heart. His topics include personal relationships and homages to those lost too early to AIDS.

The Hollywood Leftists got hold of this franchise just like they did the '24' franchise after season 4.At this point Caine is phoning in his performance.The 'Ipcress File' and 'Funeral In Berlin' are the two films that retain the true Cold War spirit of defeating international communism.This one is to be avoided at all costs...or at least chuckled at for the comic relief.

So I have to chose when to use it. It's stylish and slim (profile) but I just with it had a shiny shell so it would be easy to wipe off, more realiztic leater on the shoulder strap.

Unlike many competitive and better known brands you won't find cardboard spacers and tubes or inferior paper filter media in a Wix.

If you hear noisy valves or knocking when you first start your car, you're probably getting dry starts. Check out the Wix website to see what goes into their filters and you'll be a Wix customer too.No, I'm not a Wix employee.

Christina has a much more powerful range, and also adds a touch of something I can't explain. Even so, Whitney's version is still a classic, and since Christina's version has only been performed live and not recording for CD; this version will do.

But it is all completely compelling.Joss's skillful evocation of sympathy with the three main characters and their broken lives struggles for air alongside an uncompromising portrait of evil in all its banality. Although the story is far-fetched, the author's fastidious accumulation of detail, and the story's steady and unswerving path towards its climax, makes it all somehow credible.

RC transmitter/receivers, Basic Stamp) but assume you know about potentiometers, resistors etc and also know how to use multimeters. This book is more for the electronically adept users who wishes to use RCX as part of his tools.Overall, this is book that I would highly recommend to all who wish to use the RCX other than what all the books have on about.

Most of my reading time was taken with non-fiction. Finally, I decided that any book by an American author that had received three Pulitzer prizes including prose and poetry, must be worth reading.If fact, this book is very well written. The character development is excellent, dialog is as I remember it when working in the rural areas of Kentucky during summer vacations from college in the 50's. The plot is well developed and the story is interesting and thought provoking.On the surface, this is the story of Jeremiah Beaumont and his larger-than-life difficulties. Beneath the surface, this is a story of integrity, morals, truth and justice. It is not a story of \\"hope\\". The final sentence pretty well sums it up: \\"Was all for naught?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrically unsound printer","review":"We bought & returned this printer 3 times, just to make sure that the problem was really with the printer (and not with us). Turns out it's the printer. There is a SERIOUS ELECTRICAL DEFECT with this printer that we have never encountered with any other laser printer that we have ever owned. (We are in the computer business, and we deal with dozens of laser printers on a regular basis.) Whenever attempting to print from this printer, it creates such a surge of electricity that it causes a brief power outage in our entire office. We've plugged it into uninterruptible power supplies, we've plugged it into regular surge protectors, we've plugged it directly into the wall, we've plugged it into every electrical outlet that we could find. But no matter what we plug it into, we always get the same results.

The \\"fear techniques\\" used in the book just by the selection of chapter titles (\\"The International Agenda, \\"Establishing a Global Spirituality,\\" \\"Saving the Earth,\\" etc) puts opposition to Goals 2000 into the extreme fringe of political thought.

Berit Kjos is going the close-minded route and saying that we should tell our kids what to believe in instead of HOW to believe. It's very important for our kids to know HOW to think because that truly holds substance. Telling them WHAT to think , like how Berit Kjos outlines, means nothing. It's a terrible example of the closed-mindedness in our culture today.It's also poorly written as well. It's nothing more than an bunch of personal inferences.

Both actors are high on my list of quality artists. Imagine my dismay as I watched this movie and realized it was a horribly plotted, poorly constructed bomb. Banderas as Ecks and Lui as Sever are one-dimensional robots on screen. The dialogue is forced, action scenes are thrown in from time to time to liven things up and the plot is weak at best.

This couldn't have been worse if it was titled Battlefield Ballistic. The plot is all over the place.

They set the movie in Vancouver, BC without even bothering to pretend it's an American city, and then center the plot on two competing American agencies. So right away you see what caliber of writing we're dealing with.There are a couple of good action scenes that are fun. Really, the only reason these kinds of pseudo-Hong Kong movies get made is to show off a director's technical expertise in filming overly stylized action sequences. The rest of the movie is then built around these three or four scenes.But the director couldn't make Lucy Liu look like much of a martial artist.

As a matter of fact, it's not even up there with your average Steven Seagal flick. It has no real plot, just plot elements with one-dimensional characters reciting weak dialogue and getting into long, repetitive gunfights. I'm a die-hard fan of dumb action movies, but even this is too void for my tastes. The cast, while consisting of a few admirable talents, can't seem to keep the movie flowing and the action is trite and devoid of originality.

Liu does the super-spy-babe thing very well, and with less facial expression than Keanu Reeves. Come to think of it, the bad guy doesn't have much in the way of facial expressions either, mostly a big evil grin seemingly held in place with botox and superglue. Lots of things blow up, and blow up in the bad guys' faces.

There is no smiling, little frowning, just bland facial expressions, bland dialog and cinematography in an almost colorless film. Bullets fly, Liu says, \\"I buy weapons like some girls buy shoes.\\" Cars blow up, trains go boom, but it is all under a colorless pale.

This gets my vote for the absolute worst movie I've seen all year (by the way, it's december 28th). Even the stupid B-rated movies on late-night HBO were a step up from this garbage.

It is like watching someone else play a video game; it may be worth watching briefly, but after a few moments, you want a little more involvement (this awkwardly-titled movie may very well be a extended video game commercial).

It [was] so badly I wanted to walk out of the theatre. I had no empathy for any of the characters. The plot was very rote, the story mechanical, the actors didn't even look like they were buying it either. I was so embarassed to see Antonio Banderas and Lucy in this. It [was] so bad... it should go in a blackhole. Really, I can't say enough bad things about it.Don't buy it, save your money for something else, you'll be glad you did. If you really need to see it, rent it. Man, what I'd give to have the money and 90 minutes I spent on this movie back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballistic","review":"Seen it before but only thought about getting a DVD of it recently.

Lucy is great and Antonio is Antonio."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't deserve the star I am required to give it...","review":"Distancing yourself as far away from this preposterous slice of ridiculousness is kind of the only way to go here. Unless you like you action films stupid (and uninspired) then I don't see how anyone could find this hodgepodge of redundancy anything more than mind-numbingly nauseating. Seriously, this film is probably one of the worst films to have been made; ever. What was Lucy Liu thinking? What was Antonio Bandares thinking? I can't imagine that either of them was so desperate for money that they NEEDED to do this film (wasn't Liu just coming off of the \`Charlie's Angels' success and Bandares...okay never mind with Banderas; he's starred in more \`bad films' than most actors with half his fame). Anyways, I have exhausted the amount of time I allow to discuss such undeserving films."},{"rating":"1","title":"spy vs. spy","review":"this movie is not to good. The spy vs spy turns midway through as they teaam up to destroy a greater evil and rescue a child. Lucy Lu doesnt have much to say in this film and lets her martial arts do the talking while she comes across stiff as a board. Antonio is a reformed drunk who gets into shape and teams up with her to blow up everything in sight almost. The wierd thing is the explosions just knock the bad guys down not kill them. Later Sever and Ecks can fill them with hundres of bullets.Antonio mumbles alot and looks around as he falls through the movie in a trance. I really dont know what else to say, both actors tried I guess...everyone proably still made alot of money too. its really a darn shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is something wrong with this movie.","review":"First off, this movie wasn't as bad as people has been saying. The reviews of this movie can seem to be very misleading but at the same time, this film is not what i expected. Yes there is plenty of action and explosions and fighting but they are all bland. This movie has very bad editing. Lucy Liu's fighting sequences is very basic and boring. It's ok to watch once, most likely you will make fun of it, but it is a movie that i don't want to watch again. I was really hoping this movie will be rigth up my alley since i love action movies with cinematic scenes and unforgetable moments. Sorry...skip this one. One more thing, Antonio Banderas looks really stressed out throughout the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo awful","review":"Whomever rated this movie anything over 1 star is either a kid, or just an idiot. I mean rarely is the day that I'll go online to pan a movie, but after sitting through that last night... Look it's a basically a BAD late-night showtime/cinemax film, with two credible stars (I went to see it for Lucy as well). I watch a lot of garbage/crap, all the time in fact, that was just so bad. I'm really not going to go into it, since its already been said, but it's the most cliche filled, awful, completely non-sensible, confusing movie I think I have ever seen in at the theatres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Nicole Foster!","review":"Nicole Foster does it again.

It started out with a sample program that made me hate the book since it did not explain what the separate commands do and what the syntax was. it began by explaining what the program did and that was it. It might have been my fault that i did not understand the book but i did understand all other programming books that i have(including a \\"Beginning visual c++ 6\\" which is a great book). This did not follow the explain the code and follow with example method of teaching and just gave me code without explaining what they mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too limited","review":"This introduction is less than an introduction. Major standard programming techniques in VB are not touched. The text is very wordy and the content very minimal. The included working model is missing some important components (multimedia control, etc). You really cannot learn to program correctly with a crippled version of the software missing some key components."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide To Visual Basic 6","review":"This book is an excellent resource for the beginner.

The music is spacey but not weird, it packs a punch, and Dot Allison's voice is heavenly. During one of my many moves, this disc went missing and I've hunted high and low for it in record shops everywhere. Don't bother with itunes or MSN music, you can probably only find it used online, but it is well worth hunting down. It can function as sex music, nap music or background mood music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and good","review":"This CD offers a variety of different sounds. It has an overall blend of beautiful female voices and harmonies combined with different tempos in each song. I describe the voices and harmonies as cool and heavenly. I also like a lot of the instrumental work that combines to produce a sound like no other. Many of these songs appear in motion pictures such as \\"The Chase\\". It is the kind of music you hear in movies, and you want to buy the score or soundtrack. This is on CD I listen to a lot without becoming tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish Rises To The Top","review":"Absolutely! Fish rises to the top! He revisits the \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" material and breathes new life to it. Fish is the real deal (and there aren't many of those left these days)! His solo material shines as well. He is definately one of my all time favorite vocalists and songwriters. I am really looking forward to seeing the DVD of this performance that should be released soon. Although \\"Fugazi\\" was my first real introduction to Marillion during the eighties it was \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" that really forced open the doors to reaveal the heartbreak (disillusioned and scarred) of the refugee. It truly was a turning back (forward) to the progressive music that I loved so well during the seventies with a renewed touch after absorbing the punk era of the late 70s and early eighties. A welcome return home. Thanks Fish! You still out-rock the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I watch the same DVD?","review":"I am surprised to read the glowing reviews on this disc. I was very disappointed in this show. Fish, once a great and distinctive voice, is reduced to a mere shadow of his former self here. His recent material is written for his (now) very limited vocal range and is OK here because of that. The Marillion material shows just how far south Fish's voice has gone over the years. Listening to him 'sing' his old songs is almost painful. No range. No power. It's obvious the years of hard living have taken their toll. Combine that with a sub-par band (Frank Usher is good, but he's no Rothery) and you have a disappointing listening/viewing experience at best.How any Fish-era Marillion fan could find this DVD great is beyond me. If you want a much better option, seek out \\"Live at Loreley\\" (which isn't Marillion or Fish's best show either, but blows this away). This will only make you sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why no 5.1","review":"I liked it a lot, but why no 5.1? This will cause one star less!I like his current voice, it gives the old songs a new dimension. In fact I prefer how he sings those songs now."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 STARS! for the Fish Man from Marillion","review":"Hey Fish - would have given you 5 stars if it had been in DTS or at least 5.1. Great show - great crowd - small stage? (but I like it) - nice song line-up. Fish has always amazed me with his ability to act out a song - a true artist (not the greatest singer - but one of the greatest front men). As always he has surrounded himself with stellar musicians, who, like Fish, don't look like rockstars but deliver the goods like only true musicians can. I really can't recommend this enough. If you are searching for music as an art - you just found it. Swim on Fish, Swim on."},{"rating":"2","title":"wheres the 5.1 Fish","review":"Made the mistake in Atlanta in 2000 to try to drink with Fish. Been waiting on a good DVD. The show is great but the sound low and only stereo and for some reason want play in surround stero settings. If you are a fan you have to have it though. Next time I see him I'll bitch about the sound before he gets me drunk.

It didn't light it up the way I wanted to. But I guess I can't complain too much considering the price.I really can't tell if it has five bulbs in it or not. It really looks like there is one in the middle and the others are reflected by it with a mirror. I'm not sure.If you don't have a lit case and want to highlight your motherboard or something this would go great. Or if you want to highlight a specific thing in your computer.

Overall I like it. I gave it four starts because it seems to skip a little more often than I'd like. However in a Jeep, you feel every gum wrapper and cigarette butt in the road as it is, so I can live with it. What makes up for the occasional skip, is the MP3 player plug-in (who cares about skipping CD's, when you have an iPod anyway) and the weather band is a great feature also. The display is super bright, which is good for open air driving when the sun is overhead. Another nice feature is that the power button stays lit when the stereo is off, a nice detail when glancing at you dashboard in total darkness.

I managed to secure it to the cage by attaching it where one of the vertical and horizontal bars meet, but if the washers were a bit bigger, it would be better.

All I know is that I don't like books that require me to check reality and common sense at the door. Poor dialogue, unrealistic characters, silly situations and pointless meandering (Savich's \\"dream\\" sequence) make it unlikely I'll ever waste my time and money on another book by this author.The cover of the book says it was a New York Times bestseller. That frightens me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of the FBI series","review":"For the most part, the plot was VERY choppy. She added in Savich & Sherlock into this book but if you haven't read the previous books in her series, it would be confusing. It almost seemed that Coulter tried to take 2 short books and combine them unsuccessfully. I never felt invested in the main characters, Katie and Miles. Even by the end, there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Katie and Miles. The main plot line just seemed to wither out. Also, she tried to add small stories on the edges that don't mix well. Just page fillers. Writer's block and a tight deadline? Not her finest, that's for sure.

This is definitely going into the trash. It has more value being recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I found this book awfully foolish. Okay, there is the story about murdered math teachers - that gets Savich and Serlock into the story. Then we have a kidnapped little boy who is found within the first 50 pages and the rest of the book is, of course, the love story - that's the sheriff (Katie) who found the boy and the boy's father (Miles). Whoever wants the little boy keeps trying until he is found out and killed. Of course to intertwine Savich and Sherlock in the books, they know Miles and they come out to help - I don't see where they really helped, their coming to \\"help\\" did not do anything for the mrudered math teach storyline or the little boy that is kidnapped. They are just in the story. Of course, everything is settled in the end.The books are becoming predictable. Maybe since I haven't read any romance/thriller/FBI books before, I was looking for more of a story.The Cove and the Maze put this book to shame.

It's okay as a rough draft of a book, maybe, but it needs a LOT more work to make it anywhere near interesting, much less believable. I just kept thinking that the author must have had little to no time to write this one. The dialogue is just awful, the characters undeveloped, and the plotline skips around. NOT her best work, and that's an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Catherine Coulter book","review":"Boring!! I forced myself to finish this one. Looked good when I picked it up but was very disappointed. Would have to agree with other on-line reviews!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak! Weak! Weak!","review":"What happened to the gripping plots that I usually associate with Catherine Coulter? What happened to rich characterization and page turning suspense? This effort falls short in a plainly weak attempt. The characterization is thin and the plot lacks the intrigue that makes thrillers thrilling. The female lead in this novel is supposed to be strong, but comes across as weak. The bimbo at the gym served no purpose at all, and why was Wade's quest for Karen's job hammered into us at every turn? The Sheriff should have the skill to at least shoot where she's aiming. It was insulting to every small Sheriff's office in the southeast by the way the deputies were portrayed as incompetent and completely fallible. I grew more disgruntled as I plowed through this 370-page noose. By the last page, I felt cheated by the whole experience. Your time would better be spent in an afternoon nap than in reading this WEAK thriller that lacks intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"This book seemed pretty choppy. There were two crimes going on that had nothing to do with the other and she kept throwing in comments that had no relevance to the story. I was glad when it was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Blind..","review":"I thought this book was silly. The characters were shallow and the story disjointed. There were so many loose ends that never went anywhere. I have enjoyed many of Catherine Coulter's previous FBI novels but this one just didn't make the grade. I was disappointed with Hemlock Bay and thought that just might be a fluke. However, I am even more disappointed with this book. If you want to read a good book, don't pick this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever written.....PERIOD!","review":"I listened to the unabridged audiobook and let me tell you, it was almost painful at times. I am a big fan of CC's books, but I literally had to force myself to finish this one. In my opinion, BLINDSIDE is the worst book ever written. If you've never read any of CC's books, please don't start with this one! Avoid it at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unbelievable!","review":"This was my first Catherine Coulter book and it will be my last! The writing was completely unbelievable and you knew who the killer would be five chapters before it was ever revealed. The story dragged on and I found myself skipping two and three chapters ahead just to move things along. (and I found I didn't miss anything in the skipped chapters) I rented the Kindle copy from the library and am very happy I didn't waste anything other than time on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time and money","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the math teacher killer plot was a bit over kill and not nearly as interesting as the rest of the book. The other part of the book that didn't really make sense was the Valerie Rapper character that appeared to be after Savich. But, that being said, I found the book interesting and had trouble closing my kindle until I finished reading it. I truly enjoy Coulter's FBI series books and have read them all at least twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense-Filled.","review":"Blind Side is an exciting, page-turning suspense filled novel. I couldn't put it down from page one. Thoroughly enjoyed the character Sheriff Katie Benedict. She's tough, yet full of compassion for Sam, the little boy that was kidnapped not once but three times.

Not one solid character or developed plot. Painful to finish; I wish I had'nt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thriller with offensive language.","review":"I love a good mystery. Ms. Coulter's plots will keep you turning the pages. However I became tired of constantly having to skip over all the offensive language. I have decided NOT to read any more of Catherine Coulter's books (I read 6) because I am offended by her use of God and Jesus as curse words. There are hundreds of other things her characters could say to show shock and anger. I kept hoping she wouldn't always use the same language, but apparently she assumes it is what the readers want."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book made it to publication","review":"I honestly wish I could give zero stars for this book because that is exactly what it did for me - ZERO. There are 2 separate crimes, math teachers getting killed and a little boy being kidnapped. I kept waiting for the two to connect somehow, but they never do. The math teacher killer is resolved in about 2 paragraphs - no given clues or that sense of chase. So the main flux of the story is about the kidnapping. The dialogue is unrealistic (I kept asking myself who would say that?) and doesn't flow. Some one will be talking about 2 different and unrelated things in one sentence. It is definitely not worth the paper it is written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I bother?","review":"I kept waiting for the two story lines to merge and they never did. There was no real detective work, and what there was was sloppy. This needed some serious editing and rewriting. The characters were stereotypes and the dialogue stilted. At least she didn't make the people in East Tennessee into brainless hillbillies. The touchy-feely relationships made me want to gag, and this seemed to be more a romance novel that just happened to have a crime in it. The sudden wedding of Miles and Katie made no sense, and there was no passion in it. This is the first and last Coulter novel for me. It was certainly easy to read (skim) and is best suited to people with low reading skills and bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"I bought this book because I love all of Coulter's older novels. I am really into the mystery thrillers right now and this sounded great. What a waste! I've never read a book where the characters lacked so much personality and chemistry. Even the dialog was boring and bland. As for the romance, what romance?! Are we really expected to believe that Katie and Miles get married after 1 week when they have barely talked to each other the entire time. This book was such a waste of time and money and a huge disappointment to a long time Catherine Coulter fan. Will think twice before buying any of her newer books."},{"rating":"1","title":"possibly the worst book ever.","review":"This is my first review.

They seem to be an after thought to fit into a popular series, which doesn't work. This is the eighth in a good series, but doesn't have the quality that expectations from previous stories lead the reader to expect. Maybe one shouldn't mix romance, suspense and mystery all in the same volume.

The bottom rack does have a wood bottom and works fine. I did not discover this shortcoming until after I assembled the unit, otherwise I would immediately have sent this back.

It is hard to comprehend how the \\"crime\\" occured and the author does a good job in detailing the circumstances and the evidence. what comes across most strongly is that the parents of the victim forgave his killer and as a result the conviction and sentence which would other wise have seemed a travesty of justice, comes across as a fair conclusion. don't read this book if you want all the answers -no one has those but as a story it is very very compelling reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined for the remainder bin","review":"This book is a complete bore. Since the author didn't get any interviews with Mr. Kodikian or the victim's families, he has very little insight into what happened. It is pretentiously written and irritating to read.

Also check out his front page travel section writings on traveling in the desert before he killed his friend. He wrote these articles for the Boston Globe which launched a cover up campaign for him. This natural born killer knew exactly what he was doing. He just wanted to be another Jack Kerouac and wanted to make a story to sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic debut","review":"I knew this book would be of interest simply due to the morbidly unusual circumstances of the case itself, but Kersten's journalism is what makes this a genuinely good book. His prose is a pleasure to read, economical but with a flair for the romantic and an excellent instinct for presenting the case in a larger context, vis a vis the southwestern desert and the very human relationships involved. He never moralizes or takes sides, letting the stark ambiguity of Kodikian's story reasonate within each of us as a reader; the result is an absolutely harrowing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was not in new condition","review":"I was very disappointed to find that this product had writing on the bottom of the pages, and there was dirt and damage on the front cover.

I'm on page 171 and I have seldom come across a book that is so...irresistable. Yes, there could have been some more interviews about what happened in the desert and I believe Kodikian should have had an interview with Kersten. One should remember that this is a book that is based mainly on what really happened. It is interesting, educational (flora, fauna, desert), and really produces a sensation in the reader of \\"Wow, it's like I'm standing here right with them\\". Read it, you will most certainly enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but an interview with Kodikian would've made it better","review":"I had not heard of this case when I discovered this book at the library. I'm not a fan of the true-crime genre, but the jacket description intrigued me. A man murders his best friend as an act of mercy in an unforgiving landscape. I must admit, I couldn't put it down. I read it straight through in one sitting. I even enjoyed the historical anecdotes, the desert lore, descriptions of flora and fauna, and the quite useful information the entire story provides in the form of a textbook \\"what not to do\\" case.The book states that the only interview Kodikian granted was with Connie Chung for 20/20. It's a shame the author did not get one for this book, but the information of the journal entries and testimony rounded the story out adequately."},{"rating":"2","title":"first Orbital album","review":"awesome cd. the best techno music you'll ever hear, period.

This is actually the -first- Orbital CD that I purchased; I bought the older ones after this. Still, I like this one the best so far. It's got a nice, ambient and low-key sound that seems to be classic Orbital, with enough higher-energy tracks to keep the mix good.The best tracks on this disc, in my opinion are \\"If I Had Duck Feet\\" (I swear the carnival barker in the background is the guy who plays Neelix on \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\") and \\"Crash and Carry\\" (one of the most energetic tracks, but done at just the right level that it doesn't break the overall tone set by the other tracks).If you're a fan of Orbital or want a great example of ambient-style techno, this is definitely worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance to a different drum","review":"Orbital's third album is I think the best showcase of their massive talent at any style whatsoever. In diving in experimental waters the brothers missed on a couple tracks but on the majority the songs just knock you out. \\"Crash and Carry\\" and \\"Quality Seconds\\" have a harder edge than their recent work, and at the other end of the scale there's the smooth-as-glass \\"Science Friction,\\" the upbeat opening \\"Forever\\" and the outstanding electric symphony \\"Are We Here?\\" which alone is worth the price of the album. Not a wise first buy for techno fans, but once you get to feel Orbital's style, this album is well worth a close look."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmmm","review":"when i listened to this cd for the first time, i thought it was pretty dumb. however, about a week later, i decided to listen to it again. about 5 minutes into it, i suddenly GOT IT (there is really no way to describe this), and i fell into a detached state of semi consiousness for 3 amazing hours! it was incredible. i guess all i can describe it as is a journey through time and space. now, whenever i listen to, i hear all the incredible melodies and rythms which come together to make it so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never quite got it","review":"This was the second Orbital album I purchased. I loved \\"Insides\\", and hoped for more of the same. I was disappointed. This album contained a lot more wierd samples, that to me seemed to distract from cool synth noises. Also, I never found the rythyms and percussion as complex or as satisfying as those on \\"Insides\\". It did contain some very interesting tracks, but I never quite connected with the whole feel of this album, and eventually traded it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing flop.

Its holding on the two ends of the tub OK but the middle panels did not grab and hold as advertised - 24 hours later they are still sliding. He said there was moisture in the wall behind the tiles but I think a product advertising immediate grab and hold should do better than this. He came today and put in wooden braces to hold the wall against the tile and we HOPE this will work over the course of a few days. Its a water based product - maybe we should have used something stronger. He did wipe down the walls before installation to remove any traces of soap and the tiles were bone dry when installed.

Having served both as an enlisted sailor and officer in the U.S. Navy, I found many of the technological and tactical notions of this novel ridiculous. A copy of Jane's or Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet by the Naval Institute would greatly help. SH-60F of the (now ex-) Lewis B. Puller? A sonar suite on an amphibious assault ship? Mechanical arms on an attack submarine? His understanding of command in the line community is unplausible.

If you scooped up all the characters and placed them on one ship and then shoot a torpedo at it I would not have cared. There was no reason to like any of these characters. The Navy mumble jumble made it hard to follow at first. The best thing about this book is that it is only 342 pages. Mobley does however seem to have a great understanding of submarines, but actually I would not really know because I have never been on one. Reading the description on the back you would think the Korean element might be discussed more but it is not. About 90 percent of this book is playing cat and mouse between Jerusha Bailey and the German U-boat. You think something is going to happen and then it never does. The end is pretty lackluster also except that you are done reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate portrayal of modern naval warfare","review":"As a Surface Warfare Officer, I was quite disappointed with the obvious lack of research into shipboard weapon systems and tactics. Sonar systems on amphibious assault ships, SH-60F on 3800-ton FFG's, etc. C.A. Mobley would do well by utilizing the in-depth research techniques of Tom Clancy or write about things experienced like Dale Brown. Overall, any similarities between this novel and the U.S. Navy, in weapon systems, tactics or command structure, are purely coincidental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy it is not!","review":"I was given this book to read, and I'm trying to give it back. This is ther first portrayal of Naval warfare that has ever made me sick, and it wasn't sea sickness.

And it does have a few moments. \\"Only the Strong Survive\\" is a chill number. \\"Duality\\" with DJ Shadow is amazing, but the amazing part is mostly the second half, which sounds a lot more like Shadow than like Krush.A lot of the rest of the album is, literally, beats. The paths are literally drumloops for 45 seconds or so, reminiscent of one of those demo records that DJs mine for breaks, samples, and general turntablism madness. Whereas other records by DJs that I have (I'll mention Shadow again) are able to take bits and pieces of samples and craft emotional masterpieces, this one is just soulful grooves with sparse, denuded arrangements. There's just not that much there.So if you get this record, get it on vinyl, where it may come to more use. There is no point to having this on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking Flatware","review":"I'm so happy with this flatware! I looked for months, seeking something that was unique and stylish and found it in the Avalon set. The utensils are heavy and oversized, but the shape is clean and even elegant. I love the forged iron look combined with a sleek, shiny, high quality stainless steel. It seems like every guest raves about how beautiful and special this flatware is.I bought a nice silverplated stainless set at the same time as this one, thinking we would want to have a \\"dressier\\" option for some days. We are clearly preferring the Avalon set and I'll probably expand my set and auction the silverplate off.It works in a fun way with my Royal Doulton china and makes my Fiesta ware so much more interesting!Note: this review was for the complete set."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"It's amazing how history gets quickly forgotten. At the time of its release this album created a stink - even the band disowned it as a poor record of their \\"closing week\\" in Winterland, 1974, when it seemed as if the Dead was heading for retirement.It does not stand up well at all. No thrill, passion, excitement, and a bizarre choice of material given the wealth of good performances from the same run of shows. Lacklustre sums it up. If you have seen the Grateful Dead movie, this is from the same era. And traditionally it rates as the poorest ever official release by the Dead.Not a fitting memnorial. You have, thankfully, a whole host of better material to choose from. Same era? Look at Dicks Picks , the Boston 1974 show. Avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steal Your Money","review":"The sound, considering it was from the wall of sound era, is poor. The song selection is weak.

If you haven't bought this disc already, skip it. There are far better recordings out there. The only good thing about this disc is the song selection. Sound quality isn't the best, and the band sounds tired. Move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good kind of Different!!!!","review":"I loved the way this book was written. The characters weren't talking to each other in this book, they were talking to me. I felt as if I was there experiencing what they did, felt and shared. There wasn't meaningless dialouge in here. Changer of Days drew me in and didn't let go until the very end. The places where they traveled seemed so realistic and yet vague enough to let me still use my own imagination. I felt something with each and every character be it happiness, sadness, angst, anger, betrayal and exhaustion. I can't wait to re-read it. I would definately recommend that you buy and read this duology.

It's relaxed, and I know that might sound redundant when speaking of \\"The Dead\\" but this is more relaxed than usual. It just sounds like the group is playing whatever they want to play the way they'd like to play it. They don't seem to be under much pressure and you can hear it in the music. I know that sometimes you can get diamonds from pressure but sometimes it's nice to know that some of your favorite artists are enjoying themselves as much as you are. The musicianship is still top notch and Robert Hunter's lyrics are as introspective as ever. The suprise to me is just how good Bob Weir's \\"Weather Report Suite\\" is.

Personally, I like the return of the pedal steel to Buckners music, and \\"Dents and shells\\" is a step up from \\"Impasse\\", in which I found good but a little drab. Also, there is more of a full band feel to this album...and that is good too.

In anticipation of a 12-hour cross-country drive, I bought several new albums, but Dents and Shells was the one we all wanted to hear again and again.There is an easy, layered depth to the songwriting and lyrics, and great playing-the musicians sound like they've been working together for a long time. I was mildly surprised to find this album in the country section at the record store, a section that is less familiar to me. The music definitely feels \`authentic', as Old-Time music can at its best.This is just an all around great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, defective DVD","review":"I enjoyed this movie, but it's not for action adventure fans.

Sit for awhile and listen to Dr. Weil's kind voice and that alone will have you feeling relaxed. John Kabat-Zinn is a little odd, I really respect his vast knowledge and practical advice, but his take on things seems a bit surreal. I recommend this for anyone who is in need of a practical, if basic guide to meditation."},{"rating":"1","title":"breathless","review":"This CD was recommended to me and I have heard good things about Dr. Weil, but I have to say the CD's were a let down. The lecture was too long and i thought it would have been better to simply be text. The actual breathing exercises were not that inspiring and quite short. Although it was instructional to go through the breathing exercises along with the CD it would have been better if that part was expanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and highly usable","review":"Terrific 2 CD set - enjoyable to listen to, highly informative, short and sweet.

Perhaps as an introduction to meditation there is some useful content, but I did not find it helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weil is great, but who is this Kabat-Zinn?","review":"I love Weil's soothing voice and articulate sentences that flow naturally and motivates as well as guides us throught meditation.But the other one, Kabat-Zinn, has a chest-breathing voice, sounds shallow and too high-pitch... then he doesn't know how to punctuate his sentences, grouping words together, then making a pause between key words that leave you anxious to get the next word... The content is valid, but his way of transmitting is just horrible.I couldn't stand his voice, although succeeded to listen to the whole thing.The guided meditation is done by him, so I can forget about it; NO WAY I'm relaxing with him!It's a shame, had Weil did it alone, it would have be a great piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Anyone with a modicum of intelligence will surly find themselves unable to get through more than the first few tracks of the guided meditation.

It's well known that DJ Premier was in charge of production for artists like Jeru, Group Home, M.O.P. and GangStarr. However, on this album, Jeru and Premier seemed to have created a different kind of concept that is not present on any either D&D album. Jeru was a hypo-political storyteller and Permier's beat were the artistic backdrops. \\"Come Clean\\" was and still is an amazing track.

At least that's what I thought. I can't say the same for Mims. With his long-winded intro about music saving his life, you start to wonder if Mims is trying to appeal to your heart or your ear. Pretty soon you find that it's not really either. Many of the songs are too soft compared to the hit, lacking even big bass that makes for an enjoyable car ride.

I don't get how people like UGK and hate this guy, what is the difference really? You guys are being hypocrites. Of course MIMS isn't on the same level as legends like UGK, but he isn't really bad. When this came out, I wasn't really a fan because of the party songs. I'm not very big on east coast party rappers, I expect lyrically talent from them. Despite this, there are some real nice cuts. Doctor, Doctor includes a story of his past. I don't know this guy's life, but if he's had a troubled past, he did a wonderful job telling it by his single standard because I didn't expect this. There are about 6 out of the 15 tracks that are very well done, which does bring the album down. Too much skipping for me. I request MIMS to create a character or make a biography by extending the story within Doctor, Doctor. That would be a great album. 2.5/5 -- not worth buying but give Doctor,Doctor a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is my saviour?","review":"Continuing my rampage on wack rappers.

The line up consisted of many of Jerry's longtime Bluegrass buddies like former New Riders David Nelson, Sandy Rothman with JGB mainstay John Kahn on bass and drummer David Kemper on snare with new friend Kenny Kosek on fiddle. The album features many favorites such as Swing Low Sweet Chariot, Deep Elem Blues, I've Been All Around This World, I'm Troubled and so on. Most of the songs feature Jerry singing the lead although David Nelson does get a couple in there. The recording was made by John Cutler on a two track DAT feed and the reissue has been upgraded to HDCD. aside from that, I don't notice any difference in the sound between the new version and my original 1988 pressing bought by my grandmother for my birthday.

She lived on the edge of privledge and was sheltered from most of the shattering events of her childhood.This did not stop her from digging relentlessly into her past. She has interviewed many surviving players in these events (including members of the KKK) and has given us a glimpse and how her family was impacted by what went on around them.She also provides an inside portrait of how these events were shaped by the giants of the civil rights movement and how the events shaped them.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle edition is terrible","review":"Unfortunately, I did not start reading this until after the seven day return period for Kindle books.

It's an absolute must-read for anyone trying to understand the Simplicity movement or to live more mindfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Inspiration","review":"Voluntary Simplicity is more of a mood piece than an instruction manual. It's not designed to turn crass materialists into simple-living Ghandites. Rather it's to inspire those already on that path. In that task it suceeds admiringly. The book has a warmth and integrity to it that is appropriate to it's philosophy. In a culture where living simply and with principles is treated like an anachronism, that inspiration is important. Read it and be fortified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most important book I've read in years","review":"Please read this book. Elgin's discussion of simplicity touches on every facet of life from personal growth, the environment, politics, work, money, to the survival of the human race.

I'm all for living a simpler and richer life. And I agree with Elgin's ideas about accomplishing this at a personal level, using individual creativity and imagination to work out our problems. But I was very troubled when Elgin started proposing things like massive taxes on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol to force people to change their way of living. Once again I hit my head against the wall of \\"liberal thinking\\": great ideas, but always forced upon us by big government. If Elgin had stayed the course and argued for individual change through education and personal enlightenment (and leave the government out of it), I would have given the book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preaching to the converted?","review":"Not quite a classic in the sense of Thoreau's \\"Walden\\", and not a practical how-to like Dominguez and Robin's \\"Your money or your life\\". First published in 1981, Voluntary Simplicity nevertheless offers a passionate and compelling arguement in favour of simplicity, frugality and sanity.One can take the view that we can go living the way we are forever, but recent world events should point to the fact that that is an unrealistic dream. As the earth has its limits, so does the patience of the \\"have-not\\" nations we share the world with.Voluntary Simplicity's message is relevant and eminently sensible. But with our culture's prevailing attitudes of greed and consumerism, it is easier said than done. Unfortunately the message seems lost on those who needs it most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down marxism","review":"This book is not the best introduction i've seen to left wing political and social thought. Essentially this book boils down to an incredibly dulled down (and perhaps even anti-intellectual) interpretation of some of Marx's more interesting idea's. However, books like these are dangerous. Marx is remembered due to jis brilliance. Duane Elgin will not be. He demonstartes a less then adequate understanding of the material he preaches, and borders on a thin line where he plays with some potentially dangerous idea's. To all considering to buy this book, I'd recomend picking up some Marx, or any well known Marxist thinker, so as to get a clear interpretation of what is being spoken of, and so that you are given direction by means of someone who truly can see the larger picture, and who has a deeper understanding ofd the human dileema."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had not received","review":"There is no commentes to talk about, since the product is already paid and not yet delivered.

It is smooth, fragrant, not too rich, and easy to drink more than one cup! This is the t-disc I reach for most frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gevalia is a ripoff","review":"I can't believe the ripoff Gevalia is getting away with in this country. Yes, as a coffee it's OK, certainly better than most coffees sold in the U.S. But then most Americans don't know what good coffee is.My objection is the price. Gevalia sells in markets in Sweden for between 19 and 29 Swedish Crowns, that is, between $2.32 and $3.65 for a half/kilo package, a bit more than a pound. It's the Folgers of Sweden, an average coffee at best. Idiot Americans are willing to pay 6 times the going rate out of sheer lunacy.My wife and I have a second home in Sweden and drink Gevalia there, but it's cheap coffee. If you want your Gevalia but don't like getting ripped off just go to Ikea where it's sold at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay AWAY from their membership!!!","review":"These people are complete morons.PLEASE don't even bother joining up to their membership because they are idiots. First of all, I had a HUGE problem joining because they couldn't match my state and zip code, which is legitimate, and second, the 2 people that answered the phone were foreign and I couldn't understand a word they said and they couldn't understand me. Second, I cancelled my shipments and they charged my card anyway, which resulted in an overdraft fee, and then the next month they charged me AGAIN.I am now on the phone waiting over 10 minutes to talk to a supervisor...and what galls me is that their coffee is not even good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband's favorite!","review":"My husband has tried about six different varieties of coffee from the Tassimo and he didn't care for any of them.

Most of the grounds ended up in the bottom of my cup and the rest spewed all over my coffeemaker! I notified Gevalia over a month ago and they have not offered any explanation or solution to this problem. I have not had this problem with any other brand of T-disc or other Gevalia blends. It is extremely frustrating considering I am paying extra for the Gevalia name. I would recommend Maxwell House or Seattle's Best being far superior in the T-Discs with no grounds in the bottom of your cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping too expensive","review":"If these were easier to find locally I would never buy these on-line due to high cost of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have the coffee, not the pot !","review":"I ordered the Tassimo Coffee Maker and coffee discs for my daughter.

It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic \\"coffee\\". The \\"crema\\" version is not much more than pretty window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."},{"rating":"1","title":"switched to Starbucks","review":"The Gevalia coffees are a little weak for my taste, so I switched to all Starbucks House Blend and Africa Kitamu."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE","review":"We really enjoy the hearty flavor of this coffee, which is probably why we keep reordering it.

For the most part, I found that I could learn something from this extraordinary family and at the same time enjoy it tremendously. It is one of the most inspirational memoirs I have read. It brings reader into an unusual racial world where a White becomes the minority in a society, which allows this memoir to stand out among the others. The author has done a great job at portraying the racial conflicts of his time, the social and economic inequality, and, most importantly, the significance of family and love.The last chapters are not as impressive as the previous ones because the author elaborates too much on a single subject. Such as in \\"Dennis\\", McBride tells his father's life story chronologically. Also, it sounds extremely passive, and this makes it even less interesting.However, overall, I still highly recommend this memoir. It is a worthwhile read despite the latter parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"If you are like me an enjoy TRUE stories of LOVE through a the world's racism, sexism, and ugliness.

Which raised questions by the children, such as why are you lighter than all the other moms which would be abruptly answered with a \\"I'm light-skinned.

I had no trouble relating to the characters. I \\"felt\\" as if I were \\"there\\" with them. James McBride's description of his growing up in his unusual family is painful yet inspiring. His mother loves all her children in her own way. Her childhood was not like most, but I believe that her upbringing (or lack of it) was the reason that she was able to raise 12 wonderful children and put them through college and beyond. Her focus was education and religion. I was so impressed that after all her children graduated from college that she got her college degree.

Here we have a book penned by an Afro-American that contains many anti-Semitic stereotypes supposedly related to the author by his mother who pathologically rejected her Jewish roots, and everyone praises the book. I am both puzzled and offended. In addition if his mother had used the same child rearing practices 20 years later her children would have been sent to foster homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two amazing people, two amazing stories","review":"Ruth Jordan and David McBride may not look like mother and son, but they are. This story tells the tale of two people who over came problems such as poverty, discrimination, and self-loathing to let their true personality shine through. Ruth battled childhood abuse and adult poverty to find love and happiness with two strong black men, and the twelve children she raised. David McBride fought the perils of the inner-city (drugs, crime,and gangs) to go on to college and become a journalist. This is more than a tale of overcoming race and prejudice. This is more than a tale about overcoming social/economic barriers. This is a tale of dedicated love, and how that love can reshape our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"All People Are the Color of Water","review":"This is a very interesting memoir about the author's mother.Jim is half black and half Jewish.

His mother, Ruth McBride-Jorden is an exceptional woman. She has had an unbelievably difficult life, but has conquered all by putting her twelve children through college. She has proven that anything is possible. This book, by far, was the best book I have ever read. It kept my interest and I read it in one sitting. I could not put the book down.

As a white woman involved in an interracial relationship in the new millenium, I applaud the mother's conviction and dedication to her family. Her love for both of her black husbands from the 40's through to the present is inspirational. While I may never experience the same struggles that she faced, I felt as though we share the same beliefs.

I believe it was the unique title that caugh my eyes when I was deciding on which book to read for school. I really enjoyed the idea of interchanging chapters with words from him and his mother. It really captured my curiosity to read on. This book gives one a fair idea of Ruth McBride Jordan's plight as a white woman fighting to survive with her twelve children despite the prevalent issue of race and her poverty.

Author James McBride eloquently interweaves part of his life story with his mother's and the result is a wonderful memoir that eloquently addresses race, religious, and identity issues.James McBride's beautifully written memoir is not only a tribute to a mother of a black man to his white Jewish mother; it is also about him realizing and coming to terms with his identity.

I recommend this book to those I work with, to my son's high school English teachers, to anyone who is searching for a satisfying, uplifting experience. I say experience rather than 'book.' To me, reading this book is an experience. I pull it out and re-read it every year.

I was so deeply moved at her answer \\"God is the color of water.\\" It gave me so much to think about - water has no color, but it reflects all colors. I was so excited about that thought and about how the book shows that we can celebrate diversity in such a positive and loving way that I recommended to my prof. that he make it part of his reading curriculum for the class.

The Suffolk I remember was a loving, warm community. These differences in our experiences probably stemmed from our different circumstances? I was a white Anglo Saxon. Thus, this book helps me see my own life from a perspective that I did not see, or was not aware of, when I was growing up in Suffolk. Still I can't help thinking that some of Ms. McBride's impressions were molded by the low esteem in which her father appears to have been held, even among Jewish people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of miracles","review":"This book includes two stories. First there is the story of the writer's mother's troubled early life of isolation and abuse in the small town of Suffolk, Virginia. Then there is the story of her life as a mother of a large, black family, in New York City, herself being a white, Jewish woman, as told by the author. Anyone who has grown up in a large family (or knows of one) will easily relate to the second story; and there are lots of laugh out loud scenes included. Ultimately, this is a story of salvation, survival, miracles, and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but SURFACE.","review":"Altho this story had its interesting--fascinating, even--moments, for the most part, it was too much surface and not enough depth.

This is not a pretty picture and is not \\"inspiring\\" and \\"moving\\" as the book has been described by others. Also, his mother is not an angel by any standards as she frequently beat her children and provided food from her purse for the first ones to grab the purse.

It was so enveloping that I could not stop reading it! I strongly urge everyone to read this book. I myself reflected upon my own racial background and how important a family can be. This book does not limit one certain ethnicity to read or to relate to the story...I am neither black or Jewish but could empathize with the author's obstacles. This is one of the best qualities about the book...it is universal. James McBride's tribute was touching and his mother, Mrs. Ruth McBride Jordan, was well deserving of such praise.

Ruth McBride, his mother, revealed several shocking bits of information about herself, her father, and her mother. She had a tough childhood and adulthood. She faced all facts about racism. She was faced with death and being dead to her family. I really enjoyed this memoir. It helped me understand the problems that these people faced in the earlier years. I recommend people all over to read this facinating memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story of a black man and his white mother","review":"I liked The Color of Water because it showed how one woman who beat the odds of being shunned by family and society and came out on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"McBride Master of Media Manipulation","review":"I marvelled at the tale, not the telling. I came away feeling tantalized, that there was the makings for a great book but the author had not given us his final draft. The book reads at times like a diary, giving some very intense facts but no insight into the why's and how's of this fascinating family. This book felt like the publisher's world version of the television \\"sweeps\\" week; where the delivered product never lives up to all the hype.Frank McCourt's book, Angela's Ashes, was a much more satisfying memoir. He also recounts a childhood of beating insurmountable odds to become a productive member of society. But McCourt captures the reader with his lyric compassionate style and unlike McBride, completes the characters and story so one is not left with more questions than answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong family, not so strong book","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't get the rave feelings that this title evoked in so many. I definately applaud Mrs. McBride for her remarkable child-rearing despite their hardships and the theme of a strong family core is always appreciated. However, overall the text was flat and redundant, the topic itself (confusion over racial identity)--although common and realistic--was very frustating, and no particular point of the book was expounded on enough to satisfy my concerns or curiosities. I appreciate its literary contribution but this story just disappointed and irritated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving glimpse of a world few know.","review":"An honest look at a remarkable (but certainly not perfect) woman who had a foot in two different worlds but belonged fully to neither. McBride paints a vivid picture (warts and all) of his family. When this short book was over I felt like inviting him over for coffee to find out more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommened!!!!!","review":"This book was a very interesting book. It makes you think about all of the different problems people are faced with in this world and how we should all be looked at equally and not by our color. It also made me realize that in all ethnic groups there are capable, intelligent and outstanding people that are dedicated to their beliefs. Rachel Shilsky was this kind of person, raising her 12 kids to believe that an education was the most important part of life. This was a very touching story that I recommend to any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a tribute,a recognition to his moter sacrifices","review":"ON HIS BOOK McBRIDE SHOWS NOT ONLY HIS LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER BUT HOW PROUD HE IS OF HER.RUTH McBRIDE JORDAN IS A WARRIOR,WITH ALL THE STRUGLE AND TRIBULATIONS SHE WENT THROUGH SHE WAS ABLE TO RAISED A FAMILY,AND PROVIDE FOR THEM EVEN IF THIS MEANT SACRIFICE HERSELF.AT THE END HER TWELVE CHILDREN ARE THE REWARD OF HER HARD WORK AND DEDICATION.TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL NIT BE DISSAPOINTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"I was baby sittin some kids, and found this book among the books in the shelves. the title took my attention..

I strongly recommend this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...","review":"Personally, I thought this book was just looking for some sympathy from its reader. Sure its sad and all that he's had this crazy life, but please, we all have nutty lives and we all have even nuttier stories, but we are not all compelled to write a hudge novel about it and then have sophomore English classes make it apart of their required curriculum. Thats rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Color of Boredom","review":"I think this book is definately one of the most boring books I have ever read and I which that I never had read it. I enjoy action books with twists and turns and this book is a book about a white woman with 8 black kids. This book talks about racism and the trouble of a woman's heart....YAWN...why not just watch paint dry, I also could not remember what I had read just minutes before because the excitment level was low. I saw that Amazon gave this a 4.5 rating, a woman must of been the reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book has been on the New York Times Paperback Bestsellers list for months. Frankly, I wonder why. As a writer, I feel that the book does not carry any message. As a Jew, I am offended at the generalizations made about the mother's family.Yes, the story tries to paint a three-dimensional picture of a large poor African-American family and the woman who keeps it together. However, I left the book thinking \\"So what?\\" There is not much but straight description; the narrator does not show or tell us why we should care about his story.In addition, McBride paints a picture of his mother's Jewish family that is extremely bitter; the mother's commentary hints that all Jews act like her family.All in all, THE COLOR OF WATER is not worth your time. If it's inspiration or heart-breaking prose that you're looking for, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugarcoats Some Serious Issues","review":"Lots of people find this book inspirational, because it's easy to get caught up in the author's loving prose. A critical read of this book shows something else, however. James McBride's white and Jewish-born mother, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, reinvented herself, as many abuse survivors do. She married an African-American preacher (and, after being widowed, another African-American), converted to Christianity and raised 12 children in the church and in poverty. All the kids went on to college. Boom, a happy ending. A different son might harbor resentment toward a mother who denied him the Jewish part of his heritage, beat him with a belt, left the kids alone till she came home from work at 2 a.m., and lived with a second husband who only came home on weekends and left her with 4 more mouths to feed. And my guess is he does, but his mother raised her children to never air their dirty laundry in public, so this book sugarcoats it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New After Page 40","review":"My definition of a worthwhile read, especially in memoirs, would be one that is compelling, insightful, educational, and/or new. One out of five stars because only about 20% of this book fulfilled the previous criteria, and nothing new was written after about page 40. This book had mass appeal potential, but in reality that appeal cannot be beyond those few that have had large-family interracial experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"\\"The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to his White Mother\\" Is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. From the moment I began I was unable to put it down unitil I was finished. It is truly a must read for all generations, colors, and creeds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, witty, and wise.","review":"McBride's tribute to his mother is an entertaining and quick read. He describes -- alternating between his reflections and her recollections -- how she and their large family overcame obstacles, shortages, and setbacks with large doses of determination and love. You can read this book in a few hours, but it will give you things to think or laugh about long after you've finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing story","review":"This is truly a very inspiring book. The interweaving of the author's story and his mother's was well-done. The text is beautiful in its simplicity and candor. This is one of the most interesting nonfictional books I have read in a while. It was very touching at times, but it was also quite humorous at other times. I wish, though, that several loose ends at the end were tied up."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Color of Water","review":"This is a truly remarkable story. It really put things in perspective for me and made me give thanks for my childhood, which was not nearly as difficult as James McBride's. His family faced difficulty after difficulty and his writing is superb. He is striaghtforward yet somewhat poetic in his descriptions of his youth. His mother should be proud to have such a son who is so eloquent in paying homage to the woman who struggled to raise her family despite poverty and racism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"It is a wonderful book.I think people need to read this book.It is a wonderful sense of realism book.If people read this book they will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"two lives @ a glance","review":"I read this book when I was in the 11th grade, I simply love it. I actually had to reread the first 4 chapters twice, because I was so confused at first. Tha authors style of writing and they way the book was split leaves you a little confused, but then u realize it is his life and then his mothers. I simply enjoyed this book. It not only discusses what life is like for a black boy, but for a white woman engaged in an interracial relationship and the struggles she faced. We so often hear about the Black struggle...its good to see boths sides for once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite!!","review":"This is my all time favorite book. I came across it by chance while working at a book store in college and have read it 3 times in 5 years. The juxtaposition of the authors \\"story\\" with his mother's is unlike anything I have ever read. People of every race, every religion, and every generation will relate to the joys, angst, and triumph of this story. I've told everyone I know about this book. It's is an easy read and worth every penny and every second of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm without words...","review":"I just finished this novel and I cannot even begin to tell you how touched I am by this story. Everyone must read this! It speaks to you on so many levels. Family, faith, race... its just everything. A definte must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I found this one","review":"The only reason I found out about this book was because I joined a book club. The title didn't grab me, the sub-title didn't inspire me to grab this one off the shelves.Boy am I glad I read it though! Makes me wonder how many other books of this caliber I've missed throughout the years.The Color of Water is an outstanding read, and as biographies go, I felt more connected to this story than most I've read. I don't see how you could read this book and not feel like you've learned something. Definitely a 5-star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Memoir","review":"This book transcends all descriptions usually given to most books that come along. It gets to the root of what it is to be human, to struggle to belong, to find our place, but most of all about the power of unconditional love and its ability to heal and protect us. For a Christian, this book is an amazing testament to what faith in Jesus is really about. I was moved by James McBride's story like no other in many years. It is a classic and should be required reading in all schools. He is masterly in this story. It is funny, honest, tender and so, so real. You really feel like you know these people. Please read it now!!! (I know this is more feeling than review but I figured others had fleshed out the bones of the story already.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and most informative","review":"I will keep this short. Mr. McBride wrote a very good book alternating chapters about his mother's Jewish childhood with chapters about his mixed race and Christian childhood. I finished the book with more respect and appreciation for both Jewish and Christian religions, and for Whites and Blacks. I very much recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"color of people","review":"This book is easy to read, although there are lot of story I heard like this. For the most part, it was too much surface and not enough depth. The author should stick with writing newspaper articles to write about the racism, because still racism exist in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could have given it NO stars!","review":"This book is blatantly antisemitic. The mother obviously has a deep hatred of Judiasm and has done all she can to make it look horrible. Meanwhile the African-Americans are all very kind and decent, and there is an awful lot of Christian overtones, which constrast *SHARPLY* with the description of Judiasm. But I can tell you that *VERY FEW* Jews have any interest in converting to Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Color Of Water Book Review","review":"The Color Of Water is set in two different time periods, with two different characters but the problems that occur During their lives are similar. The book is attributed to James McBride's mother who grew up as a Jewish girl. Who went on to merry a black man and have black children. The story tells of James mothers childhood and James childhood growing up with a black mom.This is a very dull book. I was hoping that the book would get exciting and there would be a huge ending. I was very disappointed in this book because of all the hype that it had.On a good side, it was a very interesting topic of a white mom raising black children. He did a good job with the showing in the book.The book was not what I expected from all the talk of how good it was. If I could recommend this book it would be to families that have dealt with racial issues or to older adults. I would not recommend this book to teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like stereotypes...","review":"If you like reinforcing stereotypes, then James McBride's book is for you. Jews have big noses, they only care about money, and of course, his converted mother only finds love through Jesus. But let's move past that. A great mother? Perhaps her children would not have had to eat sugar as a meal or wake up at 3 am (when she came home from work with free food from her employer) to eat-- else they went hungry if she had the number of children that she and her could support. Perhaps living in a house where the dog's feces is kicked under the radiator is not an indication of a strong mother. How about when she pays one fare for the subway and puts herself and the twelve children through on that one fare. These are not virtues. The writing was weak; the message was weaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct Anti-Semitism","review":"I was very disturbed by this book and by its reception. The implicit anti-Semitism was extraordinary. Every Jewish character, with the exception of the mother who was trying to be black, exemplified anti-Semitic stereotypes. The Jewish characters were mean, greedy, perverted, prejudiced, uncharitable and had no sense of family. On the other hand, the black characters were warm, loving, supportive, intellectually superior, responsible and generally all around wonderful human beings. If the characterizations were reversed this book would have been condemned as racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"no great expectations","review":"It's an easily read book, but nothing more. The subject and the strusture are offering nothing new. The strong point is the narration being vivid, but nothing more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book! Couldn't put it down!","review":"This is a wonderful book about people. If all would read it, this world would be a better place for everyone. I love how both son and mother think about people. If we all would not care about race, religion, etc. and live with respect of others, what a wonderful world this would be!This is a \\"must\\" read. You will go away feeling good about the human race"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable Book","review":"This is an amazing book which we recommend to anybody who likes poignant,heartwarning and remarkable books. We love it because it shows the struggle of million of people in decades ago just in one family. you could see how discrimination embraced and destroy communities and families. The author's manner of writing impressed us in many ways. James McBride made us cry,laugh and even made us think that we all are equal. It made us reflect that even though we have certain differences, we all come from the same God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique story","review":"I like the story because I think it's quite a unique story. I really admire the way his mother raised 12 black children by herself all this time successfully. One other thing that makes me like this book more is the language the author uses, a daily language that is quite easy to understand with only a few hard phrases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"I ran across this page-turner this past weekend and read it straight through in one sitting. What seemed at first to be a story too fantastic to be true (and who isn't more sceptical in these post-\\"Million\\" days?) quickly unfolded into a moving account of a remarkable woman's singular achievement in successfully raising 12 children in a world where almost all the odds were stacked against her -- and them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book more than I did.","review":"While it was remarkable that this woman managed to raise 12 kids and provide them with college educations, I didn't find Ruth to be a particularly sympathetic character. Quite frankly, she beat her kids way too much for my taste. What was missing from this memoir was how, exactly, Ruth managed to get her kids' their college educations. Did I miss that part? Plus, I found the book vaguely anti-semitic. It played into every Jewish stereotype possible. Rick Bragg's tribute to his mom, \\"All Over But the Shoutin'\\" was a much more moving memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an inspiration","review":"In a world where we think that everything revolves around ourselves, out comes a book that reminds us of what the true meaning of sacrifice and love are really all about. Just when we think that we've done everything we can, we read about a woman who goes above and beyond the call of duty. This book is an inspiration and a guiding tool for hard work, dedication, and respect for the human race!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very heartfelt \\"Thank You\\"","review":"Thank you Mr McBride and your Mother also, for allowing us to enter your lives.

A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Written","review":"I have to admit when I first started reading the book I was confused on what was happening. Once I figured it out it was really easy to follow. I found both stories to be intriguing and left me wanting more. I would have liked to known why the second husband was living in a seperate home. Not knowing didnt take away from the story though. I read a review that said more should have been written about the siblings. I would have to disagree the book is his tribute to his mother. Telling the stories of James & Ruth was all I needed. Knowing the success of the siblings was enough for me.

In the blink of an eye, here we are, still trying to make sense of our lives -- but now dealing with all these losses of opportunities, loved ones, energy, dreams and illusions. Atlas hits all the big issues -- death of parents, loss of job, stiffening joints, anxieties about money and marriage and status amongst peers. It's poignant and provocative and, as Atlas has himself done many times, I, too, teared up -- facing up to the reality that there's likely a lot more living behind me than ahead. All in all, a wonderful collection of thoughtful, poignant, sweet, and revealing musings on the beginning of the endgame from a guy who writes about the kind of stuff we'd prefer to ignore, but know we need to reflect on."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant","review":"An insightful look into a life, with lots of universal truths to be had. While some of the essays threatened to lapse into tedium from time to time, they were all ultimately rescued with honest insights into life.

He speaks with a lispy mush-mouth and can't maintain an level of volume. He'll start a paragraph with a clear full tone and then, like his writing, drift down to a sad mumble. I had to constantly fiddle with the volume dial to make out the words. I can only deduce that it was his vanity that compelled him to narrate his memoir, because he clearly doesn't have the skills for it.The book doesn't really tell us as much about middle age as it does about one man's perpetual dissatisfaction with life.

This first CD starts out with the popular song \\"Disposable Teens\\", first heard on the radio, then Blair Witch 2:Book of Shadows, and then found in Mansons newest album, Holy Wood. If you haven't heard Disposable Teens, this is a good way to check it out. You also get 2 unreleased marilyn manson songs, \\"working class hero\\" (john lennon\\", and \\"diamonds and pollen\\". Unreleased songs are normally rare, and fun to get of course. But if you are just a fan of the manson style, i recommend not getting this CD because of the other 2 songs (covers basically). But if you are a true manson fan, and love any song that comes out of his mouth, you will like hearing the different way that he sings these other 2 unreleased tracks, and I recommend purchasing this rare import, because it will be hard to find anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Sassy Tree","review":"Beautiful work by everyone involved.

Black Cadillac is a true 5 star release and it is Rosanne's masterpiece. This coming from someone who has Rosanne's debut Right or Wrong on vinyl and most of her CDs. The songwriting on Black Cadillac is just superb along with the production and great supporting musicians. Yeah, even darker than Interiors [I like it that way], but richer and more profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Album","review":"Mostly filled with negative imagery--religious yet dominated by atheism, loss of sibling and spouses, death seemingly dominates sometimes incomprehensible lyrics. In minor modality with diminished chords to match neurotic subject matter. Fortunately the band takes over before the artist collapses completely in most of these tracks. Not quite so beyond all hope as Emmylou Harris All I Intended to Be but in the same vein--perhaps slit in the latter.

My favorite song is the title track. It is a wonderful tribute to her late father Johnny. I loved the groovy bass playing by Michael Rhodes on this track. I Was Watching You is another standout song about how much Roseanne loves and misses her father. What really stands out is the beautiful piano playing that accompanies Roseanne's moving vocals. Home on the Lake is another one of my favorites on this album. It is a sentimental song featuring great acoustic guitar playing bout Roseanne's memories of growing up in a house in Tennesee.The World Unseen is another highlight on this CD. This is another nice track with very romantic piano playing. This song is about trying to make a connection with someone. I also loved the track God Is In the Roses. This is a beautiful song about the beauty of nature. Black Cadillac is Roseane Cash's best work. The songs are so heartfelt and personal, and I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosanne's Musical Masterpiece","review":"Rosanne Cash's musical journey began with the question of is she, \\"Right or Wrong\\" and she still seams to questioning the reason why life is the way it is. She recognizes the security of her father's Christian faith and even wishes she could experience that faith but ties that faith to a set of rules and criticizes \\"religion\\" for the unjustices conducted in the name of God. The music on this work is the best in her career. One wonders if she knew the truth concerning the Christian religion how much brighter her music could become. The simple truth is there are only two rules to follow. Love God and love others,(Math. 22: 37-40)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced and underwhelming","review":"The music on this CD has been described as \\"cerebral.\\" That really means it's inaccessible.

Nancy Sinatra she ain't! Roseanne has put together a very coherent group of players including the immortal Benmont Tench among others. This is a very hearfelt disc with a touch of sadness to it. However it's all very well done and has more in common with Lucinda Williams than Martina McBride. I really don't even like country music! Unless you consider Robbie Fulks country.

Although there are only twenty-seven songs in this little volume, some of them are not to be found elsewhere. I have especially enjoyed playing the arrangements of Follow Me Up To Carlow and The Parting Glass in this book.

BRenda Joyce, please go back to writing like you did in \\"After Innocence\\" or the \\"The Game\\" now those two books were awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please - do not read this book","review":"I have read almost all of Brenda Joyce's novels, and I have to say this one is easily the worst. This book deals with the supernatural - a topic that I normally enjoy, but I definitely didn't come close to enjoying this book. I kept reading hoping that my attention would be captured, but instead I grew to dislike the characters and their idiotic behavior more and more. The plot never truly comes together and the characters don't evoke any feelings in the reader, except for contempt. If you want to read a good Brenda Joyce book, try \\"The Game\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Dreams","review":"I had read one other Brenda Joyce book a few years ago and can't recall what it was about. However, \\"House of Dreams\\" was one of the sorriest books that I have read for a long time. I sincerely wish that I had just stopped after I had read the first few pages and it didn't \\"catch\\" me. I decided to continue on until the bitter (and I do mean bitter) end. Maybe her other books are better and I just picked up the wrong one. I work at a library and this is one book that will be hard for me to personally recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read before Halloween","review":"I didn't agree with many of the negative reviews for this book.While I do agree that the romance level in this book was pretty low, the suspense and flow of the story was excellent. There were times when I was downright spooked and wondering how they were going to get out alive.I didn't think that Isabel would ever let them escape...especially after successfully manipulating the intertwined lives and deaths of those in the families for so long. The insights into Isabel's life showed how a lonely girl searching for comfort and love from those around her was tricked and betrayed by life's cruel fates and brought to wrongful end.I have long been a reader of Brenda Joyce and while the juicy love story I was looking for wasn't here this time, she definatley kept me on my toes and anxiously waiting until I could pick it back up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best...","review":"I had spooky moments reading this book at night, turning around to see if anyone was behind me.... so overall I don't think it was a total waste of my time, however I wouldn't consider this a great book.Romance aspect wasn't really believeable to be honest between the hero/heroine. In addition, most of the characters in this book were very unlikeable. We have the two sisters both in love with the same man. The beautiful but shallow sister comes home with her boyfriend, the older bookish, slightly over weight sister covets him.I must admit, the heroine ruined the book for me. There are some things you just do not do in my opinion, like \\"NO sleeping with your sisters ex 24hrs after they break up!\\"... you don't even date them! especially if you're aware how much the sister loves him! Its just one of those unwritten rules.Spooky book, with \\"some \\" romance thrown in, mostly blah in every expect. Borrow this book if you're a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I really love Breda Joyce's previous works. She is an excellent author.

A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brenda needs to espy a new story line.","review":"Even while I am writing this I can't believe that I read this book. Brenda Joyce seems to think that her readers need to be beat over the head with every idea. How many times do we need to smell violets on a single page? We know there is a ghost - get on with the story instead of restating everything 100 times. And what is the deal with her use of the word espy? Cass espied everyone in the book. The story line set in the past with Isabelle was much more interesting than the main storyline. The main characters didn't have many redeeming qualities - Tracy should've been killed off towards the beginning. If you want a book that won't take you long to read, than this book is for you - you will be able to skip several paragraphs on each page because they were the same as the page before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true horror","review":"One of the worst books I've read although I read it all.

I agree with some of the other reviews that she needed a proofreader. The parts in Spanish where atrocious. Also, the plot, oh my god, the plot. The story was convoluted in an unnecessary way. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of gothic romances but this was too much. The characters where either oblivious or ridiculous, or both. If this is your first Brenda Joyce read, please choose another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Brenda Joyce?","review":"Dear Brenda, If you wrote this book at the suggestion of an editor you must immediately get rid of him or her. If it came from your own imagination, please take some time off--you really need it. It was so pitiful to see how far off you went in this endeaver that I felt that something must be wrong. I have read all of your other books and while some have been good but not spectacular, most have been very well written and interesting. In this ghost story everything rang false; uninteresting characters, stupid plot, no real \\"love\\" just crude and nasty grappling, and I could go on.

The writing was terrible, the story disjointed and the scenes that were supposed to be romantic were tacky. As you struggled toward the end of the book, the ending didn't even make sense.

I've got lettuce, broccoli, fennel, cilantro, carrots and beets to plant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly","review":"I thought that this book would be helpful, as I am new to gardening in the Southwest. However, the organizational style is not intuitive at all, and it's seldom worth the effort for me to try to locate the information I need. Rather than organizing tasks by month, they're organized by plant type and then month. So if I want to know what I need to do for my garden in June, I have to look in at least 5 different sections. While there's useful information, there are better books out there. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really month-by-month","review":"I'm returning this book because it is NOT organized month-by-month. Instead, each chapter is about a type of plant (perenials, annuals, etc). Within each chapter, you do see month-by-month. But I want to know what to plant in June -- with this book, I have to read the June pages in a dozen or more chapters and pull them together. The title is hugely misleading.

On Earth, our favorite characters have begun having children and by extending thier family tree the story keeps building, pushing imaginations even further. With two new species included with the space travelers and thier children, you can't help but to be deeply connected, as if you weren't already, to the circumstances that all of the characters face. As The Ships of Earth prepared readers for this ride, Earthfall will have you creating such deep ties to the characters that the last instalment of the Saga could bring tears to your eyes. It did for me...(read the review of Earthborn for that one). Card's Earthfall was written with such magnanimous proportion that I'm starting to choke up thinking about it.

Further, the novel is weakened by the extravagant significance given a single war-time atrocity. Benefit of the doubt - maybe the author didn't have time to polish the ms, apparently completed just before her 5/05 death. Start with Saturday Morning Murder and read the other four. Only read this if you already know the series & want to see what she does with her long-running characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"have you enjoyed Batya Gur's other books?","review":"If so, you will enjoy this. If you have never read one of her murder mystery/police procedurals, I recommend beginning with an earlier one. This book starts off slowly but picks up steam and by the end I couldn't put it down.

He also produces the Hannibal Stax(once known as FABIDDEN) song, \\"high energy\\"(One of the albums best). Guru is on a total of 3 songs ,but his main achievement on this one was flexxin' his production muscle. He manned the boards for a majority of the c.d..

The DVDs are truly amazing - you get approx 3.5 hours of expert instruction! The katas now finally make perfect to me. I have been studying Isshinryu Karate for over 25 years and hold a 7th degree black belt myself. These are the real deal, not Master Uezu and Sensei Jennings' \\"bock them to death\\" applications. Master Thomas performs all of the Katas twice then performs a very thorough and detailed break down with multiple explanations for each technique.

It has made me much more efficient and less tired during long stretches of work. The mouse is equally well-designed, with a responsive scroll wheel and perfectly curved shape to fit my hand without straining. The mouse is heavy, but so well balanced that I rarely have to pick it up. The furthest I move the keyboard from the transmitter is about 4 feet, so I can't speak to its long-distance capabilities, but in the 6 weeks that I've used this set I have never felt any wrist or hand strain, which makes it perfect as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well Close Together","review":"I had to buy a new cordless mouse & keyboard when I \\"thought\\" the other was no longer working.

The keyboard would not respond to my typing. But, luckily, I put 2 & 2 together and realized the problem was that the keyboard was no longer directly facing the connector, despite the fact that it was only a foot away, but, it was off to the side.

The back and forward buttons on the mouse were bothersome to me. I had frequent difficulty syncing the devices to the adapter. It would recognize the mouse but not the keyboard. So, I'd resync. Then, it would recognize the keyboard but not the mouse. Repeat 5-6 times.I ultimately trashed this model and got the Logitech Wave which has been a great match for me (and I haven't spent one minute playing the sync game with it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wireless keyboard and laser mouse.","review":"ive been wanting to buy a wireless set for awhile now but couldnt afford it . amazon has made it so easy for my family to get things at a cheaper price, and still get # 1 quality in stuff. im sold on amazon for all our future needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Winner","review":"After trying, but not succeeding to get the wireless keyboard hooked-up, Logitech said that the transmitter had failed. They did send me another LX310, but this one didn't work either. I would think twice before purchasing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice product, if it worked","review":"I recieved the wirless mouse/keyboard and initially was very pleased. A couple of hours later I came back and the screen was filled with the character \\"period\\". I called tech support and they said the keyboard was defective.Sent it back and the replacement did the same thing. Returned it for credit and bought a Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse.I think I got a bad batch, or it would be a real good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor range and signal strength","review":"Very poor range, you have to aim the receiver at a certain angle, and have to stay within 2-3ft, and if there's any wires or cables in between the keyboard/mouse and receiver, it'd mess up the signal completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouse Sucks!","review":"i gave it a 2 star beacuse the keybord is good. well the keybord goes through batteries like water and sometimes gets stuck. oh but the mouse ughh. it is the worst i have ever seen. it is soo slow. when i move the mouse it takes like 2 seconds to process and move. thats a long time when you are trying to do something fast or play a game. i would recomend you to spend your money on a better one believe me your not missing out on anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I quit using the mouse after two days (I can only reset something 20 times a day and then I must admit I get frustrated.) The keyboard lasted two months and then started giving me problems (I hate having to pound the letters) so I just switched back to my old wire keyboard. I have liked Logitech products in the past, but if I had it to do over - I would give these two a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited range","review":"When I bought this, it seemed to be a perfect solution with such good reviews.But boy what a disappointment -- the range for it to work in my living room is strictly limited to 6.5 feet, not one foot longer. This is always the case when I use the mouse on my glass coffee table(with mouse pad). The range becomes a bit longer if I move the mouse onto other surface or change to a different height, but that doesn't help me.My guess is, its 27 MHz radio signal is very susceptible to the interference emitted from my 50 inches projection TV and/or home theater system, lacking the ability of adjusting signal strength makes this problem a show stopper.It seems I need a 2.4GHz product (Logitech MX1100, Wave Pro, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feet break, 2nd keyboard","review":"I bought my first 310 keyboard about 18 months ago, and it worked great until one of the two feet on the bottom that snap up to raise the rear of the keyboard broke off. So I ordered one of the same keyboard. One of the little feet broke off 32 days after I got it, so just beyond the return deadline. Those little feet are the Achille's heel of this otherwise pretty nice keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Easy use.","review":"I boughtLogitech Cordless Desktop LX310 Laserbecause it was much cheaper than the Dell equivalent or Microsoft. I got it refurbished for about twenty dollars.It's easy to install and to use. You do not have to do a full install, but the full install doesn't take up a large amount of space.The mouse and the keyboard do not have to be easily aimed at the signal receptor. Also the receptor doesn't have to be visible for the signal to reach.It works great. I highly highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic keyboard and mouse","review":"I was looking for an affordable but reliable keyboard. Logitech was an obvious choice for me since I've always been satisfied with their products. The keyboard is very basic but has dedicated multimedia and web keys which are really handy. The keys are not low profile but are quiet and feel nice. The mouse is pretty small but works fine and has back/forward buttons as well as a tiltable/clickable scroll wheel. Overall this is a quality product that I would recommend for any home user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Recommend","review":"The only good thing I can say about this is that it's wireless, it works, and I like the extra buttons on the mouse. That's why it doesn't get 1 star.On to the bad things. As another reviewer said, it doesn't work beyond 6 feet. I originally bought it to use in the living room for watching movies on the PC, but it's worthless for that purpose unless I sit close to the computer. Also, it has to be in line of sight of the receiver since it's not RF.After less than 6 months of use, the mouse is starting to flake out. The right button doesn't work consistently.Finally, just as a matter of preference, I HATE the way the Home, End, Del... button group is laid out!! I use these buttons all the time and they're not consistent with traditional keyboards, so I'm constantly hitting the wrong keys.Other than it working (for 6 months), I can't really say anything good about this mouse or keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"I've been using this keyboard/mouse set for about a month now. I've already had to replace the batteries on the mouse, and the keyboard batteries are starting to go.. :( The box advertises that they each last up to six months. I suppose that's with non-use. :PAll in all it's a fairly small expense for how awesome the keyboard is. Sure, the mouse is great, but the keyboard has multiple programmable buttons that don't take up too much space (there is a function key, making it so your keyboard isn't bulky) and adds to it's functionality!9/10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Cordless Desktop LX310 Laser","review":"I bought this mouse/keyboard combo. The keyboard has met and exceeded my neads. However, the mouse is what steals the show. You ever put on those perfect pair of socks or jeans, when you put them on you smile? Well that is what it feels like with this mouse in your hands. Its weighted perfectly, its just the right size, and i've used it every single day since the end of November so over 2 months now and never had to do anything with the battery. Everyone that uses it family/my wife etc say wow this is a really nice mouse, it feels \\"just right\\" in my hand. I tend to agree and highly recommend it to all of you. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited angle adjustment","review":"The angle adjustment that the handheld shower head sits in adjusts only slightly, which would work fine in a larger shower. In my case, however, the water shoots straight across the shower, hitting the door. I was stupid to overlook this and not buy a model that has a rotary adjustment and tightens down on the slider bar -- so it's really not Delta's fault.Also -- and this is Delta's fault -- the description says it's a metal hose. Perhaps it is, but it's under a thick clear plastic coating, so it feels like a plastic hose, and it's stiff like one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Modern Blues","review":"Jimmy Dawkins - Tribute To OrangeNo reviews on this yet so I will put this out there. This collection was recorded in the early 70's and pairs Jimmy with Gatemouth Brown on 9 cuts and Otis Rush on 4. As you can imagine when you have all of these guitar slingers on hand there will be some string bending going on and this was certainly the case here. Lots of stinging guitar on virtually every track. Dawkins handled the vocals and did a fine job. The songs are well crafted and mostly written by Dawkins. Sound quality is fine although the production seems to drop the band low in the mix a few times behind the guitars for short intervals. The liner notes do not detail who plays what solos so you will need to listen close to figure that out but it's all good stuff.Summary: quality modern electric blues with an emphasis on the guitar. Not a bum track in the bunch. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for open minded listeners","review":"This is a pretty good CD - you get a real distinct sound from the band - a little blues mixed with a twinge of psychedeilia and campfire harmonica. This was done the year the Dead took some time off - and Bobby put some good stuff on here. Home to Dixie is a neat song much like his later 70's stuff - wish they would break that one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware---not very good.","review":"I was familiar with Lazy Lightning and Supplication (from the Grateful Dead), so i expected this disc to be a lot better than it actually is.Three of the songs are worth listening to---Lazy Lightning, Supplication, and Hypnotize. The rest of the songs are throwaways at best. The vocals (not sung by Bob Weir) are bland, and the playing is uninspired.I got this as a Deadhead as well as a huge fan of 70s rock, and I've been let down on all counts. Fans of Bob Weir (who else would be looking for this disc?) would be better off with \\"Bobby and the Midnights\\" and \\"Heaven Help the Fool\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"This camera is ok. I wouldn't recommend it, though. It's pretty dark unless there is good lighting even though it comes with a \\"light.\\" It has a single LED that is not enough to illuminate the subject, but enough to be annoying in your eyes. Also, unless you have the laptop on a desk, the thing wobbles around too much.I would recommend one of those that clips on the top of the monitor panel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRICKY INFORMATION","review":"Despite this is a good looking web-cam and captures nice images. That's all it is.On the package Phillips claims that it is a 3 function webcam: -Captures video clips with audio -Captures digitall still images -Video chatting and VoiP. Lies: only 1 out of three, because the webcam has no microphone!!.After testing, and failing, I went to Phillips web page. One of the FAQ's was: I'm having audio problems with MSN/yahoo and my web cam. Answer: Check if your webcam is recognized by windows.2 hours later, trying to solve the problem by uninstalling, re-installing, testing, etc, I decided to dial Phillips' \\"customer care number\\". The answer: No the camera has no mic. I then asked then how can you offer video clips with audio, and VoiP, if it doesnt have mic. Ah its because the device can work with a software and a mic to get that. Nonsenses. Obviously I'm decided to return it. And tell people not to buy phillips webcams."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book... a bit redundant but provides good overall advice","review":"This was the first contracting book that I read. Since then I have purchased and read a few more that were recommended in this book. The book drives home the fact that planning is critical and give great tips to help you organize your plan. After reading this book, if you still think you want to be your own GC. I would suggest reading \\"The complete Guide to Contracting your Home\\". It gets more into the technical aspect of each phase of construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for!","review":"When it came down to owner-building my house, I purchased a whole slew of books hoping that all of them together would help. I found the Owner-builder Book to be the only book that did. I carried it with me everywhere and it came through for me time and time again. I learned many valuable lessons that I've carried on into my everyday life as well- one of which is \\"Plan, Plan, Plan\\". I've found that what he says is true, that for \\"every hour you spend planning, saves 4 hours in execution\\". This book is everything I was looking for and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful book!","review":"I was fortunate to come across this book as I was making my decision to owner build my custom home. This book was an excellent resource and it allowed me to go in to my construction effort well informed and ready to tackle the project. From tax insights, to planning and organizing techniques this book covers everything that I needed to know. It's step by step plan of attack, and it's insightful and fun to read reminders truly helped me get into the drivers seat. In the end, I was able to save a substantial amount of money in the construction of my home, as well as avoiding several headaches, and mistakes along the way. The owner builder book chronicled owner builders like myself who had a story to tell, and insider tips. I also learned strategies that enabled me to take advantage of tax benefits. In owner building, knowledge isn't only power, it's tremendous savings."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book on business side , not technical though","review":"I got this book with the author's autograph on it. I enjoyed reading it. It primarily teaches you how to manage the project, although it does not really go into the technical side of building a house. But, what is the most important thing of the building project ? it is the management right I guess. Overall this book is useful if you have not done it before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start saving money right here","review":"Filled with personal anecdotes, blank pages for note-taking and the all-important several pages of readers' testimonials."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Owner-Builder Book: How You Can Save More Than $100,000 in the Construction of Your Custom Home, 4th Ed.","review":"This book is an amazing resource. Of all the books I've purchased, this is the one that will help me the most!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and superficial","review":"The emphasis is on doing the construction management aspects - planning and hiring subcontractors, not the architectural design or actual construction techniques. There are a few good hints regarding being organized, making lists, and planning to spend enough time on the project. However, 90% of the book is wordy repetition of how much money you can save. Sample checklists are superficial and incomplete. Everything useful in the book could have been condensed to a brief magazine article. If you want to save money building a house start by skipping this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"motivational garbage","review":"This book is garbage. Nothing more than motivational fluff and a complete misrepresentation of the homebuilding business and process. The Author convinces readers that they can't control or trust an individual contractor to build a house for them but can easily control dozens of individual subs and suppliers without being cheated. Yeah right. The book is chock full of statistics and statements that have no support or reference. It is not surprising that the book is self-published because no reputable publisher would publish a book with so many unsupported facts and figures. If you need motivation and someone to tell you you can do it and you are the king of the world and contractors are the skum of the earth, buy the book. If you want real guidance and grounded advice on how to build your own home, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLUFF!","review":"This is by far the worst book I have read on this subject. Lots of pep-talk (You too can save $100,000!!!) --and little substance. It advices readers to \\"beat the systen\\" by for example paying sub-contractors cash (i.e. let them cheat on taxes) and to obtain estimates from contractors whoose services they have no intentions of using (basically abusing their \\"free\\" labor.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop repeating yourself","review":"Okay, maybe I am the odd ball, but this author drove me crazy! He should have made a pamplet instead of a book. I felt as though it was written by a Amway sales person. To me, the book read like they were trying to motivate you to go ahead and build your house. I needed factual information, and I got 90% \\"You can do it\\" and 10% \\"This is the stuff you need\\". If you are two years away from building, you might like it, but I was two weeks away and already had most of the information provided. I am sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes one good point","review":"If nothing else, this book will convince you paying for a general contractor is money down the drain--assuming you're willing to do his job instead. The author, a marketing consultant, relates his experiences as owner-builder. There are undoubtedly nuggets of wisdom amid the endless anecdotes, but nothing not found elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Worthless Smithco Marketing Piece","review":"This book was extremely disappointing...it is nothing more than a \\"puff-piece\\" brochure for the many products that the authors sell.

While I agree with some of the negative reviews that there are too many testimonials and some strange justifications discussed on why to build your own home, I think overall it's helpful.Here are the things you can get from this book: a plan showing you how to get started, understanding the different steps and trades to build, understanding the planning time required, an idea of the commitment that is required, a structure to set-up your budget, tips to secure your bank loan and ideas for some custom home features to consider.You will not get much information on the following: details on building techniques, detailed cost saving tips or useful price information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do your own contracting","review":"This book gives an excellent overview and detail of the issues that owner-builders are presented with.

This book left me in the dark at times. The book contains a number of words spelled incorrectly, which you would think, for the price, would have been edited more thoroughly. At times you have to read and re-read passages to try to figure out what is going on. The tutorials given are not thorough enough. It would be nice to know what one is doing and get into more detail. Most of the book is not really a tutorial, it is more informational."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Authorware Tutorial : A Complete Waste","review":"As an experienced Authorware user, I am continually seeking advanced material for the my trade as an educational resource developer.

The book is definitely not for beginners. It assumes you already are a skilled Authorware user, and discusses mostly advanced topics. Since I have no Authorware skills, I cannot comment on how well it handles these advanced topics, but I have read other reviews by advanced readers and they were none too impressed also. It is hard to say what exactly is the target audience for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed by Committee","review":"This book is clearly an example of what happens when there are too many cooks in the kitchen.
