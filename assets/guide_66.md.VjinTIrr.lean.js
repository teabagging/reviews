Noonan has written one great book about the presidency, life in the White House, speech writing, and the political process and how it interacts with the media. The portions of the book on how she wrote speeches for Reagan and Bush and how they got edited in the staffing process are particularly well-written, insightful, and at times downright funny. Noonan remains loyal to Reagan but she is not so blindered that she fails to note some of the short comings of his hands-off style. Her policy views are sometimes simplistic (you're left wondering if she thinks the world can be governed from what you learn in a Capra movie) but this is after all a memoir and she does a very good job of taking you on her trip.

For those of us who lived through them, it is a banal rehash on the level of the prose one finds in _Newsweek_ or _Time_. The insights are few, too. This reader's view is that the area in which Miss Noonan was involved, the drafting of speeches for the president, is at once trivial and overrated in importance, so I lament that this book will be many people's introduction to Reaganite (as distinguished from Reagoon or Reaganinnie) political thinking and activity; still, it's better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written and engaging, but other than that...","review":"...other than that, this book is absolute drivel. From the moment we are assured that our part in the Vietnam War was 'basically good' right through to the end, Noonan seems to prefer disregarding history or any serious examination of the left.

Obviously, though, I hardly remember it. Bush is the first president I can begin to remember, and only during Clinton's second term did I fully open my eyes to the political world. What Peggy Noonan offers here is a look into the past that even few then-spectators would recognize. The inner-working of the Reagan administration are here partially revealed, and what is revealed is highly interesting. Furthermore, Ms. Noonan has shed light on some of the ways *every* White House *must* work. And yet Ms. Noonan doesn't stop with a mere description: she provides an eye-opening and well-written description of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue during the 80's. This book also opens the shades on the beginnings of the now-burgeoning neo/social conservative movement in the United States.Rarely can you find so much in so few pages.

As an introduction, it is not much chop as it neglects his songwriting and original approach to non-country material. This side of Gram is exemplified on other releases (particularly the FBB Gilded Palace of Sin) that were the foundations of country-rock and alt.country as we now know them. Nonetheless, it's a great album for Gram-completists and a good country-rock (with the emphasis on country) effort. The solo (with Emmylou Harris) songs are probably the highlights although I like the Burritos take on Green Green Grass of Home. The version of Honky Tonk Women is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! A very rewarding purchase!","review":"I can not express how happy I am with the purchase of this CD player.

I used to eagerly await the release of albums from a number of artists, but I am now eagerly awaiting the releases of one artist. Oh, I'm still buying far too many CD's for my own good, but I'm no longer marking calenders and counting the days for anyone else. Patton never disappoints me in quality or quantity. If you are not already listening to this guy, you have no idea what you're missing. The guy has changed my whole music world. In my personal opinion, you can start here with Patton.

It put my experiences into a broader perspective so that I understood that even experiences I had previously thought private were commonplace in the psychiatric system. The writing ranges from poetry to prose, from first-person accounts of the psychiatric system to analyses of how the system itself operates in a broader sense, and everything in between. There is an interesting account of how the ideas, language, and power structures of psychotherapy invaded and weakened the women's liberation movement, alongside poetry that starkly illuminates the experiences of people who still remain, forgotten, possibly by now dead, in the system.

There's an on/off switch on the front left edge, to preserve battery life. There's also a small mouse control at the top right that takes some getting used to, but can be useful with some practice. In addition to the standard keyboard keys, there are also media control buttons just like on the media center remote.

The new MCE keyboard/pointer would be perfect! Boy, was I WRONG. The pointer on this thing is horrid. I have never seen any pointing device worse than this thing. Not only is it hard to control but mine will only engage for about 1 second before stopping. I have to release pressure and try again to make it move some more.

I love his wall-of-sound melodious romps. And there is a good deal of that on this disc. There is also a bit of the discordant edge that I find difficult - there is almost always one or more such cuts on all of his recordings - and I have mixed feelings about the two vocals with Cassandra Wilson. But here is yet another David Murray disc with much more power, verve, and joyous noise than 90% of the new jazz out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"school, attendance, education, united kingdom, scotland","review":"Very good reference on improving school attendance. Case studies and sample attendance policy included. Motivating students to go to school regularly and punctually is not enough; children's education is a collaboration of school, parents/carers, local community and government. The book emphasised on student monitoring through letters,phone calls or home visits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical and not very helpful at all","review":"Instead of offering numerous practice tests and the usual Kaplan-style no-nonsense approach, this book wastes time and energy by framing the test prep in terms of a science-fiction story, with little vignettes strewn around each topic.

I downloaded the 3 minute 14 second version of this song this evening and am terribly disappointed by this rendition. It's not even close to the tune that I've heard on the radio over the years.

This Panasonic CD player is superb in every way. The sound quality is excellent,and with three sound equalizers,you can customize the right tones for each specific disc you play. The anti-skip technology is solid, in fact you'd probably have to jump up and down on it to make it skip! Even the headphones are up to the quality of the player. The styling is sleek and thin, and the controls are nicely placed, making it easy to operate.The remote control is a great bonus to this set, allowing you to operate the main controls while jogging or walking without having to fumble for the player itself. This is one grand CD player. Every need of a personal CD player has been addressed. Panasonic really knows how to make great audio products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for joggers","review":"The player is very thin and plays great sound, but is not a jogging unit. The CD skips constantly and I have to hold it in my hand while jogging to prevent it. The jogging pack is also a waste as the belt is elastic so you can't get a tight fit around your waist. In addition, the headphones are the cheapest you can find and must be replaced as soon as you buy the package. All in all, this unit may work for someone who wants to sit on a plane and listen to music, but not for active people who move around a lot. VERY CHEAP IN EVERY WAY!!!!

Not only is it totally realistic, but the romance isn't that intense and out of line. Unlike other American Dreams books, it wasn't so overly kissy-dovey and while most of them feature a totally strong and good in every way kind of heroine, Carrie wasn't like that. I mean, she isn't like your perfect girl because she was very ill-tempered and jealous in the beginning, and how the author described Carrie made her very realistic. And the love story- it had real life difficulties and wasn't straight through, \\"I love you, let's get married.\\" Overall, I loved this book and it had a very satisfying ending. I totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book because it was so real.","review":"This book was so real in that the things that happened coiuld really happen and probably did really happen.

The second half is a list of recipes from various Roman authors. The book has a lot of promise and gives a good overview of what the Romans ate and the role of food in Roman culture. The recipes are given in three forms. First, the original Latin version is give, then a translation is provided. Finally, a more detailed recipe is given that the reader can use to try the recipe at home. The book is interesting, but should be treated as an introduction to Roman diet, cooking, and eating habits. The book was originally written in Dutch and the translation could have been better. However, there are not serious problems with the translation. Overall I liked this book and I am looking forward to trying some of the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Written","review":"This book is filled with misspellings, poorly phrased sentences, and illustrations not explained well in the text.

I compared it to my old minidisc player and the MD player blew it away. My wife also agrees with me. I just found out that Amazon.com also sells MD portable players. Boy did I feel like an idiot. As a result, I am returning this poor quality player, and upgrading to a 40 s protection MD player.

I recieved them very fast from the supplier. When I wore them for the first time they were a little uncomfortable which is to be expected from a new boot. I read some reviews on different ways to break in new boots. I went with the hot water method and let me tell you, it absolutley works! Just soak your boots in hot hot water for about 15-20 min. and wear them until dry. They slowly mold to your foot and become very comfortable. I went ahead and did this a second and third time and now it feels like I have had these boots for years. I bought them to wear while paintballing so I needed to break them in well before going out on the field. Waiting til that day to break them in would ruin your day. These boots are rad, just make sure you order a size smaller than what you normally wear because they do run big. For example, I wear a mens 10 and went with a Mens 9 and they fit beautifuly. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"I was excited for these boots. They fit relatively well (which is hard for me to find) and they were reasonably priced. However, after about 3 weeks of use, there is already a large crack in the soles of each boot. They split across the ball of the foot, which is rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy, but Not Sturdy","review":"I bought these for my husband who needed sturdy and rugged everyday footwear for chasing our kids and playing outside. He wanted combat boots because I'd told him stories of the pair I bought my Sophmore year in high school and wore until they broke apart nearly ten years later. He hates to shop, so not having to buy new boots was a huge selling point for him, as was the cordura uppers, for hot weather. Anyway, he wore these daily for 6 months, at which point the leather across the toes had broken open where his foot bends as he walks, and the side of the boot over the toes had ripped out of the sole completely. It was very, very disappointing and was not the kind of longevity we'd hoped for when we bought these. Our next pair will come from the local surplus store and be all leather."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STAR Combat Boots, most definately worth it.","review":"I normally wear the Tan ACU boots for my ARMY JROTC Battalion for Mondays and PT, and let me say, very good for running, hiking, anything physical, and they are SUPER COMFORTABLE.

I read the reviews telling how good of a boot they were and I made the mistake of assuming they were USA made. They are not. These are Chinese Made Jungle boots and I can attest from experience they are of poor quality and the sole will detach from the boot in a short period of time.

Initially we ordered the wrong size. We knew they would be sized small but not HOW small. There are no half sizes, so we got a 9W when he usually wears a 10.5-eventually. We had to send back the 10's first that we originally ordered...oh, we spent about an extra $20 in shipping.Once he got them in the right size they were wonderful. Very comfortable, even after more than 8 hours standing. Now, though, after only about 3 months, they are wearing rapidly. The sole has really thinned out. The leather upper is cracking where it creases when you walk. I suppose since they were cheap, it was not so unexpected-they must have used inferior materials to construct them. What a boot, though! Extreme comfort. If you don't wear them all day every day, maybe they would last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good boot so far","review":"these boots arived before the delivery time. some people have posted that they get cracks on the end of the boots but so far i dont see any cracks, the 4 star rating is because the lases need to be a little longer but i figure i can get bigger lases at walmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Boots!","review":"The mere fact that I'm already considering getting a second pair should say it all.

If ever one single song was worth the price of an entire disc it has to be \\"Free for All.\\" There is no other song quite like it.It'd be one thing if Blakey were blowing away your everyday jazz masters, but he's taking on the likes of Wayne Shorter and Freddie Hubbard here...no scrubs.Don't let my focus on the opening track deceive you.

I think she is an excellent storyteller and I had never come across one of her books that I didn't like. However, from the beginning of Killing Time, I wondered whether Howard actually wrote this book. It lacks pretty much all of the hallmarks I have come to expect of Howard's writing, including character development, development of chemistry between the leads, a plot that captured the imagination; I could go on. I forced myself to finish it thinking that it would get better by the end. It didn't, and I was left with the impression that someone edited the goodness out of a Howard creation, or switched the manuscript for another author's.

I guess I was hoping that at some point the book would have sparked some interest. Even the end was disappointing. Linda Howard needs to go back to the drawing board. I wonder if the story line was her idea or it was given to her by someone from the future.Usually Linda Howard's books are so interesting that it takes me a day or two to finish reading.

Get a new editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to be a fan","review":"This is exactly the kind of novel I normally enjoy: a bit of science fiction, romance and a novelist I've enjoyed in the past. I was disappointed. The character development was shallow. The main characters were likeable but at the end of the book I felt that I had absolutely no emotional connection with the characters or what happened in the book. I felt the plot had a lot of inconsistencies in it (which can be a problem when dealing with time travel). The story read as a preface to a later novel because a portion of the plot was left unresolved. I hope there is no \\"follow-up\\" novel because I think this was the weakest LInda Howard novel I've read. Save your money and don't buy this one. If you like romance and mystery with a bit of science fiction check out J.D. Robb's series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"I'm a huge fan and I have read every book Linda Howard has written. Mr. Perfect was her absolute best in my opinion and, even though I'm not a fan of first person novels, I read To Die For and loved it! When I heard that she was putting out another \\"paranormal\\" novel I couldn't wait! I thought it would be like Dream Man or Now You See Her. I really could have waited an eternity for this one. It was the worst book she's ever put out and I was extremely dissapointed. I couldn't get past the first chapter, but I forced myself, thinking it had to get better....sorry.....it didn't. The story line was totally unbelivable and I hope Ms. Howard continues to write the great suspence romance she's well known for and not sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok as a mystery story.","review":"The characters did not interest me as much as I would have liked. There was not much in the way of romantic or emotional development. I much prefer Ms. Howard's other books. Story brief: Bad guys from around 2200 time travel back to 2005 to get something of value. Nikita is an FBI agent from 2200 who travels to 2005 to stop them, but doesn't know what they are looking for. She and the police chief Knox work together and fall for each other. Some people are murdered. The author toys with Nikita's lack of understanding of slang. For example, instead of calling someone a \\"big baby\\" she calls him a \\"large baby.\\" Knox says she might \\"split\\". She doesn't know that means \\"leave.\\" It wasn't that interesting for me. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: 1985 and 2005 small town in Kentucky. Copyright: 2005. Genre: time travel mystery story with a little suspense and a little romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting Time","review":"The characters have an annoying OCD - they shower and wash clothes and shower again. I suspect Linda has some germ phobia that's getting worse all the time. I swear to christ I counted SEVEN showers and at least TWO episodes of washing clothes. WTH? Beyond this, her male character reads like a sketch of a man from a drunk woman's point of view. Cliche and boring. Beyond THAT she just misses the story potential. It's about TIME TRAVEL, but the concept is never exploited smartly. Linda should have spent MORE TIME thinking about the implications of time travel and LESS TIME thinking about her main character's next fat erection. Yeah, I finished this book only because I have my own OCD that makes me read until the bitter end. I won't ever read anything else she's written - my time on this Earth is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"killing time","review":"i never thought i would ever say this, but this book sucks. Don't waste ur money and time as i did mine. if this is ur first time reading one of her books get mr. perfect or something else but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linda Howard's 2nd Time-Travel story","review":"In Killing Time, Linda Howard orchestrated elements that she knows how to create and manipulate so well --a small southern town with its customary residents, a mystery, police procedures, family dynamics, personal and universal conflicts, a strong, compassionate hero, a feisty, vulnerable heroine-- to produce a result that satisfies fans and that should attract new aficionados to her work. The glimpses of the future add intriguing touches that accentuate, but do not detract from the story in the present. I especially liked the idea that information and art stored on compact discs will deteriorate and that paper will be one of that future's most valuable commodities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Definitely not one of her better books. No humor. Very little plot. Dull characters. Seems like she just had to rush it out, which is unfortunate since I'm a big fan.Oh well, hopefully, the next one will be better. The last handful have been touch and go, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't seem like this was written by Linda Howard","review":"I have ALL of Linda Howard's books. She has been one of my two favorite authors, so I grabbed this when I saw it. The more I read, the more I began to question whether Linda Howard actually wrote this book. It lacks the depth of her other time travel novel, \\"Son of the Morning.\\" In fact, it seems to lack the depth of character, depth of plot, depth of detail, and depth of research of ALL of her other works. It's pale compared to her really great contemporary work, \\"Mr. Perfect.\\" I have heard that when authors get really, really famous and in demand, they sometimes subcontract part or all of a novel to other writers. That was the feeling I got from \\"Killing Time.\\" It was an \\"okay read\\" but did not seem authentic to Linda Howard's other work and was disappointing from that perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best but still entertaining","review":"OK people, I wont go through the whole review thing with youyou already have an idea what is going on with this book. I didnt think this was Linda's best book, it couldnt hold my attention. But I love Linda, and will allow this error, the lady hasnt ever let me down before.But I dont understand why some readers believe Knox is an obnoxious alpha male, I thought he was rather tame. Honey if you think he is jerkish then you need to read the male characters in Shannon McKennas books, all those male characters have issues. Knox is a kitten compared to them.This book was luke warm but Ill still continue reading Linda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I have read just about every one of Linda Howard's books (\\"Son of the Morning\\"--wow!!!!!!!!!!). This book was a big disappointment. There was so much potential for interesting description (a flight of fancy) by bringing in the future aspect--but in this book, the future is not so different from now (and that's depressing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simultaneously Original and Boring","review":"Linda Howard continues her downward streak of boring yet original books (Cry No More, etc). Original in the sense that she really, really tries hard to come up with a concept that's rarely done. Unfortunately, this results in an incredibly mundane, un-gripping and uneventful book. Also, she's already gone and done the time travel gimmick with \\"Son of the Morning\\" which at least had some decent and memorable moments. Linda, Linda, Linda what gives? I'm still reading \\"The Perfect Man\\" and anything pre-Cry No More. Whatever happened? Any chance of doing an Ann Rice and my getting my money back? Would be deeply appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"When she is good, she is very very good, but","review":"When she is bad she is horrid. I am resigned to Linda Howard's fitting this phrase. This is one of the \\"horrid\\" ones. I share books among a group and this will not be passed outside of our group. Our but is that we'll never give up on her cause we know, when she is good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I have every book that Linda Howard has written. However, this book was just plain awful. I kept checking the cover to make sure that the book was written by Linda. The story was dull, there was no chemistry between the main characters. If you are a first time reader of Linda's please check out Mr. Perfect, To Die For, Son of the Morning, Dream Man, and Now You See Her. These are some of her best books. The lead character from Mr. Perfect has several brothers and I wish she'd write about them. I would recommend that you get this book from the library instead of purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this a ZERO if I could","review":"I am much more of a hard core mystery reader than a romantic suspense fan but I have read other Linda Howard books and found them to be an enjoyable way to spend a Sunday afternoon. This one was poorly written in that it seems as though everyone converses only in BOLD TYPE or exclamation points. The hero is too easily convinced by future girl to believe her outlandish story and the secondary plot line between the hero's should have been mother in law and the bad guy from the future was downright laughable. I guess the next book will be all about future girl's parents selling the reams of paper she hid for them to find (in the to be demolished years in the future) building and using the money to find their now older than they are grandkids from the past?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks, Linda!","review":"I normally love Linda Howard, but this book and her last one have been disappointing. This is probably my least favorite Linda Howard book. I am not a sci-fi fan, and would not have purchased this book if I had realized it was that genre. The characters were uninteresting and had no spark, and there were too many unresolved questions at the end of the book. Try again, Linda; I know you still have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Ugly...","review":"As a huge Linda Howard fan, I bought Killing Time the day it came out in stores. I should have waited until I read some of these reviews. Then I could have avoided the experience of reading this book. I've never had trouble finishing a Howard novel, until I picked up Killing Time. Knox Davis is just an okay guy. The time-traveling Nikita is cold, and as synthetic as her clothing. Forget the murder and mayhem; how their romantic relationship could have developed is the true mystery in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HUGE DEPARTURE","review":"I GENERALLY ENJOY LINDA HOWARD'S WRITING. THIS NOVEL WAS NO EXCEPTION. SHE DOES SHOW A DISTINCT DEPARTURE FROM HER NORMAL STYLE. THE PLOT IS INTRIGUING. THE STORY IS FAST PACED AND INTERESTING. HOPEFULLY,THIS WILL BE PART OF A SERIES. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE WHAT HER VISION OF THE FUTURE IS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Is Missing","review":"Linda Howard has deviated from her normal Romantic Suspense to try a Sci-Fi/Time Travel/Romantic Suspense. Knox Davis is a police investigator for the Pekesville, KY. in 2005. A time capsule is mysteriously unearthed at the court house and no clues are left. At the same time Nikita Stover comes to town, she is an FBI agent from 2207. The two join forces to stop rogue agents from stealing the information left in the capsule.Too much is occurring in this story. Trying to cover the social and technological changes in 200 years, plus the mystery and romance, means that plot and characters are not fully developed. I have enjoyed Howard's Open Season, Mr. Perfect, & Dream Man but this one left me cold. If you want to read a great time travel romance by Ms. Howard try Son of Morning. You will become involved with the characters and the plot is exacting."},{"rating":"1","title":"please stop!","review":"please, ms. howard! STOP! please go back to writing paperback books, because the hard back books truely suck! this writer use to be wonderful and now she needs to really think about going back to her daytime job or retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a streeeeetch!","review":"Quite a chore to combine elements of mystery, time travel, and romance. As someone else wrote \\"the romance seems to come out of nowhere,\\" but I will say the sex scenes are fairly hot. The book works, sort of, as escape from reality literature. The ending is of the \\"feel good\\" variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"I have always been a Linda Howard fan, but this book was just terrible. Linda, I don't know what went through your head!! It took me a week to read this book, just because I couldn't force myself to pick it up. You could have had a better plot, the male charachter of Knox Davis was a good character, but Nikiti could have used some work. I will always read Linda's books, but I will never ever buy this one or re-read it, like I do all of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow....","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I was so excited and just waiting for the release date and as much as I love Linda Howard it was such a waste of time and money. So, dont waste your money...just go to the library and check it out. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the REAL Linda Howard please write a book!","review":"Linda Howard is on a downward slide. Her last couple of books have been awful! I think she might have time traveled and had her writing skills zapped with that laser pen. Don't even bother checking this out of the library. No chemistry and plot so stupid I didn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Linda Howard, but this was boring!","review":"I basically could not get through this book, even listening to it on tape. Howard is one of my favorite authors, but this book just didn't do it for me. I personally would suggest by-passing it and waiting for her next one to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite science fiction","review":"I'm a science fiction fan, and most of the time I hate it when mainstream writers write on science fiction subjects. Certainly a book about time travel is a science fiction subject. This time, however, the mainstream writer did a very good job with the subject. I think she has done her homework.This is basically a love story with a mystery attached. It was a very enjoyable read and I think would appeal to people who enjoy an unusual premise, but also appeal to people who normally wouldn't read a book about time travel. You find yourself caring about both the main characters and the situations they are in, and you are rooting for them to find a way out of their predicament."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't REALLY Linda Howard, was it?","review":"What has happened to the Linda Howard I love to read? I saved this book for two weekends so I would have the perfect quiet time to read it and I could hardly make it through. That has never happened to me with her books before. I find time-travel stories tiresome anyway because so much of the dialogue is wasted on defining vocabulary to the person \\"out of time.\\" The idea was kind of cool but I couldn't feel strongly about either of the main characters and was just ready for the book to end. Sorry. Am hoping for more sizzle in the next book from Ms. Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love many Linda Howard novels. But this one was not very exciting and was slow to move along. I will say that the plot was interesting = about the future and Linda was very detail oriented. But this book lacked substance to reach out and touch you, or affect you in ways some of her other novels do. This book is the easiest book to put down that I've read in a very long time. I wish I hadn't purchased the hardcover because all it's worth is firewood to roast some marshmellos."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors and I couldn't wait to get her newest. Talk about a let down! The story line was boring and the suspense--what suspense? I really wouldn't call this paranormal--more like science fiction and if I would have known it was more science fiction, I would have passed. Bring back the Linda Howard we love from stories like Mr. Perfect and Dying to Please--I miss her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adios, Linda!!","review":"I liked the suspense she has been writing lately but her last three novels suck. So, like Nora Roberts, Janet Dailey, Julie Garwood, Tami Hoag it's adios to you. I love Science Fiction and Time Travel but I can get that online from authors who do it much better than Linda. Linda, your earlier stuff I treasure and always will but I will not fork out $17.00 for this again. I can get GREAT Science Fiction online that I can download to my ebook reader for $6.00 or less. God, I wish I would have read the jacket or reviews before I paid for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Linda Howard at her best","review":"Though I usually enjoy Linda Howard's books, KILLING TIME pales in comparison to the rest. The plot is silly, the characters flat, the writing poor. There's nothing here to hold a reader's interest - no three dimensional characters to care about, no juicy, page turning plot. I cringed at times, embarrassed on her behalf for the trite, sloppy writing.Come on Linda, be honest. Someone else wrote this. Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I love Linda Howard when she's good and I usually like time travel romance. This book left me cold. The hero, a police detective, was dull, --meticulous and somewhat clinical. The heroine was an FBI agent from the future who repressed her feelings. The fireworks didn't fly between them. At one point, she punches him and really whacks his chin, which didn't seem any more attractive than when a man punches a woman. The hero is amused by her misunderstandings of today's idioms, but these weren't very clever for the most part. I liked some of the technology, but it wasn't that amazing. The heroine's fascination with cotton clothing was kind of a yawner. I look forward to a better book from this author next time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original Nikon one","review":"It doesn't last as long. Maybe half as long if that. But after over 3 years, it still works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant period piece capturing 1969-1970","review":"This book is a brilliant burst of poetic prose, with some sentences having such remarkable images that I had to copy them down to keep for life. It retells the period from 1969-1971 in Kate Millett's life, when she was roughly treated as the cover subject of Time on Aug. 31, 1970. It details the early feminist movement and its opposition by the reactionary male right.It also speaks graphically of her sexual encounters with both men and women, but always poetically and tastefully. I think it's one of the best books of the last half of the twentieth century. I would recommend it to anyone, but I'll never lend out my copy: That stays in my house forever for frequent future reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate Millet Flying","review":"Kate, you need an editor for your book. I do not enjoy \\"stream of consciousness\\" style of writing but more than this, the book is disorganized and lacks simple punctuation, needs lots of organization. I get the idea about your pace of life and the workings of your mind in daily life. The book gives the reader a real feel in this regard.Your political leanings are clearly stated as is your emotional and sexual life albeit scattered throughout the book. Kudoos for holding nothing back. You are an honest author.Flying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is a good book.

It contains far too many fundamental errors. It obviously has not been proof read dispite the fact that this is a 2nd edition. Why read something that you can't trust. Two far SUPERIOR books are \\"Edly's Music Theory for Practical People\\" by Ed Roseman and/or \\"Hearing and Writing Music: Professional Training for Today's Musician\\" by Ron Gorow.

For a person with no prior knowledge of notes, intervals, etc., Chapter 2 on Intervals is more confusing than clarifying.

It is an excellent reference guide, or would be great for someone having little understanding of theory to learn very easily the basis of music theory. The exercises at the end of each chapter help to touch on the high points, and the appendix has a great chord reference. The visual aids (tips, notes, definitions,...) are also great for filling in some of the knowledge gaps. The CD is also great to use while going through the chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Theory","review":"This is a good book for studying at school. It is helpful and insightful.

(Not that is either meant to be, or is advertised as such.) Instead, it is a very friendly, readable introduction.

I just could not get into reading music and gave up. When I got older I gave it a second shot and it still made no more sense to me. I could play bass well enough and had been in a few local punk bands. With each instructor it was usually \\"this is what an E looks like, now memorize it\\" I saw this book and decided to order it.

This book helped me tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's perfect","review":"I used to create music by FL studio but soon I found I was lacking of the knowledge of chord.The condition of this book is excellent and it really helps me a lot on my work of music. I recommend anyone who is new to the music theory to see this book before he gets started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I've tried several music theory/music composition books, but most authors lose me on what I believe should be easy enough stuff to comprehend. Over the years, though I've wanted to branch out and create my own music, I get frustrated and continue just playing other people's music as I lack the understanding of how to take my music (in the form of chord progressions) to the next step.This book is different -- I like it very much so far! It explains the material in real terms, and I am having many \\"Oh! So that's what that means!\\" and \\"That's how that works!\\" moments. The book provides nice exercises that allow you a chance to try some of the things you learned in each chapter.I think the ear training CD is a great addition too! Ear training is another goal of mine so I can transcribe my favorite songs, and just be a better, self-sufficient musician.Even if it gets me half-way to where I want to be, it'll be worth it. I think this is the best money I've spent on learning music theory yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Thank you Mr. Miller","review":"Really great book, takes you by the hand explaining everything step by step. I am always the amateur drummer and had no previous in-depth understanding of music theory. I really enjoy reading this book (I am still on it).

But what is seemed like a simple and basic book turned out to be a confusing and frustated explanation of music theory.

This book is amazing when it comes to explaining all aspects of music theory.

In previous years I have enjoyed the career mode where you start in the Whelan series and work your way up to the Nextel series. I thought with the PS3 version, there would be lots of extras and career modes. However, the career options are very limited and have not held my attention. Also, in trying to allow you to set up the cars for racing, they have made it impossible to control the cars even in easy modes. It is impossible to get through a race without causing a yellow flag (the yellow flag is thrown so quick, sometimes you don't even see the wreck). I think this game will be a trade-in at Gamestop for Dirt which has a great demo on the PS3."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not bother yet.....","review":"I purchased this game and I have to admit that the graphics are pretty amazing. The worst part of this game is the lack of split screen racing. In previous versions, you can race in split screen mode which is the fun part of being with friends. The PS2 and XBOX 360 versions are 1-2 players locally, so why not the PS3 version?Bad move in my opinion by EA. For this reason, unless you just want to have some fun without being able to race friends sitting next to you and talking trash, I would not bother buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"to hard","review":"to hard for the average gamer , boring if you don't even like NASCAR, could've made it easier , no multiplayer if not online"},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics are good!","review":"Graphics are good and i liked the game.

If you're serious about gathering volumes of text to transcribe, get the Olympus DS-150 or better yet - get a regular tape machine and save yourself some money.I've used it to successfully record several telephone conversations, something I never thought of doing until I got it.I liked the Olympus VN-180 also, but it had more background noise than the Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for notes; less great for longer text","review":"LOVE the portability and size, love not having to worry about tapes. Great for quick notes. But if you try to record long conversations (I'm a speechwriter and record input from my clients), the controls are so sensitive that you can end up wasting time through failed attempts to scroll back to earlier dialogue (ending up in a different file, instead, and having to re-start.) A terrific invention, but it truly seems better for fast \\"to do\\" notes than for long text files you later wish to process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps on breaking","review":"I have a Panasonic RR-QR240 and a RR-QR80. The QR240 was purchased in Oct 2000 and the QR80 was purchased in August 2001. The QR240's speaker went out. I had to put a headset on it to hear messages. I purchased the QR80 to fill in while the QR240 was being repaired. It was promptly returned to me by a service center out of Georgia. Their repair lasted about three days. So I put it in the drawer and continued to use the QR-80. Today the microphone when out on it. So now I have two of them that broke. In just over a year I have spent about $200 on units that do not work.

Nothing fancy -- no frills -- just 3 guys with a need for speed pounding it out in moms garage. The lineup is Brant Bjork, once-time drummer for Kyuss & Fu Manchu taking a spin on gtr., drums = Alfredo Hernandez (Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age), bass = Dave Dinsmore (Unida).

I wasn't let down and found this record to be different yet has the guitar riffs that remind me of alot of the other desert rock bands. There is no crap or pretentious virtuoso musicianship being displayed here but solid driving rock. There some cool psychedelic effects on the guitar and bass lines here and there and even some brief solos which levels out the sparse change ups of the songs. Brants vocals (as well as his lyrics) are ridiculous at times, like when he uses a line from an NWA song to open Blue Demon.

Panasonic really out did themselves on this one! I can't understand why they discontinued this model as it was a very well rated and received boombox. I love the design and especially the sound. It is not over bassy and yet it packs a punch! I have had a newer Sony model and took it back to the store because the bass sounded artificial and vibrated and made a tinny sound which was absolutely horrible. Panasonic is definitely better quality than Sony has been lately. Buy this one and you won't be dissappointed. I bought mine used off eBay and it was worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo!","review":"This panasonic boombox is wicked,haha. I love the futuristic look.

The radio stations come in clear and you know they had to include a remote right? Yup, I don't have to get my lazy a$$ up to change radio stations or perform other functions if I don't want to. The sound virtualizer makes a song sound spacey, real raw. Now I know I said stick to Sony with portable audio but Panasonic is trying to come up. This boombox is great for 3 main reasions: One - It's size makes it easy to fit in any room or set up, it fits just fine on top of my small bookshelf. Two - The style can't be beat. The whole futuristic layout worked good. And Three - Sound quality is bumping. It can hang with some of the bigger and more expensive audio sets. That's my two cents on this boombox, I'm out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning this one","review":"Even if it worked...The engine loses the signal from the remote sporadically, no matter how close you are to it. Plus, for a three year old, it is very difficult to tell which way the remote should be held; up is down, down is up. In order to back the engine up to connect to the cars, the connectors (magnets)must be perfectly aligned. I was never able to do it without manually pushing the connector into place; I can't imagine a three year old being able to do it.

It's not as purely French as some of his other music has been, either. I've also never been a big fan of lyrics with the music; I prefer it just by itself as I think it expresses all that it needs to without any words. I think there are 5 tracks on this album with lyrics.I will add also that unlike some others, I was not disappointed in the \\"Goodbye Lenin!\\" soundtrack.

The main thing in schools (I being a teacher) is having the students read. These books not only are a good source of vocabulary but are so perplexing that students cannot put them down. Allow the students to have creative imaginations and let us not strive to keep them contained in a truly unreligious world that we live in. More and more religious beliefs are stifling the very fabric of American society. I too am Christian. But magic and wizardry are not real and never will be.

I only hope that Amazon will compensate us with a new cover/kindle when the engineering department admits that it made a mistake and decides to market the K with a newly generated design and cover.Is there is anyone out there who can effectively turn on the rear mounted on/off switch without \\"dislodging\\" the K from it's cover?????Oh yes, the leather has a nice feel and the elastic strap does keep the K tucked away safely when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be a better design","review":"This cover is a great idea lacking a lower right hand place to insert the corner of the kindle.

The cover DOES NOT fit the Kindle. The little \\"tabs\\" that are sewn into the cover at the top and bottom are too small to hold the device. They protrude above the back cover when the Kindle is inserted. The elastic band works OK, but does not keep the Kindle in the cover. The elastic band is the ONLY device on the cover to keep the Kindle in Place; therefore, the long end which is 7 3/4\\" is left open and the Kindle is 8\\". Bottom line: The cover just doesn't fit!!!

This will lock the Kindle into the cover securely.Just to double check to see if the Kindle is locked I push on the left side ever so slightly to see if it is lose and it never is.I have only had my Kindle for about a month so I cant say if this cover holds up to normal usage fairly,but it can be replaced.Although I do think twenty five dollars is a bit high for a faux leather cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle book cover - nothing special","review":"I love my Kindle, but I'm not in love with the cover.

Once I get my Kindle situated in the little nubby thing that is supposed to secure it...I can't turn the wireless on to connect to Kindle store without removing it. And then trying to get the Kindle back in there right...who has the time to fiddle with this poorly designed cover? I want to read! Dang it. Anyway, bad design.

Unfortunately, this should have opened by flipping over the top, not like a regular book where it renders two fo the most important controls difficult to get to.

Not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement book cover","review":"I think the design of these covers is lacking.

Someone mentioned a spine which holds the kindle in. I didn't figure this out.I don't understand why people want screen protectors. I want to be able to get at the kindle when the cover is open. When the kindle is closed, the cover is pressed against the nice suede cover.NOW, for my contribution:I attached velcro to the back of the kindle and the inside of the cover.It works. Now my kindle doesn't fall out of the cover.There is an issue in that the velcro sticky-side stick to the suede cover is pretty close to the velcro fuzzy side stick to the other velcro. This means that taking the kindle out of the cover isn't something you want to do everyday. Luckily, now that my kindle doesn't fall out of the cover every time I look at it, I don't need to take my kindle out of the cover very often at all (I just installed a 4GB sd card. That's once.).Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a Kindle by its cover, which is lame","review":"The bundled Kindle cover is very poorly designed and thought out. It makes it slightly too large to fit into a standard men's jacket pocket, and it doesn't even hold the Kindle particularly well. The strap seems designed to cover the scroller, though the fit is sloppy enough that I'm not sure exactly where it's meant to fit. And the cover won't quite support the Kindle upright, for reading hands-free on a table. The device badly needs some kind of screen protector, but this isn't it, and third parties don't seem to be selling them yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and cheaply made","review":"The Kindle cover serves only one useful purpose, and that is to protect the device when I'm traveling.

Otherwise, it needs to be redesigned. The biggest issue I have is that my Kindle keeps falling out because the back battery cover that latches onto the leather cover keeps coming off. So the battery cover and/or the leather cover needs to be redesigned. The Kindle is also not comfortable to read when in the cover. My wife owns the Sony eBook, and I really like to cover for that.

Maybe this should be used as a template for a newly redesigned cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Kindle Needs New Covers","review":"I love the kindle, and I love the feel of the kindle in the cover. I hate the cover attachment mechanisms. Inside the cover is a little tab to grab hold of the battery cover of the kindle.

Amazon are your listening... offer a new battery cover that has hinge like holes on it. Create an outer cover that has mating hinge like holes in it. Then have a pin that joins the two hinges and locks into place in the cover... preventing accidental falls. My palm pilot has a slot it it that the cover pin slides into...very secure, never a problem...Rhino makes an aluminum case for my palm and a pouch...both very cool... maybe if Amazon makes a new battery cover, Rhino could make the new book cover.

It requires having approached jazz through some other course first to appreciate, which in a nutshell means that if you aren't into avant-garde jazz (Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp, etc.), this is going to sound like so much pounding on instruments. Even when he's doing standards (there are none on this record) they don't fall into any traditional interpretation...they go WAY leftfield, and fans of the avant style wouldn't have it any other way.If, however, you're a fan of smooth jazz or even just more traditional jazz (Coltrane, Miles, etc.) this record - nay, MOST of Taylor's records - will drive you out the room. Listen to a friend's first and see if you're into it.

These days, it sits in my CD alarm clock so that, when the thing goes off every morning, I have to race out of bed to turn the CD off. God, what a dreadful cacophany!Yeah, I know, I don't 'get it.' It's over my head. Taylor was 'breaking new ground,' he was 'exploring improvisation without form,' 'creating structure without melody.'

When she is asked to investigate an apparent suicide in nearby Shore Haven, she readily agrees. Upon arrival in the small lakeside community (where tourists are breathlessly desired yet barely tolerated), she accepts employment in the victim's household, and uncovers evidence that the death was not at all what it appeared to be. Though the people she encounters seem harmless enough, it soon becomes apparent that she is in grave danger. There is a secret that someone is desperate to keep.Big Black Hole offers engaging characters, an appealing setting, and a well-constructed plot which, after many twists and turns, builds to a dramatic and totally unexpected climax.

We have many Korean friends and wanted to understand what they were saying to each other. After practicing a few lessons we tried it out, but no one understood what we were saying. It turns out that the language used on the CD is out of date and doesn't emulate modern speakers. This isn't so bad (my experience learning Japanese at school was similar), but it also turns out that one of the \\"native speakers\\" on the CD actually has a strong Korean-American accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual book","review":"This book by Carole Cadwalladr is her first and she appears to be working hartd to make all of it tie in together. It is a little different from the normal book that I read but I found it an enjoyable read.She does get into some technicalities that may bore one and make you wonder how in the world it is important to the plot, but she normally succeeds in finding a way to tie it all together.Bet her next books will be even better.This was an enjoyable read.J.

In fact, I asked myself, what does the protagonist have to live for, at the end? The baby? That didn't work for her own mother. I actually felt as if the author had tired of this whole novel-writing expedition, and was simply tryng to get rid of the plot and the characters quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book","review":"I found this book in the remainder pile at the local bookstore. As I'm interested in genealogy, the title was enough to make me bring it home. I'm glad I did! This is one of the best books about life in our own times that I've ever read.

I didn't think it was funny, in fact I think my eyes went crossed reading the \\"midget\\" humor thrown in which didn't make any sense.If you're born and raised in the DC/Maryland area you MAY understand this garbage. (Although I'm sure that most people living in this area would want to read something with more substance). I hope Zane writes something that's more intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of th BEST BLACK BOOKS EVERRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK.

I found the book extremely stereotypical, the dialog repetitive (she uses the down same phrases over and over again, like \\"sepia eyes\\" and \\"fell out laughing\\"), and at times just downright ridiculous (being chased down the street by midgets at the midget farm). I also was irritated by the fact that Zane never said what Harmony's illness was. She hinted at it for most of the novel, but her diagnosis was never explained to the readers. This book was definitely lacking for me and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because some parts were entertaining even if they were ridiculous and unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the Author.....","review":"although comical in nature, i did not enjoy the book as i was told by friends that i would. but, then Zane's writing has always left me wondering....i would tell anyone that Zane's other works 'Addicted' and 'Heatseekers' are more indicative of the author's true creativity.'Shame' made me think of a poorly written 'Bronze Thrills' byline! i was glad when i got to the end!explicit sex scenes do not create a page-turning novel!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous, but NOT what I expected","review":"I purchased this book because I had read reviews of Zane's other works and thought this would be promising. NOT. I felt as if I was reading the version that is given to the editor to make corrections on. This book was too \\"surface\\". Not a lot of depth here. Also the phrase \\" Shame On It All\\"? I don't get it. I was disappointed at the lack of writing skill, but finished it to find out what happened to one of the characters.Also, what is up with the advertisments? Corny! I WON'T waste my money on another Zane book. Sorry - I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little cheesy","review":"I guess if you like commercials in your book and cheesy words that ruin a steamy scene this book is for you.

It starts out good but beleive me it is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could get a refund","review":"I've been a fan of Zane's website for for about 6 years and decided to give her books a try. I was disappointed with the 1st one I read but I was in the airport waiting for a standby flight and said \\"what the heck...\\" Now I regret my decision. This book was HORRIBLE!!!! The dialog is sophmoric and ignorant. The situations in the book are unrealistic and stupid. Come on...A brothel of well hung midgets?!?!?!? Get real!!!! This book did not allow me to escape into an erotic fantasy. It just made me sit there and wonder, \\"what in the hell is she smoking to have the audacity to release a piece or poorly written trash like this...?\\" I'm sorry Zane, but you will never get another one of my hard earned dollars. Only those that have little or no literary intellect and have never read a decent book would find this one entertaining. This book is an atrocity to the publishing world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Garbage!!!!","review":"The best way I could describe this book. I'm a Zane fan but this book was HOT GARBAGE...as if she was just racing to fulfill a deadline and just put any ole thing out there..it was horrible.SAVE YOUR MONEY...if you still want it contact me and I will give you mine. SERIOUSLY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous waste of time!","review":"I love to read a quick summer book as much as the next person, but after reading this attempt at storytelling by Zane, I feel cheated. The story lines are ludicrous and the characters are unrealistic and somewhat appalling. Zane portrays these African American women as sex-starved idiots with only one thing on their minds. A frightening thing that Zane leaves out of her characters amped up sex lives, is the mention of condom use. African American women are one of the fastest growing groups of newly infected HIV cases. Shame on YOU Zane for not incorporating condoms into the characters numerous sexcapades. I feel that there are better African American fiction writers and stories available and I hope the next book I find will be worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"The bond between the characters in this novel was so strong that it brought a life to this book that you can only understand by reading it. This story of three stong black sistas and the challenges they face daily was incredible; definitely a page turner. Pick up a copy...you won't put it down until the end! Zane is an incredible author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zane does it again","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. Zane is very gifted and should start making her books into movies. I can't want for Shame on it all again, it is taking way to long for that to come out.HURRY ZANE"},{"rating":"2","title":"shame on it all","review":"It was overall a good book. I've read some of zane's other books and the others were a little more realistic, but this was more humurous.I do think it took way too long to get to the point of what was wrong with Harmony, and I probably could have done with out the midgets, but the book did keep me laughing and I finished it in a couple of days, and I'm on my way to go out and buy another zane book. (i absolutely love them)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This novel was so unrealistic,outrageous, and stupid it was funny.

This is my first and last purchase of any books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny! hilarious","review":"This book is simply one word (funny) Filled with lust, sex, love and loads of laughter.

It only took me 2 days to finish the book because I found myself laughing out loud to some scenes in the book. This book is definitely recommended if you want a little \\"chuckle\\" in your life. Zane has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!","review":"You all it's been a very long time since I read a book that literally had me laughing out loud. I do a vast majority of my reading on the way to work, and on the way home. I know that I was disturing others while cracking up on the bus, but I couldn't help myself. I mean all through the book this author is halarious. I have never encountered an author that has such a play on words.The Whitfield sisters start out as little girls, and they were funny then. What I really appreciated about the three of them is their closeness. They were tight, and if you tampered with one, you tampered with them all. I've just learned there's going to be sequel to this book. I can't wait.I highly recommend SHAME ON IT ALL. Especially for times when you want to entertain yourself. Buy it, you won't regret it.Keep up the good work, Zane, and thanks for the laughs. You're my new friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's trite from the beggining","review":"First let me say that I didn't make it off the second page. I found the same annoying errors in this book as I did in \\"Addicted\\".Zane absolutely, positively uses the A-word entirely too much. Only at the second page I'd already gotten to the A-word 6 times. Not creative at all. It's like she is at a loss for words and can't think of anything else to say besides the A-word.Then every bit of dialogue sounds so cliche'-ish. Every sentence sounds like she looked in the Ghetto-tharus, and found some Ghetto fabulous way to put each phrase. This book is a shame, and very stereotypical of black women. Are these \\"women\\" from the 'hood or what? I give this book 1-star for being nothing, but G-H-E-T-T-O."},{"rating":"2","title":"shame on it all","review":"i think the book was excellent and i enjoyed readin every little bit of it and i couldnt put it donw. all props to Zane"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wonderul Opinion on \\"Shame On It All\\"","review":"I totally think that you(Zane), did a wonderful job on this novel.This novel totally deserves 5 stars and more!I have been such a huge fan of all your novels.But in this one,I have to give it to you girl,you really pushed it to the top. And before I this book, i already knew that it would keep me laughing and wondering to myself what would happen next.And you really proved that friendship and family do mean a lot when it comes to keeping eachother happy.Even if it comes to having sex with ex's when you hate them.Great Job and keep up the good work.May God bless you along the way!!I LOVE U ZANE"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great story","review":"This is not something that Zane would usually write , but it was such a good book. I read it in 2 days, just could not put the book down. These sisters are a trip, everyone should have family like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This is book is so fictional. If you read one Zane book you have read them all. When you first start reading her books. they are good, but then as you read more and more it starts to get old. But hey how many different ways can you talk about sex. This book had a lot of good points but them it starts to get stupid. If you are reading a Zane book for the first time, them you might be like ... she is of the hook, but if your like me and have read many don't wast you time. She will not be getting any more of my business if she writes the same lines in every book except with different characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Overall, the book was a pretty good read. For the fact that she kept me laughing, is enough to make me read more of her books. This book reminded me a lot of Soul Food the movie, without all that wonderful cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"average with over the top antics","review":"Ok perhaps I shouldn't have read \\"Addicted\\" prior to reading \\"Shame On It All\\", but this book was off the wall. And I don't mean that in a good way. The personality of the main character in Addicted seemed like it was the same for one of the charcters (the middle sister)in this book. It was much of the same \\"kick your a** attitude cause I'm it and I can do that\\" personality in this one. But what made Shame bad was the over the top antics with the commercial breaks; the midgets; and that unbelieveable kidnap stunt with the college dean (who did deserve it actually). While I must admit that I do in fact enjoy Zane's writing style, this book did little to contribute to her growth as a writer of contemporary fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE shame on the bad writing","review":"thou this is her first novel i am cutting her alot of slack i mean this booked dragged and dragged i think by the time she got 2 addicted she had the hang off it casue this right here is not hittng n e thing at all 2 me. long drawn out 4 nothing at all. so i do say shame on it all 4 just a long drawn out book with nothing there 2 grab u and no intesity at all.BBBOOOO!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the stupidest book I've read in a long time!!","review":"I have never read a Zane book before and after reading this book, I can say I NEVER will again, the book starts off alright and you expect some substance, but it quickly begins to go down hill.The sponsor ads were pointless, not funny and a waste of paper, then she throws the silliness from the ads into the story which makes the story just annoying and unrealistic.The Harmony mystery was such a big secret and when they \\"revealed\\" what was wrong that was such a disappointment. The dean escapade was over the top and again....not realistic. The mandingo thing was disgusting and extremely stupid. I was very disappointed with this story and discourage anyone who doesn't have money to blow to stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Them Coming!","review":"Zane, you have found a fan in me. You keep writing and i will definitely read them. My book club... will be reviewing your books soon.

You are all that a bag of chips.Keep the faith and stay blessed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early 70's hard rock - one of the finer moments","review":"If you are looking for the definative Golden Earring album this probably isn't it. However, if you are familiar with their hits and have one or two other CD's by them, then this is a must for your collection. You'll also find the original version of Big Tree, Blue Sea on this LP. It later appeared on Moontan (with Radar Love) but the mix was entirely different.This LP (also known as Wall of Dolls)shows the band truly maturing from their mid 60's pop rock sound. It's also one of the earliest LP's featuring Caesar Zuijderwick, perhaps the world's greatest rock drummer. Get their videos and see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jazztet plus Bill Evans","review":"I once had a short conversation with the late pianist, Bill Evans and asked him what his favorite album was. To my surprise, he mentioned not any of his trio albums with Scott LaFaro, but a date he did with Art Farmer & Benny Golson--\\"Modern Art\\". Everything was mostly accomplished in one take, and he felt the session really swung. If you happened to buy or listen this album, you'll understand why Bill was so fond of this session. Tunes like \\"Darn that Dream\\" or \\"Like Someone in Love\\" really groove under Bill's accompaniement and also his solos. If you love the Jazztet or Bill Evans, you can't go wrong with example of \\"modern art\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"area limitations","review":"The product description says \\"all regions\\", but be warned, a lot of DVD players in the US won't play this disc.

If you already own the album of this, then buy it as an accompanying piece.Thankfully the Australian DVD has been given a 5.1 surround sound mix as well. But it is important to note that it is only simulated which means it is a pseudo surround sound. Obviously the concert was originally only recorded in 2 channel stereo.

I wasn't around for the actual concert, but seeing it on video was good enough for me. I've been a long time fan of Simon and Garfunkle...particularly Paul Simon...but I think this showed us yet again that they've still got it. Art did an ok job of Bridge Over Troubled Water, and his harmony was ok. I don't really think he was quite on the ball that night though. He seemed ike he really enjoyed being on stage and it seemed like he missed it, too. Paul's performance was, to say the least, wonderful.

That is worse is the reviews above have all been recycled, and are exactly the same between each edition.It is also tough to find one that is unedited. The 'Late Great Johnny Ace' is edited out of almost all of them because some lunatic ran on stage. There is also a great line from Artie where he says \\"Are you cold? You look beautiful\\". It's a small, nice thing that has been edited out of all of them.So, can anyone tell me what the difference is between the many DVD releases of this concert... and are any of them unedited?

I found that the years have taken a toll on the edge that their songs had 40 years ago. The music was more sweet and round. In this sense of edge versus round, I was a bit disappointed, but I enjoyed seeng them together again and hearing again the classics.

They didn't have much of an audience there, but they still completely rocked. I went home and got a copy of their CD and listened to it, and I was hooked. The best way to describe them is a mix of Neil Young and Bob Dylan but with a pinch of country and a lot of kick. If you listen to the demos, you get a taste, but to really appreciate them, you have to listen to the songs from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I'm a big fan of Judith McNaught's historical romance novels (Whitney My Love is my favorite romance novel of all time), so when I read this novel, I was very disappointed. The story was very slow and the characters seemed to lack personality. I think I'll stick with her historical romance novels and stay away from her contemporary romance novels. For contemporary romance, you can't beat Nora Roberts and Linda Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback....","review":"I was so excited to get this novel. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I found this novel very slow and actually a bit boring. While I liked all the characters I never felt apart of their stories. The secondary characters are definitely the best part of the story.I definitely recommend waiting for paperback to buy or maybe even just borrowing it from a friend.If you want to read a contemporary Judith McNaught book pick up Paradise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Ms McNaught seems to have lost her charisma in this book. I do not find the romance between Michael and Leigh as sensual and attractive as that between Mack and Sam. In fact, the story of the latter pair can be written as a separate story! I've so missed Whitney, My Love and The Kingdom of Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a letdown","review":"I love all of her books but after reading the excerpt to this one (before it came out,and obviosly before she wrote more than a few pages) I was VERY disapointed. this was supposed to be some kind of medieval/timetravel thing (called waters edge) and she suddenly turned it into a contemperrary novel. whats the idea? I guess she just couldn't go forward with the plot, still I think it WOULD have been a very good story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After waiting forever for this book to come out, I was hugely disappointed. I found it hard to believe the romance between the two main characters after some of the plot developments and Leigh, the female lead, never made me feel anything for her. Instead, I found the romance between secondary characters Mack and Sam to be more entertaining which is why I gave it 2 stars. Ms. McNaught makes reference to Matt and Meredith Farrell of \\"Paradise\\" frequently, which you are better off reading, or better yet, pick up \\"Perfect\\" again for a REALLY good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's really nasty outside, this is better than daytime TV","review":"I started this book on a rainy afternoon because it was handy and I'd have to put on a raincoat to go to the library and select another book. When I reached the halfway point, the rain stopped and I decided I really didn't care all that much for any of her characters, so I pitched this one and went to the local library and took out a Marcia Muller mystery. Had the rain lasted another day, I would have finished this one. Honest Injin! Don't buy this book, but if nothing else is available, give it a shot.Charlie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not vintage McNaught, but still better than most","review":"Although this book is not up to the standards of Paradise and Perfect, it's certainly better than Night Whispers or Remember When. That said, it does not have the emotional depth of McNaught's earlier books, and, although I polished it off in two days, I don't feel the lead characters will stay with me as other McNaught creations have in the past. But, mediocre McNaught is still far better than the best efforts of many other major authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I really enjoyed some of her prior books, but this one really falls short of expectations. I wish she stuck to what she was best known for (she was my romance comfort read). Maybe, she hopes to broaden her horizon and attract more readers who enjoy lots of suspense/mystery along with romance thrown in as a bonus. Sorry, this wasn't for me. I don't think I'm reading her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intruigue at its Best","review":"SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME is filled with all the plot elements readers love.

Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"The book arrived on time and was exactly as described. It's great to buy these older books since I am unable to download them to my iPad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not her best","review":"I wish Judith would stick to what she does best..... plain old romance. Perfect is my all time favourite book, along with Paradise and Tender Triumph, Whitney, Something Wonderful and Once and always. Her last two books have been sad in comparison. Judith just doesnt do suspense well. Half way thorough this book I was wanting the two female lead characters to get together....The men were boring. The story wasnt that great, and in places it was unbelievable. No way would someone who was that much in love with their husband fall head over heels with someone else. Two romances in the same story was just confusing, and I had no idea who the girl was who was from the previous novel until she spelled it out. Forget this novel by Judith, if you want qualtiy suspense/romance, try Elizabeth Lowell instead... she knows what she is doing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was the first time I'd ever read a Judith McNaught novel, which I received from a friend. The story started off okay, in my opinion, and overall, in general, I liked the story. However, my main problem with the book was that it appeared that Ms. McNaught's editor did not do his/her job! The book is very poorly edited (if at all) and I found it difficult to read because I couldn't get past the editing mistakes. The biggest one is that she often had two different characters speaking or having thoughts within the same paragraph! A big no-no. Each character is supposed to have his/her own separate paragraph when they speak or when their thoughts are being expressed.There were many other editorial mistakes (poor scene transitions, implausible actions and thoughts by characters, such as the detectives Shrader and Littleton; to name a couple) that took away from my enjoyment of this novel.Read it if you want something slight to pass time with."},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat emptor, fellow mystery fans!!","review":"I must admit, this was the first time I read any of Judith McNaught's novels. Probably serves me right for not checking to see what genre she is *really* considered (curses to the used book store for putting her in the Mystery section).The plot, on preview, had a lot to offer - a missing husband, the target of police suspicion, and the whole \\"you-never-really-know-anybody\\" mystique really leads to high expectations. But that's where I found the real mystery ends. The book seemed to be more about developing a love/hate relationship (or two) that hardly prompted me to keep reading. And the ending was trite, cliché, and more like a literary low-budget B movie than the its promised \\"pitch-perfect duet of suspense and intrigue\\".The bottom line? <yawn> Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy","review":"I picked up this book because I'd read a review that made it sound like a mystery, and it was, for a while. Then it turned into a sappy romance, two sappy romances actually, and it lost what little appeal it might otherwise have had.I now realize that, as a general rule, when the author's name on the cover is bigger than the title, the book is not one I'm going to enjoy: Tom Clancy, John Grisham, Judith Krantz, et al ad nauseum.Another bad sign is a title that's a line from a song, and these seem to be proliferating. Pass them up if you like good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is trash.","review":"This book was total trash. I would have liked it a lot better if the romance was taken out of it. It would have read a bit more intelligent. Instead, it was more like a dime store romance novel. And I agree with everyone who said it, people do not fall in love and marry someone so quick after losing their husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"More similar books in the future","review":"I have all her books and I read them all. I would like to read some more similar in the NEAREST FUTURE. Thamk you for unforgetable moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustation","review":"I\`m completely frustated. Like rflins said, this book is horrible. What happened to you McNaught? Did you really write this book?!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I just finished reading this book last week, and I enjoyed it. It wasn't your typical Judith McNaught, but in my eyes she can do no wrong. I think she did a great job making an attempt to broaden her base by writing more of a suspense novel instead of romance. But she did manage to get the romance in there, and it wasn't forced like I was afraid it might be. I really enjoy Mary Higgins Clark, so this was a nice return into that kind of book. Devour every Judith McNaught book you can, because no matter what style she decides to write, you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but still a good read","review":"As a big Judith McNaught fan, I also have been waiting anxiously for this book to come out. I agree with others that this was not one of her best books, bit it is still SO much better than some of the other current best-selling authors. So, I would still recommend it. I'm looking forward to her next book - hopefully she'll decide to do another historical!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! after reading some of the negative reviews, i just had to send this in. I think it was just what you expect from Judith McNaught and well worth the wait! i could not put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love reading Judith McNaught. But, this book can only be discribed as very, VERY disappointing. I never got into her characters. The books drags, and drags, and drags. When Ms. McNaught burst on the sceen with Whitney My Love, I found her writing of historical romance to be extraordinary! \\"Whitney\\", and most of the books that followed were in a \\"super\\" league of their own. The plots were great, the dialogue superb, and the stories magnificant. But her last three books have made me reluctant to buy any more of her writing. There is an old saying, \\"if the wheel is not broke, don't fix it!\\" I wish Ms. McNaught would revisit the writing style of her earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric effort","review":"I had a very hard time getting interested in this book. It was flat. Also unbelievable in parts. This author's books used to leave me with a memory of what the book was all about. When I finally closed the book I never thought about it again. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Certainly it was not one of her better efforts. A grave disappointment for such a good author. Bad hair year is the only defense I can come up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Up To Speed On This One!","review":"I've read other books by this author and liked them. Not so on this one. This book dragged. I had the impression the author couldn't make up her mind if she was writing a mystery or a romance. If both which is what I suspect, she fell short of the mark. I'm sorry I didn't wait for the paperback. The three year wait for this book was not worth it. The book definitely did not leave me with a memory of it. In fact, I couldn't wait to get rid of it by passing it on to a friend. I'm hopeful the next book will be better and not so . . . thrown together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Reading*","review":"This was not the best by JM, but it was a good read. The beginning was a bit of a turn off what with all the flashbacks that I didn't understand much at first, but then it picked up and I was with it until the end. I do recommend Someone to Watch Over Me to fans of Judith McNaught, even if it isn't her best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Fan","review":"I'm a huge Judith McNaught fan, and have waited impatiently for the past few years for this book to finally be released. I have to admit that it is not her best work, but it is definitely a good book. Judith is an amazing romance writer. She is able to draw you into her characters and make you feel what they are going through. By the end of the book you care about them like they are your own friends or family. From Whitney My Love to Perfect to Night Whispers I've felt a connection with all of her characters. The connection wasn't competely there in Someone to Watch Over Me.What would be nice is for Nicky DuVille to have his own, full length story."},{"rating":"2","title":"someone to watch over me","review":"i was really pleased with this book. it has such an unusual plot. judith is a genuis. however, i have been looking forward to \\"waters edge\\" since 1999. before 1999, i had sworn off romance, until i stumbled across \\"kingdom of dreams\\". this book renewed my interest in romance, and i have been searching for \\"waters edge\\" since then. call me a sappy, male-dominating romantic (female-empowering;such a contradiction)story-searcher. all the other books i have read since then have just been the tide-me-over until \\"waters edge\\" release. judith, where is it ..........?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after a long wait","review":"I am a huge fan of Judith McNaught's and have been checking Amazon.com religiously for the publish date of \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\". I don't purchase many hardback books but I make an exception for McNaught and this time I have to say that I was disappointed. For the first 200 pages I kept checking to make sure that McNaught did indeed write this book. It reminds me of a Mary Higgins Clark novel. I enjoy Clark but I was expecting McNaught's \\"Whitney, My Love\\" or \\"Paradise\\" characters in this book and it didn't deliver. I purchased this book intending to curl up with a steamy but substantive romance novel and instead was anxious to be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you are an old fan = 3.5 stars","review":"I have been reading romance for a long time, this author is my favorite author of all time!! That said, this is not her best.. for that see Whitney My Love. This novel did one wonderful thing. I have begun to re read all of her past works. So.. if you are new to McNaught.. oh you have so many hours of wonderful reading. If not,well, enjoy a little reference to some old friends but you will complete your read in about 8 hours - not the depth of charaters from the early novels. While you will make friends with some new characters, don't expect to have that same desire to meet them again in the next installment. Happy Reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This in not an export!","review":"Judith McNaught never wrote Water's Edge.Ms. McNaught took the initial plot device of a car accident and used it as the beginning of her latest book - Someone to Watch Over Me. This is available in the US in hardback and paperback. She has no immediate plans for a time travel novel.It's a shame that almost 2 years after this was announced by her publisher, amazon.com continues to add to the reader's confusion by listing this as an available book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have been a Judith McNaught reader and fan for a long time. I was very anxious to read this book as the gossip was that the publisher kept asking for rewrites as they were not happy with it. No wonder they did as it seems that Ms. McNaught is changing from writing romance periodic novels (which is her best style) to getting into mystery.All of her books in the past let you get to know the characters more so that you could get attached to them and be more into the story. BUt that wasn't accomplished in this book. I always say that if you keep putting a book done, it is entertaining you and this one didn't.Ms. McNaught if you read this, PLEASE GO BACK TO WRITING PERIODIC ROMANCE NOVELS! We miss them!."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely predictable","review":"I usually love romantic suspense novels, but this one was so bad that I had to force myself to finish it in the hopes that it would get better. The characters are your standard, stereotypical ones: \\"the tortured heroine\\", \\"the dark hero\\" and the \\"wicked husband\\". PUhleese. The storyline was utterely predictable and Leigh's new love came so fast it made my head spin. So much for the 13 years of marriage and love, and working through the self-doubt, anger and betrayal issues that usually come up when your perfect husband turns out not to be so perfect.As a reader of romantic suspense, I do understand that there is always going to be a standard plot that authors follow. But, this was a sub-par one at best. Thankfully I didn't actually pay money for this drivel. Skip it and read nora roberts or kay hooper's early stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"The first Judith McNaught book I read was A Kindom of Dreams and I've been wondering if I would ever fall in love with another character like I'd fallen in love with Royce Westmoreland. So hungry to find such a compelling and engrossing love story as that one, I RAN to the bookstore and, unfortunately, ran into this book. What an atrocity. It's just, a real lame story. Going from A Kingdom of Dreams to this was like leaving wedding to attend a funeral. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"It kills me to say this, (because I'm a huge fan of Judith McNaught's work), but I really hated this book. It made absolutely no sense to me. To simply put it, it was a mess. The beginning of the story had a lot of potential, but it will quickly take you down on this never-ending nose dive further along into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great hero","review":"I was surprised, but I REALLY liked this book. Generally I'm not so keen on McNaught's contemporary ones, but after second reading, I'm sure this book is good. Yes, it has some weak moments and not everything is believable. For example I don't believe the police would investigate as they did, I mean trying to find evidences against a certain man who was for them already a culprit instead of collecting all evidences first and THEN finding a murderer (even if they had a hidden motive to make this certain man a culprit, just like in this book). I only wish there were more romantic moments with Michael and Leigh, their story is too short! And Michael is adorable, I think he's the best McNaught's contemporary hero, a real knight in shining armor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"After a terrible wreck, Leigh Kendall wakes to find that her husband, Logan Manning, is missing, likely dead. In short order, she becomes one of the suspects as Logan's secrets come to light, ones she even was not party to. Then, Michael Vallente, the other main suspect, wins her heart. Though neither is the killer, both are potential victims.** Despite being over five hundred pages in length, the story feels rushed in one sense and fails to stay on target. Multiple flashbacks continually jar the reader from one time to another, and the plot leaps from investigation to the main characters in a disjointed manner that is simply hard to follow. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"still waiting","review":"Dear Judith,When are you going to write this book i have been waiting so many years to read it. I just love your style of writing. Or is this book being replace by your other novel of someone to watch over me? Please let me know. Thank you and love your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm being generous giving it two stars.....","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I stuck with it hoping things would get interesting, but they never did.There were so many lame, disappointing non-developments in the story. It was as if McNaught had open opportunities to make things more interesting, but blatantly ignored them. Sometimes when a storyline sucks the romantic aspects are compelling, but even those fell flat. If you ask me, Valente's character and his actions were completely creepy.I don't recommend this book. But don't get discouraged by the author. McNaught is awesome. I would suggest Paradise, Whitney, My Love, or Remember When."},{"rating":"1","title":"still waiting","review":"Dear Judith,When are you going to write this book i have been waiting so many years to read it.

I agree with the previous reviews, this is not Judith Mcnaught's best work. For anyone who doesn't know, this book was supposed to be titled \\"Water's Edge\\" I really did a lot of searching before I realized \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" is \\"Water's Edge\\".I feel the author and publisher could have made that a lot clearer. I spent a lot of time looking for the non-existent title \\"Water's Edge\\".It seems obvious Judith Mcnaught is not up to writing a time travel book at this time in her career.

If you wish to see the pinaccle of Tenchi Muyo, this is your movie... Great animation, supurb story, and the characters are still in check. My only complaint is the lack of humor (the kind that the OVA supplied), nonetheless, this movie deserves a 5-star rating.

This is a very intence and awsome movie and I recomend it to and Tenchi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchi Muyo In Love","review":"Tenchi Muyo In Love is an awesome movie. The only reason a person might find it boring is if they aren't very familiar with the anime. This movie follows the storyline of the Tenchi Universe Series. Basically Tenchi Muyo is about a boy named Tenchi who meets up with some strange characters such as 2 princesses from the planet Jurai, 2 galaxy space police officers, a wierd scientific genious, and an insane Space pirate. Many of the characters fall in love with Tenchi and end up fighting over him; which is what you will see in Tenchi Muyo In Love. In The movie Tenchi is going to vanish because of something that happens to his mother 26 years in the past. The whole gang is sent 26 years into the past, with the help of the genious Washuu, to prevent anything from happening to Tenchi's parents. The special affects are very good compared to the anime series and the movie displays many surprises in the plot. I recommend this movie to any anime fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tenchi Movie","review":"Just like my title said. It's the first and the best movie of Tenchi Muyo!

The only god animated films comes from Disney !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Spit Upon It","review":"Tenchi Muyo is one of the top 3 reasons why I have begun to intensely dislike Japanime. Mostly because, often, it had no plot whatsoever and just annoyed the hell out of me. However, I was conned into watching this horrible video, which I am proud to say I burned afterwards. Anything with the Tenchi name upon it needs to be thrown into a pit and burned for being an offense to writers everywhere. And I swear if I hear that stupid noise that Rabbit-Rat thing makes ever again, i'm going to find it and shoot it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best I have ever seen!","review":"I had always had a tiny interest in anime, but when I saw this movie for the first time back in 1996, I did backflips (metaphorically speaking)! The characters are funny, especially Mihoshi. The plot was sweet, the animation was awsome, and the english dubbing of this version was also very good. (To tell you the truth, I was worried that it would be cheesy Godzilla dialogue all the way through. I was waaaaaay wrong!) I highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who've seen Tenchi, and for those who haven't...","review":"...This was the first anime I had ever seen, and even though I wasn't familiar with the characters, customs, or Japan in general, I was hooked. It was purely entertaining for someone who had never seen this type of animation before, and I was skeptical. Also, if you are a fan of Tenchi, you will love this movie. It explores his past and gives you a better understanding of his connections. It is dramatic and serious,but lighthearted in the right places. It is a must-see. Also, the music is great! The extras that come on DVD are awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Need For . . . umm, any other movies!","review":"This movie was so incredibly good that I probably would never get sick of watching it. The animation was excellent (as expected), and the plot was very good. In Tenchi Muyo in Love, Tenchi and everyone must go back in time, where they see Tenchi's parents as teenagers. The movie, I think, would be suited for many tastes, with many humorous moments but a lot of action as well. The only downside is that one would probably be better off watching this after one has been acquainted with the characters, so I'd recommend seeing some episodes first. It's really nice to see all of the great Tenchi characters again, but probably one of the best parts was getting to see Tenchi's parents when they were young . . . there were some really sweet romantic moments between them. You should definitely see this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is deffinately worth the money. it has great action and if you have never seen a tenchi movie before you will have no porbolem catching on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings tears to my eyes","review":"This is one of the saddest anime movies I have ever seen.

This is a must see for all anime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Sound / great to watch.","review":"All around great movie. The extra deatil in the animation vs. the regular series really shows through. Music is good but not terribly memorable. The sound is second only to Ghost in the Shell for sheer Power. If you want to hear why you bought that home theater sound system, this movie is it. The voice actors are very good. I actually prefer it over the subbed which I have also watched. Muyo in love is by far better than the second movie which felt more like a drawn out mediocore episode on the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky Jazzy........Totally New Orleans","review":"These boys have talent.......see more recent releases.

The culmination and development of their unique sound from this album, Coolin' Off, has since developed into the band that many fans cherish and anticipate experiencing their talent live. Their uncanny incorporation of brass instrumental melodies compliment the funkiest rhythms that rock us to our core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Range","review":"This Album should be high on the \\"must buy\\" list for anyone looking for music to get your feet moving, while being technically impressive as well. Galactic shows off their New Orleans influence on this album with tracks like \\"Funky Bird\\" that start off as a little more jazz oriented with a complete change of pace about 2/3 of the way through that gets the foot tapping. With \\"Go Go\\", the band brings the horns and piano to a level that reminds me off a Jam Band, if that Jam Band were able to bring trumpet, trombone, and sax to the table like these guys do. It is clear that each track on this album has points that highlight each of the band members' styles, while the other members take a back seat that allows for the spotlight to be cast. I would highly recommend this album to most anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE","review":"I'd heard a lot about Galactic before hearing this CD, and because of comparisons to bands like the Meters & JB's, I couldn't wait to hear it. It wasn't what I expected. There is funk there, but only in small doses. The highlight of the CD is \\"There's Something Wrong With This Picture\\", and \\"Funky Bird\\" is good, but the main riff is a blatant Meters rip-off. The rest of the album sinks into acid-jazz-esque mediocrity - non- thought provoking elevator music. If this is thefuture of funk, then I don't want to be anywhere near it. For authentic funk, check the \\"original\\" Meters tracks, and stuff like the Brand New Heavies' 1st album. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to live stuff","review":"judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acid-jazz casualty","review":"After chancing upon Galactic's rather remarkable live show at a local bar, I jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc. Wasn't worth the effort, I'm afraid. Velveeta on Wonder Bread-dull collection of acid jazz duds. Not bad as background noise for your next dinner party, but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make Galactic such a great live act. A pass for all but Galactic completeists, if such an animal exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Bird","review":"I have had this cd for years, and since I am from the Boston area, I have always had fondness for this disc, originally recorded for radio broadcast on an early autumn evening in Boston in 1953. The renditions of \\"Now's the Time\\" and also \\"Groovin' High\\" are particularly fine vintage jewels of bop. The fact that Herb Pomeroy, a Boston jazz legend for more than 50 years, appeared as a guest musician is a certainly interesting, but it is obvious from listening to this that Herb's talent paled in comparison to Charlie Parker. Another jazz legend from Boston appears on this disc, drummer Roy Haynes, one of my personal favorites, who years later, would go on to play with Monk and Coltrane, to name a few. This is not an essential Parker recording, but certainly a memorable one for jazz fanatics, considering he would tragically die less than two years later, in 1955."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.....","review":"This is my second charlie parker live CD after \\"bird at the hi hat\\" and i highly recommend them both.

They later deleted the post, but I think it's necessary to comment on that. A legalist is one who upholds the letter of the Law above the spirit of the Law. Jesus is THE WORD. There are examples in the parables where Jesus places human need and compassion above the written Law. The fundamentalists place heavy yokes around people's necks, yet they don't know whether they would be able to bare up under the yoke if they were in the other's place. They will have to give an account for this one day. You reap what you sow.

Carman wrote this song after a brief conversation with Rev. Dake (author of the Dake Study Bible). Dake was sick and Carman was trying to help Dake prepare for the afterlife through a song of encouragement. Fortunately the only thing that afflicted Dake at the time was a bad case of the gout; Dake ended up living quite a few years after that.Carman wrote this song (a fact unknown to many people) when he was only 5 years old.

It seems to expand on the cinematic soundscapes of their previous voyages and continue into some new frontier. This album feels like more of a band effort than Lanterna's Sands CD with more drums and bass playing. It lifts you up right from the start and also allows you to drift along with the open vastness that songs like \\"Hope\\" provide. I'd really like to give it 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Beginners","review":"The quality of the DVD isn't very good; however, the DVD isn't a movie it is an exercise video. The contents of the DVD is about strength fitness exercises with light weights for beginners. I don't know if it actually promotes weight loss but it is a good starter DVD for people who like me lacked knowledge on how to exercise with weights. The exercises are fairly easy and if they are not challenging enough you can use heavier weights. The most difficult exercises are the sit-ups other than that the routine is fairly easy... easy enough for just about anyone to be able to follow regardless of their fitness level. I am glad that I made the purchase and maybe some day I will graduate to an intermediate level."},{"rating":"2","title":"boomers workout","review":"I liked the pace of the video.

The DVD claimed this would be a 40 minute workout, but, in fact, the running time is 27 minutes. In doing the routine, I noticed at least 3 times, the screen would say, \\"Start set one,\\" or \\"Start set two\\" and in each instance, there was no set two or no set one, respectively. My guess is that about 13 minutes got cut on the editing floor inadvertently. The actual exercises and workout are decent, but the product doesn't meet its claims and participants are not getting the full workout promised. Also, I contacted Funcercise and have never received a reply, which is also disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME DVD AS BEGINNERS","review":"As another reviewer said, THIS IS THE SAME DVD AS THE BEGINNER'S DVD, only different cover and name. \\"Sunshine\\" (whoever that really is) is NOT wearing that USA outfit in this DVD.

This loud acidy rock is so jarring and discordant that I have to mute the soundt, which means I can't get the instructions.All in all, I can NOT recommend this exercise video at all and I'm only glad it was cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing DVD","review":"No transition time from exercise to exercise.

This earlier album of Benny Green's is an example of a piano trio at it's best. Contrary to Benny's later albums (kaleidoscope), there are no other instruments on this album. The tunes all swing hard and groove. Benny is one of my favorite comtemporary jazz pianists, and this earlier album shows his developed swinging and exquisite arrangements. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the jazz piano trio.

I have the pleasure of personally knowing Benny through attending several of his his concerts in Arizona and you will not meet a more spiritually connected musician. This CD offers a good look into how Benny was in the earler stages of his career and when you hear him live, as all who love this music should make a point of doing to support the artform, you can see how the foundation gets wider, deeper and stronger to support his desire to pay homage to the great piano masters who influenced him. I bought this recording to get one particular song, \\"Cupcake\\", which has some of the best chord harmonies you'll hear in a piece. Like I said, go to his website and find his concert close to you.

Don't let the academic look of the book fool you -- if you want to learn about how psychoanalytic therapy works, and the potential effect of this therapy, I highly recommend Transforming Lives. The conversational accounts of real-life psychoanalyses as told by the therapists and the patients are very readable, compelling, and down-to-earth.Reading about how the patient's experienced the therapy in their own words was fascinating. For example, one patient wrote about how he tried taking Prozac for 5 years but found it only reduced his anxiety and did not change his life or his personality. In writing about the effect of his psychoanalysis he said: \\"Looking over the process, I am somewhat in awe of the changes that have occurred.\\" He then goes on to explain in detail how the therapy helped him understand himself and change his life. A rare look into the \\"two-sided\\" process of psychoanalysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled!","review":"Don't be fooled by all the bells and whistles on this oven like I was. Sure it does a lot of stuff (or at least it says it does) but that doesn't mean it does them well. First, the unit is very lightweight (should have been clue #1). The knobs turn very loosely and are not well marked. The temperature knob is not marked in logical increments; you can't tell where 350 is to save your life! The timing knob is also not well mrked; you don't know if you are setting it for 8 minutes or 12 minutes. I only made toast 2 or 3 times and just had to stand and watch it until it was the way I wanted it and then take it out and shut the timer off. At least shutting the timer off does turn the oven off which I hear does not happen with some ovens and which is why I give it one star.

Grab this disc, it will quickly become a classic in your jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baritone Sax ever!","review":"This is one of my personal favorite CDs! Brignola's baritone is crisp and fluent. You hear a lot of guys on the bari that sound raspy, like their reed's drying up - not Nick! This guy can jump around registers and keep it tight and clean. L.A. Bound is better than other Brignola discs I have (i.e. Raincheck). Bill Watrous' presence on this album is also a pleaser.There's so much to like on this album, but I really like \\"In a Mellowtone,\\" where both Nick and Bill (trombone) take solo breaks without the rhythm - you would not believe how they keep the time and seem to be playing with a rhythm section. Beautiful stuff. You'll also enjoy Nick's soprano on Blue Bossa - amazing!This recording will not let you down!

You get the same fascinating computer animated and animatronic reconstructions, though in this case of course they are of early mammalian life, just a great show to watch and imagine what might have been. One thing I remember in particular was a shot in which a group of primitive proto-humans (ausralopithicines?) walk past the camera, the producers actually thought to include the detail of one of them kicking up a stone as they passed the camera. That stone flew right at the lens and cracked it, just like it would have done had this really been filmed back in the past. I love seeing that kind of detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good DVD for a low price","review":"I saw this piece on the discovery channel and was intrigued enough to want to have a copy.

The documentary style approach combined with excellent cgi was very enjoyable and educational to watch. My wife and I also enjoyed watching it with the kids so thats another plus. In addition, the shows are broken down into ~20 minutes segments so the dvd's can be watched in parts on multiple occasions.The only main concern I had was the scenes in each segment where the directors found it necessary to recreate scenes of each of the animals reproducing (I'm sure the cgi guys had fun making various prehistoric animals mount each other and am sure there's a very interesting blooper real out there somewhere...).

Tracks \\"The Garden of Souls\\" and \\"Broad Way Blues\\" are the stand outs, with Ornette and Dewey taking flight. My reservation at awarding a fifth star for this recording comes from the fact that this \\"second\\" pianoless quartet just doesn't quite measure up to the Atlantic group of the early 60s (Cherry, Haden and Higgins). Despite the fact that Garrsion and Elvin feed the group creative foundations to build upon, it just seems to me that Ornette is running out of new ideas.

However, his last 3 releases have been huge disappointments. Lacking all the pieces that made his first films so campy and enjoyable. His films starting with Leeches have gotten worse and worse. His latest is Speed Demon. His so called version of The Fast and the Furious with some horror, and barley clad men thrown in there. The plot is rediclulous. The acting atrocious. The charaters names are hysterical! Clutch, Wiper, all different parts of a car. The plot goes nowwhere, and the film goes along so slowly that you don't even care who the killer is. Let me tell you,there is a twist, but its pretty obvious who it is, if you can pay attention long enough. Fans of David Decocteau may find this film enjoyable, especially for the beefy men in their underwear, but they certainly won't make one of their favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?!","review":"It this a quadruple feature or a pentagle feature?

Unfortunately, some of the approaches and themes are repetitious, leading one to confuse many of the plots with each other (how many times must a man wake up and wonder where he is and why he has no memory of his past?). However, some stand-out pieces from JL Borges, LJ Davis, Philip K Dick, Julio Cortazar and Robert Sheckley demonstrate that a simple theme can lead to surprisingly disparate approaches.

In this piece, a gentle latin ballad, Carlos Ward and Don Pullen play with such depth of emotion that all the considerations of commercial success, entertainment or showmanship that usually plague musical performance seem suspended, leaving space for a vibrant communion between the leaving artists and the dead one, with such evidence that the listener also becomes a participant in that communion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed!","review":"While this is not one of Don Pullen's best efforts, it is filled with some very good music.

The album starts off in a burst of energy with great songs like 'All My Life,' 'Low,' 'Have It All' and 'Times Like These.' 'Low' is my personal favourite with the pounding drums and crashing guitars. The album slows down very much after these and, in all honesty, I think they should have replaced 'Overdrive' and 'Burn Away' with 'Normal' (b-side) and 'Walking A Line' (from the DVD).I still love the album though even though those two are the weakest songs I think the Foo Fighters have done. The other songs make up for it, like 'Disenchanted Lullaby,' 'Lonely As You' and 'Halo'.

Since it is currently my favorite song, i would definately recommend it to everyone who loves catchy lyrics and tunes!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1x1 is a winner","review":"This has to be the best Foo album since \\"The Colour and the Shape\\". I went out and bought it the first day it came out, put it in my discman and was completely blown away. This album lyrically is their best. Songs like \\"All my Life\\", \\"Have It All\\", and \\"Times like These\\" Rule! It's a different sound coming from The Foo's, much darker, and haunting. Alot of people have been panning this album because it's different. It may take a little longer to get used to but this is remarkable nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Foo Lover, not a Foo Fighter.","review":"Another great album from the Foos.

The lyrics aren't bad but not great. The songs, unfortunately sound alot alike. The guitar parts are often similar and repetetive, although the vocals almost make up for it. By far the best song on the album is \\"All My Life\\", its definitely the most original song on the whole album, and none others sound remotely like it. Its not a bad album, I just hoped for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.. but get lost sometimes","review":"I was expectin this cd to sound more like the older foo stuff.. just from stuff i heard on the internet or w/e.. it starts out great.. low has to be one of my fav tracks (as well as the last one).. there are some other stand out tracks on the cd, I like the demo of 'Tired of YOu' better(? = im guess it was a demo one, i downloaded it on the internt and its got some diff lyrics and stuff in t), i havent heard the 3rd foo cd, but, i dunno if id say this one is as good as the first, and colour and shape, but its a good cd no doubt bout it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foo Fighters","review":"Good overall CD, but needed more like All My Life because that is my favorite song on the CD. Some of the other songs are good, but my favorite is All My Life. But if you like the Foo Fighters I would really recommend you get it! I am a big fan so I like it alot. It also comes with a cool DVD, so if you like the Foo Fighters and like some of their slower songs than this album is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"one only one - good song","review":"All my life is a great song. It sets the precedent for the rest of the album, which unfortunately does not live up to an inkling of what the first song delivers. This album gets progressively worse as the songs go by. All of their other albums as albums are better than this one. I wanted to love it, but I don't. I still keep listening, hoping that the umpteenth time around will be better, but it isn't, no matter how many times I listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance man","review":"Dave Grohl just may be the closest thing Rock music has to a Renaissance man. 2 guitarists, a bass player, a drummer and a recording engineer and producer and a vocalist who can switch from delicate harmonies to fiery, hard-edged leads at the drop of a hat. One by One is one cd that deserves to be part of every collection. If I were stranded on a desert Island & I was only aloud to take 2 items they would be a cd player and The Foo Fighters One By One. and not the kind of little cd player with head phones but one with giant speakers, so if there where any one else on the island they would hear it. and know how good this cd really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - ish","review":"I am a more than dedicated Foo Fighters fan and even more so a Dave Grohl fan, but, this album did disapoint me. I knew it would be different to their old stuff but i thought it would be better than the others. I still stand by the fact that their first album - self titled, was the best of all time, closely followed by the colour and the shape but they will struggle to get any better. Don't get me wrong this doesn't mean that i am no longer a foos fan, i am just disappointed. Their are a few really good songs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grammy for the foo fighters...","review":"The foo fighters have just won a grammy for best hard rock album, does'nt that tell you somethings gone horribly wrong?Well if that does'nt then keep on listening to straight forward formula rock....sorry nothing new on this record. Dont get me wrong I absolutely love the foo's previous records its just that I think they could have done so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire the recording engineer!","review":"Whoever recorded this Foo Fighters album should get hung...or at least fired. The sound quality of this CD is HORRIBLE. Rarely have I heard as much dynamic compression and hard limiting as this album in my listening life. Just play the last minute of \\"Have It All\\". It sounds like your loudspeakers are blown with all the awful, overdriven distortion. This is not instrumental distortion by pedal effects, this is recording distortion where the \\"engineer\\" exceeded the limits of the recording medium...big difference. It's so bad I want to return the album for a refund. I don't have a defective disc either because I've tried other copies of the album on multiple stereos. They all sound equally bad.It's a real damn shame because the music is pretty good. The lack of fidelity makes this album difficult to listen to. Why isn't anybody else complaining?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This one seems to lack the passion displayed on The Colour and the Shape.

To be honest, this band is just subpar. They're not unique and they're nowhere close to being as good as Nirvana. They are way too bloody repetitive in they're songs, and they're songs just aren't... catchy. Or appreciable. I can't believe \\"All my Life\\" won the grammy for best hard rock song. I gave the album 2 stars because I like the song \\"Times like These\\" a lot. Otherwise, this is just more boring overrated [you fill in the blank]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music - But watch out at least some are PROTECTED!!","review":"This is a great album but don't expect to be able to pop it in your computer and play the tunes. I believe the copy I have is Copy-Protected, therefore my computer won't even recognize there is music on the CD. It thinks it is a data CD and can't find the audio tracks. I don't claim to know a whole lot about copy protection, but I do know that if this is going to become mainstream record companies need to label these albums as such. I'm sure it is frustrating for a lot of people that pay [$$] for this CD and can't even play it on their computers or rip MP3's. I know it frustrates me.

Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one Yet","review":"Musical taste is such a funny thing. Some albums are just so good that you see a negative review and you wonder if they are listening to the same music you are. I bought this album in spite of my diasppointment in the last Foo Fighters album (There is Nothing Left To Lose- but could anything follow Coulour and the Shape and not be a let down?) and had no real expectations for it. The first time through it hit me like a freight train. The driving melodies and raw emotion top even the genius of \\"the Colour and the Shape\\" in my opinion. From the opening chords of \\"All My Life\\" to the fading chorus of \\"Come Back\\" this album is simply fantastic. In my opinion this is one of the best rock albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 15 bucks","review":"It's hard to believe how a band can go from a musically brilliant album such as \\"There's Nothing Left to Lose\\" to such an aweful, uninspired, unimaginative, album like \\"One by One\\".I absolutely loved their last album. This album nearly makes me physically ill to listen to. Granted, All My Life is a decent song. But the rest of the album is garbage. Sorry Foo Fighters, but you've lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Foos fooled me.","review":"I thought this album might be full of rockers like the title song, but unfortunately this album goes limp after the first song. Buy the single and don't bother with the rest of the album, if you are wanting a pure rock album. If you want a folksy-rock album, then this is the one for ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Look...don't think I am one of those music fans who can't handle a band changing as it ages and its musical inspiration changes...I can handle that. However I can't handle an album, that is boring and uncreative. And when I say album, I mean the whole album. There really wasn't even one song that caught my attention. The music seems very monotonous; guitars just scratching out the same sound for like 4 straight minutes. One by One is a dissapointing leap backwards musically from their best album \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" which is full of diverse sounds and songs that grab your attention because they move in so many different directions. Sorry Dave. I love you but I don't love this album. Oh see you at Slim's Thursday. Don't hurt me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a big Foo Fighters fan - I was VERY disappointed in this bland offering. Absolutely no \\"edge\\" at all - it almosts sounds as if they are mocking the consumer by seeing how many times they can repeat the same song on one album and still have people buy it! I don't see the general \\"mellowing\\" of their sound as a move towards sophistication (as in the case of the latest Chilli Peppers album) at all. No thought has gone into the writing, and some of the songs are approaching the middle of the road / easy listening genre. Altogether not worth the money - I would certainly suggest you borrow it from a friend as opposed to buying it without hearing first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe these bogus reviews...","review":"This album is for die hard foofighter fans only!!! If you don't have \\"The colour and the shape\\" or \\"There is nothing left to lose\\" please buy those first, as they are both four star albums. Their first album is pretty good too. But this new one stinks...real bad. I have to laugh at these ridiculous reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment... Dave out of ideas","review":"Looks like Dave has so far run out of ideas for song composition that he has resorted to ripping off his session-mates in Queens of the Stone Age. Dave should know that he's grown too far (too fat, too happy, too rich) from his punk rock roots to try to go back there again. He should stick to the anthemic rock that he was writing in his previous two bands, and not try to go back to stoner punk, which really, is a pale imitation of the real thing. Been a long time since Scream, ain't no going home again.Looking back I can see that 12 or 13 people found this review unhelpful. Sorry about that, but then, I must be a foot or two older than most others that bought this album. Look, I like Dave, and I really wanted to like it, but honestly this is really a weak effort. If you're curious, check out the stuff that inspired this (Black Sabbath, Buzzcocks, Mission of Burma), and prepare to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aussie chaps making it big in the US...","review":"This 2002 Foo Fighter's album release 'One By One', was one of the best albums from 2002 and in Sydney this album got considerable playtime especially the songs 'All My Life', 'Times Like These' and 'Come Back'. Foo Fighter's incorporate a no thrills pure rock sound with grueling vocals that is not over the top and lyrics that are fun to listen to but also a little bit mystical in meaning. This group of men ranging in their mid 20's to early 30's hailed from east coast Australia and transferred themselves to the West Coast US and signed with a great promoter label and made it big.If you like Taxiride or Train you will like what the Foo Fighter's offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"Although I'm not that big of a foo fan however this new albumis not that good at all in my opinion.The only song's Ilike on here are All my life and Time's like these.I think the rest of the album is real boring musically.When I first heard All my life I loved the high energy rocksound of the song and it is fast and a real great song.The rest of the album made me fall alseep because it's tooslow and boring.I like the Foo fighter's but I mean whathappened here.All my life started off sounding like theold foo fighter's album's which was cool.Then it's likewait a minute is this the sound of the Foo fighter's wereally want to hear?

Big mistake! There isn't one song on this album I like, and it's boring.Never again will I ever buy a Foo Fighters album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smear's influence sorely missed","review":"Its clear from this poor poppy attempt that the Foo's have let the standards slip with this release. Chris Shifflet's contribution with the guitar lacks substance and his arrival after the departures of Pat Smear and Franz Stahl has weakened the Foo's. Stand out songs are Times Like These and Low but overall the album lacks the quality of previous releases. Dave Grohl is a genius without a doubt but he lacks that little something without Pat Smear - my advice, don't buy this album instead go for 'The colour and the Shape' - far superior!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy follow-up","review":"I think Foo Fighters' latest album One By One is a worthy follow-up to the award-winning There Is Nothing Left To Lose. \\"Overdrive\\" is my favorite song on the album, and \\"Halo\\" and \\"All My Life\\" tie at second. And an interesting thing about this album is that there are creative rhythms that blend in well with the vocals, especially on \\"Have It All\\".There really isn't anything wrong with this album -- okay, maybe the choruses to \\"Burn Away\\" and \\"Tired Of You\\" could have been more interesting. But those things don't stand in the way of this great album. One By One proves why Foo Fighters keep bringing home the Grammys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Magnificent","review":"This CD just flat out kicks.There are a lot of other good CDs I've recently purchased (Queens of the Stone Age, Saliva, 3 Doors Down, etc.) but honestly they pale in comparison to One by One.I haven't taken the CD out of the player in my car or home since the day I bought it, and probably won't for several months. You can just keep listening to it over and over and over and ... it's that good.Dave's voice is outstanding, the drums are top notch (of course) and the guitars are amazing. Every song on the CD is a 5 star song. If you haven't bought it yet, what are you reading this for? GO BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Dave's progressively gone downhill since the first record. Rather than try and write memorable \\"hooks,\\" he should just kick out the reverb, like the first record, and let it go. The \\"hooks\\" will come.

That was the case when I bought this one. I'm not saying that I regret buying it but it is in my stack of sellbacks. One by one is not a bad album, in fact its measures out to being ok. Ok in an ocean full of great music. There are a few songs that I like but overall it is nothing new. The humor that is in the other Foo Fighters albums got left behind in this one. If you're a big fan then pick it up. If you are just looking for a good \\"straight out\\" rock album, try Audioslave or Moistboyz. Don't be fooled by the name, any one of Moistboyz two albums or first ep puts this to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but too soft","review":"Foo fighters is a great group. The new single off the album-All My Life is a great hit! However the rest of the cd sounds nothing like it. The rest of the cd is softer more like their other singles \\"walking after you\\" and \\"my hero\\". The lyrics in this album are kind of weak (example: says chorus to many times). I give this 4 stars, becasue it come with a bonus dvd which is great and the album has some good songs on it I like. But if your hoping this cd will be loud like the first song on the track don't get your hopes up.all my life - 5/5 - BEST SONG ON ALBUMlow - 5/5 - good songhave it all - 5/5 - its just a great songtimes like these - 5/5 - new single?disenchanted lullaby - 3/5 - song goes on and on... way to long and to much repeatingtired of you - 3/5 - same as the song before.. to long!!!halo - 5/5 - would make another good single! and 1 of my fav. songsoverdrive - 5/5 - good song!burn away - 5/5 - another good songcome back - 5/5 - great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can name 11 reasons why to buy this CD","review":"Ok..

From the moment I put the cd in, I listened to every song and knew that this is a good catchy album. The music, like all foo fighter albums, starts going one way and when you think its going to take a predictible corner, they take a different turn which always keeps it surprising.

I was given this wonderfully illustrated book as a liitle child and I was immediately surrounded by its magic. It is originally written in Swedish but for me a Finnish version is the true one - making such a big impact on me. Reason is clear: in Finnish language there is not separate words like she and he, and Toffle was mistaken as a woman searching for another woman by me already as a child. Actually the book has been dedicated to another woman, life companion of Tove Jansson, so my interpretation is not far from the truth. I would say that this book is a must in every lesbian's book shelf. It is the present I give to everybody I love anythere in the world.

This is the only film Burt Lancaster directed and he knew when to quit. The writing is stiff, and the plot is completely pieced together from every imaginable \\"Go West\\" movie cliche. Burt also sings a couple of songs and uses genuine frontier Kentuckian colloquialisms throughout the movie. His character also runs the gamut from dumb woodsman to suddenly smart gambler. There is a fantastic fight scene where Walter Matheau is whipping an unarmed Lancaster towards the end of the movie. It's obvious by the way Matheau's flailing around that he didn't know how to use a whip. Thankfully generous amounts of whipcracking sound effects were used to cover this. DVD transfer is poor with bleeding colors. Fuzzy at times though in widescreen. Not to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it matters is the journey !","review":"Burt Lancaster got to build a well rounded film plenty of hearted spirit (in his double role as star and director) through a simple but poignant story about a man and his son trying to find in Texas a new life. But in the meantime they will have to experience the expected clash between their ways of living and the civilization.The duel between Lancaster and Mathau (the ace of the whip), the stare of stars in the middle of the night and the rite of initiation at the moment his son plays the horn, becoming a man (whose analogy with Sigmund is more than obvious), are a treat.A heartfelt Western, a delight for all the family to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This album really rocks!

I pick it up way more often than the official manual and have not made a mistake yet in my formatting when I used it. I have used it for every class so far and plan to continue using it through the writing of my dissertation. It is easy to find what you need and even has a sample paper at the end for reference.

It is small and compact, which makes it great when riding public transportation or sitting somewhere without a computer and working on homework or a job presentation. Although small and compact it includes alot of information including a sample paper to see how it all ties in. It covers basic information but not the smaller less used information so it may leave a question or two that is more tehnical.

Nothing on Harlem River, Port Morris, Casanova, Hunts Point, Westchester Ave, Kingsbridge Road stations. If you plan on doing a book on such a subject do it the correct way and have photos of EVERY station not just the Westchester stations that have been printed and reprinted in various publications more times then I care to remember. New unseen photos PLEASE not train regurgitated photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and Inspiring","review":"My favorite part of this book is how local and realistic it is. I felt like I could actually use the tips if I ever needed to. The shelters were built in terrain and out of \\"supplies\\" that I'm familiar with. I, also, love the little projects. They're fun, small projects that would be a great way to introduce kids to nature (like grass doll making). All of this was presented in a fun, interesting way. The author did a great job of injecting a little humor and real life stories into the book that made it much more interesting to read than a lot of survival books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peer review","review":"As a survival instructor and naturalist for one of the largest state parks in the US (420 square miles) I was very impressed by PARTICIPATING IN NATURE. Elpel has some wonderful insights not only into primitive technologies, but also on people's roles in ecosystems, the human race's responsibility for our environment, and applications of primitive technologies in current times. This is more than an anthropological review or a crafts book. Elpel shares personal insights that inspire others to live with nature.The title says it all. Elpel encourages the reader to participate in nature, to be at home in natural surroundings and to take an active and responsible role. While most of my courses are taught in deserts in the US, Mexico, and Australia, the philosophy of this book, using the Northern Rockies as a large part of its setting, is the same. As a published author on wilderness survival, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very detailed","review":"This book is best described as an overview. It lacks detail and covers too many subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Masonic Book","review":"Beware! This is an anti-Masonic book and should not be looked upon as a book to provide actual facts concerning Freemasonry. This book is recommended only if one wishes to see what the anti-Masons are saying about Freemasonry.For more balanced and factual aoounts of the nature of Freemasonry, read: 'Is it True what they Say about Freemasonry?' by Arturo de Hoyos & S. Brent Morris, 'Masonic Questions and Answers' by Paul M. Bessel & 'A Pilgrim's Path: Freemasonry and the Religious Right' by John J. Robinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"Latino Crossings is an eye-opening study at a propitious time. The book helps dismantle generalizations about the \\"latino\\" population in the US, while also bringing the question of citizenship into a new light at a time of heated public debate on the immigration issue. The authors, in an ethnographic study in Chicago, look at issues of \\"legality\\" and social tensions between the Mexican and Puerto Rican populations there. For those already versed in such dynamics, the theoretical approach through the racialization lens offers new ways of deconstructing the institutional racism in the United States. Finally, for beginners like me, the introduction juxtaposes the migration of Mexican and Puerto Ricans into US society in an interesting way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asthma","review":"I relied on this book when my son was a toddler (1984). A friend's son was recently diagnosed, so I bought this revised edition for her. It is a \\"bible\\" for any parent to educate themselves about asthma. It also contains information about real situations that other parents have experienced. Very valuable information! A must for every parent of an asthmatic child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthrology view of Us","review":"I like the writings of Desmond Morris because he takes the discipline of a scientist and applies it to looking at us. He is as objective with this lens as he would be looking at other mammals. This approach cuts through some of a subjective opinions and cherished ideas about who we are and how we function. Yet at the same time, he is honoring of what we are and points to things that can help us relate to each other more healthily and more naturally. This book is no exception. My favorite of his is PEOPLE WATCHING which seems to summarize much of what he says in other books and also shows a lot with pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate Behavior","review":"I also enjoy reading books by Desmond Morris. This book was very interesting and provided several unexpected insights into animal testing and into child rearing. It is easy to read but a little dry at times. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy read for anyone wanting to find balance and value","review":"If \\"A Purpose Driven Life\\" was too hard or just not what you were looking for, try \\"LifeFocus\\" by Jerry Foster. LifeFocus could be a companion to \\"A Purpose Driven Life\\". It sets forth a valued lifestyle and describes a means of reaching such a purposeful life. While Mr. Foster writes from a Christian perspective, non-believers should still find it worthwhile.There is a lot to learn from this book as well as a lot of changes that I have started to make in my own life because of this book.A Sincere thanks goes to Jerry Foster for putting his own LifeFocus into print form."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"This book was awesome.

As an avid reader, I like to consider myself capable of determining the quality of reading material. I can easily say that this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only positive quality this book posesses is the air of suspense it relays to the reader. The novel contained no obvious theme, and definately no underlying themes. The use of any researched vocabulary was non-existant, and the characters were one dimensional and predictable. The book was filled with cliche phrases like \\"Dear God Priscilla, can't you see that I love you?\\". I will not recommend this book to anyone with a need for quality writing because you will be thoroughly dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Ended Ever","review":"This is the first book of Mary Higgins Clark I have read.

I did wonder about the actual case the idea came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the children?","review":"This is one of Mary Higgins Clark's best books ever. The best part of this book was the suspense she keeps you in. Where she flips from different characters and different parts of the story makes and keeps the book interesting. The story of a mother who is charged of killing her first two children and seven years later has to relive it with her new family and kids. The mystery throughout the book is to know who's doing what and what is going on in different places, which is terrific. The different characters that were brought in made this story great. Clark describes everything so well; you can picture yourself there trying to solve the mystery with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of higgins","review":"I have read all of her books and I found this \\"too light\\", without much suspense and surprises.Not recommendable at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Higgins Clark I read, and I still love it!","review":"This is such an excellent mystery!

The world thinks she escaped justice when the trial over her 2 murdered kids is thrown out because of mistrial, and a key witness running off. It happened on her birthday. She rebuilt her life, has 2 more little kids, and they go missing. This proves she's a monster, right? Things like this just don't happen twice without direct reason. Did she do it?

This book has twists, and I was shocked at what really happended and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each turn of a page is filled with more suspense and mystery","review":"This story deserves five stars. A great book for anyone who likes mystery and suspense. Mary Higgins Clark has really outdone herself in this book. She has written an outstanding book about a woman named Nacy Harmon who leaves her marriage to start a new life after her two children are murdered. Soon Nacy realizes the same scenario is happening all over again just like before. A great book that makes you want to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have read ALL of MHC's books. This is an extemely good one!!!!

This book was very exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat. I was very pleased with this book and intend to read more by this author. I liked how MHC tied the lives of Nancy Harmon together, since she has had two totally different lives. The old one comes back to haunt her. It really makes you wonder. Anyway, I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This book was well written in that the dialogue was good and the descriptions were not too long and easy to visualize. It was very predictable, a couple of chapters into the book I already knew where the children were and with who. Also it was a very unsurprising ending. When she describes the house the children are going to be in, you can easily figure out where the climax of the book is going to take place and what will happen there. Also it was very annoying how she made some characters out to be more than they needed to be, for example Bernie Mills. We didn't need to hear about his family and how he wanted to tell his wife all about what was going on. This definitely is not Mary Higgins Clark's best book. It would only seem interesting and surprising to a pre teen kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read.","review":"This was my first MHC book and possibly my last. I found the characters one dimensional, the \\"mystery\\" transparent, and the plot mediocore. I was interested enough to read the entire book, but was disappointed by the end. I never felt like I got to know anyone. I *may* try one more MHC book, but I really hope it is several times better than this clunker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"One word can describe this story, \\"Excellent.\\" It was suspensful and unique from the first to the last page. The author has a unique writing style that intrigues me to search for more of her stories. This particular story will make you think from beginning to end... and I bet you'll be surprised at the conclusion! The emotions are high, and the storyline is terribly frightening... even the name of the book is downright scary!!! Read this one... you'll be glad you did!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful","review":"Where are the Children is a wonderful suspenseful book that I am sure you will enjoy.

I suggest you try reading them to."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK","review":"This book was very intriguing and suspenseful. The whole idea of the mother getting blamed for the murders of her 4 children is classic. Although in the beginning it is very slow and hard to get into it sures comes out with a splended ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"How wonderful is the author?","review":"Mary Higgins Clark is starting to become one of my very favorite authors. Her books are very well written with excellent characters and believable plots. \\"Where Are The Children\\" is no exception. The kidnapping plot and the life of Nancy Eldredge are very exciting. What people don't understand about Mary Higgins Clark is that her books don't end abruptly, she just smacks you right in the face with the plot and the climax right away. I love suspense and her style is superb. I would recommend \\"Where Are The Children\\" to anyone who enjoys a good read and doesn't like drawn out and over descriptive suspense. A couple of more of my favorites are \\"A Cry In The Night\\" and \\"All Around The Town\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Suspenseful throughout, but just try putting this book down the at the last 100 pages!This is my first MHC book; looking forward to reading her many others.

Although this is the first book that I have read of hers, I totally agree with the rumors that I heard. Where Are The Children is an extremely enjoyable thriller. There wasn't one moment that I wasn't deeply focused in the mystery. The irony of the plot is amazing; the fact that Nancy Harmon's two children get kidnapped and killed once, and then her new two children get kidnapped is mind blowing. The irony also adds to the suspense because throughout the whole book you wonder if the same thing is going to happen to her new children, and you don't find out until the end; and believe me you'll want to finish the book even if you're not interested in it just to see the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a very shallow read.....","review":"Let's make it simple: 290 pages of large font as opposed to 339 pages of small font in Moonlight Becomes you. \\"Where are the Children\\" just didn't have the same punch that MHC has had in her previous books. The story line was extremely shallow. I had the villian picked out by the third chapter and had already decided that Nancy must have been drugged during her first marriage. I love MHC's books but this is one that I would not recommend. \\"Remember Me\\" is still my MOST FAVORITE of her books. Give that one a try before wasting money on \\"Where are the Children\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the first programming book I have read. At every stage of the book it has clearly explained the current topic and the chapters flow nicely together. The author seems to have been able to get into the mind of the beginning C programmer, and answers all those nagging questions. Every question the book raises for me is answered. I am really enjoying this book, I like its style and approach, and best of all it is actually teaching me something. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!","review":"It kept me guessing up to the final chapter!I was almost late to work because I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Snorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre","review":"boring boring and boring. unlikable,unrealistic characters, boring plot. please, this book appears to be written to satisfy her publisher's quota and not to satisfy fans. her excruciating moral angonizing of most of her characters in all of her books makes me want to scream. NO ONE is so acutely aware of others flaws and failings, or of their own as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me Reading","review":"I'm on an Anne Perry kick lately and Farrier's Lane was just the ticket to keep me up reading. Police Detective Thomas Pitt is on a gruesome murder case and his wife Charlotte, as usual, has to take part in helping to solve the case, often against her husband's wishes. But this old murder and new murder does some how involve her mother's love interest. It is set in London in 1889 with the first murder (gruesome) still unsolved. The murderer was hidden enough to keep me reading one chapter after another. I enjoyed the mystery and all the frills about society and Pitt's household happenings. The novel has some violent and (light) sexual descriptions. Ms. Perry's use of the cockney can be a bit difficult to read. All in all, I found it a good story of Ms. Perry's Pitt novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful CD player I can take it anywhere. It has good bass so I can here it clearly and the head phones block out any other noises I don't want to hear. It never goes on and off when it has full power because I tap the cover. It is also so easy to figure out. It's the best CD player I've ever had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Please","review":"There's not too much to comment on, so I will keep this short and sweet. I gave it 4 stars because I thought the headphones were very ackward and uncomfortable, otherwise, i think this is a great walkman. 2 Batteries last for 24 hours in this little cool looking machine, and the sound is really good. I recommend purchasing it, but just make sure you alread have headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made the mistake of buying this...","review":"I bought this when it first came out and was extremely satisfied with it for the first six months. The last five months were terrible. My player would skip for no reason and I figured it was due to my cd's. These last two months (and I'm still under warranty) my player's antiskip does not work at all and it can not play past the first half of my cd. The really sad part is that I have only dropped it twice and that was during my first month of ownership, so my personal use was not the cause of the problems with this player.Here's the truly frustrating part. I registered my player with Panasonic and I misplaced my receipt. Because of this misplacement, I can not repair it under warranty, even though my player has it's birthdate stamped in it (november, 2000)! Goes to show you customer service for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all comfortable","review":"The earphones are totally uncomfortable. It skips sometimes on a slight move and complicated to use. I don't jog with it.....I meditate with it..Had it been easier to return..I would have. But for now..I'll have to wait for it to die to get my money's worth. Watch the thing might last forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Another","review":"I am very disappointed in this CD player. Maximum volume on the unit is MUCH too low and the construction of this player is not as sturdy as the description would have you believe. This item is very over-priced and NOT worth it, I would strongly advise another choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Opera I've ever seen","review":"If you are looking for the Opera buffa from Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710-1736), with beautiful musics, excellent singers, fantastic setting and outfit and a lot of emotion and fun, you must buy Serva Padrona right now!It?s the best I've ever seen in my entire life!Carla Camurati is a genius!She is one of the best movie directors we know in Brazil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody's Mood review","review":"Wonderful jazz rendition. If you never heard of him, take a chance. Some very interesting tracks on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Very detailed and informative, a fantastic book for anyone who's interested in the West and the historical water challenges there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Primer on Political Maneuvering","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Even though this is about water policy, the stories told by Reisner should be required reading for anyone who wants to go into business or politics. He does an incredible job of portraying how things actually get decided on and done. This is fascinating reading, really enjoyable, and it teaches us how politics in this country is really works. It is very well-written; it is as enjoyable to read as any fiction, yet the author does not compromise the integrity of the facts. He delivers a lot of heavy and disturbing material very professionally.Some might consider Reisner's concerns over water issues to be alarmist. I suppose we will find out about that aspect in the future. Even if his concerns over water issues turn out to be far off base, there is still more than enough worthwhile material here for thorough study of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your tax dollars at work","review":"Interesting and informative. There may be some political bias here but the basic information is right on. You ended up asking 'Why am I subsidizing millionaire growers like the heirs of the Tribune fortune with my tax dollars?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long on Facts And Words","review":"The book is a great education of water development. The stories of human mismanagement, corruption and arrogance are stunning. However, better writing and less minute detail, especially in the middle of the book, would have helped its readability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarming, facinating, a page turner","review":"This is a marvelous book with so much history and insight about the true gold of the west, water. I am on my second read through . This time I am highlighting the phrases and terms used that make the corners of my mouth turn skywards. How this book can be witty, fun, and yet so factual is one of its charms. Read it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The continuing fallout of water wars and dam building","review":"This is the definitive history of water in the American West. A must read for any Californian, this tale of how America brought civilization to the desert is a fascinating look at political power, gargantuan engineering projects, and hubris. The reality is that the 9 million residents of Los Angeles County need to get water from somewhere. Cadillac Desert tells you how it gets there and what price is still being paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific - and terrifically scary - history","review":"I picked up Marc Reisner's books after moving to CA recently from what I now realize is blissfully non-seismic and adequately-watered New England... This is a great history of man getting the (temporary) best of nature and whistling past the dam. The chapter on Bureau of Reclamation chief Floyd Dominy is worth the price alone: he is the type of headstrong, puritanical warrior (no exaggeration there) that American has produced in droves, yet he is virtually unknown now. The character profiles of John Wesley Powell and others are equally as good. I only wish that other historians had the sense of humor and irony that Reisner employs so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book with Historical Information about the Damming or the West and Two Disfunctional Government Departments","review":"I reorder this book after not being able to find my first copy. The author has put so much information in CD that it is overwhelming. The battle between the Corp of Engineers and BLM is classic intergovermental department infighting. The amount of taxpayer dollars wasted is astromical and gives the reader some insite about the current state of our government's finances. There is a lot of weather information that will challenge the \\"global warming crowd's\\" short term, myopic view. All of the dams and water diversion projects were a classic transfer of weath. The one suprise was how the damming of the Columbia River was the reason the United States won the war. You need to buy and read the book to find out why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dam You!","review":"This is a classic and I was very excited to read this prior to finishing up my recent book because it is just loaded with those history-buff things that were meant to be buried with time itself. From dams to the water in Las Vegas, you will never look at the Army Corps of Engineers and the many who partook in these very scandalous acts the same way ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping & easily readable story of the West's water","review":"I have been interested in the water supply of the West since moving to California as a young adult and spotting the California aquaducts. I couldn't put this book down once I started it. It is a wonderful story of investigative journalism of the quest for the West's most important resource - water.You will gain an understanding of the rivalry between the two government bureaucracies, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For the rest of your life, the tour of every dam you pass in the U.S. will become the highlight of your trip. You will look at water differently for the rest of your life.I can't over emphasize how readable, absorbing and alarming this book is. It is a must read for anyone curious about the water supply of the American West. I was so sad for the book to end that I bought the four tape video series produced by San Jose Public Television (for sale on Amazon) and watched the story again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not totally accurate","review":"While the book is an interesting book and reads quickly, by no means is this a completely accurate book. In the section on the Owens Valley where I live, the author alludes to a lack of any more ranches here since L.A. took the water. There are over 100 cattle brands still registered in the valley. There is also an issue with drilling in the Bishop Cone (Bishop Creek delta) which is not accurate. No one remembers Reisner even coming to the valley to research the book. While the book is very readable and excellent overall, do not use this book as a reference in college papers. You could use it as a jumping off point to do further research with better information. A better book is \\"Water and Power\\" by William Karll although a little denser. The documentary \\"Cadillac Desert\\" is outstanding, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the West running out of water? If so, here's why, and what it means","review":"Marc Reisner explains just how the West is in danger of running dry in the not-so-distant future.He not only looks at the Chinatown shenanigans of Los Angeles, but the \\"socialist\\" conservative farmers of the West, greedily and hypocritically guzzling federally-dammed irrigation water at 10 cents on the dollar.And, Reisner's West includes the High Plains. Although not federall subsidized, of course, the water of the Ogallala Aquifer is being drawn down much quicker than the basin formed.Reisner wrote the original edition in 1986, before global warmning concerns were on the radar screen. They still weren't high in 1993, the date of publication of his second edition.His untimely death prevented a much needed third edition which would take that into account. However, this is an invalable resources just as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the west was (really) won","review":"Beautifully written, thoroughly researched, and highly enlightening, Cadillac Desert is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. I knew practically nothing about the subject of western settlement and water resources when I first picked up this book, but I feel now like I have a very good grasp on both issues. Reisner does a spectacular job of explaining the forces behind western settlement and the political and natural issues that made the west what it is today. I only wish there were a more updated version so I could learn how things have progressed in the last 20 or so years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crepe Cookery","review":"This is the cookbook I learned how to make crepes from...there are so many great recipes, my favorite being the salmon crepes...easy, tasty and unusual! A great party dish! I really like all of Mable Hoffman's Cookbooks...but this was my favorite! I lost it and am so happy to find it here so I can order it and make the recipe again! I don't have any other copies of this recipe...so it's a G-d send!~Marilyn Sultar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunday in the Park....with Maurice","review":"Everyone is familiar with the French Impressionists, but the American Impressionists added formidable contributions to this genre. Inspired by French Impressionism, yet unmistakably American and bold, Maurice Prendergast's park scenes are lively and idiosyncratic, yet evoke the times and flavors of 19th Century Boston and New York.The Public Garden watercolors in particular are worth study. Watercolors are exhibited on tour only infrequently, as the paper and pigments are so sensitive to light. So enjoy seeing an retrospective at home with this book. A worthwhile reference if you love watercolor and Impressionism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I ordered a steel mailbox because of its strength, but when it arrived I discovered that all of the attachments, such as the flag and the door catch were plastic. There is no way that these will hold up under the heat of the sun and the wind. Also, the door catch immediately fell off after sticking it on. If this is an attempt to save manufacturing money, it was a poor call. I immediately returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to replace plastic handle with metal","review":"plastic closure is easily broken and there is no replacement available.

The product itself is very thin sheet metal that is not well fastened at the seams. while attaching to the base the outer covering seperated from the bottom.

In short order, the door would not stay closed. Then it bent in half. I am going to be forced to replace a mailbox that should have lasted many more years. I have never replaced a mailbox because it fell apart - until now. How long should one last? I think twenty years is a reasonable expectation.

There is no indication on the box or elsewhere that it is galvanized. In fact, it is a grey painted steel and will likely rust out as quickly as its painted predecessor did.

There is literally a ST200000 label slapped over the ST200B00 label on the box. It is about an inch shorter than the listed dimensions, and gray, not silver. The first picture is a totally different product. It comes in a box titled \\"Stanley Mailbox\\" and the size listed is \\"extra large\\". The dimensions listed on the box are: 14.75\\" H x 11.5\\" W x 24.5\\" L.

After 37 years, it still sounds fresh, and that itself is an accomplishment. The \\"big hit\\" on the release is, of course, \\"Radar Love,\\" but every selection is a tour de force of progressive rock. The arrangements are invigorating, the solos are original, the beat is hypnotic throughout, and you will want to hear these songs over and over again. Folks from my generation (Boomer) already know about Golden Earring and \\"Moontan,\\" but kids who are looking for the best of retro need to snatch one of these while you can. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only a desert island disc, but I'd return to retrieve it","review":"That's right, if I were rescued from the desert island and learned I'd left this behind, I'd ask to have the boat turned around!The line-up is simple: a quartet of one drummer, a bass, guitar, and singer who doubles on reeds (flute most obviously but also some sax). The songs are also simple, but the arrangements keep your interest.The individual performances are fine, and while all that passes for improvisation may not truly have been made up on the spot, it is all very enjoyable.This is a great disc, and while MCA was licensing recordings for the Who to Mobile High Fidelity for the gold disc treatment, it always baffled me that this one never received it. The copies available today, have not, unfortunately, been remastered using any of the late-90's technology which is available - - this is pretty much the same mastering you could have bought 15 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Simply put this is a \\"Classic\\"!

And when it comes down to it, the unstable wife is at least grounded enough to realize that her husband is the best thing she has going, and so she stands by him when it counts. This could have been a really good movie.But . . . ugh . . . this movie is one that wants to make you suffer. Jessica Lange's character is so grossly exaggerated that I was disgusted watching her: she is painfully immature, painfully self-absorbed, and painfully over-sexualized. Her character literally turned my stomach.Tommy Lee Jones's acting is excellent as always, and his character is profoundly appealing, but I spent the whole movie wishing he wasn't wasted on such a pathetic woman.Took ages for me to shake this one out of my system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Sky","review":"This is an older movie.

It is so padded with overwrought military and sports analogies that parts of it aren't so much about building relationships with women, but more about an old self-aggrandizing military man telling stories.

The manual devotes about half of its pages to topics the average user will already know, such as standard maintenance instructions, but fails to provide anything vehicle specific. The detailed engine rebuild procedures are useful if you need them, but given the longevity of modern automotive engines this data could probably have been better published elsewhere and replaced in this manual with more information on common failures.

The story reminded me a lot of \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" in that it was written from a grown child's perspective for the most part and it was an old fashioned love story unlike the predictable garbage usually written today. I think it stood out even more now because of the war going on and the fact that many of us are sending our loved ones away as the main character in this book had to do. Read it on rainy day with a box of tissues and a cup of tea and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Valentine","review":"This book is a must read for us hopeless romantics. It is a touching book about two people who share a lasting love for a half a century, Pratt does a stupendous job of bringing the characters Neil and Caroline to life and he shows us what true love is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I appreciate a good love story, but this one misses the mark","review":"I consider the books I buy as gifts to myself, and I relish the time I spend in reading one. The Last Valentine was a major disappointment, and a waste of my time and my money. Aside from being totally predictable, the author seems to underestimate the intelligence of his readers, and feels the need to explain details that are obvious to most of us. That, plus the incessant use of cliche after cliche, made this read boring for me. You could easily tell what was going to happen on the next page, and the next, and the next. If I can't learn something from a book, I at least want to be entertained. This did neither for me. I hope the author doesn't quit his day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, very poorly written","review":"Went to the trouble of reserving this book at the library. What a waste of time. The writer is clearly overly emotionally tied to the subject maerial. His maudlin writing badly needed an expert editor -- the story line rambled from page to page, there were discontinuities in the story, and none of the characters was compelling. The word Love is grossly overused, almost as if the writer thought that using it on each page was all it takes to engage the reader. I suspect that the writer had enough money to get this published independently or it might not have gotten published at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak characters and so-so writing","review":"The character development is not deep enough. We are given just a glimpse into what Neil and Caroline's time together was like. It is hard to sympathize much with either of them because we do not really know much about them as a couple.A great story idea that was not taken to a deep enough level. Read it for a quick love story, but it is definitely not Bridges of Madison County."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and poorly written","review":"I ordered this book expecting to be surprised and moved emotionally. I was neither. As an English teacher, I found the writing to be below the quality I would have expected. However, perhaps the part that really annoyed me was the religious overtones. I would not have objected, had I known that in advance. I would not, and do not buy books by certain publishers or those whose beliefs I do not share. The ending was very predictable. I knew what was going to happen very early on in the book and that is exactly what happened. I found it trite and sappy.

When one thinks of the power of the internet today, and that the writer could not have \\"known\\" in advance (in 1933 a computer was still a box of gears) that the computer would advance as far as it did, let alone, that it would be \\"connected\\" it makes one stop and think how far ranging some of our writers in the past really were."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Octopus","review":"The Octopus: A Story of California painted a picture of the individuals who were major players in developing the railroads.

The characters are so real and the manner in which they are described brings them to full life. Upon the death of the characters, the characters that the reader has grown to love, the reader mourns for them. They make the reader laugh and they inspire love and hatred. The truth brought about by The Octopus, that of the ultimate good, dwarfs the adjunct, impersonal truths carried on by some other literary \\"masterpieces\\". For such an unknown masterpiece, this one is a pearl. The writing is masterful and the story is golden. While it may seem that a story about the railroad in Old California may be tiring, Norris captures the same Escapist qualities that authurs such as J.R.R. Tolkien are recongnized for(Tolkien is fantasy, Norris is reality). The naturalist sting of the novel does not at all take away, but butresses the novel. The Octopus, a masterpiece, simply brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"The people vs. the system in the early days of the railroad","review":"In his most ambitious work, turn-of-the-century novelist Norris tackles the railroad in this unflinching view of how the industrial revolution pushed the common man to the side in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Violent naturalism the way it's supposed to be: disturbing yet beautifully rendered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Populist Struggle A Century Ago","review":"Frank Norris' The Octopus is a riveting, densely-written epic tale of the struggle of ranchers and workers to wrest control of their land and their lives away from the stranglehold of the Pacific and South Western Railroad. As a cautionary tale of the wages of untrammeled monopoly capitalism, it should be required reading for all first-year business school students and anyone else who believes in free markets. The glimpses it provides into gilded-age corporate obeisance to growth, as though it were an elemental Force that was a mysterious end in itself, may illuminate beliefs that still hold sway today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black DVD Rack","review":"Sleek, sturdy, modern and attractive.

It's the characters, not so much the technical stuff that that kept me reading (although the facts seem to be well researched). It's not often I plow all the way through a novel (I tend to get bored easily), but I went cover to cover rather quickly with this one.

I would like to know what the future has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In a word, disappointing. Overall, A Trial by Jury was a trial to read. It was slow moving and over written. The author spent too much time patting himself on the back. If he spent more time getting to know his fellow jurors instead of judging them, the book would have had some added dimension. This reader walked away thinking that Mr. Burnett thinks quite a bit about him and not much about those he feels are beneath him. Not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aargh!! Keep academics off your jury","review":"This book is painfully overwritten and the greatest blessing is its short length.As a trial attorney I give it two stars because it does cover an interesting topic and a murder that is typical in its quirkiness.But the story could have been told much more compellingly if the author had taken time after the trial (or during deliberations for that matter) to find out his fellow jurors true thoughts on the matter. As it turns out the book portrays the verdict as somewhat a trial by a judge .. with Judge D. Graham Burnette presiding.For those who are fans of the courtroom drama or true crime novels, this is not your flavor. More autobigraphical and introspective than insightful into discovering the truth of the crime or what the other jurors really thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trial to Read","review":"I understand the impact that serving on a jury has on an individual. My experience as a juror on a homicide trial led to my desire to go to law school. However, you can rely on all of the other negative reviews on this book; Mr. Burnett is a self-important, self-involved bore who fancies himself to be superior to his fellow jurors, when in reality he has no clue as to how to approach the legal decision-making process. Many of my fellow jurors came from humble backgrounds and had more common sense and intelligence by accident than Mr. Burnett has accumulated from his years of living in academia. Skip this book! You have better things to do with your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book","review":"I have recently, for some reason, become very interested in the legal system and its vicissitudes. 'A Trial by Jury' is a well-written book, of that there is no doubt. I will agree with the criticism directed against the author's overly pedantic view of things but the reader is given enough warning of this by the author himself in the first few pages. I especially thought his 'apples, blood oranges and almonds' bit was a little too bewildering for my tastes. All this however, should not stand in the way of digesting this work as it is a very credible point-of-view of the inner workings of a trial by jury (in New York, anyway). The reader will be particularly impressed by the well-reasoned and similarly well-stated conclusion about the awesome power of the state as it goes about the business of keeping it's citizens in check. A very good read and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review by the lawyer on the case","review":"As the defense attorney who actually tried the case described in this book, I think this book is valuable just to see how Manhattan juries consider and decide criminal cases. As my wife, a writer, said when the book first came out, \\" He wrote the book, so he got to make himself the hero.\\" You would think from reading the book that all the evidence fell from the sky and that I played no part in presenting the defense. An interesting read if you read it only to learn how juries work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insight-Well Written","review":"Okay, so here is a book about a very real practical subject written by an academic. But it can work. Burnett doesn't have much credibility. He is a holier than thou, pretentious snot. But he has succeeded in capturing an enigma not many people have seen. He has captured the REAL issue of the criminal justice system during his stint as a juror in a murder trial.Flash by Burnett's snide remarks about his peers [remember they ARE peers] and his digs about how he even eats better than the others and listen to his discussion of law vs. justice. It is honest, in depth and well layed out. If you are involved in the criminal justice system in any way or are interested in some of the frustrations of those who are involved in it try reading this book. It is worthwhile. And even if you hate it, it's pretty short so the pain won't last long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I wanted to learn more about how juries deliberate. I did learn a little. Unfortunately, the little I learned was buried under TONS AND TONS OF PRETENTIOUS, PEDANTIC GARBAGE!!!! The author obviously has an extremely high opinion of himself that I don't share.I trudged along through the author's self-serving style because I would learn something every now and then. However, it took too much effort, for very little payoff.Even the author's photo on the book jacket was pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in poor jury selection","review":"Mr. Burnett waxes eloquent as to his intellectual prowess, devastating insights, etc. But as he admits, he made up his mind not to vote for conviction before any real deliberations began. In my view, therefore, he \\"failed to deliberate\\" and violated his first and most important duty as a juror.As a trial lawyer, this sort of self important doofus is exactly what we seek to exclude from jury panels.The judge had it right at the end; a jury's service is valuable, but is by no means as rigorous, dangerous or important as that of many others in this society. Mr. Burnett felt that being cooped up on a jury for a few weeks merited a book -- he should grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Book","review":"This is a terrible book by an atrocious author. The author is not very likable; at the start he has made up his mind about the case, so he makes fun of the other jurors for being stupid, especially the ones that don't support his position. His arrogance comes through easily, making long winded speeches to his fellow jurors and \\"putting them in their place\\" when they say things he doesn't like (despite his being younger than most of them).He says early on that it was his goal to \\"hang the jury,\\" and the only rationale he gives for that is that his whole experience in life has been academia, where the discussion essentially never ends, and he just doesn't have it in him to make such a final decision. How odd!There are no real insights into the criminal justice process, just lots of very high-brow language that sounds almost put-on. Also, he exerpts from his diary at one point--showing that even in his personal life, this fellow can only write pretensiously.Avoid this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay in school","review":"The first part of the book it interesting, as the author chronicles the details of a murder, from the incident to the court case. However, when he takes over in a first person narrative, it's unbearable. He's a pompous, snobbish, know-it-all who has nothing but disdain for his fellow jurors. I disliked his attitude so much I didn't even want the book in my house. I gave it to the public library as soon as I finished it. A classic full-of-himself academic, I feel sorry for anyone who has to have him as a professor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"The concept of the book is appealing--an educated insider reveals the secret world of jury deliberations. The problem is that the author is a pompous academic. The book is written in extremely cumbersome prose that fails to appeal to the average reader. The author goes to great lengths to show us how smart he is but the ivy league vocabulary comes across as pretentiousness. I will not get into to specifics but the author also employs flawed logic in his characterization of the deliberation process. The author had the opportunity to write an insightful and meaningful piece but he let his ego get in the way of good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Place to Start","review":"I love this album. I love what he does with Bemsha Swing and the other works on the recording, pushing the tonal and rhythmic elements to their limits.

The heads are clean; the tape was new (and the rest of the tapes in the batch are fine, so I don't think it was the tape). What I think, ultimately, is that this is a cheap recorder made in China where (judging from the other reviews and my own experience) is good....when it works. But obviously, the durability and reliability are questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonfunctioning cassette recorder","review":"When I found this cassette recorder on Amazon.com, I was delighted. I have a lot of music cassettes I like to listen to, and I tape my answering machine messages when I listen to them because my telephone answering machine deletes messages after one play-back. But when I took this cassette recorder out of its box, plugged it into a surge protector, and pushed \\"record,\\" the cassette reel didn't turn.

If the review was truethful, I must have gotten one from a bad production batch. With the volume set at the mid-range, I could hardly reproduce any audible sound. The volume has to be at maximum before I could hear discernible voices without putting my ear right above the speaker. It also records a lot of anoying background noise.

It is one of the finest books ever written about personal freedom.Sterling Hayden had a substantial acting talent, but the great surprise here is that his writing far surpasses it. The first section, in particular, is one of the tightest, most lyrical long passages in mid-20th century prose, rivalling William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren (it reminds me of the first 100 or so pages of \\"The Cave\\"). But, as is appropriate for a voyage that begins in the San Francisco Bay in 1963, it shows a style reminiscent of Jack Kerouac and Dylan Thomas.Wanderer is a ripping good story, but read it at least once for the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailing adventure with a true Skipper","review":"Great true story of a big schooner's voyage from SanFrancisco-Tahiti, leaving the pressures of big city behind and revealing the essence of a by-gone life at sea under sail.

The wire tracker is in constant use and works well out to about 200' but you do have to remember that any wire electrically connected to the transmitter will be carrying a signal. For example, in tracing home wiring if you connect to the neutral (white wire) you will find a signal on all the white wires because they are all connected to the same bus at the panel. Similarly if you trace the hot (black wire) you have to turn off the breakers to isolate the wire you are tracing. But you should do that anyway to avoid a lot of smoke and possibly a rather painful supprise.Overall, the Wire Tracker is well worth the money as long as you follow the instructions and have a little understanding of how it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big time saver in tracing alarm wires","review":"When our house was built it was wired for an alarm system but the system was not installed. So, the alarm wiring is behind the sheetrock, no records of location (company that installed is out of business) and with about 15 wires that I could not trace visually this unit saved me a lot of time. I only cut into one place by mistake and that is outstanding in my book. The one mistake I ended up making was caused by a thermostat wire which ran in the same bundle. You can get cross talk!It takes a little trial and error to make sure you are on the right wire and as you work the trace, keep reducing the sensitivity on the probe. Put a piece of blue making tape to mark the spot. Check your stud locations and see if it all makes sense before cutting.For what I paid for this unit it is a real bargain and paid for itself many times over in labor saving. Not fool proof but darn good results are possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a tool, it is a toy","review":"This item attracted me because of the price and brand name. Big mistake. For 30$ more I could have had a Fluke and not been out the 35 bucks this cost me, and been ahead of the game.This product is a waste of time for a professional electrician, low volt electrician, ect. spend a little more and get a quality product.It will tone out a cat5 or phone jack if you are within 15 feet MAX, with a very low signal. If you have a bunch of wires all in the same room, which is smaller than 15 feet, and you need to find the ends, this product may do the trick. BUT, this is all it will do.

After reading the various reviews, I am reminded that the viewer sees a film through his own filters. I didn't walk away with many of the impressions that appear throughout the various reviews.What I liked best, was what one reviewer seemed to like least. I found that the director was very subtle in dealing with many issues that can provoke strong reactions: homosexuality is not a theme, more of a fact. The Jewish/German issue is aging, but not dead. The Israeli/Palestinian issue is very much alive. The occupation continues, as do the suicide bombings. Or, the suicide bombers continue, as does the occupation. The viewer is not manipulated on any of these issues. They are brought up as they are.It's a good movie, and I'm surprised that it didn't come to a theatre near me (Germany). I think it would appeal to the \\"mass movie audience\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small gem","review":"Low budget engrosser with an entertaining plot and meaningful story.

The only reason I bought it was for its slim profile. I didn't have the room for a conventional tube TV which would have cost me a fifth of the price of this TV. Plus, the TV failed within 4 months.

With \\"Sherlock Holmes Faces Death,\\" Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are back on more familiar turf and solve a mystery having absolutely no connection to World War II.For the first time in the series, a film doesn't merely credit a story by Arthur Conan Doyle, screenwriter Bertram Millhauser actually makes use of one, \\"The Musgrave Ritual,\\" a traditional murder mystery involving an old family curse. The story gives director Roy William Neill plenty of opportunities to pour on the atmosphere that is the series' best attribute, aside from stars Rathbone and Bruce, of course.With this entry, the series greatly improved, and greater adventures were still to come for the famous detective from Baker Street.Brian W.

Jeffery Marx does a brilliant job of showcasing the ministry of Joe Ehrmann, former NFL Player turned high school coach. Joe's approach to the problems of dysfunctional families and poverty are right on target. I wonder how many people would have heard of Joe had it not been for this book. Jeffery Marx does a great job of not just exposing Joe Ehrmann and his personal journey but also his own struggles with coming to terms with his own father.One of the best lines in the book is when a parent approaches Joe at the beginning of the high school football season and asks, \\"What kind of team do you think we'll have this year?\\" Joe quips, \\"I guess we'll find out in about 20 years.\\" Ehrmann's approach to coaching is one that should be shared by anyone who coaches young people. We need to be concerned about how our children develop as people and not just players."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly wonderful read!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though I am not a huge sports fan and I do not know much about football.

Stumbling on to a job as ball boy for the Colts like Marx did would have been my wildest dream come true. That put me in his shoes right away. What really gripped me though is having an 11 year old son to teach about becoming a good man.We're mostly amateurs when it comes to teaching kids. Watching the Gilmore coaches through Marx gives the opportunity to see some seasoned veterans at work as they 'send' their young men into the world.Besides the engaging storyline I found Coach/Father Ehrmann's approach to passing along good values in a secular society very refreshing. I suspect his players' parents did too, regardless of their particular faiths.This one's a great read for parents, teachers and coaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide for all coaches","review":"I recommend this book to any coach seeking to \\"make a difference\\" in the lives of his/her players but doesn't exactly know what that means. Coaches hope to be good influences on their players just like fathers hope to be the same for their children. The only problem is that that desire often lacks a blueprint.By first defining true masculinity and then showing how one coaching staff teaches it to its players, this book helps coaches see that much needed blueprint. For coaches, the true measure of success for a team's season isn't known until 20 years down the road - if you're interested in that type of success, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Not only have I read this book but I was able to go to a seminar that had Jeffrey Marx and Joe Ehrmann as guest speakers.

After a ten second nap she's converting the crib to a stroller and ten seconds later into the rocking horse, etc. That's OK! It's teaching her how to assemble items and have fun.

The songs are never less than challenging, but there's a general absence of truly memorable compositions, although \\"Lady Day\\" is among his better ballad efforts. The group is impressive, with drummer Tony Williams trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, bassist Ron Carter, pianist McCoy Tyner, and James Spaulding on flute. The solos are of course worthy of repeated listens, yet the big-picture impression of this date is that there's something subtly lacking to keep it from being a memorable addition to Shorter's legacy (although for most other jazz artists it would be a bold act of overachievement)."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a good disc","review":"i really enjoy Wayne Shorter's music.from his time with Art Blakey then onto Miles which were magical moments to my ears.i really dig Angola&the big push.Blue Note has the jams.and what a strong band as well.the man is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy - crap","review":"bought it wanting to frame few canvases I bought on ebay.they are very low quality, they cut in wrong angles, they do not fit one each other.I am sorry I did not got the michael's ones which were much better quality.they are not cut at 45 degrees, each one is in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"These are the WORST stretchers I've ever used!Masterpiece is a good brand, usually, however I think these are knock offs or the defective ones they throw away.Like the previous reviewer stated, they arent cut evenly- and they dont fit into other masterpiece stretchers.I always stretch my paintings, and 80% of the time I used masterpiece stretchers from Hobby Lobby, I bought these because they were cheaper....I guess poor quality comes with lesser price :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Difficult to connect the pieces, and almost impossible to take apart without breaking it.

Yi-Yi was filmed in 35mm, but to see it on DVD you'd swear it was done in 8mm. On top of that, the images are jittery, not smoothe.The people who oversaw the production of this DVD, Maryann Manelski and Kimberly Rubin, have a lot of explaining to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally eye-opening.","review":"this staggering update of the 1950s American melodrama (it frequently quotes 'Rebel Without a Cause') pits the stifling monumentality of Taiwanese capitalism, the way it compartmentalises and minimises its servants in boxes (all those frames - windows, doors etc.), and turns them into non-persons, shadows (all those reflections in mirrors, windows etc.), removed from life while seeming to be living it. Yang's great achievement is to make a humanist, character driven film without getting soft or soppy, fixing a formal, modernist apparatus on it that makes connections - through incident, character, colour (those startling reds and cool blues), metaphor (doubling, reproductions), location - way beyond the narrow knowledge of his protagonists. Like his young namesake Yang-Yang, he wants to show them what's behind their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ai-Yi Yi!","review":"The problem with Yi Yi is not with the director or the cast -- it's the fact that the story is not truthful enough to make this style of film work. To present a work that goes on for almost 3 hours, and never see one truthful moment until the end -- which turned out to be pure cliche, by the way -- was excruciating. Yet the actors did a tremendous job with what they had. And, The film calls to mind Kieslowski as the theme is subtly reflected in the film technique as well as dialogue. Unfortunately the good elements are wasted with all of the over-long scenes where the characters are not allowed to take their actions through to their logical conclusion. Perhaps if they did, Mr. Yang's film would have been too controversial. Maybe this film is an example of where the Chinese culture is right now, as it decides what to cast off as this ancient society transforms into its next age of growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but tiresome","review":"Had guests over (two of whom spoke Chinese) and we watched this movie based on all of these glowing reviews. We lasted through a couple of hours until finally shutting the movie off. There are perhaps two poignant moments, one somewhat funny, one awkward amidst a general rambling of people in various relationships, none of which was interesting enough to make a group of people watch to the end... It's a boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you.","review":"I found Yi Yi to be a tedious film, at times the action and characters felt quite contrived and cliched. The subtitles were poorly highlighted and I often could not figure out who was speaking the line. The only refreshing thing in the movie was the final scene at the grandmother's funeral, but it was not worth a three hour wait to get to this poigant scene. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, tedious, melodramatic","review":"A dull, tedious, melodramatic effort that wastes the cast and the craft of scene setting. Everything goes out the window once people start moving and talking and it takes hours for the story to reach the predictable non-conclusion. The film is laden with cliches and burdened by a lack of focus. Pick a story out of here and you can make 20 films, but don't throw together teasers and expect everyone to appreciate the slow-mo trainwreck of family tragedies that this movie encompasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera waste of my time","review":"I saw this film at the theatre and it is simply the worst Chinese movie I have ever seen. It is a dull soap opera, comparable to the dull week-day soap operas on TV.

I had heard rumors that the DVD was substandard, but I so wanted to see the film again that I ordered it. Unfortunately everything I had heard was true. The transfer is blurry throughout, and on every near-horizontal surface there is distracting shimmering. It is so bad that you can even see foreground objects moving against the background, when they shouldn't, which is indicative of substandard encoding. AVOID THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving","review":"One of the my more profoundly moving experiences in cinema, both as a viewer and emerging filmmaker. Yang's technical, aesthetic, and narrative precision are models to be emulated, his personal insights on humanity, inspiring and deeply moving.It is a sad, sad day, today -- July 1, 2007 -- to hear of the news that Yang, at 59, passed away.

It captures our world and our humanity brilliantly. All the beauty, tragedy, mistakes, depression, learning, love, tension, everything we have gone through and will experience - it's all here.Still...I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. My favorite character was the young Yang-Yang, an 8 year old boy who likes to learn and is already quite wise for his age, yet he has a sweet innocence about him. The movie seemed to focus on everyone else, leaving him with only a few short scenes...thankfully he steals the final scene and gives the last words, which are heartwarming.Overall it is a slow, boring, fast, exciting, sad, happy movie. Like life itself.Which makes it pretty interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suffocatingly beautiful","review":"This Austin groups minimalistic, avant-country album crawled out years ago. I think it was winter of 2001 when I first started listening to their frightenly stark, soulful music. I fluctuated for a while, not knowing how to take them. They have all the ingredients to make great indie country sounds and something else, like something slipping off a track, an inevetiable accident about to happen, but you are looking forward to it happening. An amazing band, deserving. Resultingly I have come to them more and more lately. Typically I'll listen to holes in an album and then shelf it for a long time until it has healed, but KITW has managed to stay close at hand for some time.

It fits very comfortably on the eyes and nose, and the head strap adusts very easily to fit any size head. The only drawback is the chinstrap which is very thin and tends to feel very uncomfortable after prolonged use. I usually wear it without the chinstrap.

It looks sweeeeet! 5 star kudos to Extreme Rage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this helmet if I knew then what I know now.","review":"The helmet is poorly made. I have a normal size head for a 5'10\\" man and I find there is way to much pressure applied to the sides of my head. It gives me a headache after awhile and even with all of that pressue the helmet feels to loose for fast paced action.Also the foam around the nose pushes down and retricts the airflow going in and out of my nose. I have tried every adjustment imaginable but it is still uncomfortable.In addition the button snaps feel as though they barley snap on. It's a miracle that the plastic post snaps that hold the visor in place do not break when you disassemble the helmet to clean it.I don't understand how this helmet received so many positive reviews when it is such crap. It is my hope that this review will save someone from wasting time and money trying this helmet out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good","review":"We bought the helmet for our 12 year old son and it is a little big.

Here he argues that small stuff - small changes , actually, can have a significant and positive impact on our lives and the lives of others.Carlson is not calling for quantum changes; he seems to be an instrumentalist at heart. The short chapters in this very readable book illustrate a smorgasbord of ideas on saving money, enriching your intellectual life (read eight pages a day) to deepening your key relationships (take time to listen).ETYT reflects the idea that, to succeed in life, you don't necessarily have to hit home runs. If you hit singles lots of times when you come to the plate, you will advance.In expounding on this theme in a non-preachy way, Carlson himself has hit a home run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"What a great book at such a good time.

So much better than X10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely better then X10","review":"I'm slowly migrating from X10 to Insteon, and what should I tell...I'm impressed.Communication is much faster and much much more reliable communication between devices, backward-compatibility with X10 is working great for me so I don't need to commit and redo everything at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is junk","review":"I ordered a pair of lamplinc modules, motion sensor, and access points and couldn't get anything to work.

There's also a headphone jack, a telescoping antenna and a carrying strap. The sound from the tiny speaker is surprisingly good, and it can be heard from the next room at half volume.I bought one of these rather than paying money to MLB to hear baseball on the web.

One of my current favorite activities is listening to my Phillies games on the Panasonic in the yard,hanging in my hammock, or grilling up some steaks.

I really didn't think it would've been THIS bad!! It is the worst record I have ever owned.

Every single song is butchered. To the point that it's disrespectful. \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly\\" \\"Panic\\" \\"There's a light...\\" such beautiful songs to just have some horrible band cover it. Every band on this cd shouldn't be allowed to record again. Cursive, Beautiful Mistake etc. should be fined for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Soon Can I Get Rid of This CD?","review":"I purchased this CD too quickly; I thought it was a best of the Smiths compilation. So it arrives and I see that is a modern compilation from other bands. I think, okay, how bad can it be. Buyers, it can be very, very bad. If this is the impact that The Smiths has had on music then maybe Morrissey should have have been an electrician. I can say good things about three bands on the CD. Hundred Reasons, Walter Walter and The Beautiful Mistake succeed only because they stay somewhat true to the original. The other bands try so hard to sound hurt and damaged that they completely miss the beauty that is The Smiths. I just hope that I can sell it to a used CD store for a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My!...","review":"Please don't ever let this happen again.

I have carried these songs through thick and thin.Even though Chris has improved his voice since this early career album...and the recording is somewhat dated...it is still worth the listening.

AND my handle won't fully retract out of its frame and so the handle is not long enough to pull behind you.Otherwise I like the bag- its size and the quietness of the wheels but i wish it was more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing quality","review":"This bag has two (2) major flaws.(1) The wheel base is made of molded plastic which is riveted on the the sides. When I received my bag the plastic casing around the left and right side rivet holes were clearly cracked. This appears to be a design flaw and the actual cracking most likely occurred during manufacture when the rivets were punched. Because this is a definite weak point in the bag, even if it had not been damaged during manufacture it would most likely crack during normal use.(2) There is not enough padding for the computer compartment...especially between the handle and computer compartment. Therefore, if the bag is dropped or subjected to a moderate jolt your computer could suffer damage that would not occur in a better manufactured bag. Bottom line...spend a few extra bucks and get a bag that will protect your computer and last more than a few trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grant Green's top 5 recordings","review":"Highlights include \\"Green Jeans\\" and the Duke Pearson composition \\"Bedouin\\". \\"Bedouin\\" has some particularly distinctive drumming by Elvin Jones.

Yet, he had the self-confidence to record a set with John Coltrane's rhythm section at the peak of their fame. To top it off, they recorded \\"My Favorite Things,\\" which had become Coltrane's signature tune. To my ears, this interpretation is better, with momentum maintained throughout. The title track is another finger-snapping up-tempo swinger. The rock of this session is drummer Elvin Jones. His busy, constant chatter prevents Grant from letting up in his intensity. McCoy Tyner seems to enjoy the change-of-pace. This music and the Idle Moments album are the highlights of Grant's career and among the finest in the Blue Note legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant's Greatest","review":"Another \\"cool jazz\\" classic by the talented Mr. Green. This was Grant's best effort from his traditional jazz years which ran thru the mid 60's, before he started to experiment with soul, funk, and bebop later in his career. Standouts from the album include \\"My Favorite Things\\" & \\"Bedouin\\".Grant was probably the most under-appreciated jazz artist to ever record an album. Since his untimely death at the age of 43, he has slowly begun to attract the critical accaim he deserved. The evolution of \\"acid jazz\\" in the 90's, also lead a resurgence of younger fans as Grant's music was very popular in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"NLP book For Salepeople and Influencers.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I can't wait to go to Richard's training in the near future.

Because as a professional seller and sales trainer, I've read many many books on the topic but this one was clearly the most useless and boring one. One of my friend told me that Bandler said he could write a book in a single month, read that and you'll understand why !I'd also like to point out that NLP works great BUT you absolutely need a lot of elegance to make it work, poor NLP gets poor results, were you really expecting to be able to be a race car champion just because you can drive a car ?So forget about this book and look for books of people who can write, think about others while making a book and also who have taken time to explain things in a crystal clear way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of poorly written hype rather than useful methods","review":"I thought that this would take basic information about NLP techniques and make them more useful for sales situations.

Wish I had read the NEGATIVE reviews below more carefully before buying. Keep your receipt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I got this book to learn about nlp for sales.

A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the naybobs of negativity influence you","review":"This book is a scarcely edited form of a Bandler workshop. The incongruity of syntax and grammer are intentional. It is best read word by word with inflection.

Fortunately, there's a small book from Michael Hall out there where he clarifies what Bandler does in PE, otherwise you'd be lost (title: Persuasion Engineering Simplified). I also wouldn't recommend trying this on customers. The process is simply too strange for normal people. In a therapeutic context it *may* work.

The bad news is the two 20th Century Fox films (the first films Rathbone/Bruce made as the duo) have not been restored - THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES/ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES were not made by Universal and were not part of the restoration project at UCLA. This is why chronologically they are not being released first, as the visual condition of these two titles are not as good as the restored Universal dozen. I don't know if any cleaning/remastering has been done on the two Fox titles though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best versions yet!","review":"These digitally remastered versions of Sherlock Holmes are the best ever! All are very clear to see and hear! It allows you to really concentrate on the movie instead of all the imperfections that were in the old original copies, i.e. scratches and lines, etc. contained in the original tapes that are now aged and delaplidated. These new versions are a really good way to immerse yourself in the mystery itself, and actually a joy to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Ripoff","review":"For the price they are asking, and the lack of extras, these collections are a major disappointment. Don't believe the packaging. These disks are far from being 'loaded with extras'. There are no extras on 3 of the disks, and the 4th has only a commentary track, and an 8 minute featurette about the restoration. Don't get me wrong, I love the films themselves, I just hate the way they have been packaged and sold. I mean they could easily have put 2 or even 3 of the films on one disk without any degradation, and issued the entire series in one collection for the price of a single one of these 'volumes'. I guess they are trying to recoup the cost of restoration. My advice, wait a couple of years for them to release the entire collection at a much lower price, because that is what they will have to eventually do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The AhHa moment!","review":"If this book doesnt create the AhHa moment for you then I would find that very hard to believe. I could not be the same person as I was prior to reading this book. Thank you Dr.Bruce Lipton for providing us information to seriously change our lives. I was sick and tired of reading books that had no depth like Law of Attraction type of books but truly this is all I needed. This information has inspired me to write my fiction books as stories that people can relate to if science is too much. I love these type of books because its confirmation that we need to understand ourselves at a cellular level before we apply any sort of affirmations or create goal boards. I applied these learning in my books -The Poison of SelfandA Story of Love - The Power of Stepping Into Your VulnerabilityIf you dont read this then you can do as many affirmations you like but your will be in the same place as you are until you change your beliefs at a cellular level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell Intelligence","review":"Bruce Lipton is a brilliant scientist who has explained in an easily understood way the relationship between our brains and the intelligence that permeates every cell in our bodies and shows us that our beliefs are a very powerful part of who we are and we have an inherent intelligence that is part of us and we do have control of our own general health. Dr Lipton also gives clients the knowledge that we are more than we think we are.The Wisdom of Your Cells: How Your Beliefs Control Your Biology"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on Practical Value","review":"I thought the author presented the science pretty well... Stem cells/DNA are programmed externally via the membrane, non-random evolution suggesting deliberate genetic mutations, EEGs that pick-up brain signals outside of the body , the placebo pill effect, etc.In short, he makes good arguments how environmental factors, both at the cellular level and by extension on the body as a whole, can indeed be responsible for one's present condition.Where I felt cheated, was the ending. It seems the whole book is leading to the climax that will explain what exactly one can do armed with this information. Unfortunately, it comes up short. Basically, he says positive affirmation and/or willpower aren't effective since they involve the conscious mind.. instead what is needed is to reprogram the unconscious. How do you do that? The book doesn't have any specifics."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Head is Spinning!","review":"And so are my cells. I found his insights absolute fascinating, but this is not an easy listen. You really have to pay attention and review a lot. Dr. Lipton gives us in depth information, some of which was totally over my head, but I still learned from him.

Once again, if you can listen long enough you will arrive at some amazing insights into how your beliefs affect your body!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So what","review":"I was rather unimpressed.

Lyrically, Golden Earring hits its low point with such crass tunes as \\"Snot Love in Spain\\" and \\"Tiger Bay.\\" This album sounds like there was little to no effort involved in even trying to produce a quality product.

My only comment is as follows: The main police investigation in the film revolves around the difference between the diameters of 38 Special and 9mm bullets. The fact of the matter is that there's no difference between the diameters of these two bullets; both 38 Special and 9mm bullets are .357 inch in diameter; in other words, 38 Special bullet diameter is also 9 millimeter. The 38 Special is not to be confused with the ordinary 38 caliber.

This is not one of those, \\"How to Books\\", it is as I have said, more of a historical prospective. Good for those who just want a basic understanding of the Santeria. It also touches on the Palo Mayombe, and Monte, and gives a bit of the differences between the different people of Africa and their Spiritual backgrounds.A lot of people do not like it, or like to discredit it, but honestly the information is well researched, and aquarate.

I Love this man's voice and his talent is unquestionable. I honestly can say that I idolize George and I consider myself one of his biggest fans...but this album really stinks. There are a few songs that I really liked and I'm glad to have THEM in my collection. Roxanne is done so well (that is to say that GM's version is actually good) and I really loved Where or When, but aside from a few others... this was a VERY DREARY experience. Please, George, when you hit the studio next time... make it an album that YOU did. This century had so much material that would be better suited for your voice... including YOUR stuff!

My goodness, I could feel myself lapse into a coma...)In another song, \\"You've changed\\", if you listen close to the line, \\"You've forgotten the words....

George truly is a very versatile vocalist. There is such a large contrast between this work and the \\"heady WHAM! days\\". The CD represents an entire century of song and in my opinion the songs could have been done no better by anyone else. Highlights include \\"My Baby Just Cares For Me\\", \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" and \\"Secret Love\\". Well done to George on such refreshingly different piece of work that people of all ages can appreciate. The backing music is incredible and serves to complement his flawless voice.

I think he should release more albums like this with more well known tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tame and bland. A disappointment - sadly.","review":"What happened?Most of these songs have already been sublimely interpreted by fantastic artists. To choose to cover them, you'd have to have something pretty unique to add.George Michael has proven himself to be a terrific song-writer on several levels. Why he chooses to release an album that seems to be bred by such low aspirations and no real desire to expand on earlier and far superior interpretations is a real mystery to me.The bland, easy-listening production of every single song does not help.Bottom line: this album sounds uninspired, uninventive, unambitious. It's okay, but okay is not enough. Not by a long stretch. George Michael is so much better than this.Even if you are a huge fan, and personally I am one, you could probably do without this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is where i draw the line...","review":"I have been a huge george michael fan practically all my life, and been through his many phases from wham to faith and back around to older, but i cannot in good conscience say that i even care for this album. and it hurts me to say that. i was looking forward to his new release so much..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album","review":"Definitely a must-have for any George Michael fan. Roxanne is a low point for the album, but the rest are stunning. Miss Sarejevo is an odd choice of a U2 song to cover, but is excellent.

Not the best George Michael album, but again, definitely a must-have if you love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing and another best of George","review":"I have been listening to George Michael since I was 4 yrs. Old. I was mesmorized by his excellent voice. Throughout the years, he has had his ups and downs. But throughout it all, I have been a GM fan. George Michael is one of the best singers of all time. I suggest you buy this album. Sure, the ballads a slow and sort of smoothe, but George sings them beautifully. This album justs adds on to George Michael's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why These Songs?","review":"With loads and loads of songs to choose from over the last 100 years, I find myself scratching my head as to why George would choose this collection?There's no doubt that George's voice is one of the best there is, but an album of eight long, soupy ballads is not the way to excite people about a new CD.The only tracks off the album I had heard (or heard of) before were \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\". Neither would have been near the Top 1000 songs from the last century I would have chosen.The other songs come from even earlier times. Of all of those, \\"Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?\\" has some spark and \\"Secret Love\\" is a welcome breath of big band during a long, slow, plod towards the 10th track.I am a huge George fan, but I am truly disappointed by this album. George can do (and has done) much better. The voice is still great. However, the same can't be said for the choices for this album's material."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of talent","review":"this Man can sing,write,&produce so why this run of the mill material? why the Brunch Music?i was wishing for more dance songs like Fast Love&outside.i know he can sing other peoples music.he has done a good job covering Stevie Wonder's songs.but i would have prefered a whole new album hopefully next time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics not as printed","review":"I purchased this CD because I did a search for specific lyrics I wanted to hear.

Sure Wham! was pure garbage, but it was new pure garbage. This is just ageing white boy wanna-be-soulful mind-numbing drivel. To separate and discuss any specific track would be pointless and insulting to anyone with a 70 IQ and higher. Still, the lackluster bastardization of the Police's \\"Roxanne\\" is somehow more painful than Puff Daddy's remix.

Since the middle1970s life for working people in the US has been the ups and downs of attacks on our standards of living, little depressions,booms,more attacks, more wars, racism, even threats of fascism, a stock market crash, and now a looming world economiccrisis. The documents assembled in this book from the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s chart this development from the standpoint of the Socialist Workers Party. Just as importantly, they chart the lessons and strategies of building a working class response tothis change, and the creative experience of the SWP in building a revolutionary workers party into the twenty-first century. Some day this book will rank with Lenin's What is to be Done, Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution, and Cannon's Struggle for a proletarian party among the tools socialist workers use to change the world"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Talk About Something Else","review":"I was a little disappointed with this movie.

The sound mix is amazing. I wish all live albums could sound this good. The bass player alone makes this album worth purchasing but there is also great percussion, organ and brass instrumentation that make this album great. If you like good reggae music, played and jammed to perfection then you NEED this album in your headphones.PS. This is the album above all albums to have if you like to listen to reggae while you ski.

He loves anything Batman and he loves to go fishing with his dad. So, this seemed like the perfect gift for him. He loved it immediately and when he was told what it was for, he was even more excited.The item is easy to use and learn. The kid themed design and size work perfect for my nephew and makes it that much more appealing for him to learn how to fish with his dad. It casts well enough for what a child needs it for and the reeling works great too! I would recommend this for anyone who has a child looking to learn to fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!!!","review":"This is a great starter item for anyone who has a child & wants to try to teach them to fish. I have a 3 year old whom really loves batman, so this was a must. It is the perfect length & weight. It also has a practice weight for casting for the kids to throw around before actually fishing w/ the rod & reel. It doesn't cast as far as regular sized rod/reels, but its for a kid so it shouldn't be expected to, it serves its purpose for a child. My son did not catch a fish right off, so we snuck a small bass on the hook when he was preoccupied catching grasshopper/crickets for bait. He was very excited once bringing the fish in. Once he is a year or so older he will be much more capable of bringing one in on his own. This is a really good quality & very durable item.

This is not gospel hip hop. I bought this CD and was very disappointed in the content. KRS-1 is 5% Nation of Islam. At one point in the CD, he says that you don't need to read your Bible, you just need to look with your third eye. Be cautious of what you listen to and what you buy, it affects your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Christian as you might think","review":"While the sound of this album is great, though the beats could have been a little better, the message of some of it leaves you shaking your head. I found myself saying Amen quite loudly to much of what KRS-ONE had to say but then his twisted theology was enough to make my stomach turn. As a Biblical Studies student I was hoping that this new album would bring KRS-ONE's unique style to solid Gospel Hip-Hop but I was wrong. Instead of solid Christian rhyming and theology you get a mixture of new age and pluralist ideas (the belief that there are many ways to God). Though he may be new to the faith there is no excuse for presenting an album that kids are going to listen to with twisted and heretical theology. Keep seeking my brothers and sisters (KRS-ONE included) the truth is in God's word."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you criticize Chris???","review":"What I love about KRS is that he is real. Reguardless of how much of a Christian you are you have to respect this album. These are his beliefs and not just what the preacherman tells him to believe. He is an elite thinker and I think he deserves respect for it. This album is diverse and has something for everyone. Anyone who says they dont like this or that has something nice to say about the rest. Every Christian has things about the religion they arent sure of or just dont believe in. Its the way the world works and I'm glad he didnt take the holier than thou approach on this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a little bit to get used to, but its dope.","review":"I really don't like gospel music. Actually it is my least favorite music. But on this album once you get past the slight tinge of gospel to it, it is dope. My main problem with the album is I don't really care for the gospel type hooks on certain songs. But be aware this type of hook isn't on every song. When you get down to the lyrics and subject matter, this is a superior album. I wish he hadn't really added the religious aspect because you get these so called \\"christians\\" judging his faith and what he believes in when they don't understand christianity to begin with. If you are a KRS fan like am from the beginning, this album belongs in your collection. I would let my child listen to this album before some of these other albums that are sending messages to have my son put in jail."},{"rating":"2","title":"KRS-One's Best Work, So Far","review":"I don't understand those who are fans of KRS-One and only give him credit as long as he's producing songs with explicit lyrics. I find \\"Spiritual Minded\\" to be KRS-One's best project, to date. There is nothing \\"weak\\" about this CD, and I highly recommend it to those who like hip-hop but are tired of hearing the same tired, profane booty-ho-thug-violence lyrics. I hope that KRS-One will continue in the vein of \\"Spiritual Minded,\\" and not give in to the pressure of producing \\"profanity-for-profit\\" songs. Kris is a gifted MC, very articulate and intelligent, and I love it when he speaks without the added embellishments of vulgarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"KRS - ONE Still #1","review":"Krs one has changed the theme of his rap, but he has not lost any of his intensity. Kris continues to rap about issues that are of major concern to the black community, but now from a christian perspective. Hey if you like KRS - ONE you will enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you don't like the song, you'll like what Tony does","review":"This is a nice album from fairly early in Tony's career, and fairly late in Count Basie's. The count himself is only a factor in a couple of selections, although his orchestra is present throughout...but don't buy this one for Basie, buy it for Bennett. There are two numbers on here I have never liked much: \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Jeepers Creepers.\\" However, I must say that I do like what Tony Bennett does with both of them. He is also super with \\"Anything Goes\\" and \\"I Guess I'll Have to Change my Plans.\\" I can't fault his version of \\"I've Grown Accustomed to her Face\\" except to say that as a fan of \\"My Fair Lady\\" from the late 50's to the present, I prefer Rex Harrison's talk/sing rendition to any other style. Some of the less well-known songs on here are also quite interesting. I gave it four stars instead of five simply because it is short by modern CD standards...but it is a consistently pleasant and strong half-hour of jazz vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basie swings and so does Bennett...","review":"Basie actually only appears on two of the 12 tracks, Bennett's long time arranger/pianist Ralph Sharon, is on the remaining 10 trcks, Sharon also is the arranger for this session, though his arrangements were very Basie-ish. Bennett sounds happay as ever to be backed by the Basie Big Band. This is one of Bennett's finest sessions of the 50's, and shows beyond a doubt how great of a jazz singer Tony Bennett is, yes I said JAZZ SINGER, because that's what he is. Highly recommeded CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE 'JAZZ HERITAGE SOCIETY' BOOTLEGS!!!!!!!!","review":"Well, I guess the title says it all.

Imagine my surprise to find a CD-R with a cheap press-on label with the words \\"Jazz Heritage Society\\" on it. Terrible -- it sounds like it was dubbed off an old eight track or something. The roaring Snooky Young-led brass section is reduced to a muddy mumble.Moral of the story: don't settle for anything but the real McCoy -- Basie and Bennett deserve much better.

I can't imagine what other people are hearing to give this album great reviews? Even 1976 To The Hilt was a big improvement over this although STILL no Moontan. These are just badly written songs and too simply produced. Moontan was a masterpiece of interchanging parts of songs, changing instrumentation, tempo, affects, and awesome finales.

I really admire his prose style and insightful writing in book reviews and feature articles. However, his fatal flaw is that he is still an angry young man of the kind that most people outgrow in their 20s. Much of the cruelty and perceived wrongs he write about in \\"Pleasant Hell\\" were experienced by most people since almost everyone is outside the exclusive group Dolan alternately hates and admires. Most people would grow out of this phase and anyone as educated and intelligent as Doaln should realize that most of the people he vents his spite on don't have his education and accomplishments to look back on a little bit later in life.On the other hand, his decriptions of the everyday life of a loser is dead on. It's a disturbing book, but one that people should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good short story spoiled","review":"I bought this book because I am a fan of the War Nerd. I was disappointed.The basic idea of a Californian nerd's autobiography is promising enough, and Dolan has plenty of horribly embarrassing material (girls, personal hygiene, and work). Unfortunately, without the discipline of a word limit, or a decent editor, it degenerates into pure introspective self indulgence. Six pages on a fantasy, not even about the girl of his desire, but about his attempts to summon magical help to take the girl of his desire.There are still some jewels amid the dross, but be prepared to skim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unsympathetic, baby boomer whining","review":"As a white male from a privileged background myself, I found this book to be especially tiresome and pointless, and stopped reading about 20 pages in. I get that us white males can still be fascinating subjects of TV shows and movies, even if we're unsympathetic jerks, but that only works if we're mildly interesting. That's not the case here. Also, this is not a book about \\"growing up in the 70s\\". The protagonist is a freshman in college by the time 1975 rolls around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Loathing Narcissism in Poetic Prose","review":"Pleasant Hell is proof that nihilism goes hand-in-hand with narcissism. While Dolan can write well enough to keep the eye moving across the page, he is a morally bankrupt, misanthropic narcissist who's contempt for anything that might be considered decent has twisted him into a self-hating atheist. This literary artifact is useful as a case study in abnormal psychology and/or as a warning to those who might abuse powerful drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was there, Johnny","review":"5 stars for writing, 1 star for wisdom. I grew up in Pleasant Hill and was at the same school, at the same time, as Dolan. The actual town was quite different than he describes, and a great place to grow up, but this book is The World According To John, a subject he is as enamoured with as his own pain.If you like extremely well-written loser books, especially losers who steadfastly, bitterly, proudly remain losers, this is a must. But if you, as I do, believe that it's pathetic and spiritually bankrupt for an author to take personal revenge by using people's real names, don't buy this book.Don't put money in the pocket of this sad man who said in an interview that he spends his free time plotting the revenge he will extract from them when he returns to America.Perhaps Dolan imagines he has written the new Catcher In The Rye, but he is no Salinger. No compassion mars his unprogressing soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"literature, this is not","review":"In the last twenty years I think the bar for what is considered good writing or great writing has been lowered. I admit, I only read the book half through on a flight from Denver to L.A. and found the execution of his ideas mediocre. Maybe that's why the last person left it behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellishly Pleasant","review":"The howls and shrieks of the negative reviews offer the most positive reasons for reading Dr. Dolan's novel, but they left out many of its other fine qualities. Above all, Pleasant Hell courageously and painfully honest. It's one of the first, true books I've read about my generation and about what it was like to grow up in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is also beautifully written, as if Nabokov and Céline's literary DNA got spliced. It's often quite funny. And, unlike nearly other literary project, it reveals an amazing lack of vanity, right down to the author's jacket photo. In fact, Dr. Dolan is my new hero, our very own suburban Solzhenitsyn. Buy it. Read it. Make your friends buy it, too. This is a book that can't have too many readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure it Sterling Silver?","review":"I was not happy with this product at all. It looks as if the silver has been sprayed on to a piece of metal. I mean you can actaully see bubble on the surface of the ring. Tacky. I don't feel I got a ring that is truly sterling silver. I mean I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"size","review":"This case is beautiful but does not work for the Visor Prism.

I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about the mystics before picking up the original texts themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh view of mysticism in the Christian tradition","review":"I read this book a number of years ago and am still amazed when I think of the impact it had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song 7 Therory out the window","review":"The first half of this album is classic and falls inline with all the greats on their other albums. Song 7 on all the albums has been something to look foreward to up until Push the Button. This albums' seven, Right Left, should have be Left Out and the rest of the album (Songs 8 thru 11) probably should have been too. This could have been an amazing EP by only using the fist six songs. Would have saved us a couple of bucks too. Still worth a listen. I recommend borrowing it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $5 I've spent in a long time!","review":"I love The Chemical Brothers. I am not sure why it took so long for me to purchase this album, but when I saw it for $5 on Amazon, I figured I couldn't go wrong. And that is an understatement. Highly recommend to any Chemical Brothers fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite album by the Chemicals.","review":"With all their other albums, there are always tracks I really like a lot and some I'm not so keen on, but with this one, I like all of it. A good dancey album, from the brilliant \\"Galvanize\\" to the end. Stand out track for me is the brilliant hip hop inspired \\"Left Right\\". Most tracks have a slightly different feel to them than the rest, even though the upbeat dancey theme seems to run throughout. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crème De La Crème of Electronic Music","review":"Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons should have called themselves The Historical Brothers instead. Not only did they meet each other in History class, but they have made such an immense impact on music in the relatively short 13 years they have been around that the duo will no doubt go into the books as one of the most influential artistes in electronica, rock and beyond.With their fifth studio release Push The Button, The Chemical Brothers continue to present their winning formula, which always sounds different, but yet always remains very distinctively theirs. Surprising collaborations, new sounds, and production quality as smooth as can ever be, this is the crème de la crème of electronic music. Simply put, it just doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING CD IS COPY CONTROLLED ***BOYCOTT & DON'T BUY","review":"THIS CD COMES WITH THAT NEW COPY CONTROLLED TECHNOLOGY WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO PLAY THE CD IN MY WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER.

Listening to this new album is like going back in time. Just get it ... and get it as quick as you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Effort.","review":"I picked up the CD for 1 reason and that was the opening track \\"Galvanize\\". Great track with Q-Tip and Morroccan samples added to the Chemicals trademark thumps. Then I listened to the rest of the album and was dissapointed by all the songs. Nothing new and no substance to any of the remaining songs. This has finally made me realise that DANCE MUSIC IS DEAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"wow...i am really surprised to see all of the excellent reviews for this album. there is nothing fun or interesting about any of this. drawn-out beats and elementary clicks and beeps with vocals that barely fit into place. it is a far cry from \\"groundbreaking\\" material, which almost everyone that has written a review seems to think. if you have experienced the likes of real electronic music...you will find this very plain and uneventful. Exit Planet Dust was the only thing The Chemical Brothers should be proud of. it was produced with a very spontaneous and driving sound to it, unlike the rest of their work. why is this getting 4 and 5 stars from people? is this some kind of joke?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I was expecting something different. Compared to Come with Us, this album is mediocre. There are a couple of decent tracks, but nothing stands out. If you are a breakbeat fanatic you might dig this album, if not you will probably be dissapointed. This is definately a burn not buy cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Album","review":"For starters I would like to say that Chemical Brothers have sold out. They have mixed in alot of their tunes with hip-hop and rap obviously tring to capture a larger audience.I sure hope they haven't run out of creativity and it sure seems that way in this album.Well as an avid fan of CHem Bros this album sucks.Out of 12 tracks I only found 4 that are worth listening to.Thats alright, at least Fatboy Slim, Crystal Method and many trance/techno DJ's have been putting out some good albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chem Bros finest","review":"I haven't been a great fan of Chemical Brothers earlier works, but this album truly won me over. They have travelled far since their \\"Block Rockin Beats\\". They have arrived in a sound that is truly emotional and intelligent. The album is Electronic music, but they have made a stand point and they are striving more towards experimental arrangements and I like it! They do keep the old Big Beat vibe, but I believe they are incorporating more 80's kind of sounds.What is amazing about the Chems are that they appeal to such abroad audience, an Indie kid and a hardcore Trance DJ could enjoy this album. My favorite tracks are Believe and Hold On Tight London. Awesome song writing and instrumentation! I truly hope they will come to the US for some live shows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the warning label for Copy Control Disc?","review":"How would I rate this album? I can't tell because I can't listen to it.Copy Control technology -- look it up on the net -- they can not even technically call this a Compact Disc as it does not adhere to the format standards. I think Amazon.ca should be required to notify people that the album they are selling features this technology and will not play on your computer (without adding their software), nor can you get it onto your ipod.Letters to EMI have gone unanswered so this is how I will show my displeasure -- I will not buy another EMI Canada disc so long as they use this technology. I'd rather eat the import premiums than give them another penny. Coldplay, Ben Harper, Chemical Bros"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals and Soft Beats :(","review":"I was so disappointed when I heard this CD!!! It is nothing like any of their previous work. Their previous hard beats were not present on this CD, and most of the songs were clouded with corny vocals. Hopefully they will return to their roots and play music that works for them and their fans. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical Brothers get political...","review":"There are a few good CB songs on here, like Galvanize or Hold Tight London and especially the last two songs, however they have some flat out embarrasing tracks as well. One just features some guy who keeps screaming \\"REVOLUTION!\\" with some weak beat in the background, and there's also the infamous \\"LEFT RIGHT, LEFT RIGHT, MY PEOPLE MARCH!\\".... oh god....Electronica shouldn't be political, I cringed enough to Deadmau5's \\"raise your weapon\\" but this is on a whole 'nother level, it's like the Black Panthers broke into the CB's recording studio to 'get da message out'. Surface to air is an appropriate album closer title, because the whole rest of the album I felt like I was drowning in political BS. Unless you love hearing about da Revolution than take a few of the songs I mentioned and let the rest of it drown in it's own pretention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push The Repeat Button","review":"From the opening featuring Q-Tip to the closing instrumental, this album is brilliant, especially track 4 \\"Hold Tight London\\" (which features the hauntingly beautiful voice of Anna-Lynne Williams from Trespassers William). I hope this track is the next single with plenty of remixes, its certainly getting a lot of airplay in Los Angeles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to it before you buy it","review":"If you are an old school Chemical Brothers fan then I really don't think you will like this music. Make sure you listen to it before you buy it. If you like everything the Chemical Brothers have produced then buy it. It was a little too different for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing for home use","review":"I guess these headphones may be good for portables but I bought them for home (stereo, computer) use and am disappointed.My main complaints are: (1) the cord is short! It's only about 4 feet, nowhere near 8 feet described here, and (2) they aren't very comfortable so far. Too tight on my big head and it makes my ears warm.Also not mentioned is the function of the little box inline with the cord. It is a filter to let you play with 3D effects and \\"move the sound around inside your head\\". It's an interesting gimmick, but I'd rather have a longer cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around headphones","review":"I've had these headphones for over 2 months, including a 2-week road trip to the mid-west. These headphones out performed all others. I literally left the headphones on for hours at a time, and I can personnally guarantee that these are the most comfortable headphones ever.In addition to the unsurpassed comfort of these headphones, they provide a breath-taking display of both treble and bass. The quality is clear and crisp and doesn't lose quality as volume increases.The eight foot cord is long enough to maneuver without difficulty, but so long that it gets in the way. The lifetime guarantee on parts of labor demonstrates the pride of Koss and ensures that they will last a long timeThese are a great investment, and I strongly reccomend purchasing these quality Koss headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss R45 headphones","review":"I don't find these headphones extraordinarily comfortable (the padded headband is great, but my experience is the same as that of the reviewer below--there is pressure on the ears, which makes them warm). The sound is *extremely* good for the price. The treble is good and the bass is quite strong; the midrange is a bit distant, but very natural in tone. I'd be happy to find affordable loudspeakers that sounded this good. The R45s are not efficient, so if you want headphones that blast your eardrums, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH! My achin' ears!","review":"I've had these headphones for 2 years, using them off and on, because apparently the pain they inflict upon my ears is like childbirth in that I keep forgetting how bad it is. I should have trashed them a long time ago, but I'm a tightwad. The sound is satisfactory, but I can only wear them for about an hour before my ears get SUPER sore. Since I work in an open office, I don't really have a choice but to listen to music with headphones, but at some point I just have to stop because it hurts so bad. I was on the site shopping for some new headphones, and thought I'd do (hopefully) some of you a favor by warning you about this. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are unbeleivably good headphones for the price","review":"These headphones have great sound! They also don't let much backround sound in. I would recomend this for anyone looing for a cheaper but just as good set of headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, just what I wanted","review":"Because I am United States Air Force retired and still am very proud of the time I spent in the Air Force, I tend to continue to wear the Air Force garb.

Jane Green, girl what were you thinking. Did you even proof read it. Its like you put your makeup on in the dark for the first time and then walked out in broad day light. I loved Jane Green's Jemmima J. (funny light book for a rainy day). I don't know what happen with this one. Slow pace, no real depth to characters, vague plot. My niece gave me the book and I was bored to death so I read it. I do not recommend you spend your money on this. It doesn't even deserve one star.The main problem with this book is that it never got past the introduction!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is why \\"chick lit\\" has such a bad name. It's full of cliches, boring characters and has a ridiculous plot. It's as if the author was asleep when she wrote it. If she was,though, maybe she would've come up with an original idea. The main character, \\"Cath\\", is heartless and self-absorbed. Then you have the obligatory \\"gay man\\", the happily married couple,the glamorous bitchy friend, and the \\"perfect\\" boyfriend. It's chick lit by numbers and is absolutely awful. And the \\"AIDS\\" lecture at the end is insulting and out of place in a supposedly romantic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed with Green","review":"Bookends was definitely not one of Green's better books. I previously have read Jemima J and Mr. Maybe, but Bookends seemed to be too serious of nature with no exact plot. Maybe I wanted just a light-hearted book and it was the wrong time to read Green's novel, but her topic choice was boring for me. I never was truly engrossed in the novel. The book, like all of hers, was predictable but I also was not very intrigued by any of the characters. I felt some of their emotions but most of the time I never really cared what they were going to do next. I was very dissapointed with Green because I don't think it was one of her better efforts.If you're thinking of reading one of Jane Green's novels, I would suggest Jemima J before picking up Bookends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, almost impossible to get through","review":"This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Boring, boring, boring. It was supposed to be a fun, fast read and ended up being pure torture. There is nothing particularly likeable about the main character. There is nothing particularly interesting about the others. How does something like this get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"I somehow managed to make it through this book. The ending was horrible, and should have never passed the editors or publishers. I put this book down several times because of the way the characters were being developed. The one I truly liked was the one that was hurt at the end. It also made it look like no man was a decent man, yes good men are hard to find, but I don't believe everyone of them would be horrible. It looks like Jane was in a \\"I don't like men\\" mood when she wrote this. I was sad that I wasted my money on this. There are other British Books to buy, just don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST book I've ever read!!","review":"I can't believe I finished it, and I only did because I bought the book and didn't want to waste 15 bucks! (Even though I did)This book is soooooooo super boring... Nothing happens in the main charaters life unil the middle of the book... then something random happens, then back to boring. The writter ofen forgets what she was talking about and skips stuff she previously mentioned. Then when something life changing happens, she remembers!Blah Blah Blah.. SOMETHING RANDOM AND UNEXPECTED.. Blah Blah Blah.. OF THE WALL OCCURRENCE.. and so on, and so on...This book was horrible! I've heard that Jane Greens other books are great, but I don't think I'll ever buy a Jane Green book ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your three hours","review":"I bought this book because I loved Jane Greene's previous novel, Mr. Maybe. However, I was greatly disappointed by this recent effort. Maybe it's unfair to compare her books, but I am (although i would never admit it to many people) a fan of this \\"girl looking for love\\" genre of books, and this was probably one of the most boring ones I've read. Unlike Mr. Maybe, the writing was simply boring and the dialogue was stilted and the plot was predictable from the very beginning. Many other books in this genre are predictable as well but you read to find out how the ending happens. In Bookends, I read it halfway and was so bored by the story and characters that I didn't even want to finish it. I thought a lot of the side stories were unnecessary and didn't really serve a purpose and the character development, wait..what character development. Anyway, if you're going to read a Jane Greene novel, Mr. Maybe is the one to go with. Its funny, sassy, witty, and much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass!","review":"Don't waste your time on this contrived, predictable story that feels like a rehash of the sitcom, \\"Friends.\\" (The story is not as funny or engaging as the TV show!) The storyline revisits old territory I consider more relevant and engaging to life in the early 1990's. For life in 2002, it's predictable, trite and out-of-step. I'm suspicious. To capitalize on Green's growing success in the field of \\"singleton stories,\\" did her publisher \\"resurrect\\" material that was written many years ago?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't too thrilled about it.","review":"I bought this book because I read Jane Green's two previous books (Jemima J and Mr. Maybe) and I liked them both very much. Someone told me that Bookends was so good, so that suggestion persuaded me to buy it. I love Jane Green's work, so what the heck, right?! Big mistake! This book was so boring, not at all exciting or romantic like I would expect from the author. I couldn't really relate to the characters and I had a difficult time liking them or being sympathetic towards them. I kept on reading it hoping that the plot would somehow get more interesting or clever, only to reach the end more disappointed than when I first picked up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book.","review":"Having avoided \\"Jemima J.\\" and \\"Mr. Maybe\\" for many months at the bookstore where I work, I finally picked up \\"Bookends\\". What a disappointment! So many ends and no one to tie them...So many semi-interesting characters bumping into each other. I found Green's writing style somewhat jarring. Some scenes took pages and pages, while others were jammed five on a page. The intial exposition was rather boring, and after 20 pages or so of straight description, I was thinking of giving up.I did enjoy the bookstore setting, and felt that more could have been done with that. At a certain point, with the relationship aspects, I began to think, \\"Get on with it, already!\\" Points off for boring dialogue, a child and a nanny who got on my nerves, and \\"fill-in-the-blank\\" stereotypes for characters. Points for a bit of charm, an engaging premise and the fact that I actually DID finish it so somehow I cared what happened to at least a few of these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Green's Best","review":"This novel is not what Jane Green normally produces. There was so much going on with the main character, Cath, and her friends that you never get to know her. There's way too much to the plot and not enough depth to cover it sufficiently. I was annoyed by the end of the book and flipping just to get to the all-too-predictable end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"This novel was hard to put down and was a fast read. Green does an excellent job pulling the reader into the story of a close-knit group of friends struggling through life's changes.There were a few instances when things I noticed in the writing style drew my attention away from the story line, but those instances definitely did not detract from Green's adept usage of character development and plot.Overall, it's a lighthearted, enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Fun, But Gets Preachy","review":"As a fan of Jane Green's inital novels, I expected Bookends to be yet another lighthearted, side-splitting read. However, as I waded through the fairly shallow plot, I became more and more dissatisfied, as if I could feel there was a better/ more interesting and captivating story that could be told.Then suddenly, approximately three-quarters of the way through, almost an entire chapter was made to feel like a propoganda pamphlet. I wasn't sure if I was reading a piece of literature from one of my favorite authors, or a weepy, overemotional brochure that could be picked up in any medical clinic. The original, albeit weak, plot was lost, and I was left feeling slightly chastened.All in all, Bookends was interesting, but nothing to go out of your way to read. The last quarter is preachy, and the plot gets lost. Mediocre and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from a friend or the library","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and am extremely relieved I did not buy it myself. While the plot and characters had excellent potential, it was never fulfilled. The writing style in this book really distracted me from what could have been a good story. Green uses too many long descriptive passages to describe situations and does not develop other situations fully. Others are just plain unbelievable (i.e., Cath discussing her bookstore dream and Lucy calling on the very next page, wanting to collaborate). I had picked the book up for light reading, but had expected much better (more like Bridget Jones)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I have read all of Jane Green's books and have enjoyed them all.Except for this one.This book is poorly written with Green refering to her characters by \\"my darling\\" \\"my love\\" and \\"my sweets\\" just ONE TOO MANY TIMES for my liking. The book, in my opinion, is totally predictable. Green does attempt to throw in some plot twists at the end but does such a poor job of working the twists into her writing, that it comes across as being unthought out.Read Bridget Jones again, don't bother wasting your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tad Bit Boring to be put in the Bridget Jones genre","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I tried to get into it, but Green's characters weren't developed enough to keep my interest.Read Last Chance Saloon by Marian Keyes instead. Seems like the same storyline, but so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Chick Lit","review":"This book starts off marvelously, introducing us to young people at the beginning of their university careers, with the foreshadowing that they will have an impact on one another's lives forever. The characters are carefully drawn and the situations believable. But alas, then they graduate. Much of what happens to them as adults is highly predictable. I was only carried along by the sizzle and excitement of the early chapters. This is my second Jane Green book, and the second time she's underwhelmed me. From now on, when I need a Chick Lit fix, I'll stick with the superior Marion Keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best chick lit reads","review":"I've only recently begun to read the \\"chick lit\\" genre. Initially I was hesitant about reading \\"chick lit\\" books until I read both of the Bridget Jones books and Can You Keep A Secret. After those books, I was a convert, so I picked up \\"Bookends\\" with the expectation that I'd be laughing out loud again in no time.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Not only was \\"Bookends\\" not that funny, it meandered all over the place. I was looking forward to reading about Cath, the narrator, but I felt like her storyline- her relationship with James after spending years avoiding becoming involved with men- was treated like an afterthought. I was glad she also branched out career-wise with the bookshop, but that wasn't an interesting story. Lucy and Josh's marital issues weren't explored all that fully, and then it got unexpectedly serious with Si's shocking news.I'm still going to read \\"chick lit\\" books, but I'm glad this isn't the first one that I picked up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE JANE GREEN - but BOOKENDS was PATHETIC","review":"As for my background with Jane Green - I thoroughly enjoyed reading both Jemima J and Mr. Maybe in 2 days (you know how it is, you just cant put it down!) and I've been anticipating Bookends' arrival since early in the year. Just got back from Japan the other day, and read it last night - IT WAS SHOCKING! I hated it - the style was Jane Green, but it just lagged, and was boring, and sometimes I felt like closing the damn thing - now we all know thats a little odd cosidering its a Green book. Oh well - I just would NOT recommend this, but Green's others, I would in a heartbeat!!!!!!! DONT READ THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I don't usually do reviews, but I always read them before I order books.

What a boring, lifeless piece of junk. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun chick-lit","review":"In the tradition of celebrated chick-lit authors worldwide, such as Marian Keyes and Cathy Kelly, comes Jane Green in all her wonderful literacy talent.Bookends was, in short, brilliant. I couldn't put it down from the first page to the last page. It is the tale of friends, of bookstores and all the things that happen in between.I love books that have bookstores in them. The Three Sisters Island Trilogy by Nora Roberts is one of my very favourites, and have always adored the concept of a bookstore/cafe. There is something about a bookstore in a book that brings it to life.Previously my favourite book by Jane Green was Jemima J, but this one has been elevated to first place, and anyone that has read it can definitely understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, light-hearted & a great escape","review":"I think it .. started off a little slow .. but once I got into it .. had a hard time putting it down .. really enjoyed it.it was fun .. a great escape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU PEOPLE SERIOUS?!","review":"Jane Green is the WORST author I've EVER read.It is quite remarkable that she CONTINUES to get published!The worst drivel I've ever read: ALL OF JANE GREEN'S BOOKS.Stop wasting your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah it was definitly a torture B'&#304;G T&#304;ME","review":"i hate this book i really regret reading this book spending my money and my time.i thought it was going to be good as always cz its jane green but no definitly a B'&#304;G NO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.","review":"This was a somewhat enjoyable book until about 2/3 of the way through it.

I have to resist the urge to pick up a copy of her newest books from AmazonUK even before they are published here. Usually, I loss that fight and have to pay international shipping costs :)Anyway ---- \\"Bookends\\" is a wonderful character and plot driven escape into the lives of 4 London chums from college. While they might be a bit cliche' : the sophisticate, the gay guy, the young hip heterosexual male, and the slightly overweight smart girl, I found them heartwarming and very charming. I wanted to know their tales and find out how they got to where they are today. I loved the bookstore setting and found main character Cath (the slightly overweight one) very interesting and charming.Jane Green hits again with \\"Bookends\\" - which is a great and fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Read","review":"Another winner from Ms. Green. This book is a light, witty read based around a character named Cath and her close-knit group of friends from college. We follow the lot of them as they make their way through their early thirties, bust mostly we watch as Cath matures and learns to let go of the past in order to embrace the possibilities of the future. This is a great novel to take to the beach or read over the weekend to relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookends","review":"As I have said before I really enjoy Jane Green's work. Her novels are light and funny with story lines interesting enough to keep you reading late into the night. \\"BOOKENDS\\" was no different. The story of four college friends Cath, Si, Josh and Portia who after a series of events begin to drift away from the beautiful and very wealthy Portia only to attempt to bring her back into the fold ten years later, is just as funny and engaging as any other of Green's novels. Bookends, however does have a serious side and touches on some important subjects which Green, in my opinion, did masterfully. She was able to write about a very serious subject without changing the tone of her novel and still managing to keep you wanting more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"(2.5 Stars) Not Her Best Work...","review":"Bookends follows the life of frumpy, 30-something \\"Cath\\" and her cliched circle of college friends as she decides to quit her high-paying job and fulfill her dream of opening a local bookshop. The characters for the most part lack substance or chemistry, and do nothing to distract from the predictable plot. Jane Green is a good author, but this is far from her best work. Instead I'd check out \\"Jemima J\\" or \\"Mr. Maybe\\", two of her previous books which succeeded in ways that this one failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melrose Place moves to London!!!","review":"This book was really great. It took my alittle while to get into it but half way through I was hooked. I could really relate to Cath and couldn't believe how lucky she was to meet a guy like James. Truth be told, I can't believe any guy would put up with that much in real life!!!This is my second Jane Green book and she is definetly one of the leaders in Chicklit. But I do have to admitt that I liked Mr Maybe better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bookends Blathers On and On and On.....","review":"Minimum review length is 20 words. Twenty words is too much to describe this incredibly boring, insipid book. I read a lot and I can't recall when I haven't finished a book. Same with movies. I never walk out of them. I feel there has to be some redeeming quality. With Bookends, however, I just couldn't go on. Plot thin. Characters lifeless. Dialogue lazy. Just not worth it. Too many other good books out there to pick from. Like other reviewers of this book have said, -- I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most definately enjoyable!","review":"This is my 3rd Jane Green book and already plan to start my 4th tonight. I really enjoy her as an author. This book kept me interested 100% of the time while there were no major plot turns, there were still twists that kept the pages turning. I gave it a 4 because it didn't leave me with that, \\"I LOVE THIS BOOK!\\" feeling like babyville did but it was still highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foursome","review":"Bookends is such a brilliant read! This is a story about a former foursome from college, who looses one and gains another (Lucy) via marriage. The one they loose lives her life in the spotlight (Portia), while everyone else pursues marriage (Josh & Lucy), deals with infidelity, adjusts to life with children (Max), focus' on career changes, sees friendships come & go, and tries to find happiness overall. Finding happiness is what Bookends is all about.This \\"beach read\\" takes you on a journey into the lives of five twenty-somethings, searching for their place in this world. Two of the twenty-somethings find their place at Bookends. The other three find their place too. Have you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendships are tested","review":"Simon, Portia, Cath, and Josh were the best of friends in college. Portia eventually broke apart from ther group, while the other 3 continued their strong friendship into their 30s. At a pivotal moment in the lives of all 3, Portia surprises them by showing back up in their lives and things get very complicated.I liked Jemima J by Jane Green better than this book, but I certainly would consider this a good read. I even splurged and purchased it in the hardcover version (because the paperback took so long to be published).I think with most books there is a certain level of predictability but, again, Jane Green manages to through an unexpected twist or two into this novel as she did with Jemima J. One excellent thing about this book is the 'true to life' qualities it has - marital troubles & other relationship woes, occupational changes after starting your career, tension between best friends, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've only read a few of Jane Green's books and this one was not one of my favorites. It was boring and hard for me to get into. It was not about what I thought it would be and seemed to be more about Cath and Si. Not one of the better books. So far Mr. Maybe is one of my favorites by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first Jane Green book I read","review":"Cath,Si,Josh and Portia were first at University until then there was a falling out and Portia left the group. A few year later, Cath is working at job that she no longers likes. Spirited on by Josh's wife Lucy, Cath decides to open her own bookstore. Along with this life changing event, Portia is back in the group, but what are her motives?I have admit that the first book that I read by Jane Green \\"Jemima J\\" I could not stand. But I have to say that I did really like \\"Bookends.\\" Ms. Green gave her characters real emotions. The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that the HIV story line should have been brought earlier in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY light and superficial","review":"I was disappointed by the book. Amazon readers recommended it for lovers of Marian Keyes's books, but does not even come close to hers. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is predictable and the language is unimaginative. A loss of time, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Man, did this book d-r-a-g. The characters were stereoptypical, the story trite, and the ending predictable.

It was a little boring and I never finished it. On the other hand, Mr. Maybe and Jemima J. were awesome.Jill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but Odd","review":"Great artwork. Intriguing story that gets...very wierd. Hard to follow. It's like David Lynch on (even more) acid. Kindof a shame since it's an interesting concept, but one almost gets the feeling that the writers tried to do way too much with it. Artwork still makes it worth watching.

Well, this anime follows the same \\"mood\\" of Evangelion and the same complexity of Ghost In The Shell.

I thought it was different then the other ones I have and been buying thats also why I really liked this one.It's really worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"A freaky dark sci-fi series. It has a unique art style that I haven't seen before. The voice acting was excellent as well. It earned a 16+ rating due to its dark nature, and earned it justly. It's not a series small children would understand and enjoy. I loved it, though and I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best anime out there!","review":"Lain is a wonderful anime filled with a gripping plot and interesting story line. But I reccomend getting the entire series at once"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to enjoy it, but I just dont get it","review":"I love Anime and while I enjoy the genre immensely, I just did not like this series. I know that I am in the minority and I bought this DVD on the strength of all these reviews, but I found the entrire seires, incredibly slow and overwhelmingly boring.The quality of the animation is very good and the design of the characters and computers is top notch, but the story is so unbelievably lacking that I had to force myself to watch the entire thing and was absolutely disappointed at the end.I am not one of those people who need constant action or wanton violence to enjoy a movie either. I love great plot and strong dialogue, but this series does not have it in my opinion. This series is just a graphic art showcase of images that while beautiful, do not create a decent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lain is Freaky","review":"The Lain series has all the strangeness of 2 full seasons of the X-Files. Even though I never really fully understood what was happening (even at the end of the series! need to watch again...) I was eager for more and more. The opening theme song is cool (you won't tire of hearing it), the animation is nice and clean, and the voices are good. If you are going to buy this DVD - you should buy the other 3 too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Computers and Schoolgirls, what more do you want?","review":"Hello Navi.The first time I watched Lain, I was hooked. From the menu screen to the extras at the end, Lain is striking. The animation is very well done, and the plot is wonderfully cyber-punk. Each episode gives only enough information to keep you asking questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are all connected...","review":"A very different Anime. If you're expecting big robots, massive gun battles and some hillariously shoddy dialogue, look somewhere else. Lain will make you think. Mostly, 'what is going on?' you'll either love it or hate it. I won't go into the plot, doesn't matter what you read, you need to see it to understand. Or atleast to decide for yourself. If you want to see something different, beautifully animated and thought provoking get this now. Its the best original anime in a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow moving, yet gripping.","review":"This anime is very hard to describe, as it encompasses so much. Only rented the first four \\"layers\\" but that is enough to make me want to buy the rest. There is so much depth to every frame that I will be watching it over and over again. It starts with one of Lain's classmates committing suicide and then things get really weird. Can't really say too much more, or the story will be given away. But the way the story is revealed is really slow, and almost non-linear. If you have the patience and the time to watch more than the first two episodes, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, But Not for Everyone...","review":"I'm sure that one could find as many people who hated Lain as who loved it. There's not much in the way of middle ground for this enchanting, completely original animated serial.By today's standards, Lain moves very slowly, but that is a large part of the appeal. The story is unfolded so lovingly and deliberately, that by the end, you're desperate for more. And the series gets better with each set, up to the rousing climax in Reset.If you're a fan of 2001 you'll very likely enjoy Lain as well. Much like 2001, the Lain series examines humanity and its origins through the ways in which we interact with technology. And also, as in 2001, this exploration is done with stunning imagery and visuals.Lain is unlike any other animation you've probably ever seen. For those who decide to purchase it, please have some patience and give the story time to develop. You'll be glad that you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I thought that it was very confusing and hard to follow. Someone else may get it but I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Purchase!","review":"From the beginning, I'd like to say how much I was disappointed by this DVD. It looks good, but it's got a very slow-moving plot and is very boring to watch. I really couldn't believe how bad it was.There really wasn't a plot that I could point out to you. Basically, the main character is this shy girl that no one pays much attention to. A girl at her school kills herself and she starts receiving e-mail messages from her. She gets a new computer, is accused of being at some party, and is mocked by her \\"friends\\". It really doesn't make sense and is VERY slow moving. There's this side plot about some guy getting high off of some drugs and he is at \\"the party\\" and starts trying to kill people. It's very strange and doesn't make sense. I recommend that no one buy this and be as disappointed at wasting money on it like I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"read my review","review":"I have read some reviews for lain that say that it is too hard to follow, and that they couldn't stomach the first episode. Neither could I. but than i watched the the next three.And than i watched them again... and then i kinda started too get it. and it blew my mind.It says 16 and over on the box, but i think, purely content wise, it is a 13 and up. It features some profanity, but mostly just in the episode \\"religion\\".BUY IT BUY IT!! it is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'must see' for any serious anime fan","review":"I purchased the first DVD mostly out of curiosity, then after watching the 1st 4 episodes, immediately went out and purchased the rest. The only thing missing is an ongoing plot that could spawn OVA's and feature films, as everything 'ends' in the last episode (no spoilers, you'll have to see what I mean, and I guarantee you'll be surprised). Since it seems to have preceded both 'The Matrix' and 'Ghost in the Shell' I expect that the writers of both would have been inspired by it directly. If you are into computers, if you are into the paranormal, or if you've ever questioned your own existence, it's a must-see. There seems to be at least some influence from 'Akira' and 'Roujin Z', especially in the last 2 episodes. No doubt this series was influential in '.hack/sign' as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Cyberpunk Mystery","review":"Lain is an introverted 13-year-old girl with few friends and a dull life. That is, until a girl at her school commits suicide and a week later her classmates receive e-mails from her. Lain soon receives the startling e-mail herself: \\"I still live here, I just abandoned my body.\\" Lain now wonders just if the real world and the Wired world inside the computers are really that different, or is there some connection? This DVD contains the first four episodes of the series. You'll constantly find yourself asking \\"What the heck's going on?!\\" but it only deepens the mystery. This contains both english and japanese dialogue with optional subtitles and a few extras, and is well worth the price. Be forewarned though; this DVD has been rated 16+ due to some disturbing images (suicide, murdering, drug-related scene) and is definitely not for kids, or people who don't like to think while watching their anime. Still, I suggest checking it out. It may hook you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have Cyber-Mystery Drama","review":"This is an incredibly animated drama about the relationship between the \\"Wired World\\" and the real world, and how Lain is connected to it all. The story is very layered and in the beginning, may be confusing, but as the mystery unfolds, it becomes more and more intriguing and clear. The animation is absolutely gorgeous. I already have the fan-subtitled series but I MUST HAVE the DVD (Pioneer does an incredible job digitally mastering animes on DVD). That's how good it is. It's already won some National Cultural award in Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reason they give you 4 episodes on this one...","review":"This series doesn't get interesting until the last 30 seconds of the fourth episode. And even then, it doesn't get very interesting, at least not interesting enough to spend more money.The characters are very bland, and there is no empathy for their plights. The first episode is about a girl committing suicide- but why do I care? That question isn't answered, and her death is virtually meaningless.Is this series worth watching? Maybe. It has interesting ideas about the future of computing. Is it really worth watching all the way through? No, the entire series is as discordant and unworthwhile as this DVD, and much of it is RECYCLED FOOTAGE.A friend of mine suggested that you could reproduce the entire series using nothing but the first four episodes, and with the costs of DVDs, it is probably worth your while to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm really sorry to say this, but this anime is simply BORING. I've seen a couple of other anime films before, some good, some bad, yet one more time, nothing SO boring. Just think, the picture on your screen stays exactly the same for about half a minute, without anybody saying anything...and on the length of the whole episode just nothing significant happens or is said... It's not thoughtful or philosofical or anything, just...boring :) I really wonder how people could compare this anime to Neon Genezis Evangelion, which is really high quality film by the way, or any other good anime..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serial Experiments - Lain - the strangest series of all time","review":"Even after just a few minutes of watching this series I was already completely and utterly lost. The plot is so strange and hard to follow I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. This is about a girl who commits suicide and somehow her consciousness is able to pass through the internet. Her friend somehow communicates with her through her computer. I do not recommend this to anyone. Whoever can understand this crazy plot is undoubtedly crazy themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Anime Ever","review":"This is absolutely the worst anime I have ever seen. The story is slow, predictable and full of the same flashbacks ad nausiun. The artwork is boring.Just awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know I'm in the minority :-(","review":"Ok, lain is a series followinga young girl named Lain through her odyssy of computers, I really don't understand why so many people liked this, It has good animation, good voice acting and Lains character design isn't bad but the story was just strange, I found no attachment or empathy towards any of the characters and I had no Idea what the hell was going on, the only thing that attracted me to this video in the first place was I liked the opening and ending segments (which I still think are pretty good) so unless you get off on this type of freaky stuff I'd strongly recomend you stay away from this, or at least rent it to see what you think first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pretty...but vacuous","review":"As beautiful as the animation often is, this has to count as a disappointment. At first sight you may think you're seeing some serious ideas about identity, and about the relationship between the real world and the virtual. But the writers apparently thought long, portentous silences and willful obscurity were acceptable substitutes for well-thought out themes and genuine insights. It's hard to care very much about Lain, with her constant gasps and maddening passivity, and everyone else in the series fades into gray. By the end it's clear the writers have lost track of whatever it was they were really trying to say. I wish I had nicer things to say about the series, but the visual look is really the only exceptional thing about it. Serial Experiments may be a break from the usual pyrotechnics and fisticuffs, but today's anime fans have a right to expect more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better","review":"Don't let this volume put you off the series. Things get much more interesting with episode #5. Yes, it's hard to get past the English voice acting, particulary for Lain and her friends, but stick with it, it's worth it. It could be that the actors speak the way they do to symbolize how disconnected people are from each other, or maybe the voice actors just stink. I bought this, watched it, and let it sit on my shelf, but I kept reading folks on Amazon saying how great the series is, so I decided to give it another chance and bought the second disc, and then finally discs 3 and 4 as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched it once... bought the rest of the series immediately","review":"The four episodes on this DVD are just an intriging warmup... If you like slow moving anime and not a ton of action this is for you... if your looking for Fist of Northstar anime this is probably not for you. The best comparison I can make is probably Aeon Flux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite dull","review":"When I rented the 1963 \\"Lord of the Flies\\" movie on VHS, I expected to see a gripping, thrilling tale, dramatic, and disturbing. But what do I see? A bunch of clean, orderly looking boys with their hair neatly combed saying their scripted lines with absolutely no feeling or enthusiasm. The film doesn't even explain what the \\"lord of the flies\\" actually is. (If you want to find out what the lord of the flies is, read the book). If I had watched the movie without having read the book, I would have thought it was a great movie, and that the book couldn't be too much better. But instead, I sat through the whole 90 minutes, recalling parts of the book that were left out or changed in favor of something much more boring or unrealistic.My advice...read the book, and don't waste your time with this movie, it's horrible.Thank goodness I only rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad try!","review":"The 1990 version of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was a terrible recreation of the 1963 version. The 1990 version although made to fit modern times, was terrible. I feel that too many little things in the movie were changed, changing the feel the original \\"Lord of the Flies\\" gives you. While I watched the 1990 version all I could do was laugh. The characters in the 1990 version,ran around acting like idiots, and cursed alot, all the cursing and no character development took away from the meaning of the film. The 1990 version was so untrue to the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"Not as good as the second one (1990). It's filled with bad child actors, and seems to skip through a little too quickly without explaining what's going on very well. The book is much better in this regard of course. As usual, read the book. As a film, this just isn't very good. As a look into the savagery encoded in everyone, even the most highly educated well-mannered English boys, it's an excellent lesson in sociology and psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the book more...","review":"The movie was not as good as the book plain and simple and some of the scenes were choppy. Not to mention the acting was pretty bad (i.e Piggy meets ralph in the beginning of the film). and the didn't do the scene where simon talk to the pigs head. And compared to the book it was somewhat boring, so save yourself time and go read the book, but if for some reason you need to know the basic story line, I guess you can watch the movies, but I restate the movie is inferior to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the swearing go!!!","review":"Although William is a genius, the director of the movie stinks. They even let a 12 year-old kid say \\"*%$& you!\\" or \\"Bull@#%&\\". Well, these does not shown in the book anyway. If you think that's cool, spend some time on praying to God instead. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential? eeeeh!","review":"what I hate about criterion is they're overpriced this art house version is stripped down without the goodies! read the book way back in the day the movie did not live up to expectation problem with movies with kids is the bad acting! interesting story-line but loses focus & somewhat dull. survivor t.v. show in it's original form? every season should have a piggy character and gets killed by other tribe members!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad adaptation.","review":"Some books should not be attempted as movies, this clearly is one of them. If you just watch the film instead of reading Golding's story, you'll be missing out on much of the wonderful symbolism, the character development and most bizarre of all, the actual Lord Of The Flies itself. It would seem logical that some of the more disturbing parts of the book would be minimized on screen but the amount of this story that was neglected to turn this tragic tale into a film is criminal, might as well be a different story. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"The Lord of the Flies DVD was a gift for my fiance. He was very excited to unwrap this gift, but we were both very upset when we placed it in the DVD player. The DVD did not work. I'm not pleased with this purchase and will not be buying from the seller ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremly terrible adaption from the original.","review":"I can't believe what has happened to this wonderful, but creepy story. It has been chopped, and rearranged in a very awkward manner. Some important and key scenes aren't in the story at all! The movie didn't even exploit the message in the tale of man's dark nature. If Golding saw the movie version of his famous book, I think he would have been very disappointed. If I had it my way, I would had rearranged the story like the original. Read the book, its better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"I literally thought that this is one of the best movies ever. If you've read the book...You have to see the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See for Film History Buffs","review":"From an historical perspective on English language cinema, this film should not be missed or avoided by any true aficionado. Even outside of the sharp observatory interest in the plot and social subject matter of the original book, the actual undertaking of the task to film this many children on a seemingly deserted island near Jamaica in the 1960s is worth examining on its own merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a good look into the mirror and at your neighbors","review":"Read the book years ago. The movie does an excellent job of re-creating the authenticity of the book. We've been brought up to hide from our natures, only to make us even more so just beneath the surface. We see this brutal and honest film and want to think it's just a story, but it's not. It's raw and scary. It's probably too adult for the average viewer. We can't withstand that long, hard stare into the mirror. It's a gritty art film. This film was not meant to be an entertainment film but rather a think piece with a point. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"savage","review":"i am speechless about this film.i knew boys were rough but these boys were savages.they formed a \\" tribe \\"which gets too out of control and there ends up to be an extreme tradgedy. other than the violence and gore, it is an outstanding film, its very realistic and most enjoyable and a must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good adaptation of the book","review":"I have just finished watching this on T.C.M. and I can say that this movie is very close to the novel. I still kind of like the book better though. My guess is, the reason this film is in black and white is because of a budget shortage, and there is some book material missing. Other than that, this was a definite classic, and who says old movies are not good anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do the book justice","review":"I read this book for a school assignment and was affected by the plot. The complexity of the symbolism and how true it is to society shone out in the book. The film doesn't do the book justice as all. I feel that some of the dialogue that was cut out was essential to the plot and some scenes cheapened the meaning, making it almost laughable. The actors tried, they really did, I loved the performance by the actor who played Jack. But what happened to Roger in the movie? He was mostly cut out, except to suddenly appear out of nowhere to kill Piggy. Simon, who is my favourite character from the book, was played by an actor well suited to what he looked liked and how he acted, but there wasn't many chances in the movie to show Simon in the way he was intended to be shown. There was so much potential in this movie, but it just doesn't meet what I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly portrayed Goldings intentions","review":"This film was a slap in the face towards William Golding. The fact that crutial scenes were intentionally left out, lowered the quality and over-all feel of the story. By watching this movie alone the audience does not get the true sence of the savageness and chaos that the boys faced on the island. The book was an excellent example of great literary achievement, this movie makes it seem like joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"The point, I think, of making a novel into a movie is to take the text and replace it with a visual. In this case, and in most cases, all the awesome good bits of the text are butchered in the name of artisitc license. Well \\"boo\\" to that! I cringe when my students ask to see the movie after we read the book, because it's just not the same. Where's the part with Simon and the head? And what's the deal with the parachutist? Those are important elements of the text that are either glossed over, mangled, or removed completely. I object to such tinkering with greatness! The merit in such films is only to encourage students to write reviews or to compare/contrast. Any other use, such as a substitution for the text, is not reccomended. Rhetorical question: Why don't film makers create a real version of the text? Enough said. Just read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Buy the 1990 verson instead\\"","review":"\\"That's it; That's all there is to it.

It is certainly better than the 1991 version which is godawful in its interpretation and overall ravaging of the powerful book.The too-fast pace and omissions of important details did take away from the story but they're really not too noticeable. The acting by the British schoolboys was perfect and they were all quite believable in their roles. The black and white cinematography really added to the film, I thought, in that it made it starker and harsher. Simon's death scene is a confusion of black and white flashes, screaming, and then a silence that is more poignant than any overbearing music score.This is one of my all-time favorite books and I'd love to see a movie version done in color, but FOLLOWING the book (I choose to disregard the disgraceful recent film version).Overall, definitely a worthy adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now we know","review":"Because she was largely unknown to listeners at the time of this release in 1974, Marlena humorously titled this album accordingly. As much an entertainer as she was a gifted singer, this is her bestselling Blue Note release and one firmly enmeshed in black feminist thought.

He gives his best performance in this comdy-drama, that makes you first laugh out loud and then want to cry for these people.

Also great performances from Shirley MacLaine and Fred McMurray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemmon's Best","review":"What can I say about this movie? Just watch it. Lemmon gives the performance of his life. MacMurry is wonderfully detestable and Shirly Maclaine is piteable and sympathetic.Lemmon does a marvelous job with his character, making him by turns funny and sad. No wonder it won Best Picture.

I just wish I could be as enthusiastic about this DVD release. The DVD seems to have been taken from a less-than-perfect copy of the film, with lots of dirt and scratches (artifacts) and so much edge enhancement that the pictures literally jumps and skitters on the screen. The onderful early scene in the office are ruined by the amount of shimmer and shake on the screen. Maybe someday the movie will be given a delux treatment and cleaned up. We can only hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"A classic, well worth seeing again. The writing, the dialogue, the acting, cinematography.

For those who haven't seen it, it is a romantic comedy with a bit of a serious tone in the mid section, from which the film recovers quite nicely....

The two things I can say for director Billy Wilder are that he was a clever writer and that he was able to keep your interest. But this movie left me with a bad feeling, making light of suicide and adultery, and constantly bringing you back and forth between laughter and sadness. Shirley MacLaine is the saddest character on there, and the only thing Jack Lemmon can suggest for her is that her despair over life will pass. There's nothing beneficial about this movie, from a moral standpoint, except that Jack Lemmon sacrifices his job at the end in order to be faithful to Shirley MacLaine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bworth in Boston","review":"This was one of the dullest movies I've ever watched!

I am approximately half way through and can tell you that it is definitely hard, but not that hard.It isn't so much that this game is hard... it is that other games are so easy. Let's face it, console games are pretty much dumbed down so that your average 12 year old can play them. To make it easier, many games allow you to save at pretty much any time.This game makes you save at certain locations and it doesn't hold your hand and always point you in the right direction. In that respect, it is basically the same as most games were 15-20 years ago.So rather than the constant focus on the difficulty of this game, perhaps eveyone's attention should be focused on why most other games are dumbed down so far that your average jungle monkey could play them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"its not perfect, but it plays and handles supperbly.

How you ask? Who the hell knows the game starts off without telling you much.The game play is pathetic; controls are iffy, 'combos' are weird to execute.Graphics wise, the game isn't half bad, but if you look at the biceps of the first boss, you think you're playing on the PSX or something.Enemy AI ....what's that? Cause I don't think it was incorporated at all. The enemies just mindlessly swing at you really, all of which are easily dispatched.Overall in my opinion this game stinks....if you're an old fan, then I guess you'll like it, I'll stick to old school Ninja Gaiden myself.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but next to impossible","review":"The graphics and gameplay are fantastic!

A sleek action game that runs in full 1080p, Sigma includes features new to the PS3 version such as the ability to play as Rachel, new weapons, and a couple of new bosses. The camera is still a bit annoying in some places but is an improvement from the Xbox version.

Starting it off with Roll,Roll which has a clever chorus. Following it is Big Toys which features Mac.Krazy and D.I.G. which has great lyrics. Whodi which could be one of the best songs on the album is one of the tightest songs of the year. Next is the club song Wobble Wobble which is tight. The rest of the album is tight and it comes to an end with Souljas featuring Snoop,Krazy, and P. That could be the other best song on the album with a tight beat and great lyrics.

The human race was long overdue to have someone step out of the shadows of organized religion and all the fear-based theologies and finally bring the true nature of God to the forefront. You may not agree with everything said in Neale's books, and you don't have to. Simply take the concepts and apply them to your life and see what happens. No longer must we fear things like Hell and Satan, as this book makes very clear, we have made them both up. We created Satan and Hell in order to scare people into behaving as we would like them to behave, when the truth is God is ALL there is! He is in everything and works and moves through everything. Do yourself a favor and read his books, and when you're done, recommend them to everyone you know. They will thank you for doing so. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so Fundamental, but realistic","review":"If you have read any of Neale's previous works you will recognize many excerpts.

Not really a new idea but I give Neale 5 stars as a contributor to wishing peace in a time of turmoil.

Here, he plays dumb, asking God questions and receiving the answers like these ideas are all new to him and he hasn't written five or six books previously devoted to bringing this same message. Oh, don't forget the audio tapes, study guides, meditation cards, etc. Okay, maybe he uses a few different words and phrases and applies them to current events. But he's saying the SAME THING.

It would be useful to know how to make acquaintances through questions like \\"What is your name?\\" We only learn formal forms of address. Another gripe that I have is that the pronunciation is not consistent. There is too much of an emphasis on translation from English into Polish and not enough on trying to think in the language.

To me that would infer that \\"evolution\\" took place in our 6 literal days of creation here on earth. It's the worst logic of both \\"sides\\" of the debate. Things just don't evolve; they adapt, they mutate, they change, they're genetically enhanced through selective breeding. There's a big difference.I finally had to shut it off mid-way through the story. I could try to explain more but I think they do a better job on the Answers in Genesis website.In the meantime, steer clear of this movie.

I was so disappointed. The premise is flawed from the very start. The young college students attempt to justify evolution by manipulating the integrity of what God meant when He created the world. They leave out some very important issues that make their approach impossible. For example, Biblically, there was no death until sin entered the world by Adam and Eve's disobedience. This video begins with a presupposition that evolution is true and Christians need to find a way to justify the Bible. Christians need to start with the Bible and wait for science to catch up.

He didn't share her faith, but soon saw that her loving care was DRIVEN BY her quiet yet solid faith!(what a story, what a LESSON I'm praying many of my own fellow Christians will come to practice!!)I too thoroughly believe in creationism as Kerry and her family, so the above actually made the 'creation-evololution=coexistence' seem more of a sub-plot. My Christian landlord was excited about this part, though, and is already sharing this concept with many of his 'evolution-only' colleagues (you can correct me if I'm not saying that properly).This is a keeper, worth watching again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was very good!","review":"First the Pros -The acting was very good. I enjoy hockey, in fact I use to play so that was a good bonus too.All of the actors did a good job from the two main stars all the way down to the actorswho had a far lesser role.The story was deep.The movie even had some comedy and it was written very well.The ending was VERY GOOD and it will greatly uplift you.Cons -They spent about 25 minutes in the middle of the movie trying to explainthe book of Genesis. I actually fast forwarded past a large part of thisbecause their theologies were very different than what the bible says,or what GOD has been teaching me. I found these 25 minutes to actually be offensivebecause they ignored some very basic principals in the book of Genesis.Besides their theological errors, the move was very well made and I can stillhighly recommend it as long as you realize their explanation of the creationmight not agree with what you have been taught."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO UN~BIBLICAL!!","review":"worst movie EVER!!

I watched most of it but just turned it off from sher exasperation. I was interested in this because I liked the main character who was in the Love Comes Softly series. I knew he could act and there were a lot of big names in this. The acting was my first problem with this movie. Even the people who knew how seemed to have trouble delivering their lines with enough feeling. But hey I knew what this movie was when I picked it up. I hung in there till the whole science explanation started and after about 30 min I got lost and bored and not just me my sister and my kids. So we fast forwarded and fast forwarded for a long while and just shut it off when there seemed to be no end in sight. I blame this movies faults on the editing staff.

It is a bland, unimaginative mix that proves that connections and lack of talent can make a DJ well known. I have heard DJs who have spun for less than a year do much better than this. DJ Enrie spins boring repetitive house that goes nowhere. The mixing is alright but there is nothing special that he is doing, just your regular 32 to 64 beat transitions. Also, do not let the cover fool you. He does no turntablism on this cd. I would recommend that DJ Enrie spend some quality time with his decks and figure out a way to be unique with his music. Riding a wave of the ordinary is nothing to be proud of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular tasting of Jimmy","review":"Jimmy Smith, the reigning B3 player of all time, was instrumental in ushering in the soul-jazz genre. These cuts show off his talents and the talents of his formidable sidemen. Mostly cuts from 56-60, with one from the 80's, they include some of his best solo work and his blazing speed. The Sermon and Back at the Chicken Shack and The Champ all show why Jimmy Smith reigns supreme and proves that his work influenced much of the music of the 60s and 70s. The end of The Champ could be confused as an Emerson, Lake and Palmer cut! If you've never heard Jimmy Smith before, this is the perfect album to get into his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jazz","review":"I first heard Jimmy Smith on a Sony Jazz completion I was given in college and I have loved Jimmy's music ever since. Anyway, you'll really enjoy this CD. I would say his music is very bluesy with a jazz groove. So if you like blues you'll love his music and this is a good sampling of his music. Also check out the stuff he did with Wes Montgomery and Kenny Burrell. This CD is a must for any jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of Universal's Holmes","review":"Universal made a series of Holmes with the dream cast of Rathbone and Bruce. They range in quality from awesome to yech! The House of Fear leans much further towards the awesome side, although my personal fave of the Universal series is the Scarlet Claw. Loosely based on the 5 Orange Pips, the short film packs the trademark Universal creepy landscape and plenty of shadows and secrets and people who aren't what they seem to be. It's elementary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic, the house of fear","review":"One of the best of Holmes and Watson, does a good job ofbuilding suspense until the ending.

I have contacted Amazon numerous times, one operator even gave me a UPS tracking number for the second box to be picked up and I still haven't received a call from UPS or had the box picked or received credit.

This one does not allow you to play together but against each other. Two players can fight each other as Zords, they say that's boring! They liked it for maybe 5 minutes, that's it. The whole idea is to fight bad guys right? It's even better having another PR to help. They'll play it alone but very seldom.

Two examples: page 34 \\"Our People's Fascination with Language\\" - he discusses the language at the time of the Egyptian slavery, as well as the modern archaeological findings relating to the hebrew alphabet; Page 80 ..another section that stirred our imaginations and inspired great discussion. Here he has created 9 imaginary vignettes of Israelite characters. Readings from Mr. Eson's Passover Haggadah have become the highlight of our seders and have stimulated wonderful discussions.

I feel that this is Mariah's best work and she sticks to this type of music, rather than using all of her hip-hop friends on her albums.I can not wait for the day when Mariah Carey produces an album without featuring any other artists. I think that she has more than all the talent in the world to get a number 1 album without all of the rap music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song , Great Heart","review":"The medley of the two songs was beautifully done especially with the high notes at the end of the song. She is getting better and better with the live performance of this song. If you compared the United We Stand and the Home for the Holidays, there's a big difference. The second track on this single is There for me, which is an unreleased track that she done quite awhile.

The first track is a medley of \\"Never too Far and Hero.\\" This track is a new rendition by Mariah herself. Her voice is very powerful on this track. The second track is \\"There for Me,\\" written by none other than Mariah and songwriter, Diane Warren (famous for songs like \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" or \\"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\\") I especially enjoy this track because Mariah's voice sound exceptionally like how she used to sing. One of my personal favorites, Mariah shouldn't have put this song on the B side of a single! It has great potential!

Instead, it is written by someone who calls herself a \\"loner\\" (without ever defining what that is) and it reads like self-justification. There are no gradations in Ms. Rufus' book. You're either a \\"loner\\" or you're part of \\"the mob.\\" There is a bitter tone in much of what she writes about nonloners. It's also filled with cliches (the Marlboro Man, Travis from Taxi Driver) that any of us who might think of ourselves as \\"loners,\\" or those more in need of solitude than the average Joe, would already be well aware of. A good idea for a book, but I was disappointed by the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Party of One/ Triumph of the Will of \\"Loners\\"","review":"I only read the first chapter and about half of the second before i had to stop reading, but it pretty much said loners embody the ideals of civilization and society while \\"the mob\\" is a bunch of conforming idiots who do not have valid opinions and who are \\"using\\" outdated behaviors that we evolved (forming groups, etc) instead of being gloriously secure with themselves and reasonable like the loners. The author to this book seems just as intolerant of \\"the mob\\"(which is a pretty conceited thing to say) as she claims the rest of society is towards loners. This book might be enjoyable if the author argued for \\"loners\\" and \\"the mob\\" to be tolerant of one another instead of saying \\"although they think their better than us, WE ARE IN FACT THE MASTER RACE!

The things I've never quite been able to put into words -- my skepticism about organized religion, for example -- she's found the expression for it.This book can serve two purposes, I think. It is good for the loner -- even though we don't mind feeling alone, it helps to be able to shove this under someone else's nose and say, see, I'm not crazy. Really, I'm not. But it also serves to explain those strange folks who are happy to be by themselves to the rest of the world. Not all loners are child molesters or potential axe murderers.This book demonstrates in clear, direct statements the benefits of having loners in society.

Rufus explores the common stereotypes of loners as misfits, criminals, and perverts, and debunks them by showing the valuable contributions loners have made to the creative arts, science, and technology. She challenges the assumption that it takes two to make a life event meaningful, and brings hope to those of us who may feel alone in our loner status.

The book seems poorly organized, resembling nothing so much as a long and rambling essay that is neither erudite nor particularly insightful.

It was a rite of passage for me to read and I didn't find it to be like one of those trendy self-help things. There aren't any online mail groups about this book which is nice and there aren't any workbooks either which is even better. No one is complaining or whining or asking for legislation. It's the perfect gift for you or your favorite introvert if they're not too busy with their own work to come to the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"A member of a quiet set speaks out","review":"The author explains many aspects of a loner's lifestyle, and how such a person interacts (or not) with society. The lives of both historical figures and contemporary celebrities are referenced. Many examples from pop culture are looked at. Being a loner is neither promoted nor explained away. The sentiments in this book are the result of an informed, unapologetic, balanced (and unpopulated) vantage point. No matter what degree of loner or sociable person you are, you will be informed by and be able to relate to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"The book showed up early, in near flawless condition even though the condition was listed as \\"acceptable.\\" I would recommend the seller and I highly recommend the book, even if you aren't a Loner yourself, it will provide interesting insight as to how we think and why we may come off as rude or aloof.

If you are looking for a deeper analyis, or something that inspires reflection, look elsewhere.Ill give her 2 stars for effort, study, and decent grammar."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite","review":"This book is more a platform for Ms. Rufus's political views than a manifesto on solitude.

I don't know about you, but I don't call that a \\"party of one\\" or a \\"loner.\\" I was annoyed at being misled by this person. She insisted that even though she lived in a house with her husband, she was a \\"loner.\\" I have edited my review to remove what subsequent review readers found offensive.

Imagine a book written by an artist trying to describe the same mountain a scientist is trying to describe. The artist would write things such as vibrant flora, majestic soaring peaks, and serene tranquility. The scientist would describe it as: Mount Everest. Elevation: 8,848 meters above sea level. Located in the Himalaya Mountain range in Tibet. It is two people describing the same mountain from very different perspectives. This book is like an artist is trying to describe and explain Mount Everest to the world. Anybody looking for a more logical perspective should pass.It is probably a good read if you're an artist trying to explain yourself to the world. It is probably not a good read if you're a scientist trying to explain yourself to you. I know that's a sweeping generalization, but that's the basic premise of this book.

He takes a look at the young warrior queen's life, by inserting supposed people and partial fact, which is fine for writing fiction. It isn't alright, in my opinion, to write as badly as he did and get published. I guess that makes me more angry at the publisher/editor than anything. The style goes from romantic to adventure to fantasy and descriptions of people become annoyingly repititious. For instance, Boudiccas historical husband, Chieftain Prasutagus, is referred to as \\"fat Prasu\\" not once or twice, but over fifty times in two chapters! Maybe he (Daniels) could find another adjective; I don't know. Since I am doing extensive research on the Life & Times of Boudicca, I thought this would be a helpful tool, but am terribly dissapointed. In my opinion, it is a supreme waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I ordered this book with a sense of excitement. I had hoped to uncover some of the mystery regarding this young woman. The details were few and far between. There was little emphasis on religion or early medicine As I was reading I was never able to \\"see\\" the brightly colored Celtic garments, or \\"smell\\" the Celtic campfires or \\"hear\\" the rumbling of the chariot wheels. There was too much emphasis on the passions betwixt and between the various characters. The author tried to cover too many characters stories and lost his story in the process. A good book maybe for the junior hign school level reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women lead the way.","review":"I loved the wide sweep of this book, particularly how the Druids were forced to reeavaluate their own ideals when faced with invasion not only by the Romans but by the early Christians whose peace loving mission robbed both Romans and Brits of their will to fight. No wonder it took 77 years to conquer Britain! The characters are impressive, particularly Boudicca herself, whose troubles mature her into readiness for her role as the leader of Celts who loved to fight each other as much as the Romans. Queen Cartimandua is one of the sexiest characters in literature and the chapter where poor Atak gets raped by the widow Angarad is one of the funniest. I learned a lot from this book. The research that went into it makes it into a credible journey through time. Women - especially Celtic women - will love it. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fable is not the history","review":"Simply McElvaine's book is a fable!.

In this book, Progressives and their actions are described with admiration and god-like reverence. Conservatives and their actions are described with disdain and contempt.Finally, the author is unprofessional in his obsession to discredit Ronald Reagan in a book about the Great Depression.

Just plain silly!! At this late date all but the most doctrinaire of socialists agree that the policies advocated by both Hoover and FDR were ruinous from an economic standpoint. No one before or since has advocated raising taxes, raising the price of material and labor, and demonizing the business sector (to say nothing of the other myriad benighted policies and palatives) during an economic downturn. That is why both the duration and severity of the \\"Great\\" Depression of the 1930's are unprecedented in this country. Additionally, the author betrays his childish biases by consistantly abandoning his stated topic to attack the economic policies of the 1980's. What is the connection?????????

It's more complete, the productions are excellent, and for people who aren't familiar with Royksopp this is a great seguay into that type of music.

I just can't. It's mundane dance pop. The music sounds like background music at the gap or old navy.I can't even enjoy Melody anymore, because I get depressed about what they became. Same reason my Liz Phair CDs have been collecting dust. Only This Moment is an ok song, but I really only enjoy the vocal.

There are a few good tracks that are reminiscent of Melody: Someone Like Me, Clean Sweep, and Triumphant.. they're \\"ok\\".

While the complaints about specific historical event being wrong maybe true, the social aspects are the importants points of the book.

When the author cannot bother to check simple facts like what sea is between Greece and Turkey (it's not the Ionian), or who was the first Democratic President after the Civil War (it wasn't Woodrow Wilson), how much faith can you put in his statements about the forces that gave rise to Florentine banking or the Free Silver movement?I have never read a book with so many stupid mistakes.

The upconverted 1080p output looks great on my 1080p HDTV (Sony 55A2000) when connected over HDMI. This player uses the same basic technology (Faroudja DCDi) as the highly-rated but slightly more expensive Oppo OPDV971H. If you own a 1080p TV and don't want to buy an expensive video scaler, the Samsung HD960 provides a very nice compromise solution for producing high-def output from your standard-def DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"never worked!","review":"This product came highly recommended by our AV guy who was putting together our media room. We purchased it (not through him) and he got it all installed and looked like everything was going well. About 20 minutes into playing the first DVD it \\"skipped\\". It dropped sound and picture for about 2 or 3 frames. At first we thought it was having a problem upscaling the dvd...but even at native resolution it continued. We contacted Samsung and were told we had to ship it to the service center in California. I talked to another AV guy who said they had an office FULL of these players that have quit working or have this skipping problem. Looks like we'll be buying the Toshiba to replace it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinking every 5 to 10 minutes","review":"I'm having the same exact problem as another reviewer here.

Now I am distracted while watching a movie because I'm waiting for the darn thing to blink again. I'm using the supplied HDMI cable routed through my receiver then out to HD monitor via another HDMI.

I'm in the process of returning this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"The image quality is ok but not great. The most annoying problem is that it will go blank on DVDs and silent on both DVDs and CDs. This happens often and randomly during playback.

This is great for me because I don't have the best track record with keep my fish alive and want to only buy fish which are easy to keep. The notes about each fish are really good to.

Hard to believe the same writer would go on to script TAXI DRIVER, HARDCORE, and RAGING BULL. But after you read this you will see the 'transcendental' element is in all of Schrader's screenplays.

But if you are a Schrader fan, it is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snob!","review":"This book aims at the world of film criticism, specialists and pedants like the author. It's so pedantic it stinks. I bet the people who like this kind of literature don't care a fig for what they actually talk about: cinema. Of course I didn't read the whole rug.Ozu, Bresson and Dreyer made spiritual, religious or... trascendental films as Mr. Schader says. But they made them for the common folk, that is: for the hearts as for the minds of people. Why should there be in the world this kind of pharisees telling us how to interpret things? Ford, who is and was the greatest film director ever once said he was only a guy who made westerns and now come the yuppies like Mr. Schrader messing around, complicating things.From page 5 to 12 the perpetrator of this book digs into the meaning of 'trascendentalism'.

I had hopes that the story would evolve and other characters would be drawn out, but instead it remained all in the protagonist's head. Like a memoir from someone without a lot of life experience but very enthralled with the life she has had so far. Unfortunately I don't think that her life is quite that rich yet, maybe as she matures. Lots of fluffy fluff but without any of of the biting irony, witty sarcasm or novel approaches that make other young authors challenging. I feel like I am supposed to be taken with her gayness and its conception but instead it just annoyed me. I wonder when the author is older, will she read this and cringe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute disappointment","review":"I was completely disappointed in Ms. Helm's novel, Dish it up, Baby. The fact that this book was written as a novel, and not as an autobiography, as it clearly should have been, leads me to question Ms. Helms credibility and her struggle with developing her own self. The main focus of the book revolved around Ms. Helms and her personal experiences but by disregarding the other individuals in her life and not developing any of these characters, she totally misses out on the opportunity to prove herself as a credible and respectable author. While her attention to detail and fun witty descriptions of certain events did make the book entertaining to read at times, I found myself feeling emotionally unsatisfied and unable to connect to the protagonist in any way, shape or form.

Only a few good song's are on here: dope man, things that you do, pop 4 roc, big pimpin, and the song he did with Dre.Some like it hot has THE MOST STUPIDEST BEAT I EVER HEARD IN A RAP SONG! Timbaland was straight trippin when he made that beat, and I dont know what the hell Damon Dash was thinking when he put out this album, either he was high or drunk on something, this is the one record that made me leave rap, except for the likes of Eminem, and D-12.So dont buy this album, it is not worth the $16, it is just better just downloading big pimpin off the internet, so that way you save the other $15 for the next 50 Cent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank's to UGK","review":"There is only 1 good song on this album, Big Pimpin.

Jay-Z IS THE MOST OVERRATED RAPPER OF ALL TIME ALONE WITH BIGGIE,LIL WAYNE,AND EMINEM!This album sucked! The beats were boring,his lyrics are wack! All he raps about is MONEY,CARS,HOES,DIAMONDS,etc. All Jay songs have a catchy hook with some known sample and thats why he sells,that song Big Pimpin' sucks.

Jay-Z is one of the hottest rappers out there today and I think it has alot to do with his new c.d. Volume 3-The Life of Sean Carter! The only thing I didn't like about this c.d. is it didn't have the song \\"Anything\\" on it. Other then that this c.d. was the bomb! It had classics samples on it mixed with Jay-Z's hot lyrics that even made my mom bounce and drop it like it's hot!

I have both and can't complain, but now after hearing this album you have to ask is he just going falling off or going commercial. Jay-z's quick to tell you that he's just in it for the money and it shows. The beats were tight with a line up of some of the best producers but the lyrics were garbage, little itty bitty childish rhymes courtesy for his new audience. I can say that the only tracks where shows some of the skills that made vol2 so hot are \\"Dope Man\\" and maybe \\"big Pimping.\\" So should you buy this cause everyone has it or because you're in it for the rhyming skills. Jay-z has the skills but they are not on this album, pick up vol2 or better yet pick up artists like Mos Def, Common and Outkast (if you don't already have that one), but don't waste you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"what about \\"Anything\\"?","review":"i bought this cd thinking that the anything song would be on it, but its not.

Not one track is good on this album (and no, I hate \\"Big Pimpin\\"...it's one of hip-hop's biggest disgraces) and getting special guests as Juvenile just makes the album even worse than it already is.

Let's face it, the man could not write a good verse if his life depended on it. He has been passed by just about every new artist coming up, not only in his writings but also in his beats. The new age beats he was talking about in The Source are non-existent, and his hope of people listening from Track 1 to the end will never be fulfilled. He wanted people to listen from the first to the last track, but instead they should only listen to the first and last track, as everything in between, with the exception of Dope Man, is terrible.

He has skills as an MC and is very entertaining with it. This is his best album to date, even better than his new one which is also good. Although there are a couple of slip ups on this album such as Snoopy Track, it is good pretty much all the way through. The best tracks are: So Ghetto, Do It Again, Dope Man, Things That U Do, Its Hot, Big Pimpin, Come And Get Me, NYMP, Anything. Big Pimpin is probably the best on the album even though Jiggaman doesn't do much, its featuring UGK. So Ghetto is almost as good as Big Pimpin and is a great first track. The intro is good as it usually is from Jay-Z. My advice would be to get this album, especially if you are a Jay-Z fan, even if you're not. Go get this album right now because its brilliant. Keep em comin Jigga. You can see more about me, I've done reviews of Ludacris, DMX and Jay-Z's new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jay's best","review":"In my opinion this is one of Jays best albums,1.

Hova Song - 4/5every single song is good or better, you can easily let this cd ride out without hittin the skip button once"},{"rating":"2","title":"good....not best","review":"the \\"tweener\\" in hov's solo albums......between the success of hard knock life and the great blueprint...........noone really gives this album as much props as it deserves, probably because they haven't even listened to it.......the intro is probably my favorite intro track that jay-z ever had......either that or dynasty....anyways, the point here is (as with most rap albums) the best stuff are the songs that weren't released as singles (snoopy track, come and get me, there's been a murder)......better than big pimpin and those songs.....overall i like this album quite a bit, and if you want some more quality jay-z.....pick it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again? haters no like","review":"This Album solidifies Jay-Z as the premier rapper in the east coast. Almost everything is right in this album his flows, his beats, but his lyrics have very little substance compared to his Reasonable doubt album. overall this is a must have album for any Jay-Z fan... If you don't have blueprint get that album first. Jay-Z is flawless on that album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-Z Dies With This Album!","review":"Sorry, but this album isn't worth more than 2 stars. It's not a bad album, well, not TOO bad of an album, so it deserves at LEAST 2 stars. If you're a Jay-Z fan, I guess it's a must. Otherwise, leave it be."},{"rating":"2","title":"saannah","review":"I really thought this album was really phat. i am not from the \\"big\\" cities or not black....but i enjoy rap music expressely Jay z. I give him credit and all the other rapers to tellin the truth about society....and anyone who thinks different doesnt know what its like...usually people who critizes this type of music are the ones who got happy, go getting, wealthy, healthy lives and dont know bout real lives. so if people dont like this music...why the heck are they listening to it and crtizing it...thats plan ingorant...Rap and hip hop will always be a part of my life...and my favorite...and i am as good as can be..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roca-Life","review":"Jay Z's new album has already been released like two weeks ago here in Europe and I bought it without even listening to it. When I first put it in my stereo I thought that it was horrible, but after all I was totally wrong. The songs get better the more you listen to them and after a while you just can't stop to sing along and bump your head to this cd. I think Jay Z did a good job on this one (as on all of his Cd's) and especially \\"Big Pimpin\\" and \\"Come and Get Me\\" are really cool songs. Once again Jay Z is reloaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good News! \\"Anything\\"<--- we all love this song","review":"I was listening to Beanie Sigel, The Truth, his new album and I found out that ANYTHINg is song #14 on Beanie Mac's new album. that is really disapointing to all of us who bought Jay-Z's new album for the song ANYTHING, unless you like beanie sigel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jigga fails this time","review":"First off, I loved Vol.2 and Vol.1, but man this album is a DISGRACE to the rap game. The main reason why I don't like this album, is the fact that Jay-Z raps about money, diamonds, rings, cars, hoez, and just nonsense in Vol.3. Almost everysong has no meaning...its just \\"Jigga this\\" and \\"Jigga that.\\" WHAT KIND OF TALENT IS THAT? I like Jay-Z but this album is a poor effort with weak beats and not many good tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay is just like nas","review":"When I say Jay-z is just like Nas. I mean that as in. They both have'nt been able to live up to there first joints. \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" is a definite classic, we all know that, but now it's like Jigga is only rapping to please tha radio stations. This new album strated off like it was gonna be hot [tha first three songs]. Then it was tha new Jay all over again, and closing. Tha new \\"Jigga Fans\\" should love this album, but if you're like me just keep \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" in ya headphones cause aint nothing changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT !","review":"JAY-Z New album is one of the finest efforts going in to the new year .. This should keep things hot for a while this year.. a solid effort chock full of hot tracks and sharp lyrical attacks on pretenders, playa haters.. Among the stand out tracks ..So Ghetto Produced by one of the premire hip hop producers .. DJ PremireDo it againThings that u do (featuring Mariah Carey)The two best cuts clearly on this cd is the two Timbaland produced tracks.. again Timbaland proves he is the most innovative producer in hip hop right now .. It's Hot with it's aggressive snappin bass line and hand clappin and the southern bounce of Snoopy Track featuring Juvenile.. OVER ALL A TIGHT EFFORT PICK IT UP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Score for Jay-Z","review":"I picked it up today, and I was a little doubtful that it could top his last album. However I was very suprised. Nearly every song is a hit. I defintely suggest gettin this cd, if you liked his last album ( Hard Knock Life )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with Color","review":"While the funtional design of this case is great, the color desciption is all wrong. It should be 'silver' microfiber, with grey/silver leather accents. The only black part of the case is the attaching clip for the device. I'm returning the case becauce of the color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unstoppable!","review":"I bought this CD just about a week ago and I have listened to it every day since then. I take it in my truck with me where ever I go. I am very touched by all the songs, every song a diffrent reason. If you are the type of person where music is a big part of your life (like I am), this is a wonderful CD to get. I think that this band is here to stay and I cant wait to see what they come out with next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Camino Palmero Well Worth the Money","review":"Rarely do I listen to CDs from beginning to end without having to skip a track or two. But in the case of The Calling's debut album, Camino Palmero, I don't have to skip a single song because every single one is unique and beautiful, full of meaning and feelings. Group co-founders Aaron Kamin and Alex Band wrote the lyrics themselves. If you like the hit single \\"Wherever You Will Go,\\" then I would suggest purchasing this album since the quality of the rest of the album either matches or exceeds the single. There is a mix of slower ballads and quick paced songs, all sung by the talented Band, whose vocals will mesmerize. His voice flows from high notes to low notes with ease. I'm not a music journalist, but I know good music from bad. This is definitely a great album worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"OH MY GOSH I LOVE THIS CD! When I heard their first single \\"Wherever You Will Go\\" on the radio, I didn't think that the Calling was such a big deal, but I decided to give them a chance and buy the whole CD. Best decision I've made! Personally my favorite song on the album probably has to be \\"Adrienne,\\" but every other song is great too! Who knew such a deep voice could come out of such a little guy like Alex? It's great stuff!! Definitely an album everyone should check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"let's reheat this again..","review":"time to warm up the old frozen alternative blueprint, because we have another radio-band stepping up to the plate! With lyrically disfunctional songs that are awash in easy chords and heart-tugging vocal deliveries, this album will be sure to get the group a whole bunch of female companions, and maybe some sensitive new-age guys who want to just weep, weep, weep to this deep, deep, deep music.Smells like bad lite-alternative band spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camino Palmero","review":"Excelente CD, todas, pero todas las cnaciones son muy buenas, buenas letras, buen ritmo, buen ambiente musical.Thank You, Adrianne, for me, are the best of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks.","review":"Sorry to be so blunt, but I think this album sucked. \\"Wherever You Will Go\\" and \\"Adrienne\\" are the best songs on the album, and they're both singles. The rest of the album is boring and uninspired. I could have saved myself a lot of money by just buying those two songs as singles.I was really disappointed because Alex Band's voice is so cool. It's deep and smooth. I loved his collaboration with Santana and wish he could retain a similar sound with his own band. If The Calling ever puts out another album, I'd be willing to give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voice, Hot Singer","review":"Ok, I just heard the song \\"Wherever you will go\\" by the Calling, 2 days ago. I actually saw the video 2 days ago. It was on Much Music and I almost peed my pants over the lead singer. He has the greatest voice and it makes me go crazy and hes so cute. I don't like to use that word but I have no other way to explain it. Well, today, I decided to download the song after hours of searching for the video on Kazaa. Then, after listening to it on and on again, I came onto Amazon.com and bought the CD. It should be here in a few days. I can't wait. That guy can sure sing and they play great! I'm excited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Ordinary.....Too bad","review":"I was really looking forward to hearing this CD....Too bad it is such a disappointment. The songwriting is weak, the lyrics mundane....as the band tries to sound like Matchbox 20, Lifehouse, or any of a 100 other soundalike bands who have all done this much better. The album falls flat....especially when put up against outstanding new releases like Jimmy Eat World, Puddle of Mudd, Five For Fighting and Built to Spill. Spend your money on something worthwhile....I am not sure what this band's \\"calling\\" is, but it is certainly not music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"I bought this Cd for the song \\"wherever you will Go\\". I absolutly loved this song. It is a slow love ballad. I'm sure you heard it before on the radio. When I got the Cd I was disapointed. The other songs are boring and not nearly as good as wherever you will go. I like the song stigmatized alright, but the others are disapointing. I don't listen to this Cd much. Its better if you have Kazaa to download a couple songs before you buy this Cd because that would give you a better idea of the songs on it. Mostly I was disapointed. I expected more from the calling. I think they have a lot of talent, but maybe should stick with the slower songs. I recommmend this cd to anyone that likes lifehouse, or creed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor man's Matchbox 20","review":"I'm sorry, but these guys just don't cut it. The musicianship lacks the imagination that Matchbox 20 can inject into some of their songs (i.e. Busted, Real World, etc.) and the lyrics aren't as good as the oftentimes profound lyrics of Rob Thomas. On top of that, these guys dropped out of high school at THEIR LABEL'S REQUEST. It's bad enough when you drop out of high school, but at your label's request. I'll give these guys some credit though for being a bunch of middle-class suburbanites and not jumping on the trendy angst-train like so many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to break it to you folks","review":"But this has been done before. That singer guy's voice is so forced I can't stand a single song."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste!","review":"the calling's album Camino Palmero is a waste of time and money. the only good song on the album is wherever you will go. that's it. enough said"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see whats so great about them.","review":"Lifehouse + Creed + Matchbox 20 = The Calling, for 2 reasons:1st: The lead singers sound alot alike.2nd: They are no different than the boy bands are lyricly, because all they want to sing and write about is broken hearted lovers and new lovers. The Calling are just like the Backwash Boys, and Insank in a lot of ways, but if you like bands like Creed and Matchbox 20 and Lifehouse, then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Sung It For The Talent Show At Skool","review":"Wherever you will go is extremely emotional for me, since I never gotten a chance to see my father, and it gives me a way to feel like someone else knows what im goin through. I would like to meet The Calling if I got the chance! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER!","review":"I just got into the whole alternative music thing, and this CD is the best I've heard yet. I heard two songs on the WB's Smallville (...) and immediatly got addicted. I would mention the best songs on this CD, but they're all great! My favorite songs are probably \\"Nothing's Changed\\", \\"Wherever You Will Go\\", \\"We're Forgiven\\" (\\"We laugh, and we smile, and we play our games of sweet denial...\\" this one has great lyrics), and \\"Adrienne\\". I STRONGLY reccomend this CD, especially to people who like bands like Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, Creed, and Three Doors Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally... good pop music","review":"It has been a long time since I've been excited by a rock album. I am one of those naysayers of popular music; it is my opinion that rock and roll has been declining in quality since about 1995. Pop music's decline has been occurring for far longer. So I was thrilled when I heard this album. There is nothing revolutionary in The Calling's sound, but it is really entertaining, fundamentally sound power ballad rock and roll. I can listen to this album over and over and still get charged up each time I hear it. My thanks go out to the band for providing pop music with a quality rock and roll alternative to hip hop, Britney Spears, and the rest of the [music] that has come to dominate radio airwaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Calling\\" of all rock music lovers!","review":"I have to admit,I'm not really a rock music fan but this band is the exception!Usually when I listen to music...I listen to the lyrics before the tune.Now,this is a band with great lyrics AND great tunes!Great guitar work done,and when the lead singer(Alex Band) sings...you can't help but believe in what he's singing!Among my fave was 'Wherever You Will Go','Adrienne','Final Answer' and my ultimate fave is 'Stigmatized'....but the rest of the songs are pretty decent too!From smooth relaxing tunes to hard rock....this band is what I can call versatile!So,go grab a copy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This album is one of a kind!!!!! It's got your heart felt slow songs and your cutting edge rock.With the very catchy \\"Where ever you will go\\" this album never came out of my cd player.Both \\"Adrienne\\" and \\"Stigmatized\\" like many other songs on this album is sung with such great passion. The Callings heart and sole have gone into this album and it really shows.\\"Could it be any harder\\" leaves a tear in my eye every time I listen to it, with an impressive chorus of-\\"Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you,Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true. If I only had one more day\\"Its enough to warm anyone heart.A Truly inspirational album that's definitely worth adding to your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"Camino Palmero is pure talent by the Calling. It is one of my all time favorites, and it reaches everybody. If you love this one, you have to check out 'Two' the Calling's second CD. Great listening, I LOVE THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is amazing","review":"With easy beats that anyone can rock to, and lyrics that everyone can empathize with it's hard not to find this cd appealing. With raw vocals and amazing guitar playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Calling Rocks","review":"Camino Palmero is definitely one of the best cds out there. It's totally worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one bad song on the album","review":"I've bought a lot of CDs lately, but it's rare that I find any with this kind of quality. Every song on the album is unique, and great. You can tell these guys really put thought into their lyrics, and it's refreshing (with how much ... there is out there)I would definitely reccommend this CD. You can listen to it over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it...you won't be sorry!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite cds...I fell in love with The Calling the first time I heard them. You won't be sorry if you buy this cd...I wasn't. Alex Band's voice is amazing and he uses it to the fullest. Their songs are filled with such honest emotions love, loss, hope... It is just a great cd... And they are a great band. Buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This newcomer to the music scene is a true treasure! The lead singers voice is definatly outstanding, and sultry. I listen to it often and love this CD! These artists compare to early SmashMouth work, but a little sexier..........The songs are often about lovers or losing the one they love, but have a ripping Seattle sound about them. They are a different sound, and are recommended for someone who is ready for a musical change in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album from a stunningly talented band","review":"This is the first album I've ever bought where I listen to every song on the CD. The combination of Alex Band's amazing (and only 21 year old) voice and the genius of guitarist Aaron Kamin makes The Calling a serious new band to be reckoned with. The lyrics aren't the usual run-of-the-mill sappy romantic stuff, there's real emotion and powerful truth in their words, written by the two leads themselves.Wherever You Will go is best known, but listen to Stigmatized and the upcoming release Could It Be Any Harder and you'll be hooked. If you love Matchbox 20 and Train, I'd seriously recommend listening to The Calling as well.If you're a Brit that's tired of manufactured bands and garbage released solely for commercial reasons, listen to Camino Palmero; it'll restore your faith in the industry, and remind you how real music is meant to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd sucks","review":"Very disappointed. Apparently I don't get modern \\"Punk\\" / \\"Stupid\\". Bunch of same chord boring songs! I bought it for one song (Where Ever You Will Go), should have looked for a cover, or just have just bought the MP3, good luck guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This is just an amazing debut album from a band who is going to be around a long time. Every song on the CD is great in it's own way. It's got it's slow songs, faster songs, but every song has the same passion-filled vocals of Alex Band. His voice is amazing. This CD is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercialism at its worst...","review":"This CD is more mindless pop noise aimed at fourteen year old girls looking to buy a \\"rock\\" album. Purely disgusting. I like to think of myself as an open minded music fan, and I appreciate bands that are considered \\"cookie cutter\\" by the closed minded, like Nickelback and Tantric, because they have been around awhile and have something called talent. The Calling is different. Listen to the single, Wherever You Will Go. The lyrics have been used so many times before. The guitar part and music has been re-used way too much. And people love it! Dare not the public listen to something that challenges you. It seems like the only music that is given to the public is mindless chatter. You can't have smart lyrics, because then people begin to think. You can't have intricate songs, because then people will have to listen to your song more than once to get the hang of it. Stay away. Stay far far away. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they compare The Calling to Lifehouse...","review":"when The Calling have half the talent and twice the ego...This C.d. sucks and so does their new one...stay away...these guys are sellouts who suck fat ones during their lunch break...LoL...Lunch breaks full of big juicy meats and tasty fruits. Just ask Alex Bend...he loves to down a hot dog and chase it with a flamin hot strawberry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENOUGH ALREADY!","review":"I really dont know what to say about popular music in America when stuff like this is peddled everywhere and forced on us in film and tv. Alex, congratulations, youve sucessfully become a sellout! How wonderful for you! It would be better if your music was actually original, but I honestly cant tell it apart from most of the other groups people who have bought your cd listen to. Plus, you might want to think about chaging your look because when I turned on the TV to your video I thought you were Aaron Carter. I cant wait for this group to run out its 15 minutes. I would never buy this CD and I strongly advise others to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable!","review":"The Calling can be one of the worst bands to come from America in the last decade. Their lyrics are so poppish and cheesey and their tunes are not even worth a penny. It's funny how they keep playing the same rythem in a way over and over and over again, and people can't even see that!I suggest all you people who consider this a great 'rock' album (what an insult to rock) to get off the couch watching Mtv and eating corn chips and get great albums from bands like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Oasis, The Beatles, etc.This is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unstoppable","review":"I hate it when you buy a good CD, but you always need to skip over a track or two that just aren't great. But I NEVER need to stop Camino Palmero. Every single song is amazing. It is a great CD in the car, at a party, anywhere! I highly HIGHLY recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Leaves My CD Player","review":"There is no need for any other CD now that I have Camino Palmero. The songs range from the ever popular \\"grab the one you love and hold them tight\\" ballad to the downright get off your chair and move music. Combine Alex Band's sensual yet \\"bad boy\\" vocals with well written and thought out lyrics and you have the perfect match. No matter what your mood, what direction your life seems to be taking, lock yourself in a room and be taken away by The Calling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"I love 'The Calling's Cd. 'Wherever You Will Go' is one of the greatest songs out there, and it touches me. Alex Band's voice is a gift. If I had to choose a voice to listen to non-stop, it'd be his, it's just so amazing.

Everything in the song is so beautiful, pure, and amazing. I bought the CD right after it came out and listen to it over and over again, it's just so good, you just can't deny it. I luv Alex Band's every move, the whole band look gorgerous, i luv you guys!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Amazing Album of the Year","review":"I got this ablum for xmas after seeing their video for Where you will go on MTV. I never expect to have this album in my CD player in my car non stop since that day.Alex the lead singer had an amazing deep voice that just pulls you in. They fact that the group wrote the album them selves.I can't tell you which track is my fave , because I love them all. One of my faves in Unstoppable track #1, but this is an album you will never skip a track on.So if you buy only one album this year buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Diverse","review":"The Calling's, \\"Camino Palmero\\" LP is an excellent album for many different people.

This is surely an album almost anyone could enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Calling Rocks!","review":"This CD is so good! I didn't have to pay for this CD because i got it free when i met the band, i didn't think the CD would be as good as it was. \\"Could It Be Any Harder\\" is the best song on the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Camino Palmero is a great cd!","review":"Camino Palmero is a great cd and I absolutely love it! I bought it because I love \\"Wherever You Will Go\\" and I was hoping the whole cd would be just as good as that song, and it is! I'm soo glad I bought it! I listen to it all the time! My favorite song, other than \\"Wherever You Will Go\\" is \\"Unstoppable\\" The songs have some great lyrics and really catchy tunes. You definitely will not be disappointed if you buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Lyrics, Meanful CD","review":"This CD Is a must have for anybody who loves meaningful lyrics and slow and up beat songs.

It's worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!","review":"I was called by a friend to watch \\"The Calling\\" on the Regis Showand TRL. I am a 60's child and watched the show with two of my buddies. It was nice to see people who write and play melodic music with feeling and talent. As an example, the bass player, Billy Mohler, graduated from the Berkely School of Music in Boston. The lead singer sings with feeling and conviction rare for such a young man. And now their first single is the love song for a new movie. Kick [Butt] boys, great music stands thetest of time, And you guys are only getting started.

I still get a kick out of it everytime I see them on MTV or hear them on the radio...makes me feel special that I got to see them right before they hit it big. I really enjoy their sound, fun yet not overly happy pop-ish....deep but not rough. Nice mix of good lyrics and good vocals...I highly recommend them :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"DID YOU KNOW?","review":"I first fell in love with the song \\"Wherever You Will Go\\" a year before it was released.

I do not own many cd's that I can listen to the entire way through and not get sick of it, but this album was an exception. Every song on the album is amazing and the lyrical content created by Alex Band and Aaron Kamin is incredible. Songs like \\"Stigmatized\\" and \\"We're Forgiven\\" are proof that this band is a force to be wreckened with.

I have had it for almost 6 years and only complaint is a crappy DVD lense (reader). Some disks are stubborn, but still play. I typically troubleshooted by re-loading DVD until it would read. Then, I got smart and purchased a scotch DVD cleaner from BestBuy, which greatly helped.Lastly, when Progressive Scan DVD players came down in price, I just bought one for cheap to get higher picture quality and ran sound through Panasonic (using as traditional receiver/speaker setup, not all-in one).I have finally outgrown this set, but I do plan on running it in my bedroom as I replace with a higher-end, more digitally enabled system. Speakers are too weak for big family room, and no digital audio in/out or upconversion abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Ok, the sound was good. Until a couple of weeks ago, that is. The latest CDs I bought will not play decently. The music is interrupted every couple of minutes by sounds that make you wonder if there is a record player inside (it sure is large enough...). Panasonic are saying I can have it repaired, which will cost me at least 40 dollars. Just about the price of a low end dvd player. You know, one of those systems that will play mp3, dvd, cd, cdr and cdrw instead of only dvds, like this Panasonic thing. Based on my experience and some of the other reviews it would seem Panasonic equipment lasts about 2 years. Hmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxi-Matic","review":"This shouldn't even get one star.

This isn't worth my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GEEK one of the best new bands out.","review":"The C.D. should really be named 3 feet high cause thats how high you wants to jump while listening to it. There are only a few songs on this album but it is the first one out, and it gives you a taste of what is to come when there second one is out. The percussion in this album is unbeleivable what a 16 year old kid can do (Joy Gaskill). And the bass lines that are played by another young musician by the name or (trent). with the hard riffs of (jeremy gaskill)s guitar and the flowing vocals of the lead singer (john) any hard rock fan should love this c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Victorious Indwelling","review":"I have worked in Christian Bookstores for 30 plus years and this one is #1 of 25 of the best devotionals.

One day was a enough -- we donated it to our daycare so someone else would have to deal with it. The music is obnoxious. Even our son didn't seem that interested in it.

But she loves anything to do with music. I do agree with the other review in that the disc is hard to turn. But my daughter has no problem walking around with the keyboard. She really doesn't pay that much attention to the switches and the infra-red characters at the top. She just plays each tune gets up and dances around the room. I think this toy is great for any child who loves music."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but not much fun","review":"I bought this for my son when he was 12 months old because he loves Sesame Street. He played with it for 3 or 4 days, and showed no interest in it after that. It is a cute toy-- bright and colorful with nice music selections. It plays songs such as Skip to my Lou, This Old Man, and How to Get to Sesame Street. You can wave your hand over Ernie to make the song be played with classical instruments, Elmo for rock and roll, or Cookie Monster for jazz. You can also control the tempo and volume. There are a few piano type keys you can press, but it's hard to tell what effect they have on the song. I think overall it's hard for my son to understand the causes and effects of this toy. He's 19 months old now, and still shows no interest in this toy. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Valuable Cab Fare Ever Paid","review":"Hyken provides a very comfortable read full of great insight.

I missed him at the Blue Note, but will go out of my way to see him perform the next time he is in NY. - A wonderful addition to any collection.

Sylvia Pettem has documented Boulder's transition over the past 50+ years beautifully.

No one appreciated it much then but a few listeners, I being one of them. I was also just learning jazz tenor sax at the time so I tuned in and wasn't disappointed. Now, many years later I find myself no less impressed by this music, and that we have yet to acknowlegde Frank Zappa as a legitimate American composer, and we as a culture don't really appreciate this music for it's importance to other genre's. Jean Luc Ponty was unknown to most Americans, and Jazz violin wasn't being given a lot of respect in this country, but Jean Luc Ponty is for real. His ability to play Zappa's very technical passages, and improvise, and change meters at the drop of a hat. George Duke, Ian Underwood, Arthur Tripp, along with a host of L.A. finest musicians and others have created a classic for those unfamiliar with Zappa's orchestral side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child and wife abuse hidden from book description","review":"As an activist for 30 years, I initially was drawn to the description of the book, primarily that which dealt with working class and women's struggles. However, as I read the first quarter of the book, it became difficult to read the pages of abuse (hitting, beating) to the children and wife in this story. I was determined to read the rest, based on the seemingly progressive content/review of the book. I stopped in the middle of the book when the father/husband had sexual relations with his (female) child. I have never thrown out a book before, but with this one, I did so with pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gustav Holst: Planets - The New Dimension of Sound Symphonic Series [7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Disc] [BD25 Audio Only] [Blu-ray]","review":"I am playing this on a Sony PS3.

However, it is not well edited. It contains many typos; the grammar is spotty, and although it refers to a number of sources, it does not contain a bibliography.

Although I didn't give it 1 star because There are 2 \\"mini\\" games that I adore! The boating school one and the who cut the cheese. But the rest are BORING! There really isn't a selection of \\"mini\\" games to choose from. It could just be that my friend was a hog and woulden't give her guest a turn.

I purchased this game a few years ago. You can have SpongeBob wake up on the right side of the bed or on the wrong side. There are 5 mini-games, but they are the same on either side of the bed. The cut scenes are funny even if the characters look a little different, and even though Mr.Krabs sounds a little different. After I play this game for a while, it gets boring. I set it aside for a while and when I come across it again, it is fun again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless if you already know anything about data modeling","review":"Mislead by other reviews. Covers only basics of ERD style modeling. Not current with any UML approaches. If you only do Oracle and have never modeled, this might be a good start. Would have returned it if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Data Modeling can really be simple!","review":"I'm on the business side (I am not a techie) and this is the first technical book that I have actually read cover to cover. Steve in a very easy to understand manner walks through step-by-step the components of data models and the different types of models that exist. As a business user I found Chapter 7 (What is the Subject Area Model?) to be the most relevant for my day to day job. I also finally now understand the difference between normalization and abstraction. Chapter 11 on the Data Model Scorecard will be very useful to my team to ensure that data models are critiqued against the Scorecard's 10 categories. The only thing I can think of to make this book better would be to include an index, but the book is so concise and quick to locate topics that it is not really essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic book; not worth the money","review":"I was disappointed to read this book as I'm a fan of the author, S. Hoberman, who usually writes good articles on the subject of modeling.This book is similar to the \\"...for Idiots\\" series with the difference that this book is actually for idiots unlike that popular anthology.Re: the book's title, it is clear that the audience mentioned on the cover page is a mere marketing ploy. IT professionals can safely ignore this title unless they are brand-new to the field (<1-3 months).Some business/non-technical people might find this content useful but then again why waste money on this book when you can get similar content on the Web for free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fenomenal?

My copy is heading for the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of mystery","review":"This book is a great read. The mystery is interesting and involving, however, Rand is particularly astute in her observations about family life. Emma Price's relationship to her son, Liam, is particularly sharply etched and authentic seeming. Readers of literary fiction will find as much to admire here as mystery readers will. It transcends the genre. I hope there are more Emma Price mysteries planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out! This is Volume 1 of a three volume set.","review":"Beware that this is only volume 1 of three volumes, and that all three will cost you about $60, an outrageous price for a book which is not copyrighted.

You can also download the entire book for free from ebook sources on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountain Musicians","review":"Long alpine horns, lutes, ocarinas, flutes, jew's harps, upright fiddles: this wide assortment of musical instruments makes Kyrigyzstan unique on the Silk Road. Its smooth musical tone and sweet melodies are also special. Like the group Tengir-Too, the Kamarkan Folk Ensemble are touring musical ambassadors of a nation that became independent after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. This recording was made in London in 2001. [Amazon states two discs but it actually is one.] The album includes a booklet with color photographs of the land, its peoples, the musicians, and their instruments. Lyrics are also provided.The music is varied, only suggested by the various instruments, and listening is a treat. The quality of sound is slightly inferior to the Smithsonian Folkways recording of Tengir-Too, and although the musical selections are similar, the two albums do not overlap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking, but wears poorly","review":"I was really pleased to receive this case.

The folks at Handspring said they had have had no complaints about the microfiber cases, so maybe mine was a lemon, but it is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the new-comer!","review":"I found this book to be fascinating. I know a Santero, asked to join the ranks of Babalawo, and learned much from him. This book validated what I was fortunate enough to be taught by him and gave more detail I'd not known. I realize it is still an introduction... to truly know Santeria is to become a Santero and learn from your mentors. Otherwise, this is the best introduction in book form I've read yet! I highly recommend it for those wishng to get a look into the religion that is sincere... NOT Hollywood garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If she knew what she was talking about, this would be decent","review":"Whippler is a good writer technically, but despite years in the religion, writes absolute garbage. I think Ann Rice vampire novels have more truth in them. I'm a Santero and reading a Whippler novel is about as realistic as reading a Harry Potter novel and expecting to find actually Hogwarts in England. She makes things up that are simply not part of the faith. It's insulting to us olochas to read her works. I wish her books could be moved to the fiction section where they belong. You won't find religion in these books. Just a lot of weird magic spells for the highly superstitious. I often wonder if she is mistaking Wicca or Hoodoo with the African diasporic traditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made","review":"I have always held a high degree for KOSS equipment, but the earphones that I received (advertised as PRO) are horrible. For one the sound is extremely muddy and almost void of any decent high frequency.

No way. Shallow at best. I guess I would decribe them as not too bad for a free entertainment at a local bar. What went wrong? How could this be the same band that produced one of my top 5 rock albums ever - Golden Earring live? Answer- the lack of a second guitarist(Eelco Gelling) whose contributions to the GEL album produced such heavenly interplay that truly could bring tears to my eyes. Like Ted Nugent w/o Derek St Holmes, the sum of Gelling w/ GE made the band greater than their individual parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Written","review":"Some people are good at communicating with words, of giving the reader a vivid image and impression in just a few choice words and sentences. Michael McGarrity is not one of those people. He may have been a great cop, and he does a good job of describing police procedure, but he's no writer.This is so poorly written that at one point he actually spells out the key plot points IN BLOCK LETTERS in case you were to slow to catch on fifty pages ago. The characters are for the most part horribly developed, and when he tries to use the voice of the various villains, the results are laughably bad. The plot is ok, but then just comes to a crashing halt and everything gets resolved.He does do a good job with the relationship between Clayton and his father, and the procedural stuff is engaging, but overall this is a stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"I read this book in a single sitting. It's rarely I do that. I'm not sure how McGarrity does what he does, but he's consistent.I notice that other reviewers appreciate the \\"deepening\\" of Kevin Kerney's personal life, but I don't. I really don't care about his wife or his kid. I care about the mystery.Still, McGarrity is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the book police procedure","review":"McGarrity may have solved his \\"Jack Ryan problem\\". His hero promoted out of the action, grows closer to his son, a young Indian deputy, and numerous new characters are introduced. The procedure is detailed and the action a little short, but this is a fine addition to an outstanding series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was my first read of McGarrity and will be the last. Boring police procedural with perhaps the worst dialog I've read in 20 years. One wades through the book noting that almost all the police officers speak with the same voice and use the same platitudes. The Chief can't communicate with his son or his wife. Am I supposed to find this interesting? And then suddenly it ends. I usually pass books on but this one ended up a 3-point shot into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've loved all of the Michael McGarrity books except Under the Color of the Law. The Big Gamble is a wonderful addition to the series. I liked the inclusion of Clayton and his family with Clayton having a bigger role in the book. I thought Sara could have been included more and with less gripping on her part. For a tough Army officer, she set a record whining. I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ford Explorer 91-01 Haynes Manual","review":"Very poor quality. Faint printing on re-cycled toilet paper.

It is better as an extremely general guide to repair. It, for example, did not give an accurate location, or any location at all, for the pcv valve, computer module, fuel schrader valve, or fuel filter. It did not mention anything about having to take the passenger front tire off to change the spark plugs and the serpentine belt. It instructions tend to be overly simplified and/or vague. There is very little in the way of any sort of technique to use or things to look out for. I found some forums on the internet that did a much more thorough and respectable job than this p.o.s. and the people there didn't charge you for the info. It is good for a couple of things. It does provide torque, pressure, and other specifications as well as diagnostic code definitions, not that you couldn't google it for free.

Whilst the book is a very quick read, it tells you so much more about the characters and their relationships than could be portrayed in the film, especially her relationship with her family.

It seems to be based a little more than loosely on Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice...even naming the leading man after his parallel, Austen's Mr. Darcy. However, this version is completely updated to reflect the emotions and insecurities of the modern woman. Bridget is a socially awkward woman who feels stuck in an unsatisfying job. She is a single thirty-something woman who constantly feels judged by friends and family because she is not yet married...which obviously means there's SOMETHING wrong with her, right? In an effort to improve her lot in life, Bridget starts a diary in which she plans to record everything she does to lose weight, quit smoking/drinking, and form a relationship with a man who is not a complete jerk. Although her plan doesn't exactly go how she wanted it to, she learns a lot about her self that she didn't know....and it all works out in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Lit -- Cross between Devil Loves Prada/Nanny Diary & more","review":"If you haven't read this book-- it's a must-- it's a classic early version of Chick Flick. This is an outrageously funny book and yet sincere in it's look at the inside view of a gal with a few extra lbs and being single in the 90's. Still a national best seller. It is so much fun for anyone who tries to lose weight or is on a diet (isn't that all of us) in the course of the book she loses 72 lbs and gains 74 -- hilarious or is it? A droll sense of humor, a strong emphasis on how we look and how we relate to men-- will give any female reader much to think about and chuckle about too. Do you want to lose 7 lbs, stop smoking and develop inner poise-- well see how Bridget does or doesn't do all of that in Bridget Jones diary.Fast summer read-- great airplane reading, fun reading for a mom who has to read in short breaks between kids, food, family and chaos! Good re-reading too....keep it at the summer house for guests"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-Loud funny!","review":"Having been married at the age of 19 and married for 24 years, I thought this book might not be as fun a read as for a singleton, BUT IT IS! While many women have the insecurities and concerns that are expressed in this book (there is probably a bit of Bridget Jones in every woman) to read them in this format was laugh-out-loud funny. This was a very enjoyable book, it leaves you smiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smug Married reader from Richmond","review":"Personnally, cannot relate to Bridget at all. She is a heavy drinking, cigarette smoking, sloppy, airhead. She takes no responsibility for her life and waits for things to happen to and for her. Fairy tale ending not believable or possible in the real world for this woman, though it will make for a great, sappy end to a major motion picture in which Hugh Grant will likely be cast. HOWEVER, I read the book in just three days and found it very funny. Well worth a try in between more serious reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"I was supposed to be finishing my $60000 thesis, but instead spent the entire night reading this book. I adored it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely entertaining but...","review":"I enjoyed this book but didn't find myself laughing out loud. I found some of the British terms confusing; however, eventually figured out what the definitions were (too bad there wasn't a small glossary of terms in the back for us non-Brits). Overall it was entertaining and a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a refreshing time-out from real life!","review":"I swallowed this book in a few, delightful hours, laughing out loud and thoroughly enjoying my brief escape from reality. Surely, there is a bit of Bridget Jones in all of us. (In my case, quite a lot.) I haven't seen my actual copy of the book for weeks because it is making the rounds of all the women I know. Let's face it, we all could use a good laugh! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to tally my fat calories......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining. Laughed out loud through book.","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. The only problem I had with it was that I was unfamiliar with some catch phrases that the English use. I was able to call a friend who moved to New York from England a few years ago, and follow the meaning of the book more thoroughly. I am in my 30's, single, have parent problems, dating problems, constant weight problems and related to this character better than any other I have ever read. Can't wait for her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk food for the brain","review":"I read this book in two evenings. Such garbage. It scares me to see how many other reviewers could relate to Bridget's life! I HAD to read it for my book discussion group. It's appeal is limited to those who, like Bridget, are completely self-centered and oblivious to the real problems of our times. The book's only merit is as an escape from reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a loser!!","review":"Amidst all the hype about this Singleton whom I could supposedly relate to, I was horrified to read about a sloppy, self- pitying, disorganized, undisciplined, weight-obsessed female. She only confirms to male chauvinists that women cannot quite take care of themselves and get over-emotional and neurotic over everything else. I definitely don't admire Bridget Jones. She does more a disservice to my gender than a funny look at ourselves. What a piteous loser. Only consolation is that it is a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone could have written this book.","review":"Anyone could have written this book, and most of would have done it better. This book is about an ordinary person doing ordinary things. Those who think this is a good book must have a boring life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Hype","review":"After reading rave reviews of this book, I was very disappointed. (Especially that I bought it in hardcover!!!) It reads like an article out of \\"Seventeen\\" magazine. Who cares how many cigarettes she smoked and how much weight she lost or gained....or lost....or gained....??? It was funny in the beginning, but tedious as it went on....and on...and on. If this book can get published than I should send my journals to Viking and make a million bucks. My life is far more interesting. On the plus side...there are some funny bits and the prose flows nicely. I wasn't bored reading it, but I can't say I was disappointed when I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie may be better than the book","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, I must say that I was disappointed. The story is entertaining, albeit a bit far-fetched. The style is not quite like a diary. In fact, it's almost like a knock-off of the Adrian Mole Diaries (which are far superior). The jacket said that is being made into a film by the people who made \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\\" I think that the story might be better in that format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to its press unfortunately","review":"Such a disappointment. I thought, at first, that the reason this book was not funny to me was because \\"it lost something in the translation\\". Or, maybe because I'm a \\"smug married\\". I did like the diary format and even though I am far from being in my 30's, I enjoyed some of Bridgit's experiences (alas, few and far between). This is a good \\"beach reading book\\" since it is quick and easy to follow but unfortunately doesn't have much substance. I don't have much contact with 30-something females of today, but I surely hope they are not like Bridgit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have waited for the paperback.","review":"Must join those who give this book a barely passable review. The author is obviously capable of producing better. Bridget is a brainless, self-absorbed twit, of the type that give all women a bad review. I gave it two stars only because the characterizations were decent; otherwise the book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I know it's a diary, but still felt it was a disjointed read which I found difficult to get into. At times I could identify with the character, but mainly it was just tooooo silly. Can't imagine why everyone else thinks it's so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day Elizabeth & Darcy","review":"I enjoyed every page. It is laugh out loud funny and touching at the same time. Anyone that enjoys Jane Austin's take on love and manners will enjoy this 90's take on the same. I look forward to more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"bridget, get over yourself","review":"I find it disturbing that so many people seem to \\"identify\\" with Bridget's life. If you're neurotic, insecure, self-centered and nasty then it really is no wonder you can't find a mate. Trees are far too valuable to be wasted on this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're in your 40s, this will depress you beyond belief.","review":"This is, quite simply, a sad little book. To think that this book is being touted as \\"humorous\\" or as a representing \\"what every woman thinks\\" is truly amazing in this day and age. In a nutshell Bridget is a twit and quite stupid. The only thing that makes you feel sympathy for her is that she is an alcoholic---a problem which neither she nor the author seem to acknowledge on any level, unless that is, the author thought this was screamingly funny. I was compelled to finish it in the same way one watches a bad TV movie. Perhaps it will appeal to people in their twenties, but the question is, why????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much hype","review":"Bridget's struggle to find a man wasn't nearly as tough as my struggle to complete this book. Initially, I was amused by the premise, by Bridget's daily summaries of her calorie intake, units of alcohol, and number of cigarettes. But her pursuit of happiness wore on me.Bridget and her friends were shallow and dull. I give her credit for retaining a dry sense of humor throughout her diary; that's about all she had going for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUHLEASE!","review":"I recently read this \\"book\\" for my book club (out of 6, only 2 enjoyed it). Not only is the diary style somewhat annoying, so is Bridget! She is a totally unsympathetic character, and her constant snivelling made this a very unenjoyable read. I thought I'd always find something redeemable about a novel, but sorry, not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of us in Blightly don't care that we're single!","review":"Bridget's discomfort in the company of \`smug marrieds' is something I can relate to, as a single woman myself. But while I tend to tell these people to mind their own, Bridget gets dragged down by what she so evidently feels is a failing of hers - that she doesn't have a boyfriend. Although I appreciate that relationships are important, it irritates me that this capable young woman doesn't get on with her life and stop making it such a feature. I do think Helen Fielding did a good job with the structure of this book. But the fact that it's been such a hit must surely say that so many young women are also at home with a bottle of white whingeing about being single, instead of doing things that would get them more of a social life (and perchance a fella!). I for one wouldn't chase Bridget if I were a man - I'd feel that I could just about anyone under forty and it would be a turn-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read..and frightfully true!!!","review":"This book reflects the best and worst of modern day society...Great fun...written with tremendous humor and wit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in two days.","review":"Favorite item on the New Year's Resolution List:\\"Will go to the gym every day, and not merely to buy sandwhich.\\"How can you go wrong with this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny, pre Ally McBeal - and so much better","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read.

Much more fun than Ally McBoring, even to a \\"smug married\\" like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diary worth peeking at....","review":"A pretty amusing account of one woman's struggles. Her weight obsession, longing for a man, career developments, and family problems. I enjoyed this novel because although we wish it wasn't so, so many women are exactly like bridgit jones. Overanalyzing details & conversations, worried about life, love, our jobs, body image; and trying to have a good time as often as possible. I found this book amusing and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light, silly read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this for a laugh!","review":"The modern day Pride and Prejudice, which hit very close to home.

The book was dead funny, and a welcome diversion, though I did read the first few chapters in my doctor's waiting room and got some mighty peculiar looks! I'll admit that my own 60-something mum back in NZ didn't find \\"BJD\\" funny at all. (Last time I spend big bucks shipping her any books! LOL) As for Bridget's obsession with her weight, cigarettes, alcohol intake, etc. ... hey, the book wasn't meant to be a bloody epic. Give credit where credit is due, for writing a book that hits a funny bone with readers of all stripes. It takes all kinds to make a world (even the emotional f**kwits!) LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones's Diary","review":"Enter the world of Bridget Jones. Shes is a 30 year old singleton whose life is a whirlpool of dates with men, late nights out with friends, and endless dinner parties with the smug marrieds. The book takes place over the time span of one year, and throughout the year you see the changes that Bridget slowly goes through. The book takes you into her mind, and you get to see why she does the things she does. Bridget Jones's Diary is a very entertaining and funny book that gives you a fresh look of the life of Bridget. It is very real and honest. I really enjoyed reading this book and I found myself laughing out loud and staying up late to find out what would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Okay, it's not the most... well, \\"academic\\" book, but it's still a lot of fun. Actually, my favourite character was not Bridget, but her mother. Such a colourful, silly, petty, STRANGE woman!For those who have seen the movie before reading the book, be forewarned... all is not the same. Both start off in a similar manner, but the end of the book is quite different (I almost wish they had filmed the book's version of the last few diary entries... that would have been a hoot!).All in all, it's a fun book, but don't read it expecting to learn anything or experience anything new and earth-shattering. It's light reading at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Vs. Book","review":"I first watched the movie, and then read the book because I loved the movie soooooooo much!! And I guess it must be because I watched the movie first that I haven't enjoy the book that much, but I have to grant it that it was the preliminar idea, it is just that the movie adapted the original plot so well, that the main idea of the book had more sense.Any way, I believe this book is \\"a must read\\" to all women, because it makes you feel relieved about your traumas of looks, bad habits, love life, family, etc. I believe this is a radiography of what normal women think, maybe men should read this book to understand how does our mind work, what our worries are."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!!!","review":"i received this book from a friend who had read it (& i had the great pleasure read while i was traveling in England) & i wholeheartedly recommend it to any girl who is single or who has ever been single - that's all of us, ladies!!! those who loved pride & prejudice will especially love this story. it's loosely based on that story (tho maybe not that loosely, the guy's name is Mark Darcy after all...) Bridget Jones is hysterical, her take one things will have you laughing out loud. Also, the crazy things she gets herself into will have you laughing out loud! A definite must-read.

It is an issue that is becoming more relevant in this day and age. But the writing was so commonplace. I could not discern real literary talent here. No craftsmanship in the way emotions are dissected and presented. Its an ordinary diary filled with trite sentences detailing what she eat and drank in a day and how many cigarettes she smoked!

I might have loved this book when I was single and so negative but now that I am a happily married mother, and have experienced a great and happy career, I was bored rather than entertained. Couldn't identify with the character. Kept thinking \\"get a life\\" and \\"she is so shallow\\". Boring!

Bridget Jones's diary amplifies the modern woman's (no matter what her creed) inner thoughts, fears, desires, etc. We all fuss over our weight gains as well as losses, and yes all single women do drink quite a bit. I could definately relate to this book and it's heroine. I think Bridget show us that all our efforts are not in vain.Ms. Fielding's use of words is positively brilliant, v.funny, and v.poignant.

She is not a likeable or insightful character and the whole business with her mother was just too unbelievable.

All that is important in her life is her weight (which she checks daily), her alcohol, cigarette and calorie intake and the number of times a day she checks the answering machine. I think perhaps the term \\"get a life\\" was inspired by Bridget. What a horrible representation of single women in their late 20's/early 30's as being self-obsessed and weak spirited. I'm sure the reason this book is a bestseller is because there's undoubtedly sections that every woman identifies with in some way, which makes an even more dismal statement on our society.

See, I've already said it!! I guess so!!! I am by no means a prude, but I suppose this dumb, vapid so called \\"Diary\\" is better left to the younger crowd!!! And god knows, I hope they don't follow suit!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I heard about this book on public radio and read about it, from that I expected it to be something I'd like. But as a American who fits Bridget's demographic profile perfectly (except for the nationality!), I was dismayed. It just wasn't funny to me. Bridget Jones reads like an The Patty Duke Show--twin cousins, one English, one named Ally McBeal, working as a lawyer in Boston. It is disheartening to find women my age so weak, obsessed with men and looks, and only able live life relative to what others think of how they look, act, etc. Bridget Jones annoyed the hell out of me. Viva la Feminism!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Got Tremendous Hype, but totally disappointing!","review":"Had heard about this book and was very anxious to read it but I was totally disappointed. I felt that the book was not well written and I love \\"diary-type\\" books. Bridget was a very shallow individual and I could not get a grip on her personality. What a put-down to women...like do we only think of weight (of course we do, but not to such an extreme), men and pleasing ourselves? \\"Diary\\" doesn't have any substance to it....disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't sleep? This will surely help","review":"I am reading this last thing at night so as to go to sleep more quickly. Trust me, it's really effective.This book reads like the typical article in a women's magazine: we've already heard it all before. I expect the reason for the hype is that unfortunately lots of girls out there have concerns just as superficial as Bridget Jones's.The only reason I haven't yet given up on it is because my office mate so enthusiastically asked me to read it, and I don't want to offend her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh - lease","review":"This overhyped novel seemed somehow familiar to me, when I suddenly realized that it was merely a much much longer prose riff on the Waitresses' \\"Cristmas Wrapping\\" song from the early 80's (listen, you'll agree). Save yourself the anxiety brought on by reading the book and go listen to the song.P.S. Any book that suggests that a medium height woman at 130 pounds is overweight, should be nominated for an Annie B.(the award given to cultural images that cause eating disorders in young women and girls). Sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridget Jones Diary","review":"I was so disappointed when I read this book. Had this been written 15 years ago I might have found this funny. The subject has been done before ad naseum. It's trite and boring and found the character pathetic and self absorbed. I couldn't finish the book I disliked it so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chick Flick of Books","review":"I also thought this was a funny book - and you don't have to be single to relate. Also a thirty-something girl, I found myself laughing out loud and forcing my husband to read the funny parts. And who could not relate to Bridget when she dated the young \\"whippersnapper\\" who told her \\"You're all squashy.\\" Very funny book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me feel glad to be me","review":"Brilliant stuff! I connected with Jane from the beginning and didn't put it down until I'd finished. Where is the next few months of this enchanting women's life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read a different book?","review":"I thoroughly was bored by this book. There was little insight involved in constructing this narrative. I felt like i was reading someone's diary who was too obsessed with the typical, mundane conception of what it is to be a woman. If you need to reassure yourself that you have the same neuorses as other women then go ahead pick this book up, but if you are a woman who doesnt define yourself by a physical description nor by what society and magazines dictate then DONT BOTHER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, shallow and predictable.","review":"I for one will not be at all surprised if I read one day that Helen Fielding is the pseudonym for a shrewd but misogynistic male writer. It's a clever bit of marketing, though. It aims at the same areas that the supermarket magazines for women also aim at. The title character, Bridget Jones, seems to care only about her weight and getting a man while she's in her 30s and (phew) still young enough to have children. I say it wouldn't surprise me if a man wrote this book, because Bridget seems a composite of all the answers in magazine quizzes: \\"I think my thighs are (a) Just Right (b) Horrid, (c) Illegally Huge\\", etc. All the writer would have to do is buy a few magazines at the supermarket checkout counter. Voila -- instant character development. I notice I'm in the minority with a negative review...I'm not surprised, just saddened."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so glad that this is NOT American!","review":"Thank God this comes from the other side of the Atlantic. This book speaks to all that is trash in American (and I suppose British) culture. It's popularity is regrettable but not shocking. The writing is horrid and the dribble, worthless. This is talk-show pathetics at its worst! Does anybody really care what she weighs and smokes and drinks? Sadly, the answer to my question is apparently, YES. Somebody, please give B.J. some prozac! I am 24 and female and an avid reader. Most of my friends loved this. I can't for the life of me figure out why, but I felt I had to write in when Amazon recommended it."},{"rating":"1","title":"-5 star rating should be made for this book!","review":"Who wants to read about a thirty something woman whining about gaining a pound? Not me! Bridget was not an original character, nor was she a strong one. I had gotten to around page fifty when I could not make myself read another word of it. I took the book back. A book may not need to be a revelation of the human psyche, but if it's going to be this bad, it could at least be funny! Maybe then I wouldn't laugh at how poorly it's written."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy chicklit..oh so scrumptious","review":"if you want to laugh, then the fumbles and bumbles of the this single british 30 something is for you! i enjoyed this book tremendously. she's so funny!!! and you can relate. this is some witty stuff people!! check it out! it won't take you that long! it's quick and sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neurotic, then again, aren't we all?","review":"For those of you who have read the series about 'Adrian Mole', this is the female version (even to the bit about her parents' \\"crisis\\")of Mole. Indirectly funny yet horrifying when you think about the circumstances that Jones puts herself through."},{"rating":"1","title":"20th Century Neuroses","review":"Bridget Jones is your typical 30-something single woman in any large city around the world. At least that's what Helen Fielding would like us to believe. The truth is Bridget Jones is certainly an atypical 30-something single female from a \\"comfortable\\" background with a good job, in publishing as it happens, and all the attendant middle-class hangups about her physical size and what people think about her.If you are not part of this \\"clique\\" and you just know that she went to a public school and not the local comprehensive, then this book may well leave you cold. The only bits that will ring true are the getting righteiusly plastered with girlfriends whilst setting the world to rights and bemoaning all men as having far too much \\"emotional f***wittage\\".Frankly this book fitted a time and a place that just doesn't exist any more for most of the world's population. It passes a rainy afternoon but that is about all that can be said for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"I definitely did not like both books about Bridget Jones. Annoying and boring. Somehow you will feel how hard the author tried to make up something funny, but it turns to be quite overdone. I would recommend Kinsella's books for a fun reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"(v.g)","review":"Bridget is quirky, neurotic and v. funny! Oh - and slightly obsessive. ChuhI love Helen Fielding's style of writing. (v. clever)Bridget seems to be a v. real girl with troubles most of us can relate to. I'm a married (however, not smug) and I can still relate to Bridget because I am also somewhat neurotic and obsessive. (Should I have admitted that?) HuhI keep a journal myself and have often gone back to see what I was up to earlier. (v. interesting and sometimes v. sad!)One of the best things about Bridget is the way she bounces back from disappointments. (I'm envious)I have yet to see the movie, but I am eager to because I can totally see Renee Zellwiger as Bridget! Looking forward!I recommend this book if you are looking for some light and interesting reading and some laughs too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ab Fab!","review":"I just recently read this book in preparation for the upcoming movie release, and I absolutely laughed out loud. You can absolutely see Bridget jumping off the page as she stumbles through her commitments to her family, career, friends, social life and even her laundry. I hope the movie is as good as the book and I can't wait to see Hugh Grant and Renee Zellweger bring these characters to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down!!!","review":"I started reading the book after work and finished it in 7 hours. Although a modern twist on the _Pride and Prejudice_, the book is 100 times funnier! I completely identified with Bridget's experiences as much as I didn't want to admit it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny! Absolutely Loved It!","review":"This was such a great book -- it was funny and engaging. You'll end up loving the characters & wanting to know what happens next! I didn't want to put the book down and was sorry when it ended...I missed Bridget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Crazy English!","review":"I love this book not only because it really captures the life crisis that errupts in every late 20s/early 30s person, but it teaches you so much about the interesting aspects of contemporary English culture. This is something far from the Dickenisian world we usually envision, but a fast-paced new business world of intellectuals and modern women. You'll learn so much about the UK culture you'll want to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump on the Bridget Bandwagon!!","review":"Okay, I've already read both books and I've just watched the movie. I have to say that Bridget Jones is a very amusing read, and you don't have to relate to the girl to appreciate her antics. It takes a bit to get used to Bridget's writing and lingo, but you catch on and relish in your amusement. It mirrors P&P fairly well, with a \\"Mr. Wickham\\" and an honest-to-goodness Mr. Darcy, but you didn't have to read P&P to enjoy the book.I personally loved the second book more than the first (so go out and get the second one too) but that's because I am a big fan of Persuasion. And watch the movie! I don't mean to promo, but if you didn't love Colin Firth already from P&P, you'll love him now. Sigh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous feminist fearless!","review":"If you are female, run to get this book for your annual required dose of feel-good laughter. The cover was off-putting; I thought bodice ripper sex book. It's a feminist Monty Python stare at the dating side of a single woman's life and if you've dated anything you've thought, \\"God this is ludicrous, where's the camera/exit?\\" Fielding has miraculously distilled every one of these awkward dating/single social moments with biting wit and humour that frankly, only a Brit can write. Her writing is tight, has a great flow and is just outstanding (unlike mine:-). This is one of those writers you'll incorporate into your daily/weekly search for new books to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"self-interest","review":"the bridget jones phenomenom allowed me to feel a little happier with myself. despite all of bridget's faults and lack thereof, Fielding has made her a heroine for normal women (aside from the aquiremnet of mr. darcy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"True-to-Life Humor","review":"This book is one that basically looks at the female persona and pokes fun at it. Females are expected to be thin (but not too thin!), knowledgable, great cooks, etc. How many of us are all of those things? And if we aren't, just look at what we go through to get there.Bridget Jones is trying to perfect herself, or at least make herself better. The bad part is that she has her own set of human desires that keep her from doing this.Men: Avoid this book unless you have noticed the things your wife/girlfriend does and think you can see her side of things. Women who think Bridget should quit whining: You are either already perfect or are in denial about the silly things that you go through...Note also: This book is an easy, short read for those with short attention spans. Great for the beach or a short vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"has anyone NOT read this book?","review":"Like so many others, I've read Bridget Jones. Both before and afterwords, I read other books about twenty-something single neurotic women. Since I actually don't smoke incessantly and am completely non-weight obsessed, many of Bridget's qualities were more annoying than anything. But you just gotta love Bridget no matter what. In the movie, this is played out full-force, making Bridget more loveable than she is in the book. As heroines go, Bridget is adorable, light, and eternally optimistic. If you're looking for something a little darker, more realistic vision of loneliness, check out In the Drink instead by Kate Christenson.But if you're going to read the book and see the movie, the rule of book first does apply here. The movie really just picks up on Bridget's sunnier, more laughable qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"This book certainly had some funny parts, especially a pretentious cocktail party. But if you've ever read a \\"Cathy\\" comic strip, you've already read this book. Bridget indulges in constant insecure obsessing over weight, men, cigarettes, men, her job, men, her looks, and men. Tiresome, repetetive, and stereotypical -- in spite of entertaining moments, this book didn't end a moment too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am very surprised that so many people loved this book. I found Bridget very pathetic and shallow. She is obsessed with counting cigarettes, alcoholic drinks, and calories every day?! Do people actually do this??? I had a very difficult time relating to her and it is rather disappointing that so many women could relate. On a positive note, there were some funny parts and it is easy summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed isn't the word.","review":"I just couldn't get with it. It had some funny moments, but overall I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictably average summer read","review":"This book came highly recommended from a friend, and I was disappointed. I did laugh at some points, but found most of the book predictable and whiny. I personally thought \\"Alice K's Guide to Life\\" by Caroline Knapp did a better job of capturing the neurotic nature of the 30something single, female mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but inconsequential","review":"Very light reading. Good book for the beach, but will not find its place on my bookshelf of meaningful favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a laugh but not great","review":"Even if there isn't a calorie- and man-obsessing Bridget Jones lurking inside you, I'm sure nearly everyone can relate to some aspect of the character's neurotic behavior and scenarios in this book (a match-making mother, dinner parties, white lies, gift-giving, etc). However, after about several months of diary, the italicized resolution calculations lost their novelty and the book generally failed to be an engaging page-turner. Though I'm a 30-year-old \\"Singleton\\" myself, I felt I was reading about a group of friends just out of college, a sort of St. Elmo's Fire for the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridget is pathetic","review":"This book was not funny, although the author tried desperately to make it so. It was an OK read at best. I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"I soon grew tired of reading how many cigarettes, how many calories, and how much weight Bridget had lost each day. I confess, I could not get beyond January. Maybe I am too old to remember, but I am sure I never obsessed about these subjects like Bridget. Perhaps my granddaughter could relate to it. My advice, forget it and I only gave it one star because there was no category below that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. It started out well but I got sick of reading the same things in every entry. Bridget goes on and on about how fat she is, then reveals in one entry that her thighs are 19 inches. I just got disgusted at that point because it made it seem like all of her hystrionics about the rest of her life's problems were all for nothing. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares??","review":"Was given this book just in time for a beach holiday, and it turned out to be just right- fluffy, inconsequential, sloppily written. (and not proof read!) Fielding is funnier when she's musing about life in general than her own boring life, but overall she's tedious. Whilst I was reading this I happened to see an article in the Singapore edition of Elle Magazine, summing it up nicely: \\"It's the sort of behaviour that's a given in your teens, an indulgence in your 20's and a downright watse of time in your 30's\\". Quite- the book is a real mish mash of every female crisis, all happening to one woman at once. As the Elle article concluded: \\"We've come a long way, baby, but Bridget Jones only takes us back. And some of us have been there, done that. It's time to move on\\". Indeed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice men should read","review":"I bought a copy for all the women in my life ( wife, sister, mother - daughter too young ). I read it myself and wept with laughter.

But most of all it's funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous work of fiction","review":"I, too, was mislead by the Bestseller's List status of this book and foolishy bought it myself. I will admit that I enjoyed the first few chapters, but by the end I was disgusted. If I had wanted to read a Danielle Steel book, I would have bought one. Don't waste your time reading this book....it is a sheer disappointment. Oh, and the reviewer above who said that the author would not be receiving so many bad reviews were she a man....what a cop out! Bad writing is bad writing regardless of what's between your legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purposeless","review":"What's the point? Or, better yet: What's the big deal? Maybe it is a gender thing. I'm a guy, so i don't get the humor of Bridget Jones's Diary. The book is not funny. I found it quite tedious and i often wanted somebody to boot Bridget in the head. I did sympathize with the character at times. Quite a few times to be perfectly honest. Reading this book, i found myself waiting for a payoff that never came. I finish one chapter and think, \\"How dull.\\" I finish another, \\"How dreary.\\" I finish the book, \\"How tedious...and i'll never get that time back.\\" That's when i know i got nothing out of a book, when i realize that i've just wasted whatever amount of time i spent reading it. With all of the hype surrounding this book, i just feel let down and betrayed. It just wasn't interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"That the word feminism is used in association with this book is insulting to all us feminists. Some of us are actually 30-something professional, single women who are happy about their station in life.This book does, however, perfectly illustrate the sad state of \\"feminism\\" in England. I was there last November and there was actually a newspaper article about whether or not women should be allowed to be the boss of men at work! Disgraceful.I would say that based on this book and my own experiences in England, that women there have a long, long way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal???","review":"I found this so pathetic. I realize that I am in the minority on this one, still, I though I'd share my views. I really didn't want to hear about another person's whiny obsessions with dieting, bad boy friends and parents (which is essentially what the book is). I have plenty of friends who do that all day. The only good thing here was that it was a book and I could slam it shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid book!","review":"Bridget Jones's Diary is a stupid waste of time. I was so disappointed because there has been so much good press about this book, but I found it to be shallow and insincere. Bridget is a total whiner and her mother is a terrible person. I wouldn't recommend that anyone read this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the cover and titile entice you - it's awful!","review":"I was very excited to order this book as I heard rave reviews from critics about Bridget Jones. Let me tell you, I hated the book so much I almost didn't finish it. The character, Bridget, is stupid and pathetic. How anyone could find her amusing is beyond my understanding - her life is sad and she is not using her life to it's best potential. I heard they are making a movie about it - steer clear, no matter what the hype says!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: Silly","review":"Helen Fielding is an incredibly gifted writer. There's no denying that. But this book is so overhyped it's not even funny. The storyline of a self-obsessed thirty-something (the book kindly hints that when you're in your thirties you're 'old') searching for a boyfriend and complaining about her weight is so boring, so unoriginal. Yeah, 130 pounds is terribly overweight, isn't it? This book makes women look like cry babies with nothing better to do than feel sorry for themselves. Worse yet, there's a sequel coming. Oh boy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly amusing for the first 25 pages at best","review":"After the rave reviews I was looking forward to this one, but was sorely disappointed. The main character is a total stereotype--obsessed with finding a boyfriend, cigarettes, weight and chocolate--maybe in reverse order. Her job fills time she would otherwise spend eating and smoking. Why is it that no one writes books like this about guys? Portrayals of women like this aren't that funny to begin with, and this one wore thin quickly. Don't waste your time on the sequel--I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones, Everywoman","review":"Every woman that reads this book will be left wondering, \\"How did Helen Fielding get a hold of my diary?!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing","review":"This book is great for holiday reading.Once you started you can't stop.Bridget's story is really close to our own experierences with chocolate and cigarettes.

I wonder how accurate however the portrayal of finding your Darcy literally shoved in your face is???? answers on a postcard!!Good for you BJ who taught me if it'll happen then just bide your time - oh and also not to give dinner parties.

It is not trying to \\"replace\\" its American equivalent; it's just that the author is British. Hey, this book is so far [I'm 3/4 through it] so incredibly relaxing and hilarious. Ah, yes. If you want to laugh about yuppies networking and a thirty-something \\"modern woman\\" 's getting through the office, through strange parents, a fat boss, men... and die laughing at the same time, check it out. If you take it for what it is , a comedy novel about a year in a typical English woman's life in her yuppie thirties, without a subconscious literary critic mindset you 'll appreciate it ! At the very least, it shall relieve your stress. So important these days. Two thumbs up! Fantastic comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Familiar?","review":"Yep, just like a few of the other reviewers here, I got into BJ's Diary, and recognized that it is just Pride and Prejudice '99-2000. It's a cute book, and I do recommend it, but I don't think this book is all it's cracked-up to be. I didn't laugh quite as much as others apparently...but I did find myself cheering for Bridget by the end. As far as relatable? Loved Bridget's friends...her wacky mother running off and returning without any remorse was a bit much for me. I don't know. Do a lot of mothers do that these days?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"As a single career oriented female of the 90's, it was so refreshing to read a book that made me laugh at the trials of my everyday life!

We're all still looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grown up female perspective of Adrian Mole","review":"I read the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole by Sue Townsend about 13 years ago, and found Bridget Jones's Diary to be remarkably similar.

I whizzed thorugh it in about a day, and found it very easy going, but felt that it's been done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridget Jones","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book. I didn't care for the movie. But everybody always seems to think that the books are better than the movies. So I read the book and was disappointed. I thought it was very slow and repetitive. Some scenes were over the top, like Bridget's mother and Julio. I am going to read the sequel since I already have the book. But this isn't a book I would recommend. I didn't bring me any emotion...I didn't laugh, I didn't cry...I just got bored and wanted to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't see what all the fuss is about","review":"I'm annoyed that I spent $1 to reserve this at the library. I had to force myself to finish it. If this is the sort of character that young women today relate to, I fear for our gender. To say that Bridget is shallow, sophmoric and simplistic would be an understatement.This book was supposed to be hilareous but I only managed a weak chuckle once near the end of the book. I gave it two stars because it is slightly better than the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Simply hilarious!

It's about Bridget Jones life and let me tell you, she has a life. To her it might not be funny but for us to read. I liked the person she was, not perfect but not bad.

I just don't get it! I' m not sinlge, and I've never been into counting calories, but I don't think I would have appreciated it even if I didn't have those \\"disadvantages\\". The only reason I finished it is because it's coming up in my book club now with the film and everything. If it wasn't for that, no way. It's no fun, it's boring, it lacks uplifting qualities like beautiful language or vivid characters or interesting plot. If you want to read about relationships, pick something else. Anything else. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BBC top 100??","review":"I began reading this book as a result seeing the BBC's recommendation of the top 100 books. When seeing other books on the list, such as Tale of Two Cities and To Kill A Mockingbird, I was expecting great things. The book was amusing, yet I was disappointed in the morality level. This is not a book which should be on such a list of excellent literature. More like chick-lit, light, and all for fun reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and honest","review":"I loved this book. It is refreshingly honest and so funny! It makes the reader feel understood and validated. We've all been there-- frustrated, hopeful, confused, and ecstatic all in the same day over some of the same situations. We just can't always put it in to words. We can all relate to Bridget Jones' day-to-day accounting of home, work, relationships, emotions, ups, and downs. I laughed and cried with her. Bridget's thoughts and feelings are so well-expressed that we know exactly where she's \\"coming from.\\" Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow, pathetic look at career women in the nineties","review":"This book is funny for about five minutes (and I'm being generous)... Bridget Jones is a classic example of a shallow, pathetic woman who views her career as a way to find a suitable husband, defines herself by who she sleeps with, how much she weighs, and sees parties as opportunities to get drunk.

It only shows how that women can only be happy once she finds a man, and, as the story goes, Bridget wastes the entire year searching for 'the perfect gu-uy' and grumbles about everything else. It sounds more like the diary of an immature sixteen year-old. By her thirties at this time and age, she should have been trying to achieve the 'Woman of the 90's' outlook, but she just transported us back to the 50's, when the utter desire of the average woman was to land a man and make babies. Most readers (and to think WOMEN!!!) were so ecstatic in saying 'this is THE woman of the 90's!' but it's more like a regression to the unliberated thinking of the 50's woman. To make it worse, she works through the diary having spontaneous sex. I suppose by the year 2000 she'd have probably contracted STD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite funny book","review":"This book is dead funny.

It is hilarious!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest book I have ever read.","review":"I just finished it and am already missing her. Loved this book so much I actually couldn't wait to get home to read it every day. I made myself stop reading it so as to save some for the next day. I am glad I'm not the only female having weird thoughts like her (well sometimes!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ding Dong! Great book!!!!","review":"Helen Fielding is wonderful! This is a definite read!!! I ride public transportation on the way to and from work--and I found myself laughing out loud many times! FAR better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Derivative","review":"It's hard to understand all the brouhaha over this book! The story is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The presentation as the-misadventures-of-the-comic-heroine was perfected over 20 years ago by Jilly Cooper. Jane Austen is better. Jilly Cooper is better. This would be one of the few cases I have seen where the movie is better than the book. And that's pretty darn sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not relate to this book...","review":"...even though I'm also a single woman in her 30s. Not all of us are that insecure. Bridget should get over it already. Some of us do have other things to worry besides weight and drinking too much (which I think is a serious problem). And none my married friends are anything like hers (thank God). Is this how society sees single women? Is this how I'm supposed to act...because I'm single?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Jones's Diary:Just be yourself and not as silly as BJ","review":"I was very excited to read this book as I heard rave reviews from everyone about it. I'm 28, Spanish, engaged and I don't smoke nor drink much and I'm Kate Moss' size so I guess I don't have much in common with Bridget Jones (and apparently not with many other readers either) but I didn't laugh -not once- through the book which I found pathetic. Certainly, B.J. is not a role model for 30 something single women. My single friends do not relate to this character at all, thanks god for that! and surely their lives (and mine too) are much more interesting and funnier. So do not rush to your nearest bookstore to buy it because it's a waste of time... and money. Read \\"The Diaries of Adrian Mole\\" or \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" instead and count on a good laugh out loud. : - )"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Prefer Jane","review":"I was surpsied at how utterly pathetic Bridget is. I kept waiting for her to face her alcoholism. And I found the writing awkward. I guess leaving the subject out of the sentence is supposed to make it seem more like an actual diary, but I kept having to re-read to make sense of it. I understand that people like this book and hey! that's great for you. But if you DON'T like this book, try \\"The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" -- Jane is so much cooler than Bridget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest book in the world","review":"I read this book last summer when I was 16 and found it to be one of the stupidest things Ive ever read.Bridget jones is the most unrealist fictional charater Ive ever come across and the plot was even more ridicolous. In fact, the stupidity of this book still boggles my mind and I cant believe anybody would identify with Bridget.To me thats like coming out and screaming\\"Look at me!Im the dumbest most shallow person in the universe.!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH -- Too Much Hype.","review":"I found the book to be v. dull. There were many references to places and customs in London that unless you have been there, many wouldn't know what the author was referring to. This book was definitely overhyped! I kept reading hoping it would get better, but unfortunately it turned out to be just wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Following the juvenile rantings of a thirty-year-old woman who is obsessed with her weight and lack of boyfriend hardly seems worth a place on any best-seller list. It is a sad commentary on the emotional and intellectual state of the \\"average\\" thirty-something woman that this book has done so well. Bridget is a pathetic character - insecure, unimginative, and borderline hysterical. And it's not even funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget, Bridget, Bridget...","review":"She's a study in imperfection: overeating, excessive drinking, procrastination. She lacks sophistication, thrives on self improvement and obssesses over men. She's not Everywoman, but she is someone, who, in her indelicate, calorie counting, wistful self is far more realistic than the beautiful, together heroines of romance novels. She struggles with her weight, just as a lot of women do--thinking herself fat when she isn't; swears to diet and stop smoking, just as soon as she's finished her last \\"fag\\", her last \\"Milk Tray\\"; she craves after the hunk at work in the manner of a junior high school girl. Her adventures are funny and she is endearing because she is not perfect. Though she gripes about married people's smugness, her focus is not primarily on finding a man. All this is chronicled into a funny, fast read that shouldn't be taken THAT seriously--enough to say she's giving women a bad name and blah blah blah. It's just a book! And an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny must read","review":"This book is very funny and so true. My wife, daughter, daughter in law and myself all read it and could not put it down. For all those who continually diet and or make self improvement plans you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pride and Prejudice for my Generation!!! Thank You!!!","review":"I found the connection between Pride & Bridget Jones' only after I sat grinning as I pondered the last chapter. I received the same warm, cozy, I'm-not-the-only-one-out-there kind of feeling as I did when I read of Elizabeth and her stony faced soul mate. The parallels began with the introduction of the stand-off'ish new Mr. Darcy, and continue throughout the book, ending with, well, let's just say Eliza, I mean Bridget finds her Darcy to be quite a savior... Austen fans will know : ) Bridget Jones is a heroine of the best type - she seems real. While some people may not enjoy her self loathing or manic attitudes about weight loss and her compulsive nicotine habit, I welcome you to take a few steps back and tell me you don't know at least one woman who shares her traits. Helen has given us Jane Austen in the Ally McBeal - Demi Moore - Cindy Crawford world we live in....THANK YOU HELEN / JANE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny, I work with 3 Bridget Jones's","review":"I had a hard time putting it down. Always another laugh in the next paragraph. I work with three 30ish girls just like this. It is so very realistic, they are asked some pretty outreagous questions. They do diet, try to quit or cut down on smoking, search for a man and they all own the very short black skirt. One of the \\"girls\\" read the book and told me how much she enjoyed it so I had to have it too. What a fun and fast read I recommend it to all who enjoy a good laugh. You will also find some of your friends and experiences in this delightful comedy.

But her previous book, Cause Celeb, is also completely brilliant, and I think it's high time everybody read that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones & I Were Separated at Birth!","review":"Funny, crazy and totally in the now! I loved this book. I can identify with Bridget's total neuroses...work, love, sex, weight loss, weight gain, making promises to higher beings in order to get a roll in the sac and white wine. So what that it's slightly common and not deep and not...? I loved it nonetheless. If you're a woman in your 30's, live in a big city and are single, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"V. Hilarious.","review":"Ms. Fielding has created a wonderful world in this funny book; Bridget's dilemmas are every girls' dilemmas, and I loved Bridget Jones and her crazy singleton friends.

I did read the entire book, however, I personally didn't find this type of read interesting. But I can say that it would make a great beach read or nothing else to do read. The writer's writing and style was good. If this is your type of book, I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screamingly Funny","review":"I could not put this down and kept saying to myself: \\"I am soooo Bridget!\\". Then I settled down, got attached and am even thinking about getting a puppy - so now I delve into every once in a while to remind me about \\"single life\\"!

Either way, you'll have an opinion and have a rollicking good time forming it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud!","review":"I laughed out loud while reading this book. This book really portrayed what it is like to be a woman in their late-twenties trying to have it all. Bridget wants it all, boyfriend, career, friends and close family. The book is easy reading and you will certainly enjoy it if you just want something \\"fun\\" to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly diverting, but hyped to death","review":"There's nothing inherently bad about this book if you take it as a light-hearted piece of entertainment. Nothing wrong with that; it isn't remotely realistic, it's stereotyped, it doesn't pretend to either originality or literacy (I hope!). I read it in the bath, then gave it away to someone else. However: I do find it slightly worrying to see so many people who genuinely see this book as a kind of manual for the times. No-one is saying Bridget is real. God help us, surely no-one is saying we should be like Bridget. As far as I know, a generation of adolescents didn't suddenly develop a craving to be Adrian Mole. Be amused if you can. Be very amused (if you can, I just managed the odd smile). But please don't let's pretend this is literature....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Laughs, And A Light Read!","review":"This book will leave you laughing!

Usually when a book gets a lot of publicity I don't like them, but this was definitely an exception.Bridget Jones is a 30-something year old woman living in England. She is obsessed with her weight, lottery tickets, her boss David, and having a boyfriend. She is disgusted with Smug Marrieds, her mother, and parties.When Bridget finally begins finding people to date she is disappointed with the outcome, one is engaged, one comments on \\"how squishy she is.\\" Will she ever find someone who is just normal?This is a wonderful, funny book, and a must read.

Do 30-something Singletons really behave in this manner? The concept of counting calories, cigarettes (or should I say \\"fags\\"), and alcohol units was novel for the first 30 or so pages...but by the month of May, it was getting old! This type of behavior made popular by Ally McBeal is stale.

Months of in and out lead into one long, drawn-out account of the boredom of being a \\"singleton.\\" The grammar and arrangement is atrocious and unappealing. The book is written like a very long to-do list. It includes nothing in the present tense, and as we all know, inactive verbs make a really boring read!\\"Bridget\\" manages not only to be annoyingly British, but also obviously not British at all. The dates on her entry are American dates (mm/dd/yy) and opposed to the proper European way (dd/mm/yy). Her spellings are American but her slang is British.It's just plain confusing and not worth the waste of time it takes to finish. Get \\"Confessions of a Shop-A-Holic\\" or \\"Shop-A-Holic Take Manhattan\\" by Sophie Kinsella for a more unique, honest and funny portrayal of single British women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable Editing for the Kindle Edition (Love the Story Though)","review":"I love Bridget Jones Diary and have read it several times. Beware, however, the editing of this book for the Kindle edition was unaccptable - the font changed randomly a few times during the book, a few lines of text were missing completely, and a weird random image of a book cover kept popping up at the most random times throughout the text. I ended up calling customer service and demanding my money back. Buy the book, not the kindle edition, if you want an enjoyable reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Actually I'm rating this two and a half stars. I feel like the only person in the universe who absolutely hated the movie. However, most books are better than their movie, so i decided to read it. I thought this book dragged on and was very repetitive. I am happy to say that in the very last chapter is when a change occurred and made me think that i like the book just a little better than the movie.I feel that Bridget gave other singletons a bad name, she was so pathetic rather than funny. I am a single girl myself, and if i was so obsessed with weight, how much a drank, smoked, and how nobody loves me because i don't have a boyfriend...i'm sure i would have shot myself by now!! If you really have to read it borrow it or check it out from your library, but i think it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is BRILLIANT!!!","review":"I will try and make this review short and sweet like our Miss Jones.

It's really a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such fun v.g read","review":"Bought this on a whim in London over a year ago. I don't know if it has had a re print for U.S. readers, but it was quite a good read. Easy to put down and pick right up again.

I've already passed this one on, and I can only hope to get it back........someday"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"I have never laughed so much. I found myself laying in bed late at night in fits of laughter and able to completly relate. I encourage anyone who is thirty something or approaching and who has experienced the horrids of the dating world to pick this up instead going to the bar one Friday night, its cheaper, less calories and more fun than anyone you would have met!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"For anyone concerned about the \\"dumbing-down\\" of humanity, here it is in all its glory. This is a pointless, plotless, poorly-written excuse for a novel. And although it does provide a few chuckles, it's repetitive, shallow and utterly insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but nothing great...","review":"I enjoyed this fictitious diary about Bridget, a thirtysomething stressing about men, diets, and men...did I mention that? However, since I'm not British, and a bit young for the series, it was not that easy to relate to Bridget, even though I did like her. I also knew I missed quite a few jokes with all the British slang. It has it's cute moments, but overall, it's just basically a fluffy light read, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and delightful","review":"I was skeptical of this book, but it turned out to be delightful. Given to me by a British friend, I was afraid I wouldn't understand all of it, but the different sense of humor (the British seem to laugh at themselves better than we do) made it extremely funny. I recommend it for most women, whatever your age (well, maybe my 80-year-old mom wouldn't like the language and some of the other stuff) because it has commonalities that we would sometimes like to forget. Go for it...it's a laugh. Probably shouldn't read it in bed with your husband/lover. Hmmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I guess I'm one of the few people who didn't think this book was fall down hysterical or typical of what women experience in the dating world. Although it has some funny moments, it didn't keep my interest all the way through, and I ended up putting it down and picking it up over the span of a few weeks. I actually found the character to be more pitiful, than funny and couldn't help but think, who the heck would do all these stupid things??? I know it's just a book, but I think it's just so-so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to shake her silly.","review":"I want to grab her, and shake her. Oh, AND her idiot mother. Never in my life have I encountered such a shallow character.I don't understand the appeal of this book - the movie was cute, Hugh Grant does smarmy so well... the book, although very readable and the diary-format is fun - is a complete waste of time and money.Bridget shows you the classic teenaged way of dealing with your problems - drink and obsess. She thinks only with her hormones, whines, and has a collection of equally shallow friends.Seriously, I enjoyed Meg Cabot's The Princess Diaries a thousand times more... also written in diary-form, Meg's character, Mia, is at least someone who learns from her mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of this one","review":"Fortunately I didn't have to spend money or time on this book. A friend lent me the \\"book on CD\\" so I'd have something to do while driving my daughter, age 14, to a volleyball tournament. Both my daughter & I listened to the book and both of us found it tedious and not even vaguely representative of the female psyche, certainly not ours. If there's an interest in delving into the psyche of an extremely shallow and self-absorbed young woman, and it appears there is, then this is the book for them. Funny, I did not find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I really laughed my head off several times while going through this wonderful book. I love Bridget Jones, you absolutely have to get this book if you haven't yet. I hope she's writing more books about Bridget Jones. Helen Fielding is a very funny writer, she really knows how to make a reader laugh. Not many books or authors have succeeded in doing that. This is absolutely worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun fluff read.","review":"This is good for a rainy afternoon...you will finish it in just a couple of hours though. Better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare to the original!","review":"I'm sorry to say, but I was very disappointed by this \\"redacted\\" version of the original. I ordered it online expecting the original, but found that it was not nearly as funny. I remember laughing out loud reading the original on the train! As expected, I highly recommend the original (a 5 Star Plus!). I also have to say that I was disappointed that there was nothing at amazon stating that it wasn't the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing Out Loud","review":"This book had me laughing out loud each night as I read it in bed. Maybe it is because I am a young single woman who can relate to Bridget's overall daily behavior and thoughts. The way this book is written is very witty and charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Admittedly, my love of Pride and Prejudice might have influenced the fun I had reading this book. The romance is delightful but Bridget's quirky humor won me over. Great for the beach or just a quick engaging read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-read a million times","review":"Adore this book. Read it every year. It has gotten me through break ups, break downs, and life in general. Thank you Bridget."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL","review":"This is one of the few books I've read recently that made me laugh out loud as I was reading.

I'm older than this book's subject by more than a decade, and it definitely crosses that generation gap."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can truly relate!","review":"This book left me in stitches!

This is one great beach book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapy bound between two covers...","review":"Thank you, Helen, for making me feel \\"normal\\" (whatever that is) once again! I am not alone!

I would recommend this book to anyone, espically single women, in need of a good laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing story for those after thirty","review":"I thought that Fielding gave pathetic view of a woman's life after thirty. It was very depressing how Bridget was obsessed with her love interest, Daniel, and how he completely blew her off. It appeared as though nothing in Bridget's life was going right until the end. Overall, the book seemed unrealistic and full of Bridget whining about how pathetic her life was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Stupid, Boring and Completely Self-Absorbed","review":"If you spend all of your time obsessing about your weight, the amount of cigarettes you smoke per day, the calorie content of every drink, and the best way to let some loser guy get into your bed while an obviously good one gets your cold shoulder, than READ ON. If you have more important concerns, you will hate it. I just wish I could have given it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Afflatus","review":"What's all the fuss?

I'm all for Singles Empowerment and International Understanding, and I'll be the first to appreciate Brit humo(u)r. But after the first 50 pages, you've seen it all. And how about some complete sentences? This doesn't pass literary muster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is popular with women? Which women?","review":"I'm amazed that this novel has been so popular. I love all things British but I couldn't stand Bridget after awhile. Her endless calorie counting, taking two hours to get dressed, and pathetic whining about not having a man border on the offensive. I'm a single woman myself and I have lots of single friends and I don't know a single one who acts like this. I wanted to shake Bridget and shout at her, \\"Who cares if you have a man or not - enjoy your life! Eat what you want. Do some charity work! Do something worthwhile instead of drowning in liquor and self-pity!\\" And as if that isn't bad enough, the other characters are one-dimensional cartoons especially Bridget's mother who becomes an adulteress, talk show host and thief - none of which is even faintly believable. If ever the success of a book made me wonder about the taste of the masses, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just about the worst book I've ever read.","review":"I had high hopes for this book. It got rave reviews on NPR and it was supposed to be the hottest thing in London. What an incredible disappointment! Incredibly pretentious and a real bore to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it - and so did all my friends","review":"I can not even remember the last time I read a book so funny that I almost fell off the couch, as I did with Bridget (yes, I feel like I know her well enough to call her by her first name). I have now forced half-a-dozen of my friends to read it, and they have all adored it - one stayed home for two days to finish it, another ignored her recently-arrived-from-overseas boyfriend until she finished reading December, and a third stayed up all night reading and laughing herself silly. No, Bridget isn't the ideal woman. But she's what we all are sometimes - and she has irony and wit to go with her neuroses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious adventures and insights!","review":"This book made me laugh out loud, stay up until 4 AM, and start writing a diary! I couldn't put it down, and I've been recommending Bridget ever since! Fielding's observations about family, the constant struggle between the Singletons and Smug Marrieds, and the obsessions we all hide, are oftentimes true and always hysterical! The diary-style prose was very entertaining and I'm still laughing (of course, my friends call it an obsession)! Buy this book now, and pass it along to all your friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly captures what most women feel","review":"As an American living in London for the last 4 years, I felt I could totally associate with Bridget...she is hysterical and hits on how we all feel sometimes....and she loves to laugh at herself! I think women in any country can appreciate this book and share it with all of your friends....I have a very worn copy which has been passed around many times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe all the hype-not uproarisly funny","review":"It was an easy read but did not hold my interest. In fact after reading this book only days before I could hardly remember enough to discuss at book club. A taped interview by the author was the most interesting part of the evening. As a 40's something there was very little I could relate too. In fact at times I wanted to shake Bridget and say-wake up there is a REAL world out there--find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"v.b.","review":"Although there were funny moments, all in all the book severely disappoints. Bridget is certainly neither a feminist nor particularly appealing. Many of the characters, including Bridget's extraordinarily obnoxious mother, are completely flat and unbelievable. Not to mention the fact that the conclusion is too ridiculous for words. If you must read it, borrow a copy - you'll be happy to have not wasted the $13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of fun","review":"This book was wonderful, with a brilliant cast of characters. It was at times fall-down hilarious. The situations Bridget is in are nothing outstanding or unusual, but they are somehow made unique and worth reading about. Any woman can find at least a little bit of herself in Bridget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff. If you like that kind of thing...","review":"An amusing read. Just check your feminist principles at the door first. Bridget is incredibly shallow. Just about the point I work up some sympathy for her, she dissolves into complete vapidness. (The whole bit about enjoying the drama of her friend's imagined death? Or her mother's criminal escapades? Please.) And the end is farcical. And Mark Darcy is, yes, the knight in shining armor... Also, I don't care how many lottery tickets she buys, but the device has to be consistent. Okay, all that said, it does have some funny bits. It's sort of brain candy. The pleasures you get from this are the same derived from reading People magazine. Fluffy confection. Not literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH - self obsessed drivel","review":"This was among the most difficult books I have ever read. I never felt connected to the whining and ridiculous heroine.

I told my best friend about it and she loved it as much as I did, she was in hawaii when she finished reading it, and went all over the island looking for 'The Edge of Reason' to continue the story. Bridgett is soooo funny, her adventures made me laugh so hard that I cried! I wish Helen Fielding would write a third book. If you read The diary you have to read The Edge of Reason, it's even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GIVE A LISTEN, LAUGH A LOT","review":"Thanks to book and movie many are now familiar with the escapades of that beguiling Brit Bridget Jones. A large portion of the above many may feel that moviedom's Renee Zellweger is Bridget incarnate on screen, and she is terrific.However, the audio book version is equally superb - Tracie Bennett has the voice of Bridget down to a fair farthing as she takes us on a joy ride through one year in Bridget's life. Whether she's plaintive, flirtatious, hopeful, or bemoaning her situation, Tracie Bennett captures our heroine perfectly.Give a listen, laugh a lot, then share with a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"I couldn't even get through the first chapter, and I absolutely hate how the author basically based it as a modern version of Pride and Prejudice. Yet Bridget is not \\"perfect\\" like Elizabeth Bennet ( P & P's heroine). Bridget is very wacky and does very silly things. It was just so boring to read in \\"diary format.\\" The one thing that I like about the character is that she has her flaws. So that makes it more realistic. However, I must say that one ought to stick to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen instead. Even though I did not like Bridget Jones's Diary, I did like the movie. I finally understood Bridget and who she was, and in the movie she is a very lovable character so I would reccomend the movie over the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life","review":"This book is great!

It was so annoying that I could not even finish it, and I bought it in hardcover. I am usually able to struggle through a hardback when I buy it because of the cost. This one however was just too annoying. I thought the story and its premise was refreshing when I picked it up. It was a departure in plot and presentation from the other books offered last simmer the main character was just not very likeable. Since the book was about her I found it unreadable. I do not recommend it and would not reccomend it even if it is found on the bargain table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing-by-numbers","review":"Oh I wanted to like this. I'm usually a fan of diary-type novels but this was dire. The saddest part of the whole Bridget Jones lore is the fact that the book was so successful. So many women screaming with laughter thinking this novel mirrors their life when, if it really does, then it isn't really a lot to laugh about.Fielding lays out a fairly bog-standard plot. Bridget is a loser, then a man enters her life and she is a winner. The man leaves and she is a loser again. Been done before, been done better. In addition, Fielding rips off an earlier 'diary' novel for the whole fancy dress/not fancy dress party plotline (Diary of a Somebody by Christopher Matthew, written in the late 1970's and obviously quite a popular read with Fielding)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow quick read","review":"Bridget Jones's Diary fluxuates between being a critique of the superficiality of women's obsessions and a clever depiction of the growing pains of our late-twenties/early-thirties. Funny discussions with her flighty mother, overbearing friends, horrid boss, and stereotypical lovers do not make up for the disturbing simplification of intelligent women who seem introspective until they think about food, fat, self image, or clothing.Disappointing as clever read, disappointing as expose of late-twentieth century women. Not worth buying, but worth reading a couple of chapters if you find it abandoned by someone tired with the repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was excellent -the book is even better!","review":"This is an excellent and funny book. Quite a bit of it is in diary form but much is like a novel -my preference as I find diaries can get a bit hard to read.Helen Fielding has captured Bridget's thoughts in a hilarious way, the things she's thinking at 'those' family Christmas parties (you get much more detail in the book), 'that' boss and of course in dealings with her neurotic mother.I quote Bridget:\\"I am not going to spend another evening being danced around in front of Mark Darcy like a spoonful of pureed turnip in front of a baby\\".If you like Marian Keyes, you'll like this.

The character Bridget is so \\"frightfully\\" annoying that I found myself wanting to choke her. The humor was way too obvious with only a few one-liners that managed to give the book some redeeming qualities. This is an OK read for a 14 year old who isn't an intellectual giant, but those not in that category should just give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"futile attempt to bring down the inflated average","review":"This book annoyed me in that Bridget never changes. I had hopes in the beginning that she would somehow overcome her insecurities and neuroses, and so I endured her uninteresting obsessions. But in the end I felt duped by her constancy. She is a little kid whining for candy, only in the end to get her candy and undoubtedly begin whining for something else. Perhaps it is a true picture of the gen-x-er, but I live it so I don't need to read it in my free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, trite and a little funny","review":"Sure, it really IS funny to be smart, self-conscious and just out of perfection's reach. But, really, the questions remains: So what? Helen Fielding is clever but even she has to know that Bridget is a joke and all that calorie-counting and cigarette tallying isn't very sustainable. If Bridget wants a different life, then why in the world is she obsessed with enumerating the idiocies of the one she has?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read!","review":"What an enjoyable read! A very light, humorous read that you can not put down! You can not help but root for Bridget, relate to Bridget and want to be Bridget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes funny, but sad in a pathetic sort of way","review":"I am probably one of the few who felt this book did not live up to its hype. Sure, there were some funny parts that I chuckled over, but for the most I found it quite disturbing that the protagonist was so embarrasingly desperate for a boyfriend and that she felt that being all of 126 pounds (Oh, the sheer horror of it!) meant that she was too fat. If today's women find that they can easily relate to being obsessed with ridiculous diets (when they are already rather small) and not being secure enough to be happy without a man, then authors such as Kate Chopin and Zora Neale Hurston obviously wrote about their strong female characters in vain.On the other hand, I do realize it's simply a work of fiction and that every novel doesn't have to have some life-affirming message at the end. So if you find yourself with a few hours to pass, this light,quick (albeit 'fluffy') read is actually not the worst way to go. You might even laugh a time or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality; cheaply made","review":"I bought this match case trying to find one like the one my dad had as an Eagle Scout.

We watch this over and over again. He is able to answer the questions correctly, without much prompting. He refers to the \\"Wild Things\\" as animals he recognizes...a moose, a lion, a bird, etc...

A few nits: I would have liked more information about training your dog to climb stairs (Gromit figured it out in about a week with a lot of help from me). The book is very pro lure coursing (a non-gambling kind of greyhound racing); many sources on the net feel that lure coursing is very dangerous for ex-racers due to injuries the racers encounter during their careers.

This was a man who had both a wonderful voice and ability to lead a rock band. I was a hard core INXS fan until Hutchence's death. The way the remanding band went about finding a new lead singer, via reality TV show (Hmmmm.....Just jump on the bandwagon) was tacky.As for J.D. Fortune, is it his fault or the band's fault that he is trying so hard to sound like Hutchence. HERE IS YOUR WAKE UP CALL INXS; \\"You can't replace a great lead singer with some shoddy facsimile!\\" No matter whom INXS would pick to be the new lead singer, he was going to be compared to Hutchence. If INXS wanted to really go into a different direction, they should have picked one of the female singers on the reality show. After all, some of them had some nice talent. How cool would it have been to see a woman sing Suicide Blonde?As for this new INXS, well \\"It ain't pretty!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the spirit of Michael Hutchence","review":"I first discovered INXS through the Rock Star INXS reality show this past summer. I liked the songs so much, I went back and got some old INXS albums, which I've really enjoyed.I was eagerly awaiting \\"Switch\\", although JD was not my choice for their new singer. However, having said that, I am very impressed with the album. Songs like \\"Devil's Party\\", \\"Pretty Vegas\\", \\"Us\\", and others, remain true to the spirit of Michael Hutchence. At times, you can really imagine him singing these songs, although JD remains his own person.I was very pleased with the inclusion of Suzi McNeil on the album.

However, at this point, he might have been scared to veto some of the not-too-good songs on this album.The album basically isn't very good. Most of the songs are listenable, but forgettable, and the rest are unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.There was another thing about this album, which at first I could not put my finger on, but I have figured out. The instrumentals are missing something. The whole sound is lacking an organic, \\"we played this all on real instruments in a real studio\\" sound. The fact is, they sound more synthesized and \\"80's\\" then they ever did in the 80's. The songwriting isn't really inventive.The tracks I thought were the best are:The Devil's Party - Classic INXS soundAfterglow - Strong chorusPerfect Stranger - Another very strong chorus, but a better song in general than AfterglowUs - I liked this one a lot on the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Forgettable","review":"I've seen reviews in the print media griping about JD Fortune and his posing as Michael Hutchence. Fortune is NOT the problem. He is saddled with lame, forgettable, hook-less songs to sing. The only memorable and decent song on the album is the one he penned (Pretty Vegas) on the reality TV Show. There is no Devil Inside, Suicide Blond, or even Taste It here. Despite the tragic loss of their bandmate, one would think that after all these years the Farris brothers would have had a shed full of catchy songs. The album is certainly listenable, but so forgettable. I suggest you see 'em live and hopefully they will focus on their old stuff and leave most of the new stuff out of their set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I time warp?","review":"For those of you who watched the Rockstar: INXS series, what I am about to write will make sense, if not you may seem confused. INXS has quelled the awesome talents and voice of JD Fortune. During the show he had incredible energy and fire, yet on this album he has been toned down to a \\"love song\\" singer. Also, they BUTCHERED Pretty Vegas, PERIOD. Teh shows version is 10 times better as it is on my favorites on my computer, IPod and play lists. If you like the Switch version yet haven't heard the shows version, download it from MSN or wherever and tell me I am wrong. I was hoping this album wouldn't be an 80's throwback but it is and I agree with other reviewers that they indeed haven't got a clue to what mainstream music is like.

Glad I borrowed the CD not bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the Go-Go's, but...","review":"This isn't really TOO bad, but very unoriginal. I guess the old lead singer was what made the band anything but a second rate Huey Lewis knockoff, which is what this sounds like. It could have been worse - but that's about the only good thing you could say about it. I can't imagine any karaoke singer that couldn't 'write' songs as original as this. But since they have the marketing muscle, this will sell, regardless of the overall lack of attention to detail and generic vocals and playing. If you're going to imitate the 80s, why not copy the quirky and inventive stuff instead of beer-commercials, big hair, and silly, coked-up swagger?"},{"rating":"1","title":"excuse me","review":"hello what is it that i'm hearin' on this review site that this is the best album inxs did.for ages hello this is not inxs this is JD fortune and 5 \\"money grabbin'\\" old men tryin' to sell the inxs name with whatever cheap marketting they can promote i had alot of respect for inxs now it's all gone because they gone and done the thing a band does when their desperate for money and tryin' to re-calm there thorn as the top music genius's but with JD fortune they suck donkey a$$ because..IT'S NOT INXS THIS IS NOT INXS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, some not so good","review":"Besides Pretty Vegas, Afterglow and God's Top Ten are my favorites.

For a band that put so much time and effort into conducting a highly publicized global search to find a new singer and put out a new album, I thought it would have been better. At least, I hoped it would be. I was rooting for the band to have a big comeback -- I really was.But after actually hearing their new material, only one question comes to mind: why bother? The album has a few catchy moments (most notably in Afterglow), but is overall just bland. The band seems to have become a watered-down parody of its former self.There is more to a band than just a brand name. This album proves to me that the real genius of the original INXS was, in fact, Michael Hutchence, and that the remaining band members are now only going through the motions."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, not so good...","review":"I was expecting MUCH more from this album, but unfortunately, the only worthwhile song is Pretty Vegas.

I think people are looking into this far more than they should. If you've heard Pretty Vegas on the radio and like what you hear then go buy the album. If you've heard Pretty Vegas on the radio and don't like what you've heard then don't buy the album. Quite frankly it's THAT SIMPLE!! Forget about the reality show, IT'S OVER!Bottom line, this is a very good CD. I won't go as far as to say that it's awesome, but it's very good, catchy with the right ends of the spectrum and a little of everything in between.

Glad I didn't get concert tickets."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But falls flat","review":"I listened to the CD three times and gave it away. I didnt watch the Rock Star show. I dont really know anything about the new singer. I did hear there were others that were better. He sounds like he is imitating Elvis. A bad Elvis at that. I am happy the guy doesnt sound like Michael, but he just doesnt have any range in his voice. His voice is just flat and dull. His voice lacks the raw sexiness Michaels had. The songs sound like they were just thrown together. I was going to give it one star, but gave it another for the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"the singer's name","review":"is JD Fortune..

INXS FOREVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better every time","review":"I just had to write in to say how much I enjoy this CD. I'm not normally a big fan when it comes to music, but I can't stop playing this CD. It gets better every time and I absolutely love JD's vocals, very sultry and edgy.I also have to say something in response to those people who criticize this CD for sounding too much like the old INXS. If you liked the old INXS, what's the problem? I don't think it sounds out-dated. If INXS had come back on the scene with a completely different sound, they would probabaly have as many or more people criticizing them for that. You can't please everyone. If you like the classic INXS sound, you'll enjoy this CD! I really question people who say they were really big INXS fans, but are disappointed that the new CD sounds like INXS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for INXS fans....","review":"Don't let the fact that Michael Hutchence is gone steer you away from INXS' latest release \\"Switch\\". The band is intact and with J.D. Fortune at the mike, sounds as much like their former self as is reasonably possible. The band, on this album, disintegrates any notion that they were only a backup for a singer. They're crafted songwriters who understand the mechanics behind a \\"wall of sound\\" and they amply deliver it here on cuts like \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Perfect Strangers\\", and \\"God's Top Ten\\", their tribute to Michael. While this is no perfect album, as there are a few weak cuts, it's an admirably strong album that's well worth your time. You'll wonder how you made it through these past years without this staple of a band having something new in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"I am a big fan, and grew up with these guys blaring out my cd player all through high school. I was very pleased that they continued in the direction of Welcome to Wherever You Are. This is very modern sounding, yet retains the danceability that previous albums were famous for. JD is a worthy successor, and I was glad to see he was chosen as the singer. Best tracks on here are Hungry, Devils Party, Perfect Strangers, and Us."},{"rating":"2","title":"We lost a treasure, but found a fortune...","review":"While no one could ever 'replace' Michael, I have to say JD does a great job getting INXS back to work. He might have been an arrogant SOB on the show, but he more than proves on Switch he's up for the challenge! Fav songs, Pretty Vegas, After Glow - a fitting tribute to Michael in my mind. Overall, the album has shades of both old and new INXS and is a GREAT listen.Kudos to the band for getting Sweet Suzy and Deanna on background vocals...and asking Marty to open for them on tour. They've proven themselves to be the classy and oh, so talented guys they are with this album/audition process and I just hope the public receives it with open arms (and wallets) and supports them so this won't be just a one shot deal.BUY THE RECORD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time - Worth the wait","review":"It's about time - Worth the wait buy it to enjoy - Welcome to Inxs JD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good album....but has a few good songs","review":"\\"Dirty Vegas\\", \\"God's Top Ten\\" and \\"Afterglow\\" are all standouts.

How sad to realize that the Farris brothers are capitalists first and musicians second... To me INXS has ended with MH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing","review":"I ' m sorry to say that I can't recommend this CD after listening to it. I guess I fell for all the hype and am now disappointed. Something is definitely missing. Perhaps, its the lack of newness or creativity. It just sounds too manufactured, too derivative. It really sounds formulaic making it almost instantly forgettable and strangely weak even with the volume. Where's the creativity in this CD? I don't recall INXS being this synthesized which makes it sound all the more dated. I think the best way I can describe my reaction to this CD is that it made me feel like I was listening to a \\"Tribute Band\\" instead of the real thing. It seemed emotionally remote even though I' m sure it was calculated to be just the opposite. It just left me feeling unsatisfied - empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... It could have been better","review":"If you're concerned with sound, perfect aspect ratio, or for using with games, AVOID. When the signal creates a bright picture, or when the screen is mostly white, you get an annoying buzzing sound. The aspect ratio isn't a perfect 4:3, so you can't see the entire picture (one inch cut off on the left side, and half an inch on the bottom by my estimations) you're intended to view. This is most annoying for games, which may display information that you can't view because of this. The only advantage with games is the included A/V connectors in the front, but if you lose the remote, you can't access the GAME channel, making the connectors useless (not to mention that only one sound connector is included, instead of two).Get a Daewoo Portland instead, it's...less [money],...has no sound glitches, has a perfect 4:3 aspect ratio, and (with a RFU adaptor) works well with games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good bargin","review":"My sister bought this TV and she is more than pleased.

The picture is good, the picture is about as good as an RCA tv, the sound is just ok, It is pretty muffled and kind of loud, but you can still hear peoples voices and music clearly, the remote is basic, it works ok, but when you want to use the A/V jacks you got to get the remote and switch it to game mode, it is a pain but you'll get use to it. It seems like a pretty reliable tv because my friend uses hers everyday for about 5 hours (and she is not careful with her stuff) and she had it for about a year and it still works good. I would reccomend this tv to anyone who wants a good 19 inch tv and doesn't want to spend to much money"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's \\"OK\\"","review":"Ok I guess I should not complain because I won this TV this summer, but I agree with the person who said they have a buzzing sound. Sometimes when I am watching a show and it makes a cut to the next scene you can hear a buzzing sound, which is quite loud. It is rare but it does happen. On another note, i was walking around my room on my cell phone and when I got near the TV it was buzzing so loud, but when i stepped away from the TV it was fine. It is an overall \\"OK\\" TV. But I don't think that I would buy it, I am glad I got it for free.

Whenever there is white on the screen, there is a high pitched buzzing. I'm a quiet person and an apartment dweller so I like to keep the volume rather low. Sometimes I can't hear the dialog because of the buzzing. I've set the brightness and contrast low which has reduced the buzzing but now I often can't make out what's on the screen...certainly not any detail.

The interplay between this trio is mind-boggling. Though I'm not a fan of Chick, this album is definitely an exception. Listen to how they cook on the first track.

If you dig this album you'll also enjoy some of Bill Evans' stuff and also Pat Metheny's trio work."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent trio date","review":"What can I say. This album is one of Chick's best. His playing is crisp, Miroslav Vitous' bass is punchy, amd Roy Haynes' drums are cracklin'. The compositions on this album are just beautiful. Recorded in '68 or '69. Blue note sound quality (choice). Lengthy disc, you'll definitely get your money's worth. All players take fantastic solos and have plenty of room to stretch out when they want to. Quite a bit of material not issued on the original LP.

Baskette sings (and sometimes closer to speaks) with a voice and style that's sometimes reminiscent of Jill Sobule. But she has a quirky charisma and likeability that's hard to define.

The first single \\"Last Call\\" talks about getting a call from an old love, who's probably sitting in a bar somewhere listening to a country song. From there the album gets better and better. \\"New Again\\" talks about how everything's old and worn out, but someone's love can make us new again. \\"The Bees\\" is an intriging song, based on the novel \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\", and one worth listening to. \\"If these walls could talk\\" is a story about a family facing hard times, and a little child's prayers.

To give this book to my grandchild would mean that I approve of this and I certainly do not approve of this. And the story is so weak, the only thing the book has going for it are the illustrations.

There is some humor here, as well as the characteristic asides present in the author's other stories. Inspired by the Kabbalah and the works of the 18th century scholar Baal Shem Tov, this is the most spiritual of Madonna's three children's books and the best of them to date.Eileen Rieback"},{"rating":"1","title":"so much for purchasing based on reviews...","review":"These things are flimsy and they arrived warped (with a slight curvature to the case). Regular-sized DVD case construction is much sturdier... yes, they are thicker but the plastic is also thicker and sturdier. These could be more sturdy. Though I figured they would pretty much be the same size (facially) as standard cases I didn't think it would be such a hassle to get the cover art inserted. You better have a straight paper cutter, or better yet just fold one end, unless you want to mangle the edges of the cover art. Expect to spend hours getting your collection moved over. How hard would it be to make the case just a tad (5-6mm) wider (facially) so that no cutting or folding is required on the insert? I'm returning these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Them","review":"I was EXTREMELY impressed with how quickly these came. I got these the very next day after placing the order and they came in great condition. They fit perfectly and I love how thin they are. They make my DVD collection look amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The covers are strong and you can see the contents through the cover. Worked well for my home movies form the 1070's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed at a very reasonable price","review":"I burned video DVDs as Christmas gifts this year. Rather than label them with a sharpie and slap them into any old jewel case, I had a rubber stamp made for clean labeling and burned the contents onto discs with printable faces. These cases were the final touch to add a lot more \\"class\\" to an otherwise inexpensive stocking stuffer. They're made of exactly the kind of flexible, but tough plastic I hoped they'd be... The Clear plastic sleeve on the outside affords the opportunity to put your own printable label onto it and the disc holding 'button' keeps the disc in place but doesn't require you to snap the damn thing in half in order to remove it. I'll definitely be getting more of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim is in !","review":"I bought one pack of these and will probably buy more. These are amazing space savers for your one disc DVD cases. I dont know how well they'd work with the smaller Blu-ray (11mm thickness) cover art. They are about half the size of a regular DVD case (15mm), I believe these are 7mm..but may be wrong. I like the clear color and they are flexible !! (ie not fragile like jewel cases are). I trimmed the cover art using a pair of scissors. My only complaint would be the titles on the (very thin) spine don't always align perfect with these, thats to be expected I guess ...but they do save space and that is the main reason I purchased them. I did a quick comparison and the 25 slim cases took about the same amount of space as 12 regular cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific for archival storage of DVD programs","review":"These single-DVD cases are ideal for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they are durable, not fragile like the ordinary hard plastic cases. Next, they are much thinner than the conventional commercial DVD cases, yet they accept a user-generated ID card inside the front cover. Admittedly, there is no room for a spine label, but I file my DVDs by program content anyway so I have no trouble finding what I want. The space-saving quality is more important than the spine ID. Next, they are transparent but milky enough so you can see them on a table even when they are empty. I hope Amazon keeps them in stock because I can't find them anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Ever!","review":"I have been using these cases for years and have always been satisfied with them.

They look very nice on my TV stand shelves and have given me back a lot of space. What I don't like is that the DVD covers are a pain to neatly fit inside, as others have mentioned.

They seem to be of a good quality too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some will not close, even when empty.","review":"Defective: Several of the cases I received are warped and will not close properly; this is not the quality one might expect from a brand name like Memorex.These Slim cases have most the features you might look for in a standard DVD case however as the name states they are Slim, 7mm compared to the 14mm of a standard DVD case so standard inserts do not fit. This is not a defect it is just something to consider when choosing slim cases over standard cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim DVD Cases","review":"These are a good value for the money, however they seem to be a wee bit thinner and more prone to warping than the \\"same\\" product purchased at Staples.

Flynn's deft handling of Corbett's outsize personality--a mix of classy manners and boorish bluster--and Bond's own turn as Sullivan, a champion boxer who can \\"lick any man in creation,\\" are the film's main attraction. In dramatizing Corbett's colorful career, Walsh handles the action exceedingly well, especially the final ring showdown, a bout as jarring and thrilling as anything in Scorsese's \\"Raging Bull.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, probably Earl's best!","review":"I loved this movie. My only regret is they don't have it in dvd. Great historical movie of James J. Corbett. Truly the father of scientific boxing. It was said when someone saw him in his coffin when he had died, \\"He doesn't even have a scar on his face\\" That is how good of a boxer he was. He fought great fighters, and done well against them all because of his acquired skill. The movie brings some of this out. His movement and his left jab, keeping his opponenets off balance. He came along at a time when boxing was primarily brawling with the bigger, harder hitting man the victor most of the time. Corbett was most of the time 185 to 195 pounds. A small heavyweight these days. But he consistently beat men heavier than himself. Flynn brings this out in this movie. I don't know how truthful the romance part was in the movie, probably typical hollywood. But a great movie never the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"gentleman jim","review":"Although more fiction than fact, it was a very enjoyable movie.

While it did not cost all that much, it is still something we wanted or I would not have ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm no gentleman","review":"Over acted, historically innacurate, and absolutely one of my favorite movies!!! The chemistry between Flynn and Smith (to be used again in other films) is amazing for the time. Their last lines to each other in the movie were a great example of the banter between the two. Ward Bond, Jack Carson, and William Frawley (plus others) all played their parts in this charming free-from-all-fact story of Jim Corbett's rise to the heavyweight championship finally doing what no man had done before...defeat John L. Sullivan.I have warn out my VHS and am thrilled to have it coming out on DVD. There are a lot of funny classics that are at last comng out on DVD. This is more comedy and light entertainment, but well done. It has some of the tongue-in-cheek that The Man Who Came to Dinner has, which I would highly recommend as well.I can't wait to watch the brawling, the foot work, and the flair that Flynn had in this delightful movie. It looks like it would have been fun to make :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Moto Guzzi","review":"The author does provide a good overview of the brand and provides opinions on reliability and future appreciation of each model.

This book was written in the late 40's as a response to the Zootsuit murders which brought to the attention of the American people the marginalized situation of Chicano people. McWilliams pieced together the little that was known about the history of the settlement of the southwest by Spanish subjects who were mainly people of mixed descent in order to establish that these people were not \\"immigrants\\" but rather more native to the land than the Anglo population. The mixture of history, sociology, and news was ahead of its time, making it accessible to people from different backgrounds.

However, it is difficult to find the book by itself, but do comparision shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Barbie......","review":"Well, it isn't everyday someone sends a 13 year old a Barbie. I used to be OBSESSED by Barbies but I grew out of them.So, about a week ago I recieved a package from one of my mom's friends. And surprise surprise it had a Nutcracker Barbie and the video.It's really beautiful, but, really, not much to do with it, except for brushing it's hair, twirling it around on her little stand and letting her fall in love with my Lifeguard Ken. But I thought the sticky little hair jewels make really neat Hindu jewels......very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry","review":"\\"Season of the Sacred Fool\\" is a really well written book of poems. If one wants to read poetry that is historical and personal, this book is for that person. Otto Osip Ochs writes in a deep and emotional style that will leave a lingering impression on the reader. I highly recommend \\"Season of the Sacred Fool.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no Tsukihime anime","review":"There is no Tsukihime anime.Seriously though. This anime sucks so hard, many of the English-speaking TYPE-MOON fans vehemently deny its existence. It doesn't hold a candle to the real game. If you watched the anime and liked it (or even hated it), PLAY THE GAME! It tells the story so much better than the anime (which just sort of takes one route and ham-fistedly jams elements of other routes into it).Oh and the characters look all retarded too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Americana release of 2003!","review":"This is the best record of Danny Barnes' career (including the Bad Livers/Willies, etc.). That is saying something as I am a big fan of his entire body of work. The material spans the history of American music and has elements of bluegrass, rock, jazz, old time, and more. Also included are two unique and amazing covers of The Faces \\"Ooh La La\\" and Beck's \\"Loser\\". The band is comprised of Danny, Bill Frisell, Chuck Leavell, Darol Anger, Dirk Powell and others--how can you go wrong? The record is solid from start to finish and I can not get it out of my player. The man is a genius and one of the best singer/songwriters in the world--he deserves more attention and you should buy this record now--you will not be dissapointed! It's a modern roots masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Jazz's Greatest Female Vocalist with a Decent Pianist","review":"Well I looked for this record from 1972 until I finally bought a Japanese reissue in 1985 in Greenwich Village. I have approximately 30 other Christy albums and I live in the small midwestern city she was born in. So no surprise I like the lady. This particular collection has her singing with Stan Kenton playing the piano. The renditions are extremely etched. People always talk about Sinatra's phrasing (well, he was the best) but June really evokes heart and soul on these songs. Special place in the heart: Angel Eyes. Heartbreaker: Lonely Woman. A good place to start on Christy. Not as pop as \\"Something Cool,\\" not as much fun as \\"The Misty Miss Christy. But Shirley Luster sure could croon. Classic jazz, even if she was a white girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"June Christy at her best","review":"For the big band duo, this was an unusual format (June's vocals backed up only by Stan on piano), but there is no better showcase for June Christy's voice--bright, but, simultaneously, haunting with a sense of vulnerability and sorrow. If you're a June Christy/Stan Kenton fan, you will love this CD. It is really something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar performances.","review":"My pick for best-ever performances of these songs:\\"How Long Has This Been Going On\\",\\"(He called me) Baby, Baby, All The Time\\",\\"Angel Eyes\\".June Christie is incomparable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This set is really heavy duty so if you want something more like a light blanket to keep you warm, this would be an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Noonday Demon: an atlas of depression","review":"The book is very well documented and easy to read. The book gives insight to a very difficult subject. A must read for one who is depressed or has a loved one that is depressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Noonday Demon","review":"Solomon has taken on the tast of synthesizing personal and clinical data in a very thoughtful manner. This book explores all apsects of depression, and threads them together for the reader. It is a resource for those who suffer from depression, and those who have loved ones who suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping and tragic story - beautifully written","review":"Atlas is such an appropriate word. This book is one of those rare finds; a combination of truth, tragedy and ultimately hope. This book is beautifully written and is incredibly painful to read because the descriptions of the author's despair are described in such vivid detail. \\"The Music of Madness\\" by Tracy Harris is similar in its vivid portrayal of mental illness (I recently completed reading that one as well) and I am thrilled to see a new crop of books about mental illness that tell it like it is and help instill empathy in others who can only imagine the suffering. I recommend this book to anyone who suffers from depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Depressing","review":"I was overwhelmed by the complicated explanations to define depression and I couldn't get to the feel good part before I was too depressed to read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dense for me","review":"This book has interesting information... stories and facts. But it's so densely written as to be almost impenetrable. Editing would have helped, but I think my chief complaint is with the book's layout. The chapters are extremely long with almost no breaks in the text to delineate a switch in subtopic or give the reader a place to pause. With a little white space and perhaps some subtitles, this book would have been much more accessible. As is, I just can't seem to wade through the swamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Pharma's Darling: Award Winning Depression Book","review":"The excellent writing in Noonday Demon describes the agony of depression in a profound way. The author is the son of Howard Solomon, head of Forest Laboratories who sells Celexa so there was a lot of big pharma money behind the book. Author Solomon doesn't seem to know a thing about how his own brain works, and basically has decided to surrender helplessly to his own mind. I would rather see mediocre writing describing the joy of how you get out of depression instead Pulitzer Prize poetry about the agony of how you have to live with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope,and Great Information for a Pevasive Problem","review":"Andrew Solomon is indeed deserving of the recognitionl given him for Noonday Demon as receipient of the National Book Award.In Demon, Solomon assists us all in realizing how crippling depression is for so many people. He provides informed and depthful information on the full range of manifestations in which depression shows itself in life. For those suffereing and those seeking to understand this illness, there a fine review of all of the causes and the treatment modalities. He gives the reader an understanding of how complex this illness can be and just how widespread it is.Most important of all, Solomon tells of his own depressive illness, and offers through his example, a tremendous hope for those still suffering. There can be life again, and you are not alone! A singularly important book for our times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too raw for me to read........a trigger for my depression","review":"I had to put this book down after 70 pages. It was too graphic and too raw for me to read. With a history of depression myself and 2 hospitalizations, it triggered me into another depression. Do not recommend to anyone with a similar history as myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book if you are depressed!","review":"I wish I had read more of the reviews before I bought this book. As it was, I only saw the first few and they were all positive. You would do well to read a few of the negative reviews, they have alot of important things to say about why this book is not as great as popular opinion seems to think. Yes, there is alot of information about drugs for depression and many anecdotal sequences touching on therapy and other people's experiences, but this is one person's very skewed view of things.I know there is hope out there for those of us who suffer from depression so I can't give up and I hope you don't either. But overall, I did not find this book to be positive or uplifting or to offer much hope. And I don't recommend reading this book if you are already depressed, it may only make you feel worse, as it did for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no \\"atlas\\"","review":"On the positive side, the personal experience of the author's depression is daunting and even insightful (it may make anyone think twice about whether they really suffer from depression, compared to the extent of his illness). But I feel mislead: from the synopses and reviews I read, I expected more than an extended self-portrait. He could have condensed his own trauma into the introductory portion and spent more time with the \\"atlas\\" and \\"cross-cultural\\" analysis that is supposedly the focal point. It lost my interest quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the things I wish I'd known","review":"If I had a dollar for every time I'd advised my son to \\"Get out of bed and get with it,\\" I'd be rich. Only now, reading this book, do I realize how little I knew about his illness, and how futile were my efforts to help. How I wish I had had this book in my hands a decade ago. This is beautifully written, practical, amusing in parts, and genuinely helpful. I think every adult ought to read this because at some time or another every one of us is going to have to deal with depression -- either our own, or the depression of a loved one. Most important, this book gives me the confidence to continue to nurture my adult son through his latest episode. I owe Mr. Solomon a real \\"thank you\\" for writing his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"Andrew Solomons book will be helpful to many people not just sufferers of depression and their families. It is somewhat disjointed at times and overly dramatic however i think this proves just how closely hes deals every day with depression and the meds needed to \\"control \\" it. THis book will go a long way towards removing the illogical stigma and fear that surrounds depression and all mood disorders. i admire his deep honesty and tireless research particularly as he was so obviously suffering during the writing of this book. Recommended reading-- Undoing depression by richard o'connor , a good companion text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Noonday Demon - wonderful book","review":"I am a senior in a Miami university, and i bought this book as part of a porject for my Abnormal Pshycology class. This book turned out to be such a great read. it provided you detailed reaserch and information about depression without wrapping you up in it too much. It was cleverly written, not soppy or sad. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that is interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"the other reviews pretty much sum it up- this book stinks. It's too long and too pointless. I suffer from depression and I learned a bit, but not nearly as much as one would think from the size of the book. If you are writing a paper, this might be a good source. I don't suggest it if it is for your own use. If you are horribly suicidal, it will keep your thoughts and self occupied for a long time, hopefully until the feeling subsides a wee bit. Borrow it from the local library if you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic Twaddle","review":"All I could think was, \\"Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed.\\" I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him. I only ended up feeling more depressed. As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive.If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Noonday Demon","review":"Andrew Solomon has managed to put into one book a complete view of depression from his personal experiences and extensive research that spans the spectrum of history, politics, impact of adddiction, suicide, alternative therapies and treatments. For anyone suffering from depression, or wanting to understand the disease and how to help, this book offers that opportunity. Solomon does not delve into the multiple variants (e.g. Bi-polar) other than to mention them from time to time; so if that is what you want/need, there are other books out there for that.This is not \\"Depression for Dummies\\" - it is a more clinical view of the disease. You may find that you need to put the book down for a bit, as each chapter is very comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal exploration/exposition","review":"Along with the works of Kay Redfield Jameson, a terrific account of Solomon's experience with his own mania and depression - bipolar disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Andrew Solomon's beautiful writing is not only quite inspiring, but also brings us hope and comfort. He definitely deserves all the wonderful awards he got for this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant, human, intelligent, informed, heartfelt","review":"Read it. It's the best book on depression that I've read (& I've read them all-- I'm educated in medicine & behavioral science & have 'experience' with the subject matter...(!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough! Maybe too Thorough","review":"\\"too much information,\\" occasionally comes to mind when reading Noonday Demon, but that is far better than not enough. Solomon really dives into this subject with a vengance and gives you all you would ever hope to know regarding depressions history to treatments to modern perception,etc. The last chapter \\"Hope\\" is especially steller, and there is no chapter that is a let down. Occasionally I found the pace plodding, but I never thought his writing was in fact \\"depressing\\" it was enlightening, and an excellent job throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me depresser","review":"This book isn't for people who suffer with depression.Didn't understand why it had so much dispair in the beginning of the book.Just sad,sad,so sad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Oliver Sacks Version","review":"This is a narcisstic book--badly written-- by someone who is in pain and wants to share it. Consider the sentence \\"I was blissfully happy\\" (describing his college years) What does it mean?He was very happy? College was bliss? Solomon is quite write that depressives can tax their friends patience--but at least a certain contract exists between friends. If Solomon wants to share his pain with the public he must craft a language,shape sentences that have enough impersonality or distance\\" to compel. That is hard work. So: he relies on worn out phrases and cheap locutions like 'hearts and minds'... his book has the tone of narrative self-confession and self agrandizement coupled with post romantic cliche's about the value of Pain..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, Whine, Whine","review":"\\"I must have all of my wishes filled; whine, whine, whine.\\" From reading this book, Andrew Solomon comes over as a spoiled rich brat, who looks for answers to his depression everyplace but inside himself. This is typical of immature people who want a pill to do it all for them, but refuse to do the hard work of confronting their own mistaken attitudes and beliefs. All of Andrew's whining is merely symptomatic of his resistance to therapy. If he went to a good cognitive therapist, he could be cured in 5 - 6 sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Acid, look out here it comes!","review":"If you are into Death, Acid, or Heavy, buy this CD it's pretty good, I would have given it 5 stars but Heavy Metal is my favorite.

Some \\"Christian\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stockholm 64 - a must-have track","review":"Most of the album might be of a style of jazz that is an 'acquired taste', shall I say. However, 'Stockholm 64' is fantastic - one of my favourite jazz tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This album has its moments but the for most part is overrated. The highlights of the CD are remixed samples taken from Monk's legendary session w/ Coltrane (Trinkle, Trinkle) and some snippets stolen from a Sun Ra CD (A relaxing place on Venus). For sure there are some brilliant highlights on this album. The cover of Tony Williams' There comes a time is top notch. However, much of the album just seems to drag. I think Gianluca has a lot of potential to be the next big avante garde trombonist, but there just isn't enough here yet to make it interesting. If you really love the avante garde, and especially if you are a Grachan Moncur fan and are looking for someone who might be his next generation predecessor, this is a must have. For everyone else, it's not worth picking up. This CD is not bad. It's just that it had such high reviews everywhere (here on Amazon, all music, and downbeat magazine) that I was expecting much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"My six year old granddaughter loves this","review":"The quality is great and my granddaughter enjoys preparing her hair and \\"make up\\" as well as her dolls' sitting at this vanity.

She loved them and was so very excited about them; however, less than two weeks later, all three of the chairs broke. The chairs are for the most part made of wood and are very cute, but the back rests on the chairs are only made of cardboard, so they actually broke in half. We tried to repair them, but once cardboard is torn, that's it. So until they make the chair backs out of wood as they have the other parts of the chairs, I wouldn't purchase any of these sets with chairs. Very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea-Olive","review":"Another awesome book by Augusta Trobaugh, reminiscent of Fried Green Tomatoes, but without BBQ.I thought it started off a little slow, but it was necessary to love the characters and care about what happened to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Light reading, humorous. Reminded me of Arsenic and Old Lace. Not a lot of bird watching got done by the ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"This is not the sort of story I normally read, but thoroughly enjoyed the character study of Southern women.

Was a pleasure to read, and am looking forward to reading another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived Fantasy!","review":"Well, I finished this book, but I can't say I enjoyed it. Everything in it is so contrived. *Spoiler alert* The women's names taken from hymnal songs is just silly; whoever heard of an entire townful of mothers all sticking with a stupid theme for their children's names. And the respected judge who turns out to be a wife beater whose treatment of his first two wives caused his family to banish him. I have known women who felt trapped in abusive relationships, but a middle-aged woman who wants to stick by a physical abuser after knowing him for all of 5 months just wasn't believable to me. The whole town seemed populated by superficial morons. Save your money. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tea-Olive Bird Watching Society","review":"This was a little too far fetched for me.

Basically just hackneyed garbage. Die Hard and Dennis the Menace are mentioned, so at least the movie is up front about its lack of originality. This movie has a dumb A-team esque thing where no one is killed even though they should be. It's like a brainless cartoon. The dune buggie finale is a good idea and memorable.It's a fun movie to watch on a lazy afternoon, with a fun soundtrack and good actors, great location. Plus it's a 90s flick, so it has that going for it. It's funny to read the reviews on here that are worshipful of the young lead. Worshiping male celebrities was pretty popular back then (Dicaprio.)

First we have antagonists who are most likely mercks, but lack the skills to prove that they are. Even their leader, considering his role, is not appropriate to be a British SAS. Also, they are very \\"soft\\", to consider that they are equipped with dartguns. I got irritated also that there were many times that the protagonist will surely be caught but the criminals were so stupid. The film also lacks of realism, not much crowds outside the gate, considering that these are children held hostages. Mines exploding very near policemen, but they were not much affected by the blasts, etc. Well I need not go on. For me, don't waste your money buying this movie. If you want, just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money unless you like looking at Vincent","review":"This movie is terrible.

If anyone would like a free copy of this book, go comb the Rockland landfill.Aside from the untested and unproofed examples, the text was rather disjointed, and provided a skimming the surface view of Zope that seems to offer precious little foundation in the system.

I forgive the typos, as I believe this a translated work, but not having matching code really ticks me off.In general, even a skilled developer _will not_ be able to work through _any_ of the examples to fruition. Thus the [money] you'll spend here will get you some background information, but not working examples.The final insult to the reader is that the Publisher does not have an errata site where corrections could be posted.

Support Underground Hip-Hop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did it again.","review":"Yes, Jedi Mind Tricks has done it again. Pleased my ears. Ikon and Stoupe came out with probably the best hip hop CD I have ever heard. JMT is not to be slept on, I have been a fan for a long time and I was awaiting this release. Props to JMT for the well done gem that they have released and a big shout out goes to, Superegular Records, who are producing some of the most talented in the hip hop scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointing","review":"The best performances on this album are from the guest artists: Mr. Lif, Planet, Chief Kimachi. The performances from Jedi Mind Tricks and from Virtuoso, Esoteric etc. are not worth listening to. This album is portrayed as \\"underground\\" but starting with the real-life images of vietnam-style executions that adorn the cover, this CD is mindless, and, in terms of production, unspectacular. I wrote this review to hopefully save people some money (so you can spend it on one of the many bangin' CDs out there). This one is not worth the fiber it's recorded on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"I'm gonna keep it brief here, but look, this is honestly the hottest CD I own. I'm all about underground hip hop, from talib to gang starr to DITC and everything in between, but this is undeniably amazing hip hop. This could be an instrumental CD and still get 5 stars from me, but the fact that there are some of the best MC's alive on this piece make it worth buying. I introduced it to one of my friends one time, and the next day, everyone I knew was talking about it. I'm done, but man, you just gotta hear the beats on this. They're ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP QUALITY","review":"This album is TOP QUALITY. It has an intense underground feel to all of the tunes. It contrasts rock hard lyrics with flowing classical strings \\"Heavenly Divine, The Deer Hunter and Retaliation\\".

An all round stunner!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the album","review":"I first learned about Jedi Mind Tricks from one of my best friends and so I couldn't find it in stores or anywhere else. When I heard my friends copy, I was hooked. Awesome beats and lyrics keep you captivated each song on the album. Hopefully one day people will realize that underground groups like JMT and other artists such as Virtuoso, 7L & Esoteric and more have more skillz than most of these mainstream rappers. They even surpass the recent Wu-Tang release IMHO, and that is by far a tight achievement for two rappers and a producer to accomplish. Buy the album, support JMT and one day we could see their video playin on BET or MTV."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite hot sauces.","review":"This used to be at a favorite Caribbean restaurant in town, its been at least a year since they carried it and I finally bought some for myself. This sauce packs heat as well as carries a little sweetness. Honestly I love it on a piece of buttered bread best but it also goes well with sweet(ish) meats. (for example: Pork chops with apples or pears, pizza with pineapple, sweet barbecue sauced things)Totally worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't click for me","review":"I liked the story's premise, but it could have been a lot better. It was like it was two different books that didn't go together- cute and dirty. I enjoy good erotica, which it tried to be, but the language just didn't fit the sweet story. I couldn't see the characters saying some of the things they did. I also never really felt the love connection either. She was a virgin at 32, come on! She was a modern day professional not a sheltered lady. It was a quick read though, at least it had that going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty blah","review":"I expected this book to be predictable and that's fine. Sometimes a straight-forward romantic tale is what I'm looking for. This book, however, was really bland. The cover art is the sexiest thing about it. Sure, there is sex but I would hardly call this an erotic tale. The worst part is, I didn't care enough about the characters to enjoy them getting together. The story itself was all too pat and cliched. Way too much so, even for a romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"With clients like that, who needs enemies?","review":"Eric Ward lives in a dark and dangerous world. As a criminal defense lawyer he deals with the crusty and crafty bottom feeders who dwell along the edge of the Tyne. These are the worst kind of river-rats. Ward could have worked in a posh, upscale office with wealthy clients but this is the life he chose.What he didn't choose was to be caught up in international intrigue. But when an important local shipping firm hires him to look into the circumstances surrounding an arrested ship, Ward finds himself sailing through deeper waters than h ever imagined. He's out of his depth and surrounded by mystery but his intimate knowledge of the criminal element and the aid of some shifty characters just might carry him through.The seedy underbelly of international shipping comes alive in this suspenseful tale by Ray Lewis. Written in clear, crisp language this book is a delightfully quick and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Lou's Best","review":"This is a classic of the genre, it's up there with \\"everything I play\\" and \\"mr.

Unfortunately, I'm told this has been discontinued and to me that is heart breaking. Many have found the Angel fragrance to be somewhat similar, but believe me, there is a difference. Britto is the best!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duke is the best","review":"This is one of the those movies you could never get tired of watching. Wayne and Caan were excellent together, and I regret they did make another movie together. Mitchum also worked well with Wayne. The give and take they throw at one another always keeps me laughing. It also pulls out a little sadness and sympathy, like when Luke McDonald is shot and how bad Thornton (Wayne) feels. McCloud also is a sympathic character. Though Wayne's adversay in the movie, he is not a bad man. A very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"swagger","review":"A beautiful DVD transfer for a great film. One of the other reviews described the movie as \\"relaxed.\\" That's just it. Hawks really brings out the best in Wayne (though Wayne is always wonderful). I can't describe the sort of comfortable, macho male swagger that this kind of picture typifies--you just have to see it. And they really don't make 'em like this anymore. Great performances all around, but especially Wayne and Guest. I'll quibble with the last reviewer: Mitchum is great but the Duke is so large that he pushes everyone else out of the screen. Hey, what can you do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable , doesn't matter that it's a remake","review":"I had already seen Rio Bravo and then heard that this film was a remake of that , but wanted to see Robert Mitchum in the drunk role that Dean Martin played so well in Rio Bravo .Mr Mitchum does very well .This is a solid Western and like other reviewers I particularly enjoyed James Caan's character .The story keeps the characters going as much as the audience - you feel they are making up their minds what to do as it goes along .I hope we get a Special Edition of this film one day , but this one will do for now .If you know Rio Bravo , you may well enjoy this film more ."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the classics","review":"this is one of the many GREAT John Wayne films. it is helped by a star studded cast including a very young James Caan (Mississippi) and another legend of the big screen Robert Mitchum who plays Waynes old acquaintance who has turned town drunk/sheriff.

I recently purchase a video from Rarewaves in London, England. While the seller identified it as Region 2 and had a note to see DVD format, I think they should have used more \\"attention\\" focusing words in their listing.

Wayne and Mitchum are both on their game and play off each other like the pros they were. Since the plot is pretty simple, the characters get to show their stuff regularly throughout the movie. All parts of the movie provide fun and the old belief that the good guy should win and get the pretty girl. When you are through watching you have the feeling that the actors had as much fun making the movie as you had in watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wayne movie ever.","review":"This movie is the best movie from the Duke that we have yet to watch. We probably have found over 40 of his movies so far, and continue to look for them. Our 2 favorites are Rio Bravo and El Dorado. The story lines are similar in some ways, but we like to watch them both. Robert Mitchum puts on one of his best acting performances. If you like the Duke, you gotta see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of all time","review":"I haved loved this movie since i was a child watching it with my dad. John Wayne and Robert Mitchum play in this classic western. Mitchum plays a sheriff who is gutsy but has fallen for a woman who hs past through and she breaks his heart to where he starts to drink. Wayne plays his friend who is a hired gun. wayne is hired to kill a rancher over some land and water and to kill a sheriff who is in the way. wayne finds out that the sheriff that is the hit is his old friend. the rancher who wayne desides against killing because it would be in cold blood has a daughter who shot wayne. wayne comes to help his friend and pay back a dept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"oater\\" from Howard Hawks","review":"I enjoy most John Wayne movies and this is no exception. Although not as good as \\"Red River\\" this movie is worth 2 bits to see it. A story similar to \\"Rio Bravo\\" John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are good together. And I believe James Caan is better than Ricky Nelson although not as good a singer. Grab a box of popcorn and a soda, settle in for a return to yesteryear, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Dorado, truly a golden fortune","review":"This is probably my all time favorite John Wayne movie. It has it all Action, drama, comedy and even a little romance. It is not just your standard shoot-em-up, but a great study of characters. Great performances all around. A very young James Caan is a green but able kid. Christopher George is the supremely confident gunman hired by the evil landgrabber, Ed Asner. Robert Mitchum is the drunken sheriff who must sober up for the fight of his life. Of course, John Wayne as the hero who must save the day even though he suffers with a handicap of his own. Great support from recognizable actors Paul Fix, Arthur Hunnicut, R. G. Armstrong,and Jim Davis. While there is plenty of action in this movie, appreciate the interplay between the characters.

The third version was \\"Rio Lobo.\\" When Hawks brought up the script Wayne he asked if he got to play the drunk in this one. Nope. Here he is the gunfighter.

The vehicle of DVD is ideal for the purposes I bought this particular movie.

Aside from what the \\"actors\\" were paid, this movie looked like it had a $10k budget. Rent a run down desert truck stop, blow up a few cars, add some cheesy CG and there ya go. The story was weak and very loosely knit together (if at all). Worst movie of the year? You bet! The best part was when I was able to return it to the video store.As for the religious aspect of it, someone should have read a Bible before production.WWJD? He'd give it two thumbs down if he could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty awesome!","review":"This movie is a great one with awesome special fx! This is a must see if you are big into a lot of movies you will definitely enjoy this one, if you are interested in a look at the end of days this one seems to look pretty accurate.. Anyways love it and is a good watch :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"The premise of the film has potential, and there are good actors involved, but the writer and director do nothing with their raw materials. Using a hodgepodge of visual ideas from earlier and better films (Night of the Living Dead, Jacob's Ladder, Tremors, etc.), they render a perfectly predictable and ordinary horror film. There is far too much time spent on quiet moments for the characters to talk about themselves; that would be fine if the conversations or character development were actually interesting or developed, but it slows the movie's pacing down drastically, without giving us any real insight or emotional involvement. There is nowhere a shred of originality, conviction, or humor, and the actors are wasted for the most part, though Paul Bettany manages to find some depth in his character. It's not a bad film; it's just not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark tale but good!","review":"Legion was a little dark but certainly a good story for those of us who like horror and sci-fi. If you are sensative about religion or the depiction of angels I don't recommend this movie. It was a lot of fun for me though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Plot Development, Please","review":"Legion is an apocalyptic horror/action movie that centers around the birth of a child and the legions of angels sent by God trying to kill it. The movie begins with the archangel, Michael, leaving God's army and traveling to protect the unborn child at a diner/ gas station in the desert.This movie has decent special effects, casting, and cinematography, but lacks substance. The focus seems to have been on visual stimulation and not a well detailed plot. All of the bits and pieces are there, but the story was not developed enough to give this movie real substance. It is a wax apple compared to a real apple, it looks good and nice to eat, but it doesn't have a real matter to it.I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie; you'll end up not hating it, but not caring about it either. Oh, the movie was really predictable too. I don't like watching movies when I think I could have written it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a terrible waste of time and money.The movie has no plot, no charm, no magic.The so called \\"angels\\" look downright pathetic.I think this movie is just silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"FALLEN ANGELS","review":"LEGION is one of those movies you should probably hate, but I found myself liking it anyway. Paul Bettany plays a heaven-weary archangel Michael who disobeys God's orders to wipeout mankind.

So WHAT HAPPENED???I'll tell you what happened, one of the most convulted, unintelligent and downright ridiculous storylines I've ever had to sit through happened. Paradise Falls, indeed! I guess the writer, or writers couldn't come up with anything original so they went for the old zombie army cliche, threw in a kind-of virgin birth/savior motiff and some high powered weaponry to blow off large chunks of zombie parts. Ahh..., so much for a spectacular Apocalyse.Pass on this one by all means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible, ridiculous and very strange","review":"The entire premise of the film is centered around an angel who decides that God's decision to destroy all humans via demon possessed humans is immoral and risks his life in order to save the mother and her unborn son (who incidentally enough, has powers to save the human race).Once you suspend your disbelief at the ridiculousness of God being so inefficient and messy by using flesh eating demons to kill us off instead of putting on a nice natural disaster, you begin to realize how cliche the characters are, how cheesy the special effects are and how stupid the rest of the plot is.The only cool part of the film was the granny demon. I'll never look at elderly people in the same way again :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"I rented it for $1 plus tax from red box and still feel totally ripped off. It is the worst kind of bad movies, being complete nonsense yet wanting to be taken seriously. So you can't even get a good laugh or chuckle out of it.

Definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels with Fake Wings","review":"Terminator ripoff.Cheap CGI and sporadic storyline - just jumped around too much to make a lot of sense. Bad guy jumping on moving car roof with knife is so old and when your angels have really bad, fake wings - that's not a good sign from God.

Normally, these are empty review words used to describe a bad movie. The movie is definitely stylish; there are good actors in it; and there are some good scenes, but the lame plot and plot twists simply cripples the movie. If you can get around a plot with more holes in it than .... If you can ignore the childish ploys (i.e. Don't open that door!!)... then you might like it. That's a lot of ifs to put up with.If this style and subject of movies suits you, then be sure to see The Prophecy with Christopher Walken. That movie covers the same ground with fallen angels and stylish mayhem and gore but it also explains what is going on and within the scope of the movie, it is reasonably consistent. It's also a lot of fun and Walken steals the scenes as one bad ass angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Ehhh...","review":"....OK For The 6th.

Why did angels need to posses people when Micheal and Gabriel were clearly corporeal in the movie? Since when does God ever change His mind? What did the baby have to do with anything? They were all after the baby, yet Michael said that God was exterminating the human race. He said the baby was the last hope, yet the baby played really no part at all in the end-game. This movie didn't seam like a good what-if plot at all because it wasn't well thought out or even well written.

Veggie Tales has angels with SMG's right?So when I saw it had 2 stars I'm like \\"i get it... it sucks... thank you world for helping me avoid another movie let down. (No thanks you Tron Legacy...

It's shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A is for Abomination: B is for Bad: C is for Cheap:.","review":"This film is nothing more than another \\"zombie kill film\\". The writers thought that they would be clever and could squeeze some uniqueness by poaching off the Bible. Although the names are taken from the Bible, everything else seems to be coming from the pit of hell.The cast appears to be quite impressive, and the acting is good. But there is only so much that can be done with a bad script. The plot centers on this pregnant girl whose child must be killed, and why, nobody knows. They just needed something to attact the zombies I guess.To add insult to injury, the 'angels' need to use our carnal weapons, and are quite wimpy. There are some mediocre sound and special effects, but nothing to get overly excited about. In conclusion when watching this movie you feel that you are eating left overs from last month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining - people looking for academy award material need not bother","review":"After reading mixed reviews, I was hesitant to rent this film. After watching it, I feel I was completely mislead. This movie was very entertaining. Was it realistic? No. Was the acting the best ever? No. However, it was an entertaining story with entertaining characters and interesting effects.

The battle will be intense, not everyone will survive.This movie is pretty fun to watch. It lacks a little in the drama department, but makes up for it with some pretty major action and suspense. The acting isn't bad either. There are better movies out there for sure, but this one is definitely entertaining and worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have kept the 'CAMP' pedal to the metal","review":"I don't know if the directors were shooting for cornball campiness to any degree, but there are scenes so goofy , they hint at a sort of over the top campy silliness ala Lake Placid, but not NEARLY as spectacularly brilliant as that movie was. Too bad, the weak story just does not have much gravitas. The ending is a letdown and rather boring. It moves along at awkward pace, and the trailer is more exciting than the whole flick by far. They never explained WHY a pregnant girl in the boondocks, USA is carrying the savior of humanity either LOL.

Even the few good actors involved: Dennis Quaid, Charles Dutton and Tyrese Gibson couldn't help it along. And, I wonder how they got hooked into participating.

Throughout those minutes I was hoping at some point it would turn around; to my dismay it didn't. I'm only glad I didn't purchase.Don't purchase... rent first if you have time to waste!!

I wanted to like this film, angels, great effects, violence and only a thread of a plot, normally I do like movies that are heavy on the action even if they only have the bare wish of a plot. This one? I kept feeling like I'd seen this story before, it had wings and angels instead of cyborg assassins from a distant future. God instead of a computer program trying to stop the resistance from happening, but at the end, it was Terminator with wings. And not done nearly as well. With the mythology to draw on, with the possible conflict available, it failed to live up to it's effects.The effects were good, but instead of being as creepy as it could have been, it was just gross in parts. The caricatured charactures kept it from ever becoming the scary look at a possible apocalypse it could have been.

But the movie fizzled at the end. It wrapped up quickly and too neatly while also suggesting a sequel (which I assume has a snowball's chance in hell of getting made).Legion didn't have a big enough pay off to make me ignore the myriad questions I was left with.

What I could see of the movie (it's one of those annoying one's where everything is filmed in the dark) didn't make a whole lot of sence. You had great actors playing really good parts in this movie (why did they even take these parts for?) no awards here that's for sure. And since when do Angels need guns?!

I am very satisfied with this collection. All I was looking for was a few episodes on hope since my dear friend sure needs to feel hope herself. I haven't seen this DVD myself so I don't know which episodes are on it. I just hope that it will bring a message of hope to my friend. I just wanted to say that it makes the perfect gift. I would recommend it to others looking to give a gift that is full of inspiration. I like the idea they had of putting these DVD's together, inspiration on Faith, Hope, and even one for the holidays. Even though I haven't watched the DVD I know that every episode of TBA is a good one.

It would be fruitless for me to buy them when I have season 1,2,3 and 4 of TBA. I may buy the disc thinking I'm getting new TBA shows and realize there's 3 shows on the disc that i already own. I don't understand why the powers that be won't release the remaining seasons. It is bad enough that the seasons were broken up into volumes so I paid a crazy price for 12 episodes at a time, now they want to sell 4 episodes at a time for crazy prices. What a rip off. I will not be buying individual dics thats for sure. maybe shout factory will buy the rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't jump for joy yet...","review":"With nearly half of the ENTIRE SERIES already available on DVD, you'd think the next logical step would be to release Season 5, right? CBS and Paramount has apparently dropped this idea, and will only be releasing \\"collections\\" of the episodes that are considered the \\"best\\". There are only 4 episodes on this set, 1 of which has been released on DVD already.I know I should be happy but I'm not. I assume this is for financial reasons (not like CBS and Paramount combined are hurting) and this is better than nothing but it is a lame attempt to appease the fans when nearly half of the series on DVD has been released already. Nearly every tv show known to man is being released on DVD, and they pull a stunt like this? I would say this release should not be supported, but I fear if it's not they will never release seasons of TBAA on DVD again. This is truly a disappointment, and that's an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, but no thanks.","review":"I like this show and had bought Season Releases; however, I wouldn't buy this since it might have some of the episodes in the collection I already have and I won't pay twice.

It is one of the very few in my collection that I listen to repeatedly and still find interesting, insightful, and engaging. This recording is the only one I have found that has effectively reinterpreted his music in a new AND memorable way. While artfully paying honor to the beauty and playfulness of the melodic and chrodal tonalities that Hoady originally selected, Cory created a new and improved interpretation that is so good I now use it at the standard against which I compare all other Hoagy performances. The often subtle changes she makes in her stylings usually leave me wondering, \\"Why didn't Hoagy think of that?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's to Cory and Hoagy!","review":"Hmm. Doesn't appear to be much middle ground in the reviews here. I go along with those who really like this recording.Every artist brings their personal qualities to their work. A singer brings their talents to the task of making notes on paper come alive and reach out and touch the listener. Cory Jamison's clarity of voice and flashes of personality come through in her fresh presentation of Hoagy's great songs. The musicians do a marvelous job of playing the music. Music and voice compliment each other in this recording.Altogether, a very welcome addition to recordings of Hoagy's wonderful songs. So, here's to Cory and Hoagy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I expected a lot from this CD, but it was a let down. I agree with the review that said that the packaging was great but the contents of the CD didnt measure up. The sound quality of the CD is awful, I was constantly having to change the volume control of my stereo. The singer is nothing exciting...she does a decent job but nothing that would set her apart from a million others. I didnt care for most of the songs, although I Get Along Without You Very Well and Baltimore Oriole are definitely the best - vocal and production wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special/Dont waste your money","review":"This CD was reccommended by a friend, so my expectations were rather high. What a disappointment. Miss Jamison is so typical of today's crop of singers - they try to sell on their looks.It's not that she is awful...but she is nothing special or posseses no distinctive vocal quality or style that would set her apart from other singers. The reviewer that called this a masterpiece must be a friend. This is nothing near a masterpiece...want to hear a masterpiece go buy a CD by Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughn or Carmen McCrae. Those are great singers that have great arrangements to back them up. This CD doesn't come anywhere close except as an amatuer high school production. It's a wannabe but it can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the same as a cheap furnace filter.","review":"I was disappointed to pay so much for a cheap furnace filter.

The editing was self-indulgent and slow and there were several scenes that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. It is an uncomfortable movie with little warmth and an overdose of angst. The quirks that they tried to work in for the characters to make them human were very contrived and made me conscious I was watching a movie rather than allowing me to get involved in the story and characters as people.

To be honest I was not all that impressed. I am a middle school math teacher and have seen all of the \\"tricks\\" to solving problems. The problem is that the book doesn't give the reader a strong foundation of number sense as to why these \\"tricks\\" work. I felt like I was just reading a Cliff's Notes book to math. I truly was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanspirited, magical rather than mathematical","review":"This is a mean spirted book that is the opposite of mathematics.The general tone and demeanor of the main character is just mean and spiteful. In addition, his attitude is not mathematical at allThe devil says things like,\\"It always works!\\" but never suggests or indicates or seems to care why! OR \\"I could prove it to you but you'd go mad in the process.\\" This reinforces stupid stereotypes about math.If you already know what he is mumbling about, you may be able to follow the rather uninteresting way he presents information (ideas that can be fascinating when presented correctly- but not here). But if you do not already know about the concepts, don't expect to understand, appreciate or learn them here. What isn't incomplete or incorrect is often misleading. Do not waste any time with this book. If I could I would give it -9 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Unfortunately, my daughter says this is a yawn.

It was a good book. I like that it was about adventure and math and a story and you could do activities from the book. I liked the triangle numbers, the prima-donna numbers, Bonacci. I especially liked going to number hell and meeting all the number devils, and seeing the imaginative guy and the funny drinking glasses. I liked that Pascal's triangle had so many interesting things you could do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prima Donna Numbers??","review":"In the Number Devil Hans Magnus Enzensberger (author) creates a mathematical adventure in a fun way. He names prime numbers prima donna number and shows cool tricks using numbers. In the Number Devil a boy named Robert has dreams each night of the Number Devil. The Number Devil comes into his dreams and teaches him new things about math each night. I myself learned things about math that I didn't know before. If you're looking for a fun mathematical adventure nothing beats this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Even for Undergrads!","review":"A math professor I know actually uses this book to teach a college level class and a class for advanced high school students. The book, though not a great literary piece, does introduce many different concepts from many areas of undergraduate mathematics. One potential problem with the book is that although the Number Devil mentions any facts, he never proves any of them. This presents a great oppurtunity for students as then they can prove some of the Devil's statements, like his formula for Triangle Numbers. Be warned, though, some questions that the Number Devil asks are actually still open questions in mathematics, and not even your teacher will know the answer or proof! Overall, though not a good stand-alone book, it's a great companion to a regular class that tries to introduce the students to non-calculus mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used to be very bad at bad before I read this book!","review":"I was sitting in the school library while my teacher was reading another book.I was daydreaming and then spotted The Number Devil book.The title seemed interesting so I checked it out.

If you like books where the character is in reality than this is the wrong book for you. But if you like fantasy, check it out. It takes place mostly in the main character's dreams. The main character's name is Robert. He hates math like many kids probably do. But Robert learns to enjoy it with the help of a devil called the Number Devil. He visits Robert's dreams and shows him about all sorts of ways to discover easy tricks to do math. This is a very well-written book it explains how to have fun while doing math.Review written by a 9 year old- approved by a Mom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamed-up stories are excellent, but make-believe words are not","review":"Robert is a 12-year-old who dislikes his maths teacher, Mr. Bockel and - by association - maths.However, his dislike of maths begins to wane when he receives nightly visitations from the Number Devil in his dreams. In each dream, the Number Devil presents imaginative maths lessons in surreal settings.I really like how the author has made maths digestible by serving bite-sized lessons in each short dream-chapter, and the use of vividly coloured drawings to illustrate the lessons make them all the more palatable.My one grievance is the use of make-believe words and names to describe real-life equivalents e.g. 'Fibonacci' is referred to as 'Bonacci', 'irrational numbers' as 'unreasonable numbers'. The author had probably attempted to add humour by doing so, but I thought it was unnecessary as the story is already very, very good. In fact, I found it tedious to re-explain the story to my child using their real terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"All About Beer Magazine-July","review":"Over-all superior beer magazine. 20 years!

The only reason I would not rate it a 5-star is because when it comes to heels, you cannot be in a rush (which is usually the total opposite of my case) because you have to know how to take pull them out in a careful manner, so that the other heels don't fall off.For flats or men's shoes, however, it works more than amazing!

The only issue is that its flimsy feeling. I was however able to load 16 shoes and then pick up the entire rack to move without it coming apart. The shelves are space tightly vertically, so items like boots will only really fit well on the top row. This item is just okay, nothing to be happy about and nothing to be upset about.

If you really want to work on your attitude you should just listen to Earl Nightengal or Zig Ziglar. For sales coaching this can't touch anything Jeffrey Gitomer puts out and Gitomer goes much deeper into tips and tactics.Joe Girard bills himself as the worlds greatest salesman and he is in the Guiness Book. His record for CAR sales is still untouched, but I doubt this record stands up to any criteria broader than that.

If you are planning to write a research report on Japanese life in internment camps, it might be helpful, but otherwise I recommend you do not read it.

At least you got that luxury, staying in the camp w/o working and being treated not that bad because you were in the U.S. If Japan got bombed by other countries during the WWII, I don't think they would have treated foreigners in their territory like that. They would have killed them brutely or revenged on them cruelly. Japan was incredibly crazy during the WWII. Most Asian countries suffered severly by Japan during that period. Through this book, I have realized America's generosity one more time as a naturalized citizen from Asia.

She had lived a life of \\"fair treatment\\" in her Ocean Park neighborhood, a life of heartache and confusion in Manzanar, and later, a life of stereotype and discrimination when she and her family left the internment camp. Although she experienced moments of not wanting to be Japanese, she grew up appreciating and understanding the circumstances in her life.

After I read this book I really began to appreciate my life.When the Japanese-Americans were thrown into the camps, it just shows how bad they were treated.

It was a very difficult time for the Japanese people and I know that they were relieved to get out of the camp.

One moment you want to cry for someone's misfortunes and the next moment want to beat them up for their bad judgement. I sure felt that way for the dad.On the other hand, the book sometimes is supersaturated, or expands on moments more than it should. Sometimes I just want the author to move on to a new subject.

He had no more hope, he still had pride, but he lost the strength to fight on and persevere. Jeanne, is a person who's life began there.

When she finally found some here to stay the other kids at her school didnt think that she could do the things that she did.The intresting part to me was when the book said that they couldnt communicate and they didnt have a kitchen or a kitchen table, but the weir d thing was that was the most important to them.7.2 K.W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell to Manzanar","review":"I think that this book is great.

The internment camp pulls her family apart, and the rages of her father don't seem to help the wounds that her family has suffered. Everything turns upside down as her father turns into an alcoholic, and America drops the bomb. Her dad won't let her do anything she wants, and least not now. Between the crazy bathrooms and the rush of the mess halls, Jeanne and her large family can't wait to say farewell to Manzanar.This is an amazing true story, and the details of the story paint pictures of Manzanar in your mind. It's very informative, and will hook you in, but might lose its grip on occasion. I was tempted to skip a paragraph every once in a while, and the book really slowed down at parts. I think that this book is only okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting....","review":"The Manzanar book was kind of slow for my taste. This book is about a young girl whose family is sent to an internment camp because they are Japanese. I could see the point of writing this book and I respect that but it didn't have what it takes to keep me interested. There were some good parts that I liked but there were very few. I liked the part when Jeanne went to the cemetery and how the author really described the whole scene, the wind blowing, the kids not being old enough to respect it, the sentimentality of it, etc. That was the coolest part of the book to me. I think the author should have focused more on Jeanne's life after she got out of camp.

He started swearing that he would kill mama. The Japanese should never have been sent to the camps.

She gave a true sense of what it was like for the people at Manzanar, and made me feel really bad. The U.S was wrong for putting innocent people into the camps, and unfortunately Jeanne and her family were some of those people.

She explains everything with good elaboration and some humor, which makes it an enjoyable and educational book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"farewell to manzanar","review":"I though the book was intresting and ended w/ a bang.

Someone would have to have so much courage to do that and, then to have to go throuhg it again?This book made me realize how badly Japaneese were treated when Parol Harbor was going on and how they were discriminated aginst juts because they were different. They were loked up in a camp just because the people that attacked , were like them they were thought to be bad people to . They couldn't do anything about it.

W. II. The American government was at war with the Japanese government. It is a very powerful book because it gives you a real impression of what it was like in concentration camps. It is written in the first person style as though the child is talking. It tells about horrible living conditions and lack of experienced caretakers. I think this is an important historical account of the terrible things that happened in history. It shows that internment profoundly affected the Japanese people.

My girlfriend picked the movie and enticed me into watching it. I can't say what drew me to it, but it's been a favorite of mine ever since.For those who believe that there is one true love out there who you are fated to meet, this movie is for you. Timothy Hutten and Kelly McGillis are two souls who meet in heaven. When Kelly McGillis is incarnated (not reincarnated, as she was born in heaven), Timothy Hutton pleads to be reincarnated in an attempt to reunite with his soulmate. The primary story is that of these two souls unconsciously searching for each other.As another review mentioned, the plot does drag at times, but all-in-all it is a wonderful, heartwarming story.

The use of interviews with Nancy, clips from the 1981 NBC News documentary on his presidency and the episode from the GE Theatre provide emotional and historical context to his accomplishments and achievements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read wikipedia","review":"This documentary provides absolutely no information that can't be found on Wikipedia. You have interviews with seemingly random people (or random Apple fans) who speaks opinion and speculation. Most of the footage can be found on YouTube. I could've easily done a better documentary than this. If you want a better documentary, watch \\"One Last Thing\\". That one will go through Steve Jobs life but also through the eyes of his former colleagues and friends. You'll get a better picture of who Steve Jobs was including his faults (he is known to be a tyrant among his co-workers for example). The film (\\"One Last Thing\\") won't tell you everything but at least it gives you a better idea than this crappy movie (\\"Visionary Genius\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst documentary I've ever seen","review":"I may have just watched a high school project. Terrible editing, terrible interviews, and barely researched \\"information\\" all narrated by a British actor who sounded nearly asleep by the end of it. A bad tabloid style exploitation piece based on nothing more than narrating the Wikipedia page for Steve Jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to watch - poorly told story","review":"The documentary relies on many clips from interviews with people for whom there is only a vague reference to why they should be given any credence at all - perhaps the director found them off the street. For example, one woman whose interview is extensively used is just named on screen as Hilda Baker with no explanation of her role in Steve Jobs life or why she would have any insight. The film utilizes extensive stock clips to support their story, but are so sloppy as to frequently use anachronous ones for example an iphone when chronilogically they are only at the stage of the first ipod. It seems to me that 1/2 of the movie is made up of video clips that add no value to the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time...","review":"I actually became angry while watching this documentary. Not because the information is totally wrong or that it isn't a little bit entertaining, but because of the terrible quality of the film. As a previous review mentioned, this looks like a high school project that deserved a \\"C\\". The information isn't quite in order which can be a little confusing. There are interviews with random people who really have no business speaking on Steve Jobs life. On top of that the interviews are seemingly placed in random points of the film. At one point the narrator began speaking on Jobs' break from Next to spend time with his family in the 1990s and then the film jumped to an interview with a woman on the street who was speaking about the iPad. This happens on multiple occasions in the film. That on top of the annoying grey border and the use of Moves Like Jagger, some Adele song, and Viva La Vida as background music, makes me wish I had never hit play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the WORST documentary I've ever seen.","review":"The production value on this documentary is so bad, I'm honestly embarrassed for the people who made the film. It honestly feels like a 6th grader would have made a better film.However, production value aside, the most embarrassing part of the film is the fact that the writers clearly didn't actually know what they were talking about. There is nothing new or interesting about Jobs in this film -- it feels like they just read his Wikipedia page. In fact, their lack of understanding of the subject matter is pretty apparent when they illustrate that they don't know how to say the name of the Mac OSX operating system. They fundamentally misunderstand simple technology and say things that just aren't true -- like when they state that the iPhone runs on OSX.If I were the filmmakers, I'd pull this film. It's that bad. It's that embarrassing for them. Worst of all, everyone knows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED TITLE NAME","review":"I NEED TO FIND STANDING ON HOLY GROUND.

Much of the narrative spits out facts that everyone already knows. Most of the rest is decoration, trite commentary and superficial philosophizing. The piece on Bill Gates is typical. It was delivered in a contemptuous tone, skipped the exciting history of Microsoft, and even dismissed \\"The Road Ahead\\" as trivial! Similarly, Iacocca's piece on Henry Ford does not even mention Ford's infamous bigotry. In fairness, I must say that I did learn a bit about the lesser known people, and enjoyed the imaginative piece on Gandhi.

What Spurgeon and Mr. Murray are actually attacking is consistent, biblical calvinism.The kind of theology being presented by Spurgeon and Murray is sometimes known as 'hypo-calvinism' (see trinityfoundation.org), where G-d is seen as electing only some people to salvation (true), but at the same time honestly desiring the salvation of every single individual in the world (false - see Proverbs 16:4, 1 Peter 2:8), and where His grace is divided into a higher kind (shown to the elect) and another lesser kind (shown to everyone else).Without getting into the arguments for or against the theolgy, I wouldn't reccomend this book because if you haven't looked at the issues of supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism and a host of other complicated issues, this book will most likely prejudice you against the true gospel and true biblical calvinism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spurgeon had it absolutely right.","review":"This book should be required reading for all who would claim the title \\"calvinist.\\" Murray shows Spurgeon's courage to stand and proclaim the message of the Scriptures without rationalizing them. It is clearly shown in this excellent book that both Arminianism and Hyper-Calvinism spring from the same rationalistic error.One of the negative reviews of this book on this page suggests that one must understand supralapsarianism, infralapsarianism, and a host of other complicated issues in order to understand the \\"true\\" gospel.

Nevertheless, I do not consider it a balanced perspective of this still controversial research area and I would not use it for any of the classes I teach. At some point in the future we will look back on this period of scholarship in anthropology and wonder why we struggled so hard to come up with popular answers when other conclusions were equally indicated. Solid social science steps outside the constraints of cultural popularity/political correctness at any given era. Yet, it is understandable that many of these papers do not. Alternative explanations do not easily find publication and are often derided by one's peers.

(That's a subject unto itself!) The primary characteristic of this recording (by the way, an excellent technical job) is the prominent addition of Larry Carlton, the proverbially \\"legendary\\" guitarist, replacing Lee Ritenour. (Hey, Lee, more \\"Wes Bound,\\" please!) Carlton's imprint is everywhere in this recording, and it's both fascinating and successful. Carlton's positive reputation is well known and well deserved. The cut \\"Blues Force\\" seems most memorable in my mind. Two vocal cuts are far less successful. I find it odd how frequently vocal pieces (often directed toward radio-play) fall flat on otherwise excellent contemporary jazz recordings. Much of this CD is mesmerizing, geat to listen to in the car, and Carlton is a welcome addition to Bob James and the crew. Bob is a phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"When Larry Carlton replaced Lee Ritenour, I was excited about the potential of this band to add some excitement to the \\"smooth jazz\\" scene.

This is hardly \\"rambunctious\\" as suggested in the Amazon.com review. It really isn't even good background music. BORING! The only track worth a listen is Blues Force. After that it is just annoying. This group is just coasting and I feel they will never achieve their potential after listening to this CD.

The materials and construction are pretty good. Just be aware it's not a thick winter coat so if you plan to take the dog camping in the freezing mountains, you might want something else. My dog is barrel-chested but not overweight and the XL fits her just fine--if your dog is actually fat (even a little bit) try the next size up. The two straps could use to be an inch longer each and the velcro closures aren't exactly hard to open and may need to be replaced with sturdier ones before the winter's out, but I still think it's a good coat for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute and the keep them warm!!!","review":"These jackets work great!

I bought him a coat from another source size Large and it was way too small(reaches from his neck to the middle of his back). SO, I bought this one in an Extra Extra Large, thinking that coats run small, and it's way too big. The neck-to-tail length in the size chart matches him but the coat hangs out over his tail (which he finds really annoying), and the strap wraps around his belly and all the way to his back bone. I like the coat, but now have to figure out how to adjust it to his size. I think the fit is wrong because I didn't allow that he IS long but also has short-hair and is very lanky. Thus he's not furry enough to fill out the coat. People who order this coat should keep this in mind in selecting the size. This design factors in a full fur coat, so if you have a short-haired dog, you might not need as big a size as you'd think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely made but online sizing info wasn't correct","review":"A nicely made doggy jacket (red velvetine exterior with pocket, reflector stripes, and gray fleece lining). After some tailoring (shortened torso length and belly strap), it kept my geriatric dog (approx 55 lbs, german shepard x) comfortable on chilly mornings.The jacket had to be tailored to fit him because the sizing info provided didn't adequately (or accurately?) describe it's size. I was concerned about purchasing an XXL for a 55 lb dog. But the nape-of-neck to base-of-tail distance (24-30 inches) was ok and having no experience with dog clothing, I decided to err on the side of getting something too large. Whatever.

The \\"soft side\\" half of the Velcro has practically no \\"fuzz\\" on it. As a consequence, the coat falls off a moving dog because it doesn't stay \\"stuck\\" and easily detaches. The coat then slowly inches down the leash trailing behind the dog, who then becomes a bit freaked, thinking it is chasing him. Actually, it was kind of funny, except due to the temperature being so low, putting it back on was impossible with gloves on. The coat could use an additional fastener, like buttons, which wouldn't allow it to come off so easily. On a dog that isn't moving, it looks fantastic.

For people who are new to her I would suggest starting with Mortal City or End of Summer and then buying this CD. As always, her lyrics are amazing. She has an uncanny way of writing exactly what I'm feeling. This is also nothing new to her, but her voice conveys such an amazing amount of emotion that even if you don't understand the full depth of the lyrics at first you will know what she's feeling. If you're not a fan of Folk, don't let her category scare you off. I know people with very varied musical tastes who all like Dar Williams. In a nutshell; I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dar Williams Sings With Polish","review":"If you were expecting another musicial outing like Williams' 'Mortal City', then you may be disappointed at first listen. However, spin this disc again and you will began to appricate the more intricate lyrics and studio production than previous Williams' \\"outings.\\" I would not call this CD a \\"folk album\\", like 'Mortal City' is. However, \\"Another Mystery\\" and \\"After all\\" are my favorite tracks and they are great because Williams is such a good song-smith. A must have for die-hard Dar fans and for people who like good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"You know, I am a HUGE Dar Williams fan. And I continue to be, barely. This CD seems to be such an effort at getting the mighty buck; it sounds just like all the other folk-rock-pop artists out there without the ability to differentiate. This CD is such an absolute departure that it actually saddens me, it pains me to know that an artist who I care about, one with so mucy to say, would sell out and be like all the rest. It makes me gag.I wish there's a way to tell her and her manger/producer that this is a failure of self. I think she's been duped into thinking this will help her career. Perhaps it will, because the masses to which she never attracted, will buy this one just like anything else that has a certain overly-produced sound.I'll pray she finds better counsel. But the bucks are probably too atractive.My only saving grace is that the words (and the words only) are sometimes still spiritually alive and honest. But, that's only half of the art of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad...","review":"Boy, I really disliked \\"End of Summer\\" - Dar's previous album, and I was prepared for another 45 minutes of whining about big business, environmentalism, all set to the drubbing sounds of electronically farmed beats. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that was not the case at all. Dar's days of singing poignant folk songs about love and human relations seem to be gone (Richard Shindell is picking up her slack though), but she is now writing really good pop songs. Her lyrics are not as structured and cohesive as they were on her first two albums, but I really don't mind. I liked \\"The Green World\\" from my first listen, and it keeps getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Twist on the Original Dar","review":"Dar tries a new sound (slipping back to her acoustic/folk roots only for \\"Another Mystery\\") and it pays off! Her best album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Growth Spurt","review":"Each of Dar's albums shows huge growth past the one before it (how many artists can you say that about anymore?) and I was wondering which way she'd go after End Of The Summer. the green world surprized me, in that she took that wonderful self-knowing but insulated quality of hers and somehow made it global without collapsing. \\"After All,\\" \\"Spring Street,\\" and \\"It Happens Every Day\\" are so fresh and strike with such precision; it just leaves you breathless ... and impatient to know how much deeper this incredible artist can plunge into the mysteries. Her awareness of the world around us becomes more astounding with each new project. Lots of artists promise; Dar delivers. That's true of all her albums, and anyone curious about her can start here or with any of them. They don't grow old, only better ... and more particular to your own life's turn of events. Bless you, Dar, you're one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very intelligent album that grows better with age","review":"I'm not a diehard folk fan. My favorite band is Rush. So I'm not bothered by some of the heavier production on this album, I think \\"Calling the Moon\\" should have been left off the album entirely, and for a while I had \\"Spring Street\\" set on single track repeat in my car.One of the things I've always loved about Dar's work is that she plays games with words that ultimately serve the point of the song. She doesn't play them up or base an entire song around a pun, she just comes up with quirky phrases that draw you in to the emotion of a song. After my third listen to the album I was conviced that Dar could entirely bring the house down if she appeared on VH-1s \\"Storytellers\\".It's definitely NOT another \\"Mortal City\\", but the same spirit is there, and if you work past your hypothetical distaste for a pop sensibility in the songs, you'll be very entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere between Mortal City and End of the Summer...","review":"is where I would place The Green World. It had a lot of the same pop arragements of the latter album while retaining more of the folky feel of the first. Aside from a couple of songs that I really dislike (\\"Calling the Moon\\" and \\"We Learned the Sea\\"), the album has gotten better each time I've listented to it. \\"After All\\" and \\"It Happens Every Day\\" are probably two of Dar's most stark and honest songs, and have become two of my favorites. And, \\"I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono\\" and \\"Another Mystery\\" are great, uplifting and fun tracks on an album that is not as light-hearted as her others. While it may not be as good as my favorite album, Mortal City, it is still great music, and I'm glad to see that Dar is beginning to get the public recognition she deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or leave it, really...","review":"Eh. That's about all. Eh. I've been a die-hard Dar fan since I heard her in concert for the first time, a private show at Bryn Mawr College's May Day festivities. But I think I missed something here. I found the production to be very heavy-handed when compared to older Dar, a little more mainstream -- stuff you might hear on the radio in between Celine Dion and Alanis Morrisette. Which is mostly a matter of personal preference. I felt like Dar's voice could have been showcased better, and has always been showcased better with the guitar and a background instrument or two; it seemed to be lost among the support this time around and I felt that her unique voice lost all its power because of this. On the upside, the songwriting was superb and thoughtful. It's listenable, but not superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arab Mediterranean 1900","review":"(From another review): Contents include: Madeira and the Azores; Gibraltar and Tangier; Granada and the Alhambra; Algiers and Malta; Constantinople Old and New; Under the new Constitution(Turkey); Cross and Crescent in Conflict(Islam vs Armenians); Smyrna and Ephesus; Beirut, Damascus and Baalbec; Higher Education in Turkey; Egypt and the Nile and much more. 256 pages with photographs & map."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Struggles and Joys of Urban Ministry","review":"This is an inspiring, wise, and often humorous account by the wife of a pastor of the founding and growth of an inner-city multi-racial congregation over a 25 year period.

The book is also sure to be a favorite of those who like Jan Karon's Mitford series. Of course, the characters in this book are real not fictional, but they just as endearing as those in the Mitford series and the portrait of the rewards and challenges of ministry, relationships, and family is similar even though inner-city Baltimore is so different than Mitford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohio","review":"This item (DVD)is defective, there is no audio (Duel of the 7 Tigers).

After reading other reviews, thought this system could pass for that, but it is horrible. there is a noticeable delay when the receiver finally picks up the signal from the mics, and the sound is horrible. Sounds muted, and often gives off a strong short annoying sound burst when speaking into the mic with words that starts with certain letters like \\"p.\\" Your lips have to be super close to the mics to even pick up your voice, you basically have to be kissing your mic while singing to pick up your voice, & then the sound that comes out isn't even very good anyway. Want to return it but got busy & didn't get to try it out until a little bit pass the 30 day return policy. My fault for just assuming it would be at least acceptable but it's not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR..","review":"Overall, product quality is relative to price: see title of this review.The mics feel cheap and light, almost like a cheap chinese remote control toy you expect to break in a couple of weeks. Seeing past aesthetics though, the mics have a terrible pick-up. your mouth needs to be literally 1\\" - 1 1/2\\" from the receiver to achieve a descent pick up. I understand that this is no SHURE mic system but.. (sigh). The receiver, though not unpleasant to look at, emits an unpleasant and repeated low feedback sound. Thinking it may be a bad cable, we've tried using new cables with the receiver, but the problem persists.On the upside of things, we've learned to adjust the mixer to decrease the disruptive feedback from the receiver, but there's still something there. Will most likely return the mics and spend a few more bucks on a more dependable system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"From the day it arrived, this system did NOT work.

And they work very well in unison (all 4). They perform very well indeed and the battery life seems to be more than adequate. The only gripe I have, as mentioned by other reviewers is that the covers seem to just flip off the battery compartments. The batteries don't fall out, but the covers are part of the mike that you grip, so it feels kind of weird. They have been dropped, drooled on, and otherwise destroyed by mishandling, but they appear to be made of the things that energizer bunnies are made of. Very good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"Got this in the mail, plugged it in for a home karaoke player (hooked up laptop to mixer, hooked up system to mixer, out speakers).

The explanations for the source code consist of \\"Paste in this code and everything will work fine\\" which is a far cry from explaining what is happening in the code block. You can tell that this book is the combined result of many different authors with no major flow between the chapters.

The keyboard itself is definitely nothing special, its a simple controller with that one function in mind. For the price, I couldn't ask for more, that's what my s80 is for. I like this because it is light and easy to transport. My s80 weighs probably well over 60-70 lbs - not an easy transport. But the heck with midi, the easy USB input is great.

This album includes seven great tracks from one of the founders of the Nigerian pop scene, recorded between 1970-1985... It's all top-flight material, warm, gentle and captivating....

The presentation is an analogy to human societies."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good choice for family viewing","review":"While many reviewers here have given the film high praise, many parents or teachers will be unprepared on the basis of those reviews for some of the more sordid elements of the film. Unless you want to explain to your children, for example, why, when the mother pulls back the sheets, she finds her daughter's pants are wet (after an encounter with her boyfriend), this film would not be a good choice for family viewing.The film's premise, to show the impact of the war on everyday life at home, is excellent, but some viewers will not be able to stomach the coarse elements that are an integral part of the film.For a thoughtful, and often inspiring, look at British homelife during the war years for junior high and up I recommend the novel Enemy Brothers by British author Constance Savery, a skilled storyteller who lived through the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, not what I remembered","review":"Last time I watched this film was in the theaters (I was probably 11) and I remember seeing it like 3 times I loved it so much. I remembered a great, heartwarming, joyful, funny film. Oh how my memory let me down.What I got was a disjointed movie - really just a bunch of scenes strung together - with too few laughs and too little heart. Sure my Girlfriend says in the last 20 minutes it really improved and you really felt for the characters (I had gone to bed by then). But honestly I spent the first hour of the movie in embarrassment that I had talked it up so much.Oh well, another childhood memory shattered ;)I would never watch it again nor suggest it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was absolutely awful.

So much in fact I was compelled to find it after I had forgoten the title and I proceded to drill my English boss for the title. Eventually after some searching I found the movie and I enjoy it fully. The film is like few others I have seen in my young life and even though the accents are hard to understand the mood of the film carriers you. War movies and biographies have always been a hobby of mine but this movie goes beyond the traditional war film as it dives into the effects on the general population and children. It is a tremendous film with something for everyone (Humor, drama, etc.) and in my belief a film many Americans should view in order to understand something which we have never seen up close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopeful and glorious","review":"I am showing this to a Year 9 History class in Australia.

It recalls the topsy turvey ways of a world where the abnormal conditions of war become commonplace. The men are away at the front and abscenses are not always making the heart grow fonder; the kids lack supervison; and one may be the victim of the next German bombing run. In this world of fear, uncertainty, and confusion, Billy still has the problems of growing up--attaining acceptance of his peers, becomming more independent, learning to throw a proper \\"googlie\\" cricket bowl...and of course the problem of girls. He learns that life in not permanent, that his own mother is not immune from heartache, that life, afterall, can hold wonderful surprises even in the midst of war. There are so many outstanding moments in this film that it would be difficult to list them all...a particular favorite of mine is when Billy's grandfather shoots a garden rat--hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say about a movie","review":"One of my favorate.

A few times a year I will watch the DVD and see new things to appreciate and reexperience. One of the facets of this film is that just when you think something horrible is about to happen, it doesn't. Even the family's home burning leads to something good. Always finding the bright side of life, as they say. I love the German jam scene, and Billy checking out the ladies underwear and the shooting the rat and the school teacher with all the \\"pink bits\\" on the atlas - \\"all ours!\\" Surely the final scene with Bill and Grandpa has to be one of the most uplifting endings in all of filmdom, complete with a rousing sound track! 1987 was a banner year for films and I think this is the best; in my top 5 of any year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this","review":"One of my favorite movies.

But what Sher really does is provide a fascinating personal journey through an erratic minefield of diplomacy and policy, personalities and cultures. \\"Within Reach\\" is extremely well written, and the anecdotes and insights that are peppered throughout provide a deeply personal look at a complex process.

It includes Glass Enclosure which is a song written by Bud in homage to the mental institution he was in. It is a quirky tune with bouncy, energetic bars juxtaposed with serenely slow playing. Also included is Collard Greens and Black-Eyed Peas, a title reminiscent of pure soul food, and this song definitely has soul from the beginning bass solo all the way through Bud's entrance and exit. Parisian Thouroughfare is about as wonderful a song dedicated to Paris that you will ever hear. It has striding solos that make you feel like you are strolling down a back alley of that fair city. Any music fan will surely appreciate the music on this album, and if you read any of the biography's of Bud, you will surely fall in love with the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son was not impressed","review":"My 5 year old son loves monster trucks.

The lovely adagio section which follows the first fuga is omitted along with the da capo of the fuga. The fuga is so masterful that it is worth hearing twice, and that is how Richter composed it!Too bad the archive LP of this lovely symphony along with other sinfonias from composers of the Mannheim School has not be reissued on CD.I will not comment one way or another on the other four sinfonias on this disc since I am not familiar with them.

I knocked this out in about a day. You know, if you look closely, this book is actually made to look and feel longer than it is. For instance, the pages are very thick paper. More so than most books. Plus, the most obvious clue being there are so few words on each page, short chapters, and narrow page lettering layout. Not sure why I felt like pointing this out today.

Parker seems to be going through the motions. The dialogue remains witty and snappy but there is not much else. It appears that Parker was rushing to complete this novel before his death. You can skim read this in an hour or two.The plot revolves around a peeping Tom who is stalking women in Paradise plus sending notes to Police Chief Jesse Stone, saying he is going to take his obsession to the next level.

I enjoyed the persona of the police force, particulaarly Jesse's laid back style and commitment to virtueously serving and protecting. Story line, as discussed by other reviewers was mildly engaging. Ending quite predictable as was most of the story. As an audio book while driving, the \\"he said,\\" \\"she said\\" abysmal dialog was beyond annoying. If not for favorable reviews by ardent fans, I would have put Parker and Jesse in the \\"to be avoided\\" category. They may be worth another try, but with the comments about Jenn I am not sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak storyline but the subplot works well","review":"The late, great Robert B. Parker was one of my favorite writers. His most recent books were hit-and-miss but usually enjoyable. This one is no exception. It's a fairly mediocre main plot with only the snappy dialog of Parker's characters holding it together. But the subplot of Jesse's ex-wife is woven into this book much more cohesively than usual. The book is about obsession and control. The Peeping Tom's obsession with watching and controlling his victims. Jesse's obssession with his ex-wife and her control over him. In the end, there is resolution on both levels.Parker fans, like me, will enjoy this book.

The new characters added a freshness to the story line, and chief Parker did not fail to bring his worldly skills to the happenings in Paradise. Great read. Unfortunately, with the passing of author Parker, this may be the end of chief Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one for Robert B. Parker","review":"I simply love the Jesse Stone series.

This time I'm on the low side. I was undecided between 2 and 3 stars. But decided on 2.Of the reviews that I read I think Jeanne's review is closest to mine. I think it is Parker's worst effort of either the Sunny Randall or Jesse Stone series. The two main story lines are a panty inspection of 13 year old girls by a Middle school principal and a peeping Tom/Home invader, with a swingers club as a spinoff from the panty inspection. NONE of the stories evoked any interest from me. The major plus of \\"Night and Day\\" is it looks like Jesse is finally going to be rid of Jenn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance","review":"While many women romance authors have moved to the mystery thriller genre, this appears the first shift I'm aware of where a man who is great in the mystery thriller area shifts to romance novels.

It looked like a minimum effort on the part of the author and no effort on the part of the editor. I was particulary upset with the dialogue and the \\"he said-she said\\" additions to the end of each sentence, even in a two party dialogue. It was as if the author was being paid by the word (which maybe he was-since the plot is more fitting for a short story). I agree with most reviewers that best that can be said for this book is we may have seen the last of Jenn.

But Night and Day, featuring Jessie Stone, is a dronefest, an endless succession of two-word paragraphs and flat-splatting wisecracks.

Unfortunately the boneheads at Capitol Records have not included the BEST of the sessions big band songs such as \\"Moonglow\\", \\"King Porter Stomp\\" and argueably Goodman's most famous song \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\". Those songs are truely worth seeking out if you can find the original lp. It's not to say that the small group recordings are not anything less than excellant but why not keep with the original intent/concept of album - big band swing!It's like taking Sinatra's \\"Only the Lonely\\" lp and intermixing some of his big band sides while deleting \\"One For My Baby\\".

The music, by MJQ director and pianist John Lewis makes a huge contribution to the movie. Even if you haven't seen the movie, this record stands alone as a powerful statement of jazz composition. This is no \\"background music\\", mind you.

Now less than 6 months later, the entire plastic mechanism that activates the valve and igniter has worn out to the point where it no longer works. I have only filled this lighter about 6 or 7 times to give you an idea of how much it has been used.

It always lights when the body has been warmed in my pocket. It you leave out in the cold, Butane is hard to light. I just rub it in my hands if its chilled and that strong jet flame comes back quickly. The striker mechanism and light are still working.

It's dark, spooky fun...featuring a really well done MYSTERY. Some of the best banter between Rathbone and Bruce is in this film. And the bad guy ranks up there with the best of the non-Moriarty movie Holmes villains. THIS is the Rathbone movie from the Universal series that I return to again and again.

I had only used delicate laundry soap and the handwash cycle, and air dry so it should have lasted much longer for the price. Next time I am buying a 19 momme silk sheet set and even if they cost double, they will be worth it since they will last for years.

About five months ago, a small tear appeared in the left corner of the fitted sheet. After that, it was as thought the whole set was on a timer: the top sheet tore, the pillowcases came apart, and I found myself spending a fortune at the tailor to have them repaired. The repair work didn't last. They are just too thin, as one reviewer said, to withstand the wear and tear of bedsheets. And, yes, I washed them in special soap and it made very little difference.

Never before have so little episodes had SO many memorable moments! The characters are flawless and hysterical, each with their own unique quirks and mannerisms. Adam Scott is so loveable as Henry, the cynical down-and-out actor. Kasey, played by Lizzy Caplan, is the antithesis of a stereotypical, ditzy sitcom woman: she's smart, funny, ambitious, and holds her own against a hilarious, mostly-male cast.I have watched this show a billion times; every time, I laugh hysterically. I honestly can't recommend this enough. R.I.P, Party Down. Here's to a (hopeful) resurrection!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the ten best shows ever","review":"Party Down is an hilarious show. I loved it from the very first episode. The cast is impeccable and the writing is stellar. The dialogue flows so smoothly, it feels like it's improvised. That shows you how well-written the show really is. And it doesn't feel the need to have a joke every twenty seconds like a traditional sitcom, which is another positive.The characters feel like real people, despite all the situations they're thrown into. That actually puts it above The Larry Sanders Show for me. I love that show and it was very funny, but did I really care about any of them? No, not really. Adam Scott and Lizzy Caplan are the heart of the show, and their relationship was something I could really invest in. Dark, funny, unique and occasionally moving, Party Down ticks all the boxes. I can see myself watching it over and over again. In fact, I already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, cheesy synths and flutes","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews I bought this without actually listening to any of it first. If you are into John Fahey and other guitarists of that kind you will be disappointed. A lot of this borders on elevator muzak, and even fans of new agers like William Ackerman will probably be turned off by the production and choice of instrumentation. He almost goes somewhere cool when he starts off \\"Amazing Grace\\" with a kind of \\"Fripp\\" approach but quits that approach very quickly.

It has a plot that when it was written a few years ago must have seemed outlandish, but today is something I could see in the news. Honor Bound always pulls up just short of revealing or tipping the scales of polemic, but Ratti is masterful and quite clever of pulling back and keeping his cards to himself. Goes without saying that I read a book curious about what it reveals about the writer as much as for the story itself, and John Ratti is a good writer because he takes a genre fraught with political viewpoints and distills it into such a human and heartbreraking story that I think this work really deserves to be seen of one of the best of its kind, even if I'm not sure about ending. Not being sure about it, maybe that's what the author intended ... if so, then good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak - Blah!","review":"I'm not a fan of this book. I've tried to figure out if it's because it hits too close to home of if it's due to the author's relentlessly politically pessimistic view about our present and future. Either way, it soured me. I kept hoping Ratti would pull off something uplifting by the story's conclusion, but intead he left it for the reader to decide. Too bad: Honor Bound has a good plot and exciting heroine, but she, and the reader, deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall ... Quite Good","review":"As a long time fan of military fiction, I was rather surprised by Honor Bound. I found it so unlike anything else in the genre that the author should be commended for his different spin on the subject matter. It's clever, what Ratti has done, creating an American military hero who is a woman, someone who is inwardly rather than outwardly a super-hero, and who has to fight the good fight against those in and out of our government. Honor Bound is an uncompromising look at the effects on those who live for honor, without the inevitable triumph we come to expect from an American military fiction protagonist. This book stayed with me long after I read it, probably because of its real world vision, something we see far too little of in books of this type."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the core, Ratti is dead on right!","review":"Although some of his details regarding culture and history may be in dispute, that's merely contending the fringes (after all, it is fiction, and Ratti only stipulates \\"some\\" of it will one day be fact), but Honor Bound captures the bewildered, confused heart of America and its relationship with its government. With a great deal of skill, John Ratti uses his leading character, a U.S. Army officer, to whisper his concerns, not with any dogma or through discernable didacticism, but by showing an American just like most of us, and what happens when she bumps up against the powers-that-be. He doesn't preach, doesn't seem angry, and respects America with all its views. The talent he reveals in Honor Bound is one of a writer who makes one see the mirror on the other side of that dark looking glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crystal in the Clanking Clutter","review":"This book so surprised me! I'm usually not a reader of this genre, but having heard so much about this book over the past years I was intrigued by the debate over its future predictions for America and the world. I don't want to give too much away, or lead anyone to believe it's a great book. No, it's just short of that ... just a hare short. I've never read a book where I could so feel the author's humanity toward his protagonist, or so not see the writer's true view of the world. Bewteen those poles of \\"closer look\\" sits a story that left me seeing those who tread the minefield of modern political and social debate as narcissistic phonies more interested in drawing attention to their own anger rather than caring about solutions. Ratti illuminates, through Captain Kasey Lawrence, the importance of living the truths behind ideals instead of simply mouthing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate History or Future Prophecy?","review":"Honr Bound is a great read! Excellent plot mixed with fascinating stipulations about where the world is heading. Not for those who never pick up a newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Make A Great Movie!","review":"I heard so much about this book, which seems to have achieved something of a \\"cult\\" status in the military fiction genre, and having finally read it, it certainly delivers! Honor Bound's heroine, Kasey Lawrence is the most memorable character I've have encountered in a work of fiction in quite some time. Honor Bound is a big story, filled with a myriad of cinematic twists and turns; yet as large, arid and brutal as its geographic and plot landscape is, there's a muted calmness, even sadness at it's center. There's a big secret in the story, and once it's revealed, you'll never see the world, or our country, the same. It's unbelievable to me that this book was published before September 11 - how come there wasn't a mind like John Ratti's in our government before that day? I think the time is right for a story like this, something in the vein of a \\"Missing\\" or a \\"Z\\". I hope some filmmaker has the guts to make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, but not great","review":"This is a rather trivial story about a woman living outside of Omaha in the late 1800s. She doesn't like the town much, but she does like the woman who runs the restaurant, despite the fact that she has a good woman back on the homestead. The progression of the story is rather mundane. Even the \\"mystery\\" of who stole the bell isn't much of a mystery by the end of the book. Some of the dialogue is supposed to reflect the frontier life of the people, but the only down home phrase missing was Aw, shucks. What we need is a library that specializes in loaning out women's novels, so that something like this can be read without having to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Depth","review":"While set in 1880's Omaha at the beginning or the city's life, I never felt a part of the historical setting. The detail is vague, the characters are wooden, inauthentic or stereotypical bad guys. The plot twists are contrived and the love story (as such) leaves me cold. Perhaps if the novel had been spun out for another hundred pages, I might have felt more interest. This was definitely a gloss over novel meant to fill only the strict page guidelines of Naiad Press. I am disappointed as I liked many of the author's earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Reformed Covenant Theology","review":"Shepherd departs from the Reformed tradition when he insists that covenant keeping, i.e., faithful evangelical obedience, is necessary for justification. He de-emphasizes classical Reformed teaching, such as eternal and unconditional election, justification by faith alone (apart from any of the works of faith), and the centrality cross of Jesus Christ in the life and consciousness of the believer. Read this book if you want to explore an innovative and \\"Arminianish\\" theology of salvation, but turn elsewhere if you want to understand the classical Reformation view.For a solid and orthodox articulation of classical Reformed Covenant Theology, I recommend Louis Berkhof's _Systematic Theology_, and for a more thorough treatment, Herman Witsius' _The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man_."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, enlightening book","review":"These guys are hilarious -- and they give readers a totally original picture of why profs give the grades they do.

The cord storage device works as advertised and I am satisfied with it, considering what I paid for it. If you are going to be storing 100-ft. of electrical extension cord, this adds up to a significant weight that the device has to 'carry' and you have to hold while rolling the cord around the device (reel). There is a handle for one to hold, but when nearing the end of the 100-ft cord, you will notice the device flexes and it is difficult to hold with one hand while reeling (ergonomic factor). For improvement, I think the manufacturer should strenghten the device in places that would minimize flex and improve comfort during use. There are not too many products available on line that serve this purpose and have this design/function. Perhaps competition could drive improvement of this type of product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I ordered this product for an extra long, extra orange, extra intertwisted extension cord that my husband bought.

This music will lower your blood pressure, calm you entire being and is perfect for lazy winter evenings when you just want to listen to music and fall into a blissful sleep.These are adult lullabies, which have an innocent sweetness. \\"Let's Get Lost\\" tells of two people in love who just want to lose the crowd and be together. \\"You Don't Know What Love Is,\\" is mellow and has a bittersweet feel of love and loss. \\"It's Always You,\\" is about being in love and how when you are in love you see the object of your affection in everything, you feel them near you when you think of them.So, get ready to slow down to about 10 miles per hour and drift away and enjoy this mellow mood music with someone you love or spoil yourself and waste an evening away with a good romance and this music in the background.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chet can't sing? Maybe you should listen!","review":"Chet has a voice like no other. The guy knows exactly what he's doing and it shows. We could compare his modest phrasing to the one of Miles Davis. And oh my god, the emotion he tranmits, it's incredible ; he truly lives the songs he sings like i've rarely heard another jazz singer do. And you should hear him scat! He scats like he plays the trumpet... I recommend this record to anybody who likes good music with a humanly touch...

As moderate jazz musician, I have since gone on to purchase many of Chet's albums...but this one is, to me, definitive Chet Baker.

Phrases such as, \\"He can't sing, but ...\\" are repeated like mantras. Fact is, he just plain can't sing. He has a sort of hipper-than-thou whisper that broadcasts, \\"I'm such a sensitive artiste.\\" For some reason, people bought it. Blame it on the good looks, the smack habit, the James Dean act, and the times, which glorified everything unstudied and done badly - (read Kerouac). He was a nice, if unremarkable, horn man. But that singing, wow. You'll get more passion from your dishwasher, and more technique too. Baker's real brilliance was in passing off attitude for art, something that survives to this day.

As of Basbanes' publication, he was due to get out of jail the following year.In a lively anecdotal style equally reverent and irreverent, Basbanes devotes the first half of his book to the lore and history of book collections throughout the world and the second half to well-researched and even gossipy profiles of the world's foremost living collectors.

The part at the beginning where they spell out M-o-n-i-c-a is really scary. 2. PUSH N SHOVE: The first time that I heard this song I really didn't like it. Perhaps because it has a really slow beat.

This is his only film with Rita Hayward, Claudia Cardinale, and Lloyd Nolan, so definitely not the usual cast.

Looked great on my home projector.The film is a great John Wayne film. He carries the lead very well. It is great to see a young Claudia Cardinale.

I could not find a single image or line of text in this book that hasn't been directly copied over from 'Book of Tiki' (even the chapter titles remain the same).

Another man falling wildly in love with her after having known her only for a few hours (during which time she behaves like a complete jerk) and having absolutely nothing in common with her? Give me a break. The characters that weren't actively obnoxious were either weak and wishy washy (Mark, William, Caroline) or preachy (Eliza, Victoria). They were all so unlikeable I found myself wishing they'd all gone down with the ship, including the ones who stayed on shore.Ms. Price seemed to have done a good job researching the period and the historical descriptions are well done.

Given the strictures of Lamott's situation at the time--no man around to help her or take responsibility for his child--the humor in this book is nothing short of amazing. After a particularly frustrating episode of feeding solids to her son Sam, Lamott writes that the process is a lot like spackling; you fill the hole with stuff, scrape around the sides, try to pack some more stuff in the hole, and so on. This was so true and so perfectly described that I laughed out loud with recognition. Although Lamott's situation isn't everyone's, the difficulties, fears and joys she describes herein are universal to most new parents. This makes a marvelous gift for the new mom who has everything else and who could use a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, and Very Touching","review":"With unflinching honesty Anne LaMott loosely recounts the first year of her son's life. As a recovering alcoholic and single Mother, she vacillates between hair pulling frustration and utter awe as her son changes month by month, sometimes day by day. Surrounded by an incredible support staff of friends and family, and an unwavering faith in God she navigates the path of parenthood and life with a wicked sense of humor that leaves you laughing out loud one minute and then pricking your heart with moving eloquence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operating instructions for the friend","review":"I found this book to be very helpful to me as someone who does not have children. Many of my friends have children and I now have a different perspective of what they went through during the first years with their children. Lamott is so real, honest, and illustrative in her stories that I think most people who have been around children can relate. This is a great gift not only for mothers, but also for those who do not have children yet and what they can expect as first-time mothers. Although Lamott's perspective is from a woman, this would be a good read for new dads too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nice to know I'm not the only one who felt this way!","review":"I think the people that gave this book a negative review missed the point that it's a journal...it was what Anne Lamott was thinking as she was going through her son's first year. God forbid any of those people read my diary! I thought this book was extraordinary in how well she captured how much you can love and then hate this little human being you produced within the space of a few seconds. I will be buying this book for all my pregnant friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamott's support for new parents is like a good friend's.","review":"I was alternately moved to laughter and tears on first reading of Operating Instructions and have reread my favorite bits many times. When I loan out my tattered copy, it's usually to parents, but there's something about Lamott's honesty about the good, bad, and ugly of life that offers comfort for all. You get the sense that Anne's got her priorities - care of her child, not how clean the house is. In life where we all struggle to do it all, it's good to be reminded of what's important."},{"rating":"2","title":"a light in the darkness of the unknown and alone","review":"i was given this book over 4 years ago by a professor at my college (i found out i was pregnant my final year of college). my then best friend and fiance at the time (and father to be) had ran away and i was at a loss for a strong, feminine, and real example of a woman who was likewise accomplishing and perservering at the challenges and insanity of becoming a parent. this book was a light for me in a time of darkness. i stand here 4 years later. better. stronger. safer. Having been encouraged by the trueness of the desperation and the thankfulness of the joy at becoming a parent. This book helps you to believe that you are not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read - especially for expectant mommies","review":"i read this book WELL before i was even pregnant. now that i've had my precious daughter, i think i will re-read this great book. it's a \\"must read\\" to add to your collection of pregnancy/parenting books, such as \\"girlfriends guide to pregnancy\\", \\"what to expect when you're expecting\\", etc. it gives a humorous, heartwarming, honest and unflinching account of what it's like to be a mom. (and a little on pregnancy too!) being someone who grew up in the same area that anne lamott did, it had a special nostalgia value for me. (SF Bay Area, Marin Cty.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS STORY COULD BE MINE WORD FOR WORD!!!","review":"When I first read what Anne Lamott's book was about, I could hardly believe my eyes. This was the story of my life, practically identical!!! I too was 35 and also had a son, whose father wanted no part of. I laughed & cried, because this story hit so close to home, and I didn't think there was anyone else out there that thought and felt all those wonderful & awful feelings, sometimes all at the same time. I couldn't put the book down, it was awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A baby is a little miracle. Now shut up.","review":"Reading this book felt like being stuck next to a new parent on a long plane trip. Either you're bored because you don't have kids, or you're bored because it is never your turn to talk about YOUR kid, or you are so kid-oriented and passive that you simply LOVE to hear all about the mundane ordinary pleasures that someone else gets from THEIR kid. If you are in the latter category, or you are perhaps a single mom in recovery and born again in Christ, you will enjoy this book. Otherwise, skip it and go spend some time with your real-life friends who have kids. They need the company, and the baby stories are all pretty much the same. Lamott's diary style offers 'reality' but little art."},{"rating":"1","title":"if only....","review":"As a mother of two, including a son that is under one year of age, I could have enjoyed this book. However, I found the conservative bashing, especially the George Bush bashing, just too much to take. In fact, I put the book down in favor of another, and have yet to pick it up again. I can only think of maybe three other books in my 37 years that I have failed to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"conservatives, beware","review":"I just had my first baby (an amazing boy) & started reading this after he was born. I would not recommend for mothers, since the author drones on endlessly about her fears for her son. This only puts the same thoughts in the readers minds, things which never would have occurred to me before. I would also discourage anyone from reading this who is the slightest bit conservative. The author goes on and on about her hatred for Republicans and especially George Bush. She seems more interested in pushing a liberal agenda and teaching her son about fear and hatred than writing a good memoir. I found that part quite offensive, regardless of my political opinions. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it inspired me to write down my own observations, thoughts and feelings for my beloved baby boy, so that made it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics a big part of this book!","review":"I received this book as a gift. I don't think the giver knew his audience very well. I was intending to read a similar book to \\"The Zygote Chronicles,\\" which I WOULD recommend. This book was more about her expressing her political views than about taking you through her thoughts with her son. I found myself trying to skip around to find the information about him and not about her ranting on about how Republicans are evil and convincing her son of the same. I was sorely disappointed in this book. From someone who is coming up to motherhood in a very conservation and traditional way, this was quite offensive. However, I know that some might find this amusing. I sent it to a friend that might think differently than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very helpful book","review":"I received this book as gift--it did not look like something I'd like since I have children already, but I read it anyway...This book is supposed to be about the first year of a little boy's life, but instead it focuses more on his single mother's therapy and past problems with drugs and alcohol. If you are in the same boat as she, you may find the book humorous. However, I fell into the category of those with husbands (she seems to like putting down women who have partners), so I didn't find it amusing.This would have been a great opportunity to tell it like it is, but most of the book didn't focus on the title matter at all. I would not recommend this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please...","review":"This book is so unabashedly poor-me drivel that I can't believe it was published. I loaned it to a writer friend of mine, and she is of the same sentiment. Motherhood does not need to be this melodramatic, this difficult. Oh please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but...","review":"This is a quick and easy read, and if you have an infant or young child, that is the only kind of book you can read!! Anne Lamott has a great sense of humor and is able to vocalize the feelings that a great deal of new parents have but are too ashamed to talk about. The only problem with this book is that there is a tremendous amount of talk about Jesus and tons of Republican-bashing, which can get irritating if you are not a Christian liberal, as Anne Lamott so clearly is! If these things don't bother you, then you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, complex, and sometimes dark....","review":"I'm glad my son was 9 when I read this book. While I loved Annie Lamott as the person she presented herself as(she was so HONEST!),the book took me back to those dark times of new motherhood. The book was hilarious but the undercurrent of self-doubts and mixed feelings towards your baby- while real- I think I'd rather forget. I thought this was a simple book about a very complex REAL person. I loved her emotions, her honesty, her very humorous writing style, and her ability to be \\"every woman\\". It may be realistic but I'm not sure it's a must read for new or expecting parents! I loved it but at the same time found it to be disturbing. (Maybe that's the point!) Great job, Annie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down-to-Earth and Hilarious","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. My first-born (daughter) was about 2 years old at the time. I absolutely LOVED it!Anne's honesty is refreshing. She also has a warmth and sense of humour that leaps off every page. While reading the book, I almost felt like I was talking to an old friend. It gave me a comforting feeling to hear what was going on each day in her life. I couldn't wait to find out what her son, Sam, was up to. I wish she would write a follow-up to this book, so I could know what Sam is doing these days!I read this book 12 years later when my second born (son) was born. I enjoyed it even more the second time around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that.","review":"The book invokes memories of my own child rearing experiences and emotions. Having said that, it's like being at a gathering of women talking about their labor struggles. Why do we think anyone cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for all audiences...","review":"I bought this book for my granddaughter who had just had her first child. I know Anne Lamott to be a bit radical in her writings, however, I thought that while recording the life journey of her child she might be a bit less crude. Not true as she begins by making refernce to his maturing genitals through the years. Not appropriate for the mother of newborn son, at least in my opinion. There seems to be enough crude language and displays without including it in a record of your son's first year ot life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I think she is an amazing author, but I just couldn't buy into this one. It just felt so narcissistic to me (obviously it's a memoir, but even at that, it just felt so completely over the top that I just couldn't stomach it). She has such amazing thoughts on faith and God, it just makes you want to write them all down and keep her quotes in your pocket. But then she gets started on tangents (and language) and she loses my interest, because I know she can do better (and has: Traveling Mercies and Bird by Bird are both works that I really enjoyed). So, I'll give Grace (Eventually) a shot, if nothing else but for the amazing spirituality (and quotes that I will keep in my pocket for a rainy day)."},{"rating":"2","title":"very timely, even today","review":"Anne LaMott wrote this book during the first Bush presidency --. In several passages, she chronicles her hatred of Bush senior & encourages her little Sam to grow up to be leader of the rebel forces. When I read this book, I had to go back & look at the copyright date; I felt like I was reading something written in 2004. LaMott is self-deprecating and quick to acknowledge all of her wonderful supporters & friends. This is a great read for new moms, particularly those who are disenchanted with the current president & state of the world generally."},{"rating":"1","title":"was recommended to me, but I didn't particularly like this book","review":"It might have been too high of expectations on my part - since a friend recommended it - she thought it was hilarious, but I simply did not enjoy this book. It was kind of boring and repetitive of other books on the same themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"operating instructions","review":"I have always liked anne lamont, and have read most of her stuff. I love the way she writes so honestly and openly. However, this book is probably my favorite of hers. I just finished and couldnt put it down. I think it would be a great read for a first time pregnant mom. I laughed out loud during parts because having a young son myself, her take on some things rang really true to me. Of course in her typical honest raw form....The fun and challenging parts of the first year are revealed. For sure, she had challenges...(especially being a single mom)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read for new moms","review":"This is my favorite gift to new moms. Annie Lamott chronicles the love and challenges in the first year of parenthood. She openly talks about the dark side of how hard the first year can be as a parent, and she does it with wicked humor and tenderness. For me, it was a better companion than any \\"self help\\" book for my first year as a mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for new mothers","review":"This book is a must-read for single moms and also new moms. Honest, loving, funny - a truly wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my sanity","review":"When I was a new mom this book saved my sanity. I realized that maternal feelings weren't all cotton candy happy. They ran the gamut. Anne let me laugh at myself even when I was angry, frustrated and confused. I learned that motherhood is real. The book is far cheaper than therapy and a must for new mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight","review":"I ordered this book for a friend going to visit her first grandchild. I cannot imagine a better gift. Anne Lamott has a sense of humor about herself that is rarely found these days. Her writing here is every bit as delightful as it was in Bird by Bird, the collection of essays I encountered first. It does not matter in the least whether you have a small child in your life. This book draws in everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who are expecting... an unexpected treat","review":"My mother gave me this book recently, when I learned I was pregnant. I really enjoyed it, although some parts of it alarmed me (especially Lamott's description of her baby's months of colicky, sleepless nights).(...) She is unflinchingly honest about both the highs and lows of motherhood. There's nothing sentimental or sappy about this book, yet she makes it clear that she considers her (unplanned) pregnancy to be the greatest blessing of her life. It made me more excited about having my baby... and reassured me that even oddballs like myself can make good mothers.I don't think you have to be a mother or mom-to-be to enjoy this book, but it probably helps. And it's definitely not a good choice if you're at all prudish or conservative. Otherwise, though-- highly recommended. Guaranteed to bring you lots of laughs and a least one good cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous gem","review":"I stumbled across this book at the library and was drawn to it because of the title. It was an absorbing read; Anne Lamott is an amazing writer. Even though my youngest is almost 8 years old, I could still relate to the common struggles and worries that go hand-in-hand with being a new mother. I was alternately laughing one moment and on the verge of a weepfest the next. This book has started me on a path of reading everything I can find by this author; she is truly a gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for new mothers","review":"This book helped me survive my first-born. It was such a breath of fresh air, and Lamott was like my best friend, sharing the same experiences. I have read this book countless times - and laugh out loud each time. I always send this book to all my friends when they have their first born. (As you can see by my order history.) This is a much better tool than any of the how-to baby books out there. I absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn Off","review":"A book suppose to be about her son's first year is FILLED w/ vitriolic language towards conservatives. It made me ill to read it; half ways through I quit...actually thought about burning it but thats NOT what conservatives do. A few of her notations about her son's first few months were funny but nothing could motivate me to finish the book...I also ordered her new book; Some Assembly Required but am loath to open the cover; in fact wish I could return it for a refund as I don't want to support her in any way, shape or form. Conservatives accept people where they are; have done more for woman's rights and blacks than any liberal, do not attack people for what they believe...I fail to understand why liberls feel it's their duty to feel it's their right to vituperate people who have a different view point from theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporate Comedy","review":"\\"Dear Mr. Mackin...\\" is one helluva funny book. I was laughing out loud the whole way through.What Mr. Mackin does is write letters to companies about their products, usually regarding their advertising or packaging. He then prints the company's response alongside his letters. It's most often a form letter with an enclosure of coupons, but sometimes not.For light, funny-as-hell reading, you can't do better than this gem of a collection. If anyone knows what the 2,000 body parts that LEVER2000 cleans, I'm sure Mr. Mackin would love to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jug and Groove are IN the latter...","review":"More than half of this CD is Live; the other 2 tracks being done the same day in the studio. The studio sound is better, no question, but Live is Live...and I like drummer Leroy Henderson a lot on the Live part. Much like Anders, who reviewed this below, I find the guitar to be a problem on both Live - where his 'gain' is up too much, and hence distorts his sound; and in the studio - where he is obviously out of tune. Playing ' Wes-style octave' leads when your guitar is out of tune (listen to \\"Morris The Minor\\") is bad enough; to allow that on to a recording is not good...Otherwise, Jug sounds great with Groove, especially in a Live setting. This is a straight-on groove CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories of strength","review":"This book was so helpful to me, that I loaned my copy to a friend, and I bought copies for two other friends who were dealing with the same issues.

Because life is a dream state, and therefore you have temporarily crossed over from the dream state to another plane.... blah, blah, blah...\\"However, sometimes, due to not being the brightest bulb out of the box, I need to call up reserves to fight the good fight against abstract thinking morons.

Case in point, the tooth fairy goes unmentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynic more than Skeptic","review":"It's always a treat to read a writer who engages in what he purports to refute. One other review on this site gave Carroll's book five stars for, in part, \\"not too much depth.\\" No argument there. Depth seems a prerequisite to skepticism. So Carroll's credibility regarding such matters as Carl Jung's contributions to psychology is, as revealed by both his tone and his thin and selective support, reveal a writer in way over his head.In all, the work (like the website), reads more like a set of fundamentalist sermons warning congregations against temptations of the flesh than a demonstration of intellectual rigor. Merely claiming to be skeptical doesn't make one so.Ironically, this is a good book for learning how to be a skeptic in the same way that a book by Rush Limbaugh is a good way to learn how to be a leftist.The two stars are for: 1) Some laughs; 2) An engaging list of topics; 3) Occasional lucidity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A facinating book!","review":"I had a great time just browsing through this book and reading the various entries. Several of the entries were familiar to me from other books, but this dictionary added aditional information. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the unsual."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Skeptic's Dictionary","review":"The main thing wrong with this book is that some of the sections are nothing more than uninformed personal opinion. There are some items that he is knowledgeable of, but this quality of his commentary is not consistent, and when he finds something he feels strongly against, he gives a rant that is no better -and in some cases a lot worse- than the ideas he is writing against. He writes like a university professor, which is to say that his style is quasi-polished and packed with arctypes of ideology, some of which are themselves pseudo-whatever. When those are right, then his arguments are correct; but when they are untrue or incorrect, he simply doesn't seem to notice that they are untrue or incorrect. For this reason the book is suspect overall. If there's something you know is true, maybe you will find reinforcement of that fact here; but if there is something that you are not sure about, this book is not the one to trust in finding out what the objective truth is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treat with the utmost skepticism!","review":"If you wanted to teach someone to think for themself, would you:A) Teach them to think concisely and rationally, how to carry out meaningful investigations, and how to keep an open mind till they had sufficient evidence to make their OWN evaluation, pro or con, on a given subject?B) Or would you tell them what to think, implying that they were some kind of gullible fool if they disagreed with YOUR evaluations?If you said \\"A\\", well done, there's hope for you yet.If you said \\"B\\", you'll probably love this book ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if not deceiving","review":"At first I was glad to be able to read this book on various subjects.

His understanding of elitism and its ties to Masonic and Kabbalistic ideologies is lacking. Scholars are only now seriously considering the idea of a NWO and this is only due to the recent flood of information concerning the subject by world leaders. To state that the subject has been created by fundamentalist that are running around looking for things to delude themselves with is a delusion in itself.

I met JONATHAN WINTERS in front of the Warwick Hotel in NY in 1958, and I asked for his autograph, and he said, \\"You don't even know who I am!\\" And I said, \\"You are Jonathan Winters, and you must be a star now because you in my \\"TV Annual\\" here.\\" He was so excited and wanted to see it. He was on Jack Paar a lot and screamingly funny.But in the last 15 years I have been buying his ART BOOKS because I am fanatically interested in art history. Jonathan Winters is enormously talented as an artist. This documentary covers Winters the comedian and Winters the artist, and it has about 50 guest stars. And 49 of them were worth seeing.The director, who has a great directing name: PASTERNAK, should get an award for this baby. If you like to laugh, love fine paintings, and want to have a memorable night, buy this DVD. I will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go elswhere for your Jonathan Winters fix","review":"A painfully bad, unfunny, artless \\"mockumentary\\" starring Jonathan Winters. What a missed opportunity. A real documentary about Winters would have been amazing. You see flashes of what could have been -- moments of great humor whenever Jonathan is allowed to riff free and loose and be real. But the fake story about Winters trying to get into the Museum of Modern Art and suffering after a painting of his is stolen (he's really a fantastic artist) is both unconvincing and devoid of humor. Robin Williams livens things up a bit once or twice. There's a decent scene of Winters and Howie Mandell shopping in Target looking for where they can buy \\"funny,\\" and the scene where Winters tries to hire a hitman to recover his lost sense of humor almost achieves something, but the rest is awful. I kept watching for glimpses of Winters being Winters, which you get, but I definitely don't recommend this film. Try Winters' other DVDs or albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Struggle of African descended people for freedom.\\"","review":"Stunningly beautiful full of a wondrous music score.Vivid and gritty story of Brasil during colonial times.With slavery and the neverending fight to be free.

Since this deck has no \\"Dolby\\" feature, my classical music came out sounding flat and tinny. In addition, there was a lot of \\"hissing\\" from surface noise. Since I have top-of-the line speakers, and a Denon amp, I'm used to hearing near \\"concert hall\\" reproduction of my music. However, this Pyle Pro deck obviously wasn't made for that type of use.

And even after that, all the main character can seem to do is angst about how miserable she'd been in the first half of the book!

I went from these to both Box Sets, and from there to purchasing all the single album CDs.So, is this set part of a plan to 'trap' people into becoming fanatics? Maybe not, but that's how it worked out for me. I hardly ever pull out these disks now to listen to Zep, but they served their purpose and I'm glad that I bought them! I dare anyone who is new to Zep to buy these and NOT want more of them!

This being said, even attempting a two cd box set was bound to set die hard fans howling like Robert Plant in Kashmir. For the casual fan, this set hits many of the high points of the bands career. If you are curious about Led Zeppelin, this set provides a great way to whet your pallet, without spending a large sum of money for the albums. If, however, you esteem yourself as a die hard Led Zeppelin fan, you will undoubtedly miss many great tracks that have been left out, such as The Wonton Song, Over the Hills and Far Away, and Heartbreaker. If you find yourself in this category, buy the larger box set, all the albums, or the Complete studio recordings set, because you simply will not be satisfied with this set. For me, this set brought me from the casual fan to where I am now, wanting more. I would only reccomend it for the casual or curious fans of Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty unoriginal","review":"Hmmmm. . .power trio plus one, blond lead singer, loud and crazy drummer, guitarist who was the brains behind the group. . .all I have to say is, if these guys weren't paying royalties to the Who, they should be.Long-winded collection featuring trademark Zeppelin: by trademark, I mean shreiking vocals and half-decent riffs.

It is by far the worst Cd by the worst band I have ever heard. There is no melody or any tunes to any of the songs. Listening to this CD really makes me wanna kill myself. The guitar solos are horrible and every song is the exact same. People that listen to this CD need to get out of the 70s or whenever this band was actually popular and listen to some good music that people have actually heard of. It's 2004 people! What I really can't stand is all of the young, high school people that listen to Led Zepplin because they think it is cool. Ok, maybe clothes from the 70s are in, but music isn't.

I certainly wouldn't buy this if I had already sprung for a larger Led Zep CD collection, but for me, somebody who finds 1 and 4 their best albums (both well represented here) and 2 and 3 over-rated but for a few killer tracks (\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Imigrant Song\\" are included) disc one (EARLY DAYS) is ideal... The second disc (LATTER DAYS) doesn't do as well by the available material...

This was frequently not the case. Either all wax was on one sheet, or only a small section of wax was left on one of the sheets. And of course, after you have warmed the entire strip in your hands, and after you have used one of the sheets, the other sheet has cooled off.That issue aside, the wax just didn't work well on my legs. Each strip left a LOT of hair behind, no matter how many times I waxed the same area. I do have coarse, thick hair, and I'm sure that's part of the problem. But I have used other waxing kits before, and they did work on my legs, so this brand is suboptimal. I tried heating a strip in the microwave as one reviewer suggested, and it made no difference. These wax strips just don't work well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Waxing Strips!","review":"Works well for me! I usually use this for my underarms. I would definitely buy it again!

There is no way you could do the job with one box. Especially since on go over doesn't get all the hair. My hair was with-in the recommended length. I followed the directions.

The wax sticks to everything but the wax paper itself, so the entire wax remains on your skin, after you pull the paper.I have to say that I used the same brand for sensitive skin (the blue packaging), and I did not have any problem with it. Only this product (with the green packaging) did not work for me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Product For Years!","review":"I've been using these strips for roughly 3-4 years now and am heartbroken that they are no longer sold in my area. I have tried Sally Hanson (disappointed), Nads (disappointed), as well as a couple generic brand waxes. Of course, nothing beats going to the salon, but these are so much less expensive and truly do a great job.If you're planning to try these strips, heres a few pointers:*Always shower and exfoliate before waxing!!! I use a loofah on my legs 2 days in a row beforehand just in case*It's wax, so you will realize there are parts of your legs that are more sensitive than others. If you're afraid at first, try to wax your knee/upper calf area. The area that is post painful to me is near my ankle.I would truly recommend trying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked poorly for me","review":"I had high hope for these since the box said they work well even for short hairs. I tried them on both my bikini and legs, I also had my boyfriend try it on me as well (he has warmer hands, I thought perhaps I hadn't warmed the strip well enough).It left about 1/2 the hair on my legs and didn't work at all on the bikini zone. We also tried leaving the strip on a little longer, but then the wax pulls off the paper and sticks to your skin.The finishing wipes also don't seem to take away the sticky residue. Since all the other reviews for this product are so glowing, I was surprised by how poorly it preformed, so perhaps the box I had was defective in some way. I just know that it didn't really work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"So far this is my favorite wax strip that I have used on my face. I had no luck with Nair Wax Strips.

The sugar removes the wax and the baby oil prevents irritation and soothes the skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"I followed the instructions exactly and it did not work. I tried it three separate times before I could get it to remove any hair, and it did not remove nearly as much as it should have. It pulled out maybe 10 single hairs and left a thick, sticky, wax residue on my leg that didn't even come off in a hot shower. I had to SCRUB and SCRUB! Shaving is easier than this!

I was so excited at the thought of not having to shave, so I read lots of positive reviews and then went out and bought some for myself. I got them at Walgreens for $8. I let my hair grow to a proper length for waxing and then I read the directions VERY carefully. And I followed the directions VERY carefully!! These things suck. They hardly removed any hair and left wax behind. So I had to wipe the spots I waxed with those wipes and now my calves look like they have razorburn! Ugh I'm SO disappointed!! I tried all kinds of tricks to get these things to work. I warmed them up with my hair dryer for a few seconds instead of my hands to make sure that the wax was warm and that did nothing. I tried everything. No matter how concisely I followed the directions I got very poor results. DO NOT waste your money!! Total rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap alternative to salon","review":"It is a cheap alternative to going to the salon to get a wax job, but it will be more time consuming and i highly suggest reading the directions carefully. You can cut the peices to fit your needs and reuse them a few times. It's too much of a hassle for me to do all the time, but it's really good for a special occasion. It's much easier to use than the wax you spread on yourself. Just be careful not to overuse the strips though, a couple of times i had problems with the wax sticking to my leg."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books should have been called \\"Exclamation points! Italics! Cliches!\\"","review":"The title is misleading - I didn't get what I paid for. This is a book that claims to offer enlightenment on elements of conflict, action and suspense without actually engaging in any of those topics. Instead we hear about melodrama, soap operas etc with some very cliched and tired tidbits on dialogue and short, choppy sentences (which anyone with basic writing ability knows anyway). Be warned, the author's definitions of these elements are vastly different to what you and I may define as conflict, action and suspense, and as a result wildly misses the mark.

It's the sort of thing that's great if you really haven't read another book on writing, but which is pretty useless if you have.I'd imagine that this book might be useful for a very beginning author who is working on developing these conflict, action, and suspense, but there are almost certainly better books on these three things out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Shot","review":"I wrote a bad review for Threelac originally.

I'll review again and let you know if it works or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Well, usually I love remix albums, EPs, and such, but I have to say that this one just doesn't quite cut it. I'd rather have the plain, old Rosemary Clooney version any day--it has more fire. Besides, it seems these guys are just jumping onto the Mambo bandwagon clinging onto the flash in the pan coattails of Lou Bega."},{"rating":"2","title":"iso good","review":"Very good taste, this is the first time I order this brand and the flavor turn to be delicioso! overall very good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains genetically modified soy","review":"'Studies showed organ lesions, altered liver and pancreas cells, changed enzyme levelsIf you use protein powder for health reasons, why would you eat this or feed this to your children?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Muscle Milk Better","review":"I tried the dymatize nutrition whey chocolate as a replacement to my muscle milk chocolate, I was not at all happy with the switch, the dymatize was more chalky and powder tasting and it certainly did not have the sweet chocolate taste as the muscle milk does, I will be using muscle milk again next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste and nutrition choice.","review":"I use this protein powder in lots of receipes and just as a shake on occassion. It blends well and tastes GREAT! I love that it has no carbs and is low calorie as well. Works perfectly with my post gastric bypass surgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells and tastes terribly off","review":"When I first opened the bottle, I swear it smelled similar to spoiled milk. I don't know if the company sent me an expired product or it spoiled in transit due to the heat (can't find expiration date on it), but the diarrhea from drinking it is kind of tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This protein powder does not taste as disgusting as most others. It actually has a good taste and I noticed a difference in the way it helped me tone! Very filling as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best bang for the buck, in my opinion","review":"I have tried most of all the major brands and I like this best.No GasNo CrampingMixes VERY easily in a shaker with water aloneNo aftertastevery inexpensive price when you buy 5Lbs from Amazon.Chocolate is my fave. But, the fruit is nice too.The other dymatize I have tried is the Elite Gourmet, which is a blended Whey and not a true Hydrolized Isolate.When I switched from Blended Whey to a 100% Isolate I immediately noticed less water retention, quicker muscle pump, and more noticeable energy during high intensity, when drinking pre AND post workout. . .My results may not be typical, however, I am noting it since this is markedly different than what I noticed from Muscle Milk, ON, EAS, and Gaspari."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, great service","review":"Product arrived in a timely fashion from the supplier & seems to be working well with my system. The taste is GREAT - which, as anyone who uses protein powders can attest to, that is no small compliment! Most of them have a horrible after taste, but this one mixes well & goes down easily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protein powder","review":"Great tasting protein powder, especially considering it has no fat and only 1 carb in it. I mix with water and crushed ice after workouts and it tastes great, same goes for the chocolate. I have used this in place of other because I am trying to lose weight and the 1 carb per and 24 grams of protein help a lot.Also, shipping was incredibly fast via allstar health. Try it , its may seem a little pricey but its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOATING AND REACTION","review":"I USED this product for a while and it seemed fine. Then i began to feel and look bloated continuously. After talking to my doctor he said my body did not react well to this product. The company i purchased from said they would be glad to give me a refund if I returned it. I had already paid shipping and now another 12.00 to return it. I called Dymatize and they said they would give me a credit on their web site. Since I can use nothing they sell they basically said thats just tough. I would think a company would be more gracious but, they certainly were not. There are many other good products on the market and my suggestion is to choose one not made by DYMATIZE"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO GAS! HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT","review":"This protein powder is high quality and worth the extra expense.I have had problems with digestion and gas with other inferior products.I drink one for my \\"second breakfast\\" almost every day, after my morning work out.This powder mixes well also. I just put into a 20oz Rubbermaid plastic bottle and shake.I sometimes put the rest of the morning coffee part way and a shot of skim milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Protein powder","review":"Great tasting! Mixes well with just about anything. The price of this was about the same as the 2lb in the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best CD","review":"I have enjoyed this CD. It is one of her best. My favorite song, on the CD is, Keep on Blessing Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yule Struttin'","review":"It was a pleasure to have this CD during Christmas time!I have enjoyed driving with these music very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Anyone Who Loves The Baroque!","review":"Any further compliments about this complete recording of Corelli's works would be superfluous at best. All that I can say is that they are played here with such clarity, vim and vigor. One of the best if not THE best version I've ever heard.Value for money also so grab this A.S.A.P. before it goes out of print!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1.6 L is MASSIVE. Do.Not.Get. you probably want the 775 mL","review":"I ordered the 1.6L first and it is MASSIVE! It is the size of a skillet and you could easily cook for 4-5 people in that thing, maybe even take a bath, it is soooo huge. I had to return it, turns out the 775 is really what you want. It is the perfect size for one person, or more specifically your Bug Out Bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"pre-dented","review":"received pot with 2 dents in the bottom of pot and 1 dent in the lid. packaging seemed to be ok so I assume the pot and lid were dented before they were packed for shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"1.1 MSR Pot","review":"I recently purchased this one to upgrade from my last one that was smaller. Since the fiance is going with me now, the meals are bigger. I thought it may be too big but found that it still fits in a side pocket of my Osprey Argon or Aether (I have a 110 and an 85. They might have smaller pockets on the smaller packs). It's much roomier inside for more kitchen storage. I put all kinds of stuff like soap, a scrub brush, spices, spork, etc. It's not water proof. The lid handle is a little small for big fingers especially while using a pot holder. The pot handle is great and easily used without a pot holder. I was packing for the last trip and had an idea... I wish they would make these in a square shape... You will agree if you use it as a storage device in your pack. I could fit a lot more items inside the pot if it was square! Just an idea... I would buy this item again."},{"rating":"2","title":"1.6L Alpine Stowaway Pot","review":"Perfect size for 2+ person meals. I have a smaller set of pots but even for solo trips, this one sees a ton of use. It's very sturdy, but light and compact. Some people have complained about the handle not locking in place, but I'd rather deal with that then have a separate handle to have to stow and eventually lose.**NOTE** If you have a MSR Dragonfly stove, it'll fit snugly inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifically Tiny","review":"I also own the 1.6L. while the bigger 1.6l is great for 3-5 or just ample storage, this 775ml is perfect for the solo backpacker cooking about a cup or so helping. Fits nicely in the 1.6l as well. Will not fit my whisperlite stove like the 1.6 but sure saves some space and weight! Just like its big brother the quality in the materials and efficient design are exceptional"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-ce208d12"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/66.md","filePath":"guide/66.md"}'),j={name:"guide/66.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
