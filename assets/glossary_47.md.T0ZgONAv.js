The general consensus so far is that the biggest downside is it needs IS (image stabilization). Small, compact, comfortable to hold, easy to operate. The screen is hard to see in bright daylight (I've never known an LCD that wasn't) and the \\"little blue light\\" is somewhat bothersome after a while. Works beautifully with the Transcend 8 gb SDHC card. We haven't tried it w/ a tripod or monopod yet but I think a monopod would help significantly. I think this is a great deal. Everything about the camera works as described in the manual - comes with a second battery too which is nice. Great value for the money even without IS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I BABIED THIS CAMERA, AND IT STILL BROKE.","review":"After not even a week of using the camera, the backlight on the lcd would come on, but the camera would not start up.

My reference experiences are a 12 year old Sony 8 mm tape camcorder (a pain to haul around) and a two year old Nikon 5 MP digital still camera (easy to pocket). The biggest aggravations with GO-HD are: the motor noise of auto-focus and zoom transferred to the sound; the lack of image stabilization. Lesser problems are: light level drops with zoom; reddish cast with auto white balance; poor still images. I haven't tried the HD video because of the above problems combined with the megabyte consumption. In summary, this camera promises more than it can deliver. On the other hand, it is very handy and easy to pocket. I will continue to use it for close-up, candid, less-professional situations. In retrospect, I should have purchased the less expensive Aiptek MPVR+ (which has image stabilization) and waited for HD on a better camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, cheap camcorder","review":"Length:: 0:52 MinsThe video quality is pretty good given the cost. It's been a nice addition to my backpack. It starts up quickly and is ready to take a photo or video at a moment's notice. The only two complaints I have is regarding the microphone and the battery. The internal microphone is terrible. If there is a lot of background noise or you're recording a loud event, there is a lot of distortion in the soundtrack. Also, I ended up upgrading the battery toone with more amperage. Since then I've had no issues with charging or battery drain while the camera is not in use. Here's a sample video from the camera.

This films starts off well and had me interested for most of its duration, but it was let down by a barely coherent ending that, after 36 hours of thinking about it, I still don't get. Based on the plot summary, you might think that this is a Christian propaganda film, but it's not. It's just a normal film with some religious themes, except the religious ideas put forward in this film are so confused, that I'm not even sure what the writer's beliefs actually are.

Basically a compilation of early tracks and re-mastered demo material, it delivers all the aggression and anger that is Leaether strip. One thing I really like about the material on this album is an underlying retro feel, reminding me of mid to late 80's underground dance, but with much more punch! The lyrics and subjects of this album emulate a darker period when many of us were angry, fustrated and unsure about the future.

The idea of a dark elf going against the society he was brought up in was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innermost Desires","review":"I have long thought that good fiction allows an author to examine the social issues of our society in a non threatening way. The ability of the author to cloak the innermost desires of the heart in such a way that the reader is drawn into the story so quickly and completely that only when the story is complete does he realize the social implications is what determines the quality of fiction.Salvatore openly challenges the traditional cloaking of intent and encourages the reader to be a better person by using the philosophical notes at the beginning of each chapter which reveal Drizzt's continual struggle for good over his innate evil. Ontologistic at best, paganist at least, you decide.Calvin Howell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful ending to the Trilogy, and open to the sequels","review":"This book was an wonderful ending to the Dark Elf Trilogy. It moves into the conflicts Drizzt encounters with the people, the elements, and even himself. Salvator leads the reader into the very depths of Drizzt's soul, as he questions his decision to leave his homeland and how different the surface world truly is. The story follows his thoughts and has so many twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. The only dissapointment I found in the book was I wondered what was to become of the remainder Drizzt's family in Menzoberranzan. Besides that, this has been yet another excellent book from Mr. Salvator."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN interesting Outlook.","review":"Although I have not read Exile or Sojourn I have read Homeland, and thought that it was one of the strangest books that I have ever read.

All the wonder and excitment, all the adventure and scenery, all the characters and dialogue that makes Fantasy so enticing to readers is written at its peak.

No book captures that more than Sojourn. No book probably ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"like the book","review":"Good stuff. A good addition to the story.

Warning, though. There is no Regis. Roddy McDowell (I'm sorry if I got his name wrong.)was my top 3rd favorite charecter. I really liked Montolio the ranger. And, this gives a good moral:Do not think war heroes are good for battles. They have to be good for their courage, love, and understanding. People say R.A. Salvatore's books decline with each passing book. I disagree. I've read 6 of his books, and they don't disband at all. I look forward to reading The Legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak compared to the other books in this series","review":"I would say that this is the worst installment in Salvatore's series so far. Why?The style is too choppy. Scenes that would deserve much more attention - the impact of Kellindil's death, the death of Tephanis - are glossed over and very rushed while other scenes, like the completely nonsensical adventure in the dragon's lair, drag on and on and on.My second complain would be that the book is too preachy. It tries to tell the reader what's right and what's wrong but it's too heavy-handed and definitely not subtle.And the way Bruenor met Drizzt? Well, lets just say that if I read this book before the 2nd trilogy, I wouldn't like the dwarf much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Take A Moment And Listen To This Brother Preach","review":"Brother Ali's EP Champion is that non stop boom bap sound that listeners have been longing for.

Those who accuse its author of slanting history in favour of the \\"loyalist\\" argument disregard the diaparaging, contemptuous even, manner in which the British forces and authorities are depicted, as well as the extent of the atrocities committed by the latter during the campaign. What comes through very clearly is that the hero of the narrative has opted for the unionist camp, not out of love or admiration for the British, but out of fear of a collapse in law and order and stability. From a purely literary point of view, the work is not immune from criticism, and some of the more long-winded passages could well tolerate a modicum of pruning."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Tolstoy?","review":"I'll be brief. I am puzzled by the reader who downgraded Oliver Wiswell for its sympathetic portrayal of middle-class loyalist Americans in the Revolutionary period. Roberts has written sympathetically about all classes in his opus, and Wiswell states frequently in the book that he is, after all, an American. Is that insufficently PC?I've read other books by Kenneth Roberts and continue to read history and biography of the Revolutionary period. Judging by that material, Roberts' insight (remember he wrote over 70 years ago) is astonishing.Although Roberts does not seem to have enjoyed the literary acclaim given Fitzgerald, Faulkner, even Hemingway and the like in contemporary criticism. I believe his works will and should endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my absolute favorite books.","review":"I've read this book twice, and I don't do that often. Incredibly entertaining, and historically informative. You're not sure where the fiction begins and the fact ends. The writing is superior to most books written today. The perspective may be hard for an American who is passionate about their history, but it is a real perspective that was shared by many, and besides his frustration with the Brits...well enough of that. Great book, one the, if not the, best historical fiction I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Wiswell","review":"This book was perhaps one of the most boring I've ever read. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it's a great source of accurate information regarding both sides of the revolutionary war that you would not get from reading a textbook. However, the novel reads like a textbook, following a predictable series of historic facts. The love story in this book is hardly enough to keep someone interested. The side stories are bothersome and unnecessary. This book could have been compressed from the lengthy 783 pages, into a much more managable 300 pages. The wasted adjectives, similes, and series's make me wonder if Roberts had been paid by the word. I wouldn't read this book unless you were required to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed...","review":"I have been a fan for many years.

What I'm wondering after reading Petals On The River is, WHAT HAPPENED? This book was very disappointing. It contained too much whining and too little romance. Also, it was very tedious to hear Shemaine continually referred to as a bond slave, and there was way too much baby talk. The story was predictable and trite, and lacking in humor and suspense. It was difficult to finish the book, but I kept hoping that the story would improve. Unfortunately, even the ending wasn't a surprise. Altogether, this book was a big disappointment.

While a rather small amount of dialouge is fairly unbelievable, and the plot is every ONCE in a while predictable (i.e. you don't have to think to read this book, hence the 8 not 10 ) this is a darling tale of love conquering all.

I had trouble getting past the first couple of chapters. I was expecting much more from this work than what I received. It was a pleasant story, though altogether too drab. The characters were pretty dull, not alot of life to them at all. Shemaine was too meek for her own good and far too afraid of her own shadow.

Unfortunately, this isn't true. Instead, the story simply becomes preposterous. If that weren't enough, Woodiwiss' prose soon becomes painful. Not only is her sentence structure embarassingly incorrect, her language never rises above buzzwords and cliches. Nobody loves a child when they can \\"nurture\\" him, nobody talks when they can \\"communicate\\" and her attempts to give a colonial flavor to the language never rise above substituting 'tis for it's.

I left it midway and even then it was a struggle to reach there! Her recent books deviate from her usual execellent ones and this one was the very worst, never something that I would expect from her. Perhaps her recent divorce (I think I heard something along this line somewhere) is to be blamed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much much better","review":"I've read every novel of Ms Woodiwiss; I have been waiting for years for her new ones and kept looking around for her books whenever I was in a bookshop. And finally, here comes the new novel. But ...I have to agree with the reveiws before me that this one is the least good (I don't want to describe it as the worst) of her works : the story is predictable; nevermind if the story is predictable, but the characters are boring and one-dimensional; I thought there might be more enlightening scenes involving Andrew, the son, but he just played a minor role; the whole plot is just too easy for the characters and not much development. I've to put it down and go to sleep in between the story ('cos I didn't want to fall asleep while reading it : Woodiwiss is my favorite author and I hate doing this to her).Just keep hoping better novels that at least compares to her usual standard would come soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed -- Could have waited longer for her next book","review":"I am a big fan of Ms. Woodiwiss, however, this book was very disappointing. I have read all her books and eager await her novels. This novel lacks any kind of suspense and is very perdictable from the moment you pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: What was the wait for?","review":"I follow several authors of romance novels, and it's been a long wait since the last Woodiwiss novel. I think I would have rather kept waiting than settle for this book, which was very predictable with very little tension or suspense (romantic, sexual, or otherwise). I was originally pleased to see that the book came out as a more affordable trade paperback (rather than a hardcover) but $10 is too much to spend. I'd rather re-read The Flame and the Flower. In short, I was very disappointed in this novel. Frankly, when I finally reached the end, I found I didn't even care what happened to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly formulaic love story.","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Kathleen Woodiwiss's books. Unfortunately, I cannot say that about her latest, \\"Petals on the River.\\" I think what it lacks is sexual tension between the main characters, Shemaine and Gage. I believe sexual tension between the hero and heroine has been one of the primary forces of her books. In this story, there is practically none, and it takes over 300 pages before the main characters make love. I, too, have skipped over chunks of the book I found to be boring. And why did she wait until the last couple of chapters to introduce the Beauchamps? I believe they would have enlivened the book if they had appeared sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss and was looking forward to reading her latest, what a disappointment!

After much anticipation, I couldn't wait to sit down to read it. Unfortunately, I found it predictable and uninspiring. I even skipped whole sections out of sheer boredom and read it just to get it over with rather than out of pleasure. As another reviewer suggested, I too feel that I have outgrown her novels. Whether it is her novel or my growth I leave for you to decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am a long time fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss. I think her best novel was Ashes in the Wind. I was waiting for her new novel to be published and I must say it is very disappointing. I still haven't finished the last 50 pages. I don't understand how such a gifted writer could have missed the mark. The characters were one dimensional and the story was very lame and predictable. There were no surprises or anticipation for the love scenes. I hope this was a fluke and that Ms. Woodiwiss provides her loyal readers with a better story and more well developed characters in her next book. Or she may lose a lot of fans like Patricia Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited five years for this?","review":"after waiting 5 yrs for this I've fallen asleep 6 times while reading it.I've either out grown Woodiwiss or perhaps she should put her pen to bed with her heriones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money or time!","review":"This book isn't remotely worth the high price tag.

Kathleen, get back to your sweeping epics with heroic warriors and strong fiesty heroines!

I bought my 1st romance novel on the recommendation of a friend. I had a preconceived notion of what they were like. Since then I've read 3 and I love them! What I like about this author is the romance, the courting, and the way she describes the seduction. It's not real smutty (like I expected)! I think I'm hooked on them now. I hope this might convince any other 'beginners' to give this author a try. I'm hesitant to add, but it's improved my own sex life - since romance is on my mind so often lately ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have been listening to this book on cassette tape, and the only redeeming quality I could find about it is the narrator. How she managed to breathe life in Shermaine and Gage, I'll never know. But, alas, even the narrator's wonderful way of reading just couldn't get past the words! I found it to be boring and predictable. That is the last Kathleen Woodiwiss book I'll ever buy! Too bad...I loved her previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh.....not the Kathleen I remember","review":"Sorry to say, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. I kept wondering through out the book if this was truly written by Kathleen or by someone else who may have found her notes. Doesn't seem to be Kathleen's style. What a shame if my thoughts are true. It would be a tragedy if someone was trying to fill Kathleen's shoes by writing her ideas, under her name. I hope it's not true. This book was never ending mushy. No action to speak of, no humor, NO EXCITEMENT. Bummer. Still I will keep my copy. I will continue to collect Kathleen's books. They are treasures I hope to pass on to my daughters and granddaughters. Especially the early ones. Thanks Kathleen, for your wonderful stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not one of her best...","review":"I first read THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER in 1971. I was riveted from page one. THE WOLFE AND THE DOVE and SHANNA were also terrific and I've read them countless times. It seems she's gone downhill from there. The one about the Russian princess I didn't even finish. PETALS ON THE WIND has a lot of the same character types as FLAME but was not near as captivating. I kept thinking Roxanne was Louisa. The book is predictable, no real tension even though the main characters lived in the same house and don't make love until 3/4 through the book. She should also try to make her female characters a little more 3-dimensional and realistic. All her heroines lately are petite and the most gorgeous thing walking the face of the earth. No one should be THAT perfect even in literature. She used to be my favorite author, but not any more. Maybe I've outgrown her. (sigh!) I hope THE ELUSIVE FLAME with a grown up Beau will recapture her former glory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS ONE!","review":"This is the first romance novel I have ever read and I thought it was great!

I have been to the places that are mentioned in the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"This was the worst Woodiwiss I have ever read. I really enjoyed her first few novels, and was kept spellbound by them. I have not outgrown Woodiwiss, as I still occasionally re-read her older novels, and still enjoy them. This novel was severely lacking. To me, the characters were cardboard, the storyline very ho-hum. The publishers had to buy this one on name recognition alone. This is the second Woodiwiss I was sorely disappointed with, and has taught me to never again purchase a book of hers without at least reading the first chapter. If I would have done this, I would have saved my money! Doesn't her publisher have readers who pre-read these books before they decide to publish?? I think I will pack my copy up and send it back to them demanding a refund. Sorry Kathleen, but the price was steep and the quality was sorely lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Book since SHANNA!!!!","review":"It was Wonderful! It made me go get my old Woodiwiss books and read them over...I really admire an author who can write a great romance without the use of money, betrayal or greed!!!!

Thank you, Kathleen...you ARE one of the elite!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda lame","review":"This is my first book by K.W. and it may be the last. There were some nice parts, but most times you felt like it was dragging on and on. And why the heck was everybody and their dog trying to kill Shemaine all the time? It became ridiculous after a while. The author could have easily shaved off 75 pages of worthless information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read as if it was right from a romance writing handbook,","review":"instead of the gifted author. I was very disappointed in this latest book compared to earlier ones written. Everything was a little too perfect for the heroine Shemaine. She was just too perfect as a character. (I guess she wouldn't know what a bad hair day was...) The most believable scenes were ones that involved Gage's young son Andrew. Since she dedicated this book to her young grandson Seth then we at least understand why Andrew's words and behavior were realistic although predictable. The book left a bad taste in my mouth, everything fell together too neatly, as though it was wrapped up like a nice clean package. There was absolutely no suspense or guessing or tantalizing chemistry and sex scenes between the characters. I had a hard time visualizing the characters and if that happens it is a sign that the book isn't worth the read. A huge disappointment when compared to what I feel to be her best book \\"A Rose in Winter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book - have everyone by her.

It makes this volume of particular interest to the collector and aircraft hunter.Without being over enthusiastic about the book (I am more a mid level \\"enthusiast\\" looking for plenty of color profile) I find this book a good source to place me in a friendly way at an advanced level in luftwaffe history, and I am grateful for this because it does it totally painlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob is a Beast!","review":"This is the third screenplay of Chris Lindsay that I have had the pleasure of reading. His work is always entertaining and I appreciate how he brings his characters to life. Bob is an evil troll, no two ways about it, and it's hard to find any sympathy for him when everything unravels. On the other hand, it's easy to laugh when divine justice serves him up a plate of just desserts.

Knowing what filters were used to get the picture is helpful if you want to do some experimenting of your own. The only thing I sort of disagreed with was the \\"shoulds\\" and \\"shouldn'ts\\" that the author used. For example, the author mentions that arches should ALWAYS have some sky appear below them so that they look more impressive. I believe that the picture should be an expression of how the photographer wants the image to appear and if that means photographing a subject differently, then so be it.Other than that, it's a very good book to read in order to find some good techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martian Chronicles??","review":"Sure, go ahead, stack a polarizer and enhancer on.

The selections are from many first-rated albums from EMI. Most of them such as duets from \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\", \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\" and \\"Madama Butterfly\\" are very good indeed. However, Gedda is the real star of this album. His duets from \\"The Pearl Fisher\\" and \\"Carmen\\" are among the best on recordings.

But oh what exquisitely lovely melodies coupled with some properly rousing choruses! Although some very fine singers have recorded the Elijah, this one has never been surpassed. Janet Baker has the perfect style for this oratorio, Gedda and Fischer-Dieskau provide beautiful tone with great phrasing and diction and the conductor seems to have an instinct for the right tempos.

Its sad how much has changed since her discovery by Bob Ballard. The book goes into depth through pictures, and artwork of famed painter Ken Marschall. What is happening to the liner is awful.

Many of the photographs seemed very familiar, I was surprised to see so many of things that had somehow survive breaking and kind o depressed to see the signs of collapse that the wreck is now going through.I sure wish I could've seen the movie, hope it comes out on video soon and I'd like to see much more work of this type doen before it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST","review":"This book is a must for any TITANIC collector.

Excellent quality and durability. Best of all each driver has a hollow shaft permitting the tool to drive nuts on bolts up to 3 inches long. A nut driver is so much more convenient to use versus a crescent wrench (adjustable or otherwise) and the hollow shaft extends the utility of these drivers to many applications that would otherwise require a wrench.Two thumbs up! I buy Klein whenver possible!Update:I was recently repairing a leaky toilet and to my delight, the half-inch driver slipped neatly over the bolt used to connect the tank to the bowl. For years, I had been using an adjustable crescent wrench to perform this function. Given the most awkward location of the bolts, the fact that there are TWO and you have to tighten them evenly, this chore was pretty miserable. But, with the Klein nut driver it was a breeze. Easy to place on the nut, doesn't mis-adjust, doesn't slip.The right tool for the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant Go Wrong with klein!","review":"I know klein makes great tools and expected nothing less with these.

Later de Zavala was the first Vice-President of the Republic of Texas.In many ways the book is even more informative than de Tocqeville's \\"Democracy in America\\", although the opinions of the two men are similar about many matters.The translation was only published in 1980 and is out of print.

I've come to the conclusion that people who compare modern bands to the Beatles, need to listen to the Beatles again. Lifting riffs from Beatle tunes does not make a band comparable to the Beatles. And in this case, doesn't even make the tunes catchy. The lyrics are so bad they'll make you turn down the stereo at stop lights and blush. My friend Erik once described some band to me as \\"sounding very Canadian\\", I didn't know what he meant until I heard Sloan. They are very much Canadian, like their predecessors, Grapes Of Wrath, Corey Hart and Loverboy. Very scrubbed, very tidy and very deliberate in their delivery.

In my opinion, this version of Jerry Thomas' book verges on fraudulent. I don't know how in good conscience this publisher (Classic House Books) can put that title on what they have published! First, the drawings in the original are as important to the book as the printed material - and they have left out all the drawings. I believe that omission, by itself, essentially creates a misrepresentation of the original. There were at least two typos in the very short preface, alone - a rather poor reflection on the publisher. I will, from now on, avoid any book published by Classic House Books. I am returning this version of the book for a refund and I have ordered what I hope is a more historically accurate reprint. If you really want to have a reprint of Jerry Thomas' book, get a different version of it; even if you pay a little more for it, at least you will know you have something a little more authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance, so-so sound","review":"Since I like the solemn, slow tempos of the older recordings of this work, this recording is made for order for my taste. But the sound is not too great. There were times when the chorus seemed to have lost their microphones. The tenors in the chorus are often impossible to hear. Also, the trumpets can get a bit shrill in their trill passages, but I've noticed that in lots of other Mass albums (except the first Helmut Rilling album). This is a live 1957 performance: a real historical find, and no audience noise.

Or perhaps it is a mystical appreciation of the One as the Cloud of Unknowing.Trust me on this: when the infamous Karajan alternative from 1974 - the Festival of Soup (Bach: Mass in B minor) - is streets ahead in terms of clarity, presence, diction and the separation of powers, it is time to complain.It is impossible to comment on the mettle of the soloists in this EMI performance. They look B-grade on paper (in a non-perfunctory sense) but perhaps on the day they surpassed themselves or fell to the rung below.

It combines a solid and classic plot with classic plot twists, \\"secret book of strikes,\\" animal form vs. animal form galore, grandmaster vs. grandmaster galore, and some of the most intricate intense kung fu action I have ever seen. Jack Long is fantastic. I remember seeing this film in its theatrical release, in Times Square, NYC as part of a triple bill in the late 70's or early 80's. I sat through 2 other films to see the film TWICE, as did everyone else!

This debut book by McKinna was a treasure find! I am not a diver and did not quite understand all of the diving and sailing stuff but it was a relentless action/adventure story with some good surprises - and I like that! The characters were well written and I felt like I was kind of reading a well made action movie in the tradition of DIE HARD in the diver's seat, so to speak. I like Ben Gannon and his woman Sass, and the cajun friend Rolly was fun to follow. The bad guys were bad and colorful and Sligo was exhausting to read with his constant cocaine snorting and relentless smuggler's smack. The story and action were very fun to read and I already bought the next book - TIGER REEF, and will be reviewing that in about a week. Great debut Mr. McKinna and am looking forward to your next book. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First-Class Thriller Fiction!","review":"Great book from an interesting author!

Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for more","review":"As a writer, I know how hard it is to produce a book, but I couldn't finish this one. Can anyone write about something other than terrorists and drug dealers? How about some pure adventure, no suspense, no intrigue, just a lot of diving, a little fun, maybe some romance (but not essential), and some writing that conveys an author's love of the sea and all that lives in it. Any diver knows there is enough adrenaline in simply going under water, but I guess people who read books and don't dive, they don't have a clue how fascinating and exciting being under water is. They continue to read those pie in the sky Cussler fantasies. Are there any readers who like realism?If I buy another McKinna book, it will be a non-fiction one. I'm tired of fantasies. The real thing is just as exciting, but then I'm spoiled, because I was an oilfield diver too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"This was a great idea for a story. Great potential for theme and plot, etc. But the execution didn't even come close to living up to that potential. The author rambles on and on re-empasizing the same points over and over again, trying to show a theme. The plot is pretty good except that it trails off and the ending is very poor. It is very good about 2/3 through and then it becomes worthless.Now for the incredible \\"what was he thinking?\\" part: the lack of editing. I can't even beleive how sloppy this book is. There are misspelling and errors all over, and in a few parts there are crazy typos such as the letter \\"b\\" being in the middle of a sentence. What is up with that? If you're going to take the time to write and publish a book, edit it for god's sake!

Note to you...there was no Christian Church other than the Christian Church for the first 1000 years.Over and above that, they go on to talk about how James...not Peter...was the head of the church after Jesus left.

She keeps on coming back to that over and over again as though there was a chance that the reader had forgotten her ordeal. The author repeats herself too much and it almost becomes condescending. I'm not an idiot and I do not hava a short-term memory and I do tend to remember what happened 10 to 50 pages earlier in the book, so I would appreciate not being talked down to in this way.The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the first quarter of the book was alright.

I kept hoping it would get better as I read the book but the author kept repeating key events over and over again. Can a person really NOT know who they were for 10 years? The hero was described as being some God in the bedroom who could go for hours and hours and satisfy ANY woman he was with. He's basically a pig who used and abused women shamelessly and then tossed them out after he was through. The heroine only got her memory back once she had some hot sex with her ex-husband???

She couldn't handle this complex and GREAT character but reduces her to a slutty bitch in corsets. (Pardon my language) Maybe it's the script, the actress or the director but with the leading lady of this movie being so horribly miscast the entire movie goes downhill.

Rating this movie 1/5 is a compliment, it is not even worthy to give it 1 after all this cut off. IF you are a history buff, wait till the version that is not by A&E.

Well, I was totally surprised and I thouroughly enjoyed it! The acting was wonderful by the entire cast.I truely cared about the Witting family - how they became a family, and the trials that farm-life in the midwest in early 1900's provided the family. This three-part series was very warming! A definate movie for families, and people who simply enjoy sitting down with a wonderful movie that takes you to another place and time. A series which I really hate to see end.I rented the last in the series first, and promptly went back and rented the first two.

Opinión que comparto plenamente con Lenny."},{"rating":"2","title":"disappointing conducting","review":"Karajan has never been a verdian conductor except Otello perhaps. Here his tempi are so slow that Verdi looks a slow waltz. The singers save the day, Freni is great and so, and maybe more, is Cappuccilli. Very elegant Van Dam as always. Great King Ghiaurov, vocally out of place Raimondi, his voice has no weight to carry the role of the Inquisitor. Carreras has still something left of his unbelievably beautiful voice he squandered irresponsibly in few years,after a more than promising start, Baltsa is less vulgar than in other occasions and she is the weak link here together with Raimondi. Uneven rendition, but Don Carlos is a hugely complex undertaking so all considered 4 stars for the effort of the singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow and too much noise","review":"Le principal problème de cet enregistrement est qu'il juxtapose du très bruyant et de l'inaudible avec une prédilection pour le très bruyant. Les chanteurs sont souvent noyés mais ce n'est finalement pas très grave : trop occupés à sauver leur chant, ils le dénaturent souvent. La jeune Agnes Baltsa évite les gros écueils d'Eboli mais malgré la beauté de son chant, elle est bien désincarnée. Mirella Freni chante cependant un très beau \\"Tu che le vanità\\" et José Van Dam est un très bon moine. À ceci s'ajoute un irrespect des tempi préconisés par Verdi et donc un ralentissement exagéré : le trio des jardins de la reine fait un quart d'heure, l'air d'Élisabeth douze minutes, soit des durées supérieures de 15% à un enregistrement normal. Et puis, c'est encore une version en quatre actes, avec mme quelques coupures. Bref, une version à acheter d'occasion, pour les complétistes."},{"rating":"1","title":"let us hear the singers !!!","review":"A good cast but inaudible because of Karajan's megalomania. The sound, very loud, seems more appropriate for Bruckner or Wagner, than for Verdi. Some orchestral piece or some aria like Elisabetta's \\"tu che le vanità\\" are interesting in Karajan record, but Verdi is often unrecognizable. I bought the Giulini version (EMI, 1970) then and I discover Don Carlos. I apologize for my bad english."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere in between","review":"In the debate that is raging below I'm inclinced to side with the London reviewer, whose opinions certainly aren't uneducated: after all, s/he does not say that the singing is bad, just badly served by the conductor, and it is certainly true that they are hard pressed in the heavy moments even though they sing the lyrical bits beautifully. What is more important in deciding whether this should be a first choice is a point that the reviewer from Colorado does not mention, and that is Karajan's decision to omit the first act thereby losing some great music and making the plot almost unintelligible. A recording that does this can hardly be called 'definitive'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous recording","review":"This recording is in my view the best Don Carlo you can find. Main reason for that is the excellence of all the singers and Karajan's apprehension and comprehesion of the drama. Out of all the existing recordings, this is the only one, where all the performers are at their absolute top in their careers in one of their best roles. Don't hesitate to make this choice, even if it's one of the cheapest one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, polished performance","review":"Don Carlo, one of Verdi's most grand operas, is a mesmeric piece that embodies the incarnation of opera. The Karahan performance is of the \\"revised\\" Don Carlo, shorter therefore than the Giulini one, for example. We hear here Carreras at the summit of his carreer, a young Van Dam, and a warm and feeling Ghiaurov. Mirella Freni handles the harmonic passages as though she were Saville born. Karajan brings out in this performance both the subltle line and the grand scenes, contrasting them with carefully chosen orchestral textures. The CD is clear and free from discernable artifacts."},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought i lived in the south...","review":"I thought I lived in the South, but \\"Junebug\\" has me wondering. Phillip Morris has taken every stereotype of the South, berated his audience with them, and somehow, received critical praise for this brash misrepresentation of everything i've ever loved about the area i've lived in for 26 years. His characters are one-dimensional and ignorant, apparently like most people from the South. I have yet to find anyone from the South who likes this film, yet many friends, whom i've found to be ignorant of the South, love this film. Morris is from Winston-Salem, where the film is set, but i can't imagine him liking high school or his time spent in the area. The people in this film are cowards who cannot see the world outside themselves, and I resent this narrow view being portrayed so all-encompassing. People love Amy Adams performance. I found her performance the most stereotypical and disconcerting. How good can a film be if the people it's about hate it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Arrives Mysteriously to Ruin Your Day","review":"Suddenly, this movie appeared in my life. I don't remember ordering it -- or even receiving it, but one day I found that it had been sitting on my nightstand for over a month.I wish I had never seen it.Junebug doesn't really have a story. It's a mishmash of incoherent anecdotes that are loosely related to the story of a highfalutin' Chicago art broker visiting rural North Carolina. I'd love to say that there are a few humorous scenes with this formula, but there are not.Characters? No one is likable. No one is relatable. There are no discernible motives for anything that any one does. There's just nothing here.Plot? Nope. There are a few central themes, but they're lost in the shuffle of \\"y'all\\" jokes and Amy Adams blathering on about nothing. That pretty much sums it up.I would advise you to avoid this movie, but as I said earlier, it's just liable to show up at your house unannounced. Send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Dreary","review":"This film is grossly over rated. I could not wait to see it and now that I have, I want the time back. Amy Adams is truly delightful and brings the only light to this otherwise dreary and depressing film. Another dysfunctional family piece that ultimately takes us nowhere.

A week in the life of...? I agree that McAdams stole every scene she was in, but really there was nothing else going on-so how hard was that? Sure the director and cinemetographer captured the stillness of a country town. Bravo. But call me picky, I do like my films to have a point. A plot. A theme-something. I come away from this with more questions than answers. The main one (because there's plenty of them.) What was the deal between George and Johnny? Overall, the movie was a little too slow for my taste and I would have preferred our main characters to have some kind of character arch or growth after this experience-especially since this was aiming to be a character movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I was an extra in this film, and agreed to do that before having read the script.

I highly recommend this movie for all, and especially for those in the south. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...","review":"This film is so unique and yet so typical. The story delves into the lives of a son who left home to become successful to the resentment of his other non-book smart brother. Showing the delicate lives we weave with our families and our careers, the director articulates these complexities via humor, sadness, and hope. It was amazing how involved I got with the jealous brother--a sign of great acting and directing.This movie really is a must see. My wife and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum on what we like in movies and we both agreed that this movie was great.

She is clueless about Deep South's codes of conduct as if she was an anthropologist discovering a lost tribe in the Amazons. Commonplace shots of American independent cinema are scattered here and there, like arbitrarily sustaining a setting for a lot of precious seconds or making use of off-screen sound only as a trick. Who cares about this? Only a beautiful chatterbox saves the day... (in fact, it looks like a lot of those Southern women are really pretty)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Because This Is An Indie Film Doesn't Make It Good","review":"As a North Carolina resident, I was especially excited to view this film. Unfortunately, I was exceedingly disappointed. Not only was I frustrated with the movie, but also with the overwhelming positive reaction to this poorly constructed film. I attribute this positive response to the ignorance of those who think that because a film is produced outside of Hollywood, it is subject to different criteria. The movie, beyond being a complete waste of my time, contains no sympathetic characters, no real plot, and is only a superficial and vacuous portrait of some superficial and vacuous people. Remember this, fair movie renters, the term \\"Indie\\" is not equivalent to words like \\"quality,\\" \\"creative,\\" or \\"worth-watching.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This was a disappointing, unsatisfying, ludicrous, and boring movie. I hated it. I wish I could demand my money back, as well as the time I spent watching it. Others have already detailed some of the many faults of the movie so I won't waste any more time on that. I don't know if anyone has pointed out that one of the ludicrous things about this movie is the \\"artwork\\" that Madeline was so eager to get her hands on. I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but I'm pretty sure that no one would ever get rich selling that particular crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perverted","review":"I know filmmakers have lowered their standards, but Junebug was perverted and insulting. Several scenes prominently feature odd uses of sex. Early on, a husband fingers his wife while he's driving. Ab artist in the film paints pictures of giant penises and castrated men with blood pouring out. On top of that, the movie makes all southerners out to be dumb, religious hicks. I'm not a southerner and don't care much for the south, but even I thought it went too far. I only wish I could get that 1.5 hours I spent watching Junebug back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I have never been inspired to write a review of anything in my life, but I have been so confused ever since I've seen this movie. I just don't see the value or the purpose of this movie. Not that all movies should have a purpose, but they should be entertaining at the least. It had so many opportunities to make some poignant statements, or to throw a kink at you, but it just didn't do anything. Nothing was revealed; it didn't even want to make me wonder. I kept thinking that the editors left all the good footage and storyline on the cutting room floor. I don't get it. Amy Adams was terrific, and it might be worth seeing just to see her act out her character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"I had high hopes for this movie...it was terrible!

The performances are subtle and engaging with glimpses of genius. Sounds good right? All of this is rendered irrelevant by the last line of the film. The time and emotion invested watching Junebug is lost in a matter of seconds. I was left bewildered, even angry at what appears to be a faliure in screenwriting. Perhaps someone else could comment to enlighten me regarding the director's/writer's overall intentions. If indeed the last line of dialouge is meant to challenge the viewer's assumptions about the themes in the film, then my opinion is that it missed the mark and detracts from the power of the the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen!","review":"Granted, I manage to avoid even watching most stinkers. But this one reeled me in ('scuse the pun): I usually really like independent films, and I had high hopes for this one based on the other reviews. But I found it a depressing, total waste of time. The movie drags, the plot never resolves, and the minimal message it seeks to convey (families: we love 'em, we hate 'em, why doesn't anyone ever talk about anything?) has been better portrayed in many other movies. Skip this one and get Crash or Memento (or the original Manchurian Candidate) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much.

While both aircraft had great potential, each aircraft had problems in development; the Me 163 in particular was an inherently dangerous aircraft due to the fuel it used. Though each aircraft achieved some success, the effect they had on the air war was minimal.As with other volumes in the series, the book is a combination of narrative, including first-hand accounts of flights and combats, dozens of photos including rare color shots and over 20 color profiles by Creek and Tom Tullis.Very nicely done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagjwaffe V5 Jet Fighterws and R9ocket Interceptors","review":"If your interested in this luftwaffe aircraft,It is must to get.A true Collectors Book,Very Informative.Not Much info on luftwaffe officers involved.Statatiscs are bare mininum.But good pics"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jets!!","review":"Another excelent book showing the final years of the war with the jets like Me 163, He 162 and Me 262, have a lot of drawings and photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different!","review":"If you want to listen to something different in a good way, this is for you.

Although this may have been true to life for that era of time, there is definitely nothing enjoyable about reading so much detail about so much misery. When a person is reading a fiction series, at least I for one want it to be an enjoyable read, even if the subject matter is serious. It could have been written as historically accurate without continual devastating events one on top of the other. I also started losing track of the characters, there were so many and they just sort of get all jumbled in the mix.

I found my brother's old 70's field manual to be more helpful than anything else available (I stress OLD because new ones rely on pre-manufactured things like tents, sleeping bags, dried foods, etc.). Just what is a 2007 Boy Scout supposed to do in a TRUE emergency without access to those things? An old manual would have the answers--how to build shelter, hunt/prepare/store food, leave signs and trails, and how to disappear when needed--and how to do these things FROM SCRATCH!I, for one, don't see the need to buy this book.

Lombard is at her ditzy best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A William Powell Classic that had a superior release","review":"I rented this at a video store that had the Criterion DVD version,based on reviews it is the best print, and I can verify that. I liked & enjoyed this film,its not my favorite Powell film,but I like William Powell so I decided to buy it. It is a fun classic movie, but I do like the Thin Man series better as well as Evelyn Prentice. He plays a forgotten man who thanks to Carole Lombard becomes the family butler. And what a looney tunes family it is. And he is more than just another butler. I liked the cast in this and this is about a bunch of rich snobs that again proves money doesnt mean a happy peaceful family. If you like William Powell like I do,Id rent it, but I would only rent it if you get rent the Criterion DVD and not the Madacy version. The Criterion transfer is superb and supplements are also satisfactory. Well worth the money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, all around --","review":"Somewhat odd combination -- depression-era realities and politics, with screwball comedy.

The over-acting of the family that hires Godfrey, even in a comedy, appear to be caricature's of a Marxist fantasy of wealthy life. The shrill, psychotic characters might be funny, I guess, in another era... I found it grating, boring, and childish.

I am very familiar with this movie as I own a VHS copy, so I immediately noticed the missing scene.

The sound, sensible, and (just about) believable storyline is excellently acted by very good actors.Being made well before the art of 'screen effects' had reached the present high level, one has to make allowances, but the all round quality of this movie is abundantly clear.Lovers of 'modern' action movies, slick productions and/or suspense movies, will not find this to their taste. We 'old timers' lap this sort of movie up!! So will all true lovers of good movies.Powell is superb and Lombard excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe Amazon is selling this!","review":"This \\"remastered\\" edition came WITHOUT shrink wrap and it had a clearly photocopied cover.

That could be a fault with this specific disc, but still highly frustrating.I chose this version based on others reviews and was very dissappointed. Definitely not worth $19.95, or even $1 in my opinion. I really can't believe Amazon is selling a DVD like this.If you really like this movie bite the bullet and get the Criterion version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyones Man of the Hour","review":"I adore this movie. I have it in a very poor copy and this one is significantly better. You cannot improve upon the rags to riches to, oops, never were any rags it just seemed that way, theme. My man Godfrey has a tale to tell, tells it wisely and with wit and leaves you wanting nothing more. Satisfying, just as a movie should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smile from ear to ear!","review":"This movie ranks as one of my favorite Lombard pictures.This movie is extremely well cast, the sets are beautifully done, and the story is very entertaining. I found myself with an unquenchable thirst for more Lombard after seeing My Man Godfrey. I knew before seeing this movie for the first time that Lombard and Powell were ex spouses to each other during this filming. I honestly thought that would carry over in the movie, considering how tumultuous a divorce could be but I was completely wrong. They were two peas in a pod.This movie is one of the main reasons I prefer Old Hollywood black and white to today's Hollywood trash.

It would have gotten five stars, but the DVD is taken from an incomplete dupe. The results are, to say the least, virtually unwatchable. Hope is on the horizon; Universal has struck new 35mm prints from the original negative, and it's playing right here in Philly.

Quality is not markedly better than my old VHS version, and it is *missing a scene* which is in the VHS version (where Powell kicks Lombard out of his room, telling her that as his \\"sponsor\\" it will reflect badly on her, and thus on him...). This is particularly annoying bacause the later interchange between Lombard's character and Molly (the cook) makes reference to Powell's action, which on the DVD version now has no context. Very disappointing, since this is such a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but bad DVD!","review":"\\"My Man Godfrey\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies. But check your TV listings and record it from the TV. It will be one of the rare times when a late-night TV rerun gives you a more complete movie and better quality than the DVD. This DVD has at least one missing scene. One very important scene is when Irene goes to Godfrey's room and Godfrey tells Irene that she must never enter the butler's room again. This is a crucial scene because later when there is jewelry missing everyone rushes into Godfrey's room, but Irene stands outside at the doorway. Another bad thing about the DVD is the picture is all washed out. This very excellent five-star movie is a 2-star DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!","review":"We purchased this item for a Christmas present for a family member.

The acting by all the cast was tops. I have not seen Universal's 1958 version with David Niven and June Allyson to be able to compare the two. It is not yet available on DVD.William Powell is a very polished actor with a very pronounced speaking voice. He is always a delight to watch, especially in Mr Roberts.

And the sight of American soldiers carrying dinimutive Chinese soldiers on their shoulders, or Gracie Fields singing a lighthearted novelty number about shooting down \\"Jap\\" planes (followed, oddly enough, by \\"The Lord's Prayer\\"), pretty much invalidates any claim this movie has to being of any value to anyone.

Second season was lousy.","review":"I watched it as a kid and again as an adult. The first season was great relative to other science fiction shows at the time. In fact, I can't think of a better sci-fi series back in the 70s. The first season, was well written and made the assumption that the viewers had some brain cells. Some episodes were very intense and creative. One episode that comes to mind, is the \\"Dragon's Domain\\" which was very scary, horrifying and tragic (by 70s standard). The Second season was a creative disaster. I had read somewhere that American producers got their hand's on the show and decided to dumb it down for American audiences. Too bad, because it could have been to the 70s what Battlestar Galactica has been to this past decade -- something well written and intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"THANKS A&E FOR PUTTING SPACE 1999 ON DVD!THE FIRST EPISODE GETS THE WHOLE SHOW STARTED WITH THE MOON BLASTING OFF INTO SPACE AND I LOVED THE ZOMBIE LIKE ASTRONAUTS IN THIS EPISODE TOO! SET 1 ALSO HAS CHRISTOPHER LEE AND EPISODES LIKE 'BLACK SUN' WHICH SIMULATE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON QUALITY LSD. THINGS DRAG AT TIMES AND I WISH THE ZOMBIE LIKE ASTRONAUTS IN THE FIRST EPISODE ACTUALLY ATE THEIR VICTIMS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I'M REAL HAPPY WITH THIS SET. GREAT SHOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2001 A Space Odyssey The Series","review":"Previous to ordering this boxed set I had never seen Space 1999. I had heard of it, however, and was intensely curious. If you liked the special effects and character quality of 2001 A Space Odyssey, then this is the series for you. The show has a reasonable amount of 70's style special effects and the story outlines aren't too bad. However, all the characters are completely emotionless and flat. These are the least character driven stories I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Notwithstanding the other reviews...","review":"...which point out the cool special effects, great imaginative story lines and fancy spacecraft, I felt badly let down by the production quality of the DVDs. The content is wonderful, but the transfer was shoddy.Space: 1999 was originally filmed in England, using film stock at 25fps. It has been converted to the US NTSC standard (29.97fps) which in most cases is not a problem, but during action sequences or any time there is a lot of movement on screen, you get a very distracting shudder to the image. This makes it quite uncomfortable to watch, which is a shame, because the Space 1999 stories were great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe and mystery","review":"I maintain a great deal of awe and respect for the originality and production values of this series. I have never before, or since, viewed a series that so effectively captures the awe, the grandure and the mystery of being in space. If you are looking for bubblegum Sci-Fi this is not it. Space:1999 is as intelligent as it is artistic as it is original. At last a format (DVD) deserving of this spectacular series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"I wanted a book that would help me with at-home handyman jobs that my husband did and did not teach me how to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book by a top Bayesian decision theorist","review":"Jim Berger is well known for his work in decision theory, Bayesian methods amd his texts on these subjects.

One of the brief stories within the book is called \\"The sparkle from eternity that takes a story from the life of Jesus and brings it to a modern form and causes you to do some serious soul searching and can change the way you look at life and death.

This book puts Jesus death and resurrection in language and thoughts we can under today without losing the biblical meaning. He creates a clear picture and stirs up emotion. Most of the time he brings in someone else's point of view that maybe you hadn't thought of. I highly recommend this book, I read it every Easter."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"A wonderful book for anyone.

If you're fond of disco/dance music of quality, you better own this record. Change is undeniably the best in their segment. It's intensive, it is musical (I mean harmonical y rhythm), it is love, it is even poetical.The Very Best Of Change is about the very best of music of the early eighties. It is a statement of art.I love every minute of this record. And you will, too.Now, guy, do you want to seduce this lady that has you suffering with a lack of attention?Put on this record, and, like me, you'll end up in her bed, which in this context, is like being in heaven.Please take the time to check out: MIRACLES, THE GLOW OF LOVE, SHARING YOUR LOVE, THIS IS YOUR TIME, all of them great records of the 80's.Enjoy!

It is well worth the asking price.l."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tail good enough for any literary connoisseur","review":"I read the classics--Conrad, Bronte', London and Homer, but Howard has nailed a classic story here. The sheer visual force of the images of palaces, monsters, and strange people make you feel like you're actually there. It is a weird story about two penniless adventurers that traverse an endless forest only to find a seemingly abandoned palace. It is full of insane people, however, where nobody is safe. It's such a refreshing read! It's free--enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Conan","review":"Great read. Been reading Conan adventures for years and have not discovered this till today. Highly recommend this for anyone who likes barbarians, women who needs saving,fights, monsters, and of course wizards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I am a fan of Conan, but I found Red Nails to be dark (literally and figuratively), hard to follow, and a little confusing. Not much 'swashbuckle' for a Conan work. I would definitely not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great surrounds","review":"I bought these to be the surround speakers in my home theater system & definitely made a good choice. My speakers are all Polk Monitor series tied to an Onkyo HT-SR875 Receiver (also awesome). The thing that really stands out is how absolutely clear and pure the sound is from the Polk speakers. When watching movies - the soundtrack sizzles and the dialogue is crystal clear. While watching the Superbowl - I heard this funny popping noise coming from the opposite side of the room from me -and then realized I was hearing someone at the game, sitting by a microphone and applauding. Clear as a bell.I don't think I would like these as well for a dedicated bookshelf stereo speaker - they reproduce mid to high range well, but don't have much bass response. Paired with larger front speakers, a center channel and a good subwoofer, they help create a really terrific home theater experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe S","review":"I have the Polk Monitor 60s in the front and the 40s in the rear. With this arrangement I hear subtle sounds/notes in music/details I never heard before for the same music I have listened to for years. The speakers have great clarity and sound reproduction and do not sound muddy or have distortion. The bass might be a little low. However I increased the bass setting on the reciever and do not miss much. Maybe in a year or two I will add a subwoofer and the CS2 center speaker. Basically I gained more clarity and accuracy of sound. I might have tried the Monitor 70s for the front if I had to do it all over again and noticed the price I could ahve gotten them for from AMAZON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair speakers","review":"I bought these because reviewers said they sounded good. They sounded hollow to me, so I returned them."},{"rating":"2","title":"MR QUICK / RICH SOUND","review":"I ONLY PURCHASED THESE BOOKSIZE SPEAKERS BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE THE LARGE VERSION /MONITOR 70 THE SPEAKERS CAN BE USED WITH ANY MAIN SYSTEM I TESTED THEM WITH A 1500 WATT AMP BEFORE PLACING THEM IN MY BEDROOM THE SOUND IS JUST AS BIG AS THEIR BIG BOTHERS. I NEED TO MENTION THEY ARE VERY BIG BOOKSIZED SPEAKERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a good speaker but.....","review":"Right out of the box, one of the speaker's woofers had a rattling sound like it was defective. While this does happen on occasion, it is unreasonable that the customer should have to pay for return shipping on a defective item. This has to be changed. Return shipping for these speakers are 40% of the cost of the speakers.This will prevent me from ordering big ticket items from Amazon in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source of info","review":"Obviosly well researched with good photos. Beats the hell out of Cunningham's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"351 Cleveland","review":"This is a collection of old hot rod magazine articles and as such is verrry old and dated material. Most of it is available on line. A lot of the photos are poor quality Xerox copies taken from the original magazine articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book on the 351C","review":"If you're looking for some interesting articles on the 351 Cleveland engine this is an excellent book. While there is nothing recent in the book there is still a great deal of information about the 351 C and it's development as a racing engine for Pro Stock and Nascar circle track use. Getting to see some of the techniques used by Bud Moore back in the days when Nascar stock car racing used production based engines was really very interesting.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally Good, but kind of uneven","review":"Yulduz Usmanova has a nice mix of traditional Uzbek rythms and more modern techno-type stuff in her music. Most of the times she makes it work, although as someone who is not a fan of Tak Boom I have to say it's not a universal. Some interesting political commentary in this album, particularly given that she was in virtual exile from Uzbekistan for a while, then was invited back and is now a member of the Oliy Majlis.For people who are unfamiliar with Central Asian music the mix of more Western sounds (even some English) with the traditional Uzbek instruments and sounds is an excellent introduction; far better than, say, heading straight into mugam music or a more hard-core Central Asian sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thunderbirds are go","review":"Fantastic, a wonderful walk down memory lane for me and the best three hours I've spent in a long time. If you like Wallace and Gromit, chances are you'll see that a lot of the gags came from this series. Hopefully the remainder of the episodes will also be released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A lot of Fun!. I remembered when I was a kid, and spent a lot of time enjoying the series. Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"How cool is this?","review":"I bought Box set 1 and 2, and although there aren't many extras on the DVD's, the episode were really great! For 1975 it really had pretty good effects and interesting plots. The actors are good, and come on, it's so cool to see a futuristic space show with analog clocks, bell bottom pants, and pre-mousse hair styles!!!What a fun ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious...","review":"I bought this book because the consumer reviews were quite positive and because it seemed to fit the self-help profile I was looking for. I was disappointed to discover after reading only a few pages, God, the Lord, and spirituality became such a large part of the material. Had I known that there would be discussion of God in helping understanding emotional problems, I would not have purchased....Just a fair warning to the non-religious or non-believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Coming of Age Tales","review":"It's a great story about the coming of age of two males - 12 year old Marcus, son of a weird, New Age London mom - and Will, 36 year old bachelor boy living off his father's royalties for a notorious Christmas jingle. It is unclear which is the more mature as Will joins SPAT (Single Parents, Alone Together) in order to meet hot chicks. In the process he invents an imaginary son, wife and hilarious circumstances. While on a SPAT picnic he meets Marcus and despite themselves, they become close.Summary - Fiona (Marcus's mom) tries to commit suicide, Marcus struggles to stay upbeat despite the attempt and his daily torments at school. At least he meets and falls for an older teen girl who has her own problems and in the end all concerned manage to work out there problems and procede to the next stage of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"About a Boy","review":"In the novel \\"About a Boy\\" Nick Hornby presents the friendship between the 36-year-old Will and a young teenager who is called Marcus.Will enjoys his carefree single-life and besides he is very trendy and cool. Normally he spends his time watching TV and listening to music.Marcus appears to be the complete opposite. He is bullied at school because of his strange outward appearance and behaviour. After meeting each other in a park their lives start changing completely.We read this novel in our English class and we enjoyed being confronted with this humorous and interesting story. Especially, we liked Will's jokes and his provokative way of speaking.In our opinion this book is definitely worth reading. Be it at home or at school.Steffi Bolz and Julia Busche"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book is Good...","review":"...but I like the movie better. The story centres on Will Freeman a 36 year old bachelor and Marcus the 12 year old who befriends him. From their interactions, they learn from one another and mature into an adult and a teenager respectively.Nick Hornby is a great author, and I loved \\"High Fidelity,\\" and I have picked up \\"Fever Pitch.\\" The movie based on \\"About A Boy,\\" condenses the best scenes and one-liners from the book, and lets remarkable actors like Hugh Grant, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz and newcomer Nicholas Hoult play out Will, Fiona, Rachel, and Marcus as full-bodied characters. I usually prefer books to their movie counterparts, but this, I concede, is an exception to the rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unraveling of a Stoical Man","review":"My friend has told me that there is no such word as \\"stoical\\" - I contend that if that is true, there is at least a beautiful and poignent description of my made up word found in Will and Marcus. On the surface it seems like a \\"coming of age\\" story concerning a 36-year-old man and a 12-year-old boy, but deep down there seems to be a undercurrent of someone struggling to understand what it means to feel and to live with people in community and to lvoe them through their messy moments and their bright spots as well. It's a well-written and funny book worth the time and joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Funny Story","review":"About A Boy is a touching and funny story about Marcus (12) and Will (36), two British males who act each other's ages. When they meet each other amid a drama that is both serious and humorous at once, they help each other to learn to act their own ages. The story is woven well by Hornby, who comes up with the goods again, creating characters that you care about and interesting, humorous sub-plots that push his general theme along it's way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up to \\"High Fidelity\\"","review":"Being a music obsessed geek, \\"High Fidelity\\" is, naturally, one of my favorite books of all time and while \\"About a Boy\\" couldn't have possibly been as powerful, I enjoyed it nearly as much. A funny and charming story to begin with but I thought that the incorporation of the Nirvana stuff was a stroke of genius. I'm sure that critics will eventually begin griping about how *all* of Hornby's books are about immature, pop music and/or sports obsessed men in their 30's but Hornby is to the immature, pop music and/or sports obsessed men in their 30's genre (if you can call it that) what John Grisham is to earnest legal thrillers or Danielle Steele is to trashy soap operas."},{"rating":"2","title":"great british humor","review":"I really liked this book-it didn't try to be too dramatic or emotional, but it was touching anyway. It was a different plot with original characters, and it was one of the VERY FEW books that actually made me laugh out loud-Hornby really has a way with words, and as an american, i found the british expressions invigoratingly fresh!! A great, lighthearted yet touching book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"If High Fidelity burst on the scene like a great first album - say the first Clash record, then About a Boy is the more developed later effort - 'London Calling' maybe. Both books are terrific in their own right and deserve all the praise they are receiving.It will be difficult to cast a young actor to play 12 year old Marcus in the movie version of About a Boy. The kid's character is fascinating and complex in the book, but I'm afraid Hollywood will just go for some Macaulay Culkin type and miss the whole point.Reading About a Boy is time well spent. It makes one eager for Hornby's next book and to see how his literary style continues to evolve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly NOT a book worth reading","review":"Nick Hornby clearly can't write. You can't 'feel' the characters of this book. They seem to have a very contradictory personality, and you have the impression that Hornby himself doesn't seem to know whom he is describing. At times the hero is a bored middle age man, and the next paragraph he is a dynamic young man with an exciting personality.A shame, because the story could be interesting. A fascinating subject ruined by lack of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly, highly overrated.","review":"Nick Hornby writes reasonably well, and the premise of About a Boy is, in theory, promising. However, the characters come across as flat and fairly unconvincing, and the effect of the novel does not do justice to the potentially great themes contained therein. It seems fitting that Hornby's books become popular movies; they are quick and dirty entertainment, which is fine, but I would not call this a powerful, or even very interesting, work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"I found a hardcover of About A Boy in a remaindered bin, and bought it hoping I would soon discover what all the hype was about re. High Fidelity. I hope that High Fidelity is much better than About A Boy, because this novel was utterly lacking in positive qualities. The best that I can say about it was that it was occasionally amusing. On the whole, it was a disappointment. I was not interested in any of the characters. The writing style was high schoolish, with an even lower vocabulary level. The brushes with suicide were poorly done, and at the end of the novel I was so fed up I just skimmed through the last forty odd pages to see if there was anything worth reading. There wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaing read","review":"If your looking for something filled with deep meaning perhaps this isn't for you, but if you want a book written with wit, humour and a simple message About A Boy is for you.The story line is predictable at time, and I only read the book after seeing the movie to see what changes had been made, but I won't go into them as they are fairly minor.Hornby offers an interesting tale of two unlikely soles who cross paths, and find themselves entwined, despite the efforts of one to get rid of the other, and in the end they challenge each others perseptions about life.A fun fast entertaing read that is sure to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amusing read","review":"I wasn't expecting this to be an analytical and introspective book, but it was. Some parts of that kinda slowed the story down sometimes, but for the most part, this was an enjoyable read. There were quite a few amusing parts, which I enjoyed. The relationship between do-nothing Will and picked-on Marcus develops into a strange father-son, older brother-younger brother type thing, but in the end it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"About a boy","review":"Hallo !!!!I read the book \\"About a boy \\" for school, and now I can say it is really interesting to read it. The book shows very good the different kinds of people and how they behave. The main aspects concerning the novel: friendship, problems and music are shown clearly and the reader gets involved.Based on all the reviews posted here, I realized that the book was probably a fuller version of the charecters in the Hugh Grant movie.But as I already said,in my opinion Nick Hornbey created a very absorbing novel. It is worth to read it and I can advise it to everybody, succeeds in fascinating the reader on each of the 320 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive and hilarious!","review":"From 8:15 yesterday morning my eyes had been glued to this novel. I loved it. Conversations between personas, especially Will and Marcus, are so quirky and make you laugh out loud. Nick Hornby's characters are vivid and alive. The events throughout the reading can be so horrifying, pleasing and hilarious. During the last twenty four hours my parents had to suffer my reading the best parts of the book to them. I was scared that maybe towards the end of the book I would get tired of everything, but unlike most books read in a short period of time, I didn't. It all went quickly and easily like the breeze. I recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"A good book, will have you laughing in recognition and embarassment as did \\"High Fidelity\\". Thoroughly enjoyable. And to the person who claims it's derivative of \\"This Boy's Life\\" by Tobias Wolff - I suggest you actually _read_ \\"This Boy's Life\\". The only similarity between the two stories is that they are both narratives represented by ink glyphs on oblong pieces of wood pulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy follow-up to High Fidelity","review":"\\"About A Boy\\" is a very good read. The humor and easy writing style make for entertaining reading. Hornby's characters are more recognizable than any other authors I've been reading. I even see a bit of myself in some of them. I look forward to the next one, as I did after reading \\"High Fidelity\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad second novel","review":"While this sophomore effort isn't quite as funny as his first novel, the story is more engrossing, and its characters more charming. I actually preferred this to High Fidelity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and engaging","review":"A thoroughly un-likeable character has an opportunity to redeem himself, unbeknownst to him, in this novel by Nick Hornby. I love writers who can make me laugh out loud, especially while reading on a crowded bus in midtown Manhattan during rush hour, and Hornby is no exception. Read it fast before the movie is released and you will forever be equating Will with Hugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Hornby always has insights","review":"This book again is a prime example of Nick Hornby's ability to render a realistic character and write with insight. Through out this book, the character grew in engaging ways. Nick Hornby writes with sensitivity and insight into the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"About so many boys..","review":"What a delightful exploration of how a thirty-something (can't remember exactly how old) boy turns into a man. This book draws the lives of the two main characters together and shows how they develop through their interaction. Nick Hornby writes in a simple yet not patronising manner, and takes the reader on an interesting, fun, enlightening journey. BUT please don't take my word for it... have a read, and a laugh :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"S-U-P-E-R-B-E !","review":"Nick Hornby nous donne, avec son troisieme livre, sa vision de l'homme contemporain, et de ses problemes de maturité; qu'il ait 12 ou 36 ans. J'ai littéralement devoré ce livre en une journée; meme s'il est tres différent, il m'a procuré autant de plaisir que \\"Haute Fidelité\\". Qui d'entre nous, Messieurs, ne se reconnait-t-il pas (a un moment ou un autre) dans la description empreinte d'humour et de réalisme que fait Nick Hornby ? Pas étonnant que Robert DeNiro en aie acheté les droits pour le cinéma ! Un grand livre, un fabuleux auteur...dont j'attends avec grande impatience le prochain roman !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! About a Boy is a great read!","review":"The book focuses on a relationship between a cool-obsessed 36 year old, Will and a not-so-cool 12 year old, Marcus. The book follows each seperately and Hornby does a great job of developing his charcters. Definitely worth reading no matter if you are 15 or 115!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I love everything that Nick Hornby creates (so far), but this book is exceptional. It is extremely funny, sometimes darkly so, well-written, and engaging. I actually read it twice in one week - it is rare for me to read ANY book twice, much less in the same week. It is that wonderful. Hornby's treatment of the quirky relationship between a 36-year old man and a rather lost boy is both humourous and heart-wrenching at turns, and deserves to be read by all. I cannot reccommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read!","review":"I am ashamed to say that I did not read \\"About a Boy\\" until I heard about the movie. However, I did read the book before seeing the movie. I highly recommend this novel. ... Everyone remembers what it was like to be an awkward kid who didn't really know who they were outside of their parents. Not to give too much away but, the suicide of Kurt Cobain is mentioned in the book and how it affects one character.... READ THIS BOOK!Trust me, you will not be sorry for an instant. In short it is about being human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable!!","review":"This is the story of a boy and a man (sometimes I'm not sure which is which) who are trying to find their place in the world. I've not laughed out loud this much while reading a book in quite some time. Mr. Hornby has done remarkable job of getting the right voice for each of his characters. I work with kids Marcus' age and he is right on. This is the first of Hornby's works I've read but it won't be the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This book probably offers better insight into the workings of the male mind than many a pop-psyche guide.Will, somewhat typical of the detached male, is caught between an attraction to the opposite sex and an inability to make any sort of commitment. In a creative attempt to meet women, and to achieve some sort of heroic status as a 'good guy', he poses as a single parent with an absent small child,and turns up to a meeting of the local group SPAT - Single Parents Alone Together.The tangled web of deceit generates not only many tensely amusing situations but also leads him to some sort of redemption. A marvelous read with some really perceptive observations of the contemporary dating scene, and the lives of single parents and children. I rate it better than High Fidelity, which possibly appeals more to male readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific follow-up to High Fidelity","review":"A wonderful story about two very different people -- one, a 12-year-old sheltered boy, the other, a 30-something avoider of life -- who come together and somehow learn enough from each other to improve themselves. By the end, one has lowered his walls and become engaged in life, the other hardens himself and becomes more respected by those around him. As with all of Hornby's writing, there is a great deal to laugh about in this book. But it is a more self-revelatory laugh, one in which you may not be laughing so much at the book's characters, as you are in recognizing one's own failings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Paced Read","review":"This book was hilarious. The characters were amazing. Most importantly, it was a fast read. I went on vacation and needed something for the plane and this was perfect. I read it practically from start to finish, and I loved every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"About a boy, or about a man?","review":"A very well written book projecting the evolving relationship between a boyish man and a manish boy in modern England and the way they help each other realize their own selves.Will, leading a (what many men would think) perfect life, not having to work but still being able to enjoy it, with his fancy car and yappie ways encounters a boy way beyond his (and his own) years.They both find new things about life and about themselves and they build this amazing and unbelievable at first friendship.A light, pleasant read, recommendable to spend the warm/hot days of the summer with...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though I loved Hi Fidelity, I liked this book better since","review":"it deals with the very real issue of single motherhood. As a single mom to a teen aged son I got a lot out of this. I actually dated \\"nice\\" guys like Will . The attitude surrounding Parenthood also smacks true. Nick Hornbys second novel might be a far reach for some but I highly reccomend it for single Moms & other parental types .... The right sneakers ARE important. My only crticism is that Hornby needs to stretch his perspective on women a bit. I only found one female character realistic & well drawn ...Ellies Mom... This woman is more typical of the woman I know & so I guess I am prejudiced... More Like her!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read; real substance beneath the comic surface","review":"A refreshing look at the business of growing up, for a twelve year old, and a thirty something.

I did enjoy it,I thought Hugh Grant and all the others were very well-cast and so I kept picturing when reading the book. This book is touching without being sappy and funny in a knowing way,Like the line about being able to date a typical pre-teens bedroom within a 24 hour time-frame(too true!) It even made a dead duck seem funny without being in bad taste. It also had a real feeling of London city life. All in all,an entertaining book about a man's(finally) growing up helped in part by his unlikely friendship with an eccentric 12 year old boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guys, Unmasked","review":"About a Boy By Nick HornbyIf you've ever wondered what it's like to just be a guy, Hornby is the man you need to read. Light enough to read on the beach, but brilliant enough that your brain won't atrophy. Hornby's hero starts out as nothing but an aging slacker on the make, and inadvertently becomes a good guy. A great gift for guys of all kinds, single mothers, and anyone who wants a romping good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to more from Nick Hornby","review":"I couldn't wait to pass this one on to my book buddies. It's full of wit and plenty of character development - two things I treasure in a good book.What I really enjoy about Hornby's writing is the unexpected details he brings to his characters. For example, his description of Marcus' mother, Fiona, as being a woman who sings songs with her eyes closed, is like a mini-biography. I found this same distinction to his writing in High Fidelity as well, and it really added to the characterizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart as Hell...","review":"About a Boy is smart and bouyant-- relaxed and funny. Excellent reading on many levels. Hornby touches on both primal fear and unremitting joy, genuine curiosity and bold perception. What else could you possibly ask for from a writer? Loved it to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing follow up to an incredible debut.","review":"About a Boy was extremely anticipated after reading Hornby's first novel, High Fidelity. I had picked up High Fidelity on a hunch an was amazed. Never before had I identified myself so much with a literary character. This book made me think, laugh, and even cry a little. I was amazed at Hornby's ability to absolutely nail the male psyche in such a clear manner. High Fidelity actually helped me come to terms with some of my \\"issues.\\" With that in mind, I rushed to the store to purchase \\"About a Boy\\". What I discovered left me sadly disappointed. Where was the wit, and insight that fueled me through High Fidelity? Although this book was clearly written, it failed to inspire thought or concern. The plot didn't flow and try as I might, I absolutely didn't care about any of the characters. They wear dull, lifeless, and uninspiring. What happened Hornby? Please, please try again. Eagerly awaiting the next one- joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really about two \\"boys\\"","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a quick, witty and untimately enjoyable book about a boy who just wants to fit in, and a man who perhaps just blends in too well. I must agree with another reviewer who stated that the character of Marcus seemed remarkably placid and content considering that he had such hopeless parents, both of whom appeared incrediably self absorbed and self-centered. Marcus finds what he is lacking in parental direction in Will, an unlikely candidate considering he is a 36 year old man who appears quite content in a life with no career, no real interests (except finding women ), and no real thoughts for his future. The two form an odd but mutually beneficial friendship, that brings them both closer to maturity and what it takes to really be a man. While I did not enjoy this novel as much as \\"High Fidelity\\", it still makes for a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"wavering between 3 and four","review":"Like High Fidelity, About A Boy made me laugh out loud. Light and breezy, this book makes a great entertaining read. My only qualm (and this is why I'm wavering between three and four stars) is althought it was fun to read, it was so light I felt like the book might float out of my hands. (Even with the undercurrents of divorce and suicide inhabiting the book). A novel does not have to be filled with some heavy duty message in order for me to enjoy it, I suppose what it is about the book that reads funny, is the scary subjects within it, they feel out of place next to Hornby's witty tone. Something doesn't match up quite right, and it isn't that humor can't be found in the dark. That aside, Hornby is a talented and engaging writer, and if you liked High Fidelity I say read this one too(I liked High Fidelity more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to read following \\"High Fidelity\\"","review":"Did you read \\"High Fidelity\\"? If you liked that, then CHECK THIS OUT. Same dry humor. Great writing. Funny. Flows. I really cared about the main characters (man & boy) and loved reading about them growing up--both of them.

This very dark series explores horrific sexual crimes graphically described. It takes place in the future when there no longer exists what we know as polite or respectful language or deference to women or young people. Everyone is vulgar both the men and the women in their language and the accepted way they communicate and interact. The main character Eve is fashioned after your hard core homicide detective. She rough and vulgar and prone to violence and anger, barely feminine at all. Even the sex among the main characters is described as violent with the same dark descriptors as the sexual crimes committed in this book.

It was the BEST but this new stuff is made in China and is garbage. If you are lucky enough to have some of the old containers all you have to do is hold them next to the new ones and you will see the difference. The old ones are clear and the new ones have a blue cast to the glass. For some reason the blue tint in the glass weakens it but somehow makes it cheaper to produce. From what I've read all colored glass is more fragile especially when subjected to heat but I have to tell you, it also chips with just regular use. I've never had any of the old pyrex chip. Also, the lids for the new ones are EXTREMELY stiff and very difficult to get on to the containers. I even had one lid split because it would not stretch. Somehow this new stiffer plastic is cheaper to make just does not make a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BE CAREFUL","review":"In case you haven't read the January issue of Consumer Reports yet, let me summarize: Corning sold Pyrex to World Kitchen, who is using cheaper glass which makes it more likely to shatter from heat.

I have used these containers to cook and heat up things in the microwave and haven't had any problems with them breaking.

Perhaps you came up with Alice Coltrane. If you're really hip, you might even know about Dorothy Ashby.Now you can add Carol Robbins (who actually studied with Ashby) to this very short list. It's tempting to call her the \\"Bill Evans of the jazz harp\\" -- and so I just did. And this is a good thing.Joined in various combinations by guitarist Larry Koonse, reedman Bob Sheppard, drummer Tim Pleasant, Derek Oles on bass, and Steve Huffsteter on trumpet and flugelhorn, Ms. Robbins has crafted a charming and enjoyable \\"ballads and bossas\\" outing here, with a more-or-less equal balance of standards and original tunes.Jazz Play is elegant, classy, and seductive \\"dinner jazz\\" mood music that also rewards dedicated listening. If you're not already hip to the rare and unlikely beauty of the jazz harp, Carol Robbins will make you a believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip jazz cd","review":"Wonderful musicians with great material equal a great jazz cd.

You'll turn over.","review":"It would take truly magnificent conducting to make anyone accept the flashlight of Helga Dernesch's voice in lieu of the laserbeam of Birgit Nilsson's. And although Karajan is capable of truly magnificent conducting, he must have been taking cold medicine when he recorded this. The \\"turgid tempi\\" noted by the Amazon reviewer are just deadly. For example: the brooding music for strings in the prologue to Act III - so harrowingly melancholy in the legendary Bohm performance - is taffy-stretched into an almost ambient lugubriousness. A love-it-or-hate-it performance? Okay. I hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revisit to Idealistic Concepts","review":"I have virtually every Tristan recording ever made: mostly commercial, but a few \\"pirates\\". Without a doubt, this recording is the absolute best. The drama, the intensity, the poetry all come through like a fresh breeze every time that I return to listen to it. Granted, some problems exist with just crazy technical problems in the mixing operation ( listen to the last few bars of the end of act one: little chorus and too much horns), but even so, this is about as close as you will ever get to a 'perfect' performance of Tristan. Dernesch has that haunting, hurt and extremely sexy and dark voice so necessary for Isolde. Vickers, of course, is the best of the best. Ludwig is absolutely fantastic and this recording catches her at her prime. The orchestra is silkenly smooth. Hands down, the best recording ever made of this great masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of the Zombies Review","review":"This movie is a camp classic!!! It is so BAD that it is almost great. The premise is that Dick Purcell is working for the government and he and the always ridiculous Mantaan Moreland and John Archer crash their plane onto an Island inhabited by a Nazi sympathizer who turns the local natives into Zombies to do his evil bidding. The plot is confusing, how can a man help the Nazi cause by being on an island in the Bahamas? Mantaan Moreland, who was genuinely a funny man, is relegated in the role of the \\"black servant\\" who rolls his eyes, and by todays standards it is very sad that he was portrayed as an idiot. The movie however, is worth watching, simply to see the bad writing, directing, and the stereotypical portrayal of Nazis. It is truly a cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old fresh breeze in today's speech-strangled world of pc","review":"EYES-UH-CUMMIN BOSS! This movie is of the old Stepin Fetchit mold and is a welcome revival from an era that was criticized by today's real enemies of free speech as racist, insensitive, etc. The black actor might have done as Stepin Fetchit did and make a few good bucks from the stereotype he was paid to put down on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD AND BAD!!!!!","review":"This Roan release has an excellent print of King of the Zombies which makes it great to watch.

This release shows the good and bad of Roan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Transfer to DVD Format","review":"King Of The Zombies is a great campy/funny B&W film, and Mantan Moreland steals the show. Unfortunately this transfer of the film print to DVD is the worst that I have ever seen, and Im not referring to the scratches, dust or spots on the print that was used, this actually adds to the vintage feel of the film. The problem with this DVD is that the frame of view has been cropped in on all sides so any scene where the actors head is close to or at the edge of the original frame gets there head cut off down to the nose or mouth and this is through the whole film not one or two scenes. I don't recommend that anyone who enjoys vintage film of this type buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Copy?","review":"One of the reviews for this DVD actually refers to another edition which was paired on a double feature with 'Revolt of the Zombies'.I haven't heard any complaints about the print quality on this particular release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mantan Moreland Steals the Show","review":"Third-billed Mantan Moreland is the real star of this 1941 Monogram horror-comedy. Whenever the hilarious character actor appears on screen, \\"King of the Zombies\\" rises above the usual low-budget schlock. Unfortunately, the non-Moreland scenes are deadly dull.

As far as content, little or no substantiation is offered for their assertions. That said, I don't regret buying it.

Mr. Ondaatje seems to have a more obscure purpose. I found this book unclear, self-consciously arty, and populated with pointlessly enigmatic characters. I might have enjoyed the annotated Herodotus, so often referred to, but never presented. The diary of a man in love with the desert would surely have been more engaging and direct than the elliptical, pointless, yet painful relationships we have been shown"},{"rating":"1","title":"After seeing the movie, this book was a major disappointment","review":"This book was a rambling mess. It was a crime for the Academy not to give Anthony Minghella an Oscar for his adapted screenplay-he turned this terrible work of literature into one of the best movies ever made. See the movie, DON'T read the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"I will try to watch the movie","review":"I am one of the few who have not seen the 'highly acclaimed' movie, but I must rent it soon in hopes of it explaining what the hell is going on in this book. This is the most boring book I have ever read and I am an avid reader. I have previously read \\"Coming through Slaughter\\", by Mr. Ondaatje and did not enjoy it either. Think of the book as a piece of jazz music. It goes all over the place and you either like that kind of thing or you just don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"the second best book I've read yet","review":"If you did like the movie based on this book, you'll most probably like it. As usual, the book is better than the movie, in this case not just because it goes into detail but because of Ondaatje's style of writing. Most of the people I've given this book to read said they sometimes had to give it away for a minute just to take a new breath. It really makes yoy stop and enjoy the stong effect it has on you and wonder how someone can put the words in an order with such an effect. A beautiful story beautifully written which is a rare combination.To make this short, if you did like Alessandro Baricco's SILK (which is my most favourite book), you'll probably like this one too and vice versa. This book is a must for all people who don't mind reading lovestories but find most of them trivial and banal. This is a book about love - strong and rare, forbidden and scathing, a life-and-death love many of us wish to find. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"literature should be art.","review":"Ondaatje is a fine writer. I have read many negative reviews here about the work being \\"artsy farsty\\"; literature is an art. The English Patient has such beautiful imagery, I can't understand how you could be bored- unless you are not a literature reader. I think this attitude is perhaps derived from the movies success. Ondaatje's brillance really comes through in the details, his original descriptions. He has the ability to make prose sound like poetry. In many passages you can here the poetic quality clearly, this is the writing only a great writer could do. maybe it is not his best story, but it is far from bad. for those who said it was boring, what literature do you like"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"It's rare that I read an original novel AFTER seeing the movie first, but, once I saw the film version of \\"The English Patient,\\" I wanted to read the novel itself because if the movie was as good as it was, the novel had to be just as good (if not better). I was definitely not disappointed. This is one of the most beautifully descriptive novels I have ever read. The author's choice of words is exquisite, and he conveys the images in his novel perfectly. Had I NOT seen the movie before reading the novel, I could have gotten just as good a visual from just reading Ondaatje's words on the page. This is the only novel by Ondaatje that I've read, but I'm anxious to read some of his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eccentric Prose destroyed by intertwining mess of a plot","review":"I read 132 pages into the novel confused as hell. I then rented the movie and cleared up a lot of confusion as to where Ondaatje was trying to lead the reader. His beautifully eccentric poetic style of writing was deeply effected by the intertwining mess of a plot. After finishing the movie the novel became much more understanding and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid book","review":"I didn't get this book, but I tried to keep reading. I am an avid reader, but I finally had to quit wasting my time. I couldn't identify with any of the characters (thank God). I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated, dense, poetic, erotic, wow, wow, wow!","review":"Don't miss this - and don't miss the movie, either.The English Patient is a completely enthralling novel of war, honor, romance, and courage. The parts written in the point of view of the English patient while under the effects of morphine are especially difficult, but just as especially lyrical, dense, and captivating.Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the first time, the film's better than the book","review":"For those of you who think that films based on books don't usually do them justice, here's an exception: while the film based on this book is perceptive, poetic and touching, the book is overly descriptive, confusing and boring. See the film; forget about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the summary","review":"I thought this was going to be a great book to read but as I started it ,I was greatly disappointed because it is extremely boring. The author has added in so much unnecessary detail and boring descriptions as well as characters of no significance. However to be fair, the book starts picking up pace towards the middle with the descriptions of the desert trips that I really enjoyed. Parts of the plot are loosely connected for instance the change of Hanna's feelings from her love to the English Patient to the sapper. Also the attitude of the sapper after the Hiroshema bomb. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, maybe I should try it again","review":"It has been a long, long time since I didn't finish a book. The ramblings and looseness of plot did not hold my attention long enough to finish this book. After reading other reviews, maybe I should try it on a better day. After 200 pages, I gave up"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish to give it no stars at all. Such a BORE!","review":"After all the great reviews that this book received I had high expectations when I began reading it. It wasn't long before I was greatly disappointed.I soon discovered what a boring book it is. I just couldn't bring myself to finish it.This is probably one of the few stories that make better movies than books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow and slow....not much more.","review":"Ok, to be fair, the author won a Booker Prize for this book. There must be some attributes that I don't see. A very talented author friend complimented the style - very matter of fact...which it is and which the author has mastered. As for the plot - there isn't much of one. Four people come together in a ruined villa in Italy near the end of WWII. They each are haunted by their experiences of the war and they somehow find solice in each other's company. A chapter here and there I found very interesting - I thought perhaps the story was picking up. It quickly fell off into dullness again. I just don't know how to critique this book beyond my personal opinion that it was a very dull, slow-moving story with brief glimpses of interest and intrigue followed by more dull droning. I truly skimmed the last 100 pages with little interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential","review":"The plot of the story had a great potential. It portrays four people coming from different walks of life and experiences during WW11. Each character has an intriguing and sad story that has altered his or hers life for ever. Unfortunately, the author spends so much time proving to his readers his proficiency in the English language that the book looses its charm after few chapters. The most influential writers and philosophers (of present and past) make their writing unforgettable not by using the longest and at times inappropriate words but by eloquently putting them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another dull \\"literary\\" novel...","review":"The English Patient lacked all but one of the characterics that make for a truely great novel. It's characters were lackluster and one dimensional, it's plot was missing, it's pace was slow and plodding, and it had no ending. It did have some lovely prose. For me, lovely prose just isn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what gets awards in Hollywood?","review":"I began this book with a very open mind thinking that since it was given such grand reviews I would like it. WRONG! I kept reading thinking it would get better. When I finished it I thought, SO? I could not see how this could be made into one of the great love stories of the century. The characters were not fully developed, but I continued to read thinking I would eventually come to the great love story and I would become excited about the plot. It never came. The narrative by the English patient did not tell me of any great love. Just a fling behind the husband's back. I was very disappointed by this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooty prose attracts devotees","review":"While most are raving over this novel, here's another \\"thumbs down.\\" Ondaatje gives little life to his characters -- but mostly relies on descriptions of their surroundings to convey their thoughts and emotions. Very well, it's been done before with great success. But the problem here is that Ondaatje is obviously too in love with his own prose.Reading this book is sort of like being lectured to by a snooty english prof. who thinks he's got a better handle on setting symbolism than you ever will. Oh well, folks seem to love it anyway. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, For Goodness Sake!","review":"It's quite obvious from the tone of the book that the only character this author cares about is himself! Soooo tedious that every time I sat down to read, I found myself thinking about watering my tomato plants, which would have been a LOT more interesting. I could write more, but that would just give this book free advertising, which is something I DEFINITELY DON'T want to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Novel that is Beautifully Written","review":"The English Patient is a complex novel that interweaves four characters and their separate stories in a plot centered around WWII. While the movie focuses on just one story attached to the present narrative, the book is much richer, fully developing all of the characters. The main narrative creates a moving world of its own, as the characters find a safe haven from the war and their personal tragedies. The novel can be difficult to follow, as the flashbacks to the characters' prior stories are not linear. However, the difficulties are well worth the effort. The English Patient is a book that will endure and inform"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously complicated.A superb literary achievement.","review":"Michael Ondaatjee's \\"The English Patient\\" is a stunner.

But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"In memory, love lives forever.","review":"I believe this is the most marvelous book I have ever read. I am amazed at how Ondaaje used sentence fragments to completely tangle me in this book. He is a brilliant writer.Katharine's chapter is the most beautiful piece. It is the way you would want a lost love to describe you. I read the book before the movie- and although both are lovely, the book brings you to a point in you imagination that you cannot control. \\"Who lays the crumbs of food that tempt you? Towards a person you never considered.\\" The words flow into your train of thought on a daily basis. \\u0019You will end up giving this book to everyone you know and love. I completely recommend it for your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful,lyrical, and intelligent war-time romance.","review":"I have just started to read The English Patient for the fourth time and I am still enthralled by the incredible beauty of the language. This novel was clearly written by a poet,who leaves with you multi-layered, powerful memories of the allure of the desert, the obsessiveness of the love affair, the characters' sad longing for everything they've lost and can never recover. Except for a few tedious passages about bomb defusion, this is one of the most intelligently romantic (not sentimental) novels of the late 20th century. The images stay with you--the cave of swimmers, the hunted monastery, the desert winds--as much as the well delineated characters, making you want to come back again and again to their distant and magical world. The novel holds you in its lyrical grip and you won't want to let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, Touching, Haunting...","review":"It is a rare occurrence in literature when characters have as much depth as do those created in this novel. Their emotions are like open wounds and the reader feels guilty looking inside but cannot help it. A powerful and moving novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and tedious read...","review":"I just finished reading The English Patient. I don't know if I can really say \\"finished\\" since I skipped quite a few pages due to the dullness of the book. It is one of the dreariest, most slow-paced and unnecessarily wordy books I've ever read. I wonder how it even won a prize? You never really get to know or like any of the characters, who are all terribly boring. The book jumps from scene to scene, and you're never really sure who's saying what. And like other reviewers have commented, nothing really happens. I'm yet to watch the movie, but I hear it is really good. But as for the book, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are not enough stars!","review":"Well, there would be more stars but they are all hidden by the sand!!!

A writing style entirely lacking in subtlety and full of bad metaphors (one character compares her step-mother to a barge...); far-fetched plot divices; self-absorbed, unlikeable characters with no voices of their own (they all speak like the poet Ondaatje).

Heck, I couldn't even find the story at times. I hate pretentious books and all the hype surround thing one just makes it worse. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the wording could be quite beautiful. Just not my kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a talent.","review":"Wow. 300 pages of nothing. This book is certainly amazing. Everyone tells me the style of this book is breathtaking. Yea, it truly is. He has absolutely no writing ability whatsoever. The \\"imagery\\" and \\"description\\" that everyone rants about is pointless, boring, uninteresting, and rambling. There is zero structure to the novel, and to add insult to injury, this hapless book doesn't even lead you to anything. There's no plot. It's just a winding nonsense festival of shallow observations and condescending themes. If you would happen to like a book about 4 people living in a random villa TALKING for 300 pages, you'd love this book. For all others, avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"oooh...this is such a BEAUTIFUL book!","review":"I find it incredibly funny that so many people are gushing over this book. They must think they're supposed to like it because it won the Booker prize. *I* am ashamed of the fact that it's still on my shelf. I think I'm going to use it for toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and irritating","review":"I guess these are the books the jury likes for awards. I was looking for a good lively love story, but ended up reading one of the most complicated and dragging novel of all time.There is no begining or ending and the lives in the book have no meaning. a boring and dissappointing saga of a burnt patient and the nurses love for him or who, i could not understand.My worst read so far"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, overblown, and boring","review":"This is the kind of book that some English teachers might point to as \\"great writing,\\" but I found it incredibly pretentious and overblown. The characters ultimately are cardboard and uninteresting, the plot is not particularly riveting, and I found the writing style to be pompous and irritating. In trying to wade through this thicket of inpenetrably stuffy verbiage, I ultimately was bored silly. This book gets my \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" award for this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie","review":"While I loved the movie, the book left me dry and perplexed. Normally I prefer the book to the movie, but in this case, it was the other way around. The story jumps around a great deal and you live in the heads of Hana, Caravagio and Kip, but only graze upon those of Catherine and Almasy. If you expect to read about that great romance, better just rent the video because it's not in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"A lyrically written book, with I feel, no great substance (and not much humour either). The characters (four of them) are not very convincing. How this book could be compared to \`All Quiet on the Western Front' is beyond me as they are entirely different stories (this was cited in one of the comments in my edition). The author skips endlessly from one time sequence to another time sequence - as if he cannot hold a thought for more than a few pages. This out of sequence style strikes me as contrived. There are nice sentences thrown together but little cohesion.At the end the author lists his sources. It is as if he read the sources and used these to try to inspire a novel - about deserts and dismantling bombs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie was better, and different","review":"so I saw the movie when it came out, and really liked it. I always meant to read the book and finally found a copy. I made several attempts to get started and found it confusing and impenetrable. finally, I decided to plow through to the end believing it must be good since the movie was, and the book was a best-seller.I must say that there isn't much to the book. nothing happens; no real plot develops. it just ends, with a little end-note about Kip the sapper after the war which was both jarring and unnecessary.the most unsatisfying loose-end is the fate of the patient Almasy. the book ended with him in bed just like it started, and never having been forthcoming with Hana, Carvaggio, or Kip.also, once in the book it says the Bedouins treated Almasy with tannic acid which turned his skin dark. that is truly bizarre. this is how you tan animal hides to make leather. it kills the cells and makes them non-porous. is there a dermatologist in the house to comment?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite flowing and intriguing language, storyline was flat.","review":"It started out as if it was going to be pretty interesting, with the fantastic description of the setting. That's okay for an intro, but the main thing is, THE ENTIRE BOOK SHOULD NOT BE AN INTRO. We wanted to see Odaantje step off the setting for a few moments and start concentrating on other things... like plot, maybe. Don't get us wrong, Odaantje had a brilliant writing style. But it just didn't work for a novel. Maybe he should stick to poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnum Opus","review":"Obviously from the reviews, one can infer that you either love it or hate it, a lot of fives and ones. Those who hate it said that they have found it boring which i highly disagree on. This is definitely one of the best books i have read and i recommend it to anyone. Even if you have seen the film, read the book. The movie chose to concentrate on Katheryn and the patient while the book goes deeply into the other characters. Not boring in the least...You have to read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment!","review":"I am a lover of books and enjoy nothing more thana \\"good read.\\" I was looking forward to readingthis book prior to seeing the movie, and anticipated an \\"all-nighter\\" staying up until the book was finished. It is a small book, after all. I was SO disappointed to find it a boring, ponderous artsy-fartsy book which relies on stream of consciousness and endless narrative to tell an uninteresting story. There are very few books I find unable to finish, but I have put this down three or four times to read another book instead. Although I keep coming back to it to try to press onward to see what all the fuss is about, I find myself caring less and less. The characters are shallow and pretentious, and could use more development; the plot(s) entwine and separate but never engage the reader. Thumbs down!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"read the book first!","review":"The English Patient is my all time favorite movie, which people say is strange considering I'm only 14. Unfortunatly, I saw the movie before I read the book, which sort of spoiled the novel for me. If you are going to experience both, then I would definatly read the book first. Otherwise you will be dissapointed with the difference between the book and movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guaranteed success","review":"An excellent example of a book written with an audience in mind.

I bought it several years ago, started listening to it, and stopped halfway through. I just couldn't get into it. Recently, I tried to listen to it again, thinking maybe I missed something the first time around. It was just as bad. Whereas, with most audio books, the narration adds to the content of the book, in this one, it kills it. If you want to read this book, stick to the paperback version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for patient readers","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time, even though I found it frustrating the first time through. I kept wondering \\"where are we now? what's going on?\\" and re-reading passages to pick up the thread of the plot. The second time through, with a grasp of where the book was headed, I was able to enjoy the sheer beauty of the book's mood and atmosphere. I would advise first time readers to savor the book, and not worry about the sense of drifting among plot lines - the book will take you with it. I have noticed in conversations with people about \\"The English Patient\\" that there are those who like the book, and those who like the movie. The movie has a much more traditional narrative flow. It took two readings for me to understand that the book has to be read like poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ethereal and too dense","review":"While I count the movie as one of my favourites, I found the book The English Patient to be incoherent, too loosely drawn with some of the densest prose this side of Heart Of Darkness! Gossamer images clog the narrative leaving the reader with an impression of holding a cobweb - one is left reading nothing but air! Like A Room With A View, the movie is better than the book, and the soundtrack is worth buying as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious book with unintelligible plotline.","review":"While acknowledging that the prose is flowery, I much prefer direct novels with something to say. The film made some sense of it all. If you liked this book, you will like Possession, another Booker Prize winner. I say the co-winner of the Booker for this particular year was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My succinct review","review":"I will endeavor to keep this review as brief as possible:I have not read that many books, to be honest with you; but Ondaatje's \\"The English Patient\\" is the most enjoyable of all the ones that I have read.Ondaatje's style is unique and one can see that this is a poet at work; the breadth of his vocabulary is immense and his extravagant use of poetic devices make the book a work of art. Suffice it to say that I have never read a novel which incorporates so much of the literary scope into one product: this is not just a novel; it's poetry and art as well.The only thing I did not like about this book is that, at times it can go off topic a bit and become quite drab- but this is the exception rather than the rule, and the novel as a whole is very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly dissappointing","review":"I think a better title for the book should have been \\"Kip-the wary sapper.\\" Ondaatje only devotes, at most, three chapters to the English Patient. The rest of the book is devoted to Kip, the bomb sapper. I honestly thought that the book would be about the title, but I was wrong. Although the book was written well, I was disappointed in it. I wanted to know more about the English Patient and his journey's through the desert. I would only recommed this book to others after informing them that it is about mainly about Kip."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ROMANCE","review":"The best romance book for all seasons, especially if you are visiting or living in An Arabic country with desert, the words chosen are passion heated, the description and details real and if you can listen to the soundtrack when reading, it will be graved into your heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the english patient","review":"i had a good experience ordering this book. it was in good shape,cheap,and shipped quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best-ever","review":"This is an incredible book.

I have heard other sound systems that use small satellites as the surrounds and they really may as well not be there as you can't hear them. These however do a great job of helping fill the room with sound while blending with the other speakers so you hear the sound from all around you, not just from specific speakers.

Ortega sees that the world has been transformed, that it has become overcrowded with a kind of pleasure- seeking irresponsible 'mass man'. He contrasts this figure with the responsible elite , those who demand much of themselves and would contribute to society as a whole. Ortega's work is often seen as observing and condemning the rise of totalitarian society.But it seems to me that however well he formulates his observations the distinctions he draws is far too broad and simplistic. The great evils and destruction in the century would come not from masses alone but rather from ideological driven elites whose ideas led to the tormenting and murder of millions.I would also say that there are all kinds of other social, political changes which occur in the century which it seems to me Ortega does not see. 3"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product for the price","review":"This product is a great buy, considering the low price (even considering you have to pay postage).

Mirella Freni and José Carreras are not such singers. They are both overparted. Only Baltsa and Cappuccilli hold up their end respectably. Freni's lyric voice is pushed in \\"Ritorna vincitor\\" and sadly cannot ride the Triumphal Scene ensemble. Without the help of the mikes, she would have been drowned out. Carreras does not have the heroic tone for Radamès. He also cannot ride the Triumphal Scene ensemble. His sequence of G's at the end of Act Three are nothing compared to the ones Corelli hits in his studio recording of \\"Ada\\" with Birgit Nilsson.Skip this recording. Verdi did not write for lyric voices such as Freni and Carreras. Ada and Radamès deserve better. The reviewers of this recording who praise it to the skies are obviously fans of Freni and/or Carreras. They really don't care how well Freni and Carreras serve their roles, only that they merely sing them.

As of this writing despite several exchanges with sony tech support I've been unable to get the MP3 player to work with any of my existing MP3s all of which play without problem on my other MP3 players, It appears that this issue will not be resolved and I'll have to return the SJ33 at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony support nonexistant","review":"If sony could get a zero, I would give them a zero.

My only complaint is that it doesn't come with detailed instructions on how to use the programs. But after playing with it a while everything starts to make sense, and it quickly becomes an indispensible tool. It used to be something I never thought I needed, and now I don't know how I lived without it. This one can also sync with Quicken or MS Outlook, which some people will love.By far the best thing about this PDA compared to others is the display - twice as detailed as other PDAs.

To improve this product, I recommend that the name be changed to: \\"Ocarinas, Red and Blue\\" and that the product be changed to contain a red ocarina and a blue ocarina, as pictured.

It doesn't catch skin in the trimmer blades unless you're exceptionally hamfisted, unlike some other hair trimmers where it is common.

I understand that this book is written for self-employed, small business owners who know next to nothing about bookkeeping, but it's way too dumbed down. I am a small business owner who knows nothing about bookkeeping; that's why I bought the book. But I didn't get anything useful out of it. It's literally written for people with an 8th grade education. I learned next to nothing from the book. As a business owner, I want to know why things need to be done a certain way. This book just gives you the simplest case examples with no explanation, but plenty of useless fluff. So I couldn't figure out what to do in my particular situation. And every business owner is going to have a unique situation. Find a better book that has some more detail and can give you some insight. If you want to learn about bookkeeping and why things are done the way they are, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to photograph closeups in nature","review":"I believe anyone interested in close-up photography will benefit from this book.

At least she can sing, and her album is half way decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Singing!","review":"Wow! when I listen to this cd for the first time I was really disappointed!!! Ashley cannot sing! It seems like the music overpowers her voice! 1 or 2 of the songs were okay, the rest was not worth the money I spent!

Any takers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually pretty good","review":"I found myself wondering whether or not i would enjoy this cd and minus 2 or 3 songs on the CD. I actually enjoyed it among my favorites Don't Touch (The Zoom Song), He Said, She Said, So Much For You and Not Like That. It's a really catchy dance driven cd but it has kind of an R&B flavor to it that should get some play at any dance or whether the mood strikes you. I also enjoyed a couple of the slow songs, but i had more of a blast listening to the uptempo songs.

So what? Well people today tend to think that teenagers are so stupid that we can't know a god voice when we hear it. We ALL know what happens when the disney girls sing right? WHY do they always sing anyway? I am NOT bashing Ashley. Maddie is so funny and I like her, but she is not a born singer. She whines. And her raping? One word: Cheesy.But then again if you enjoy mozeralla cheese music, then buy Headstorng.

She sings (not well I might add) about how all the girls are just jealous of her style and how she doesn't care. Well, if you don't care, then why are you singing a poorly written/produced song about it then? How does this Disney garbage even pass as music? I'm so sick of these annoying Disney \\"stars\\" who are on the Disney shows and movies and then all of a sudden they have a record deal. How they even get signed is totally beyond me.

It is set up in an easy to reference way, with lots of pictures and clear, detailed descriptions. Many of the positions even have 2 possible methods, one for the novice, and one for the advanced student. This is great when you are first starting out and you lack flexibility.My favorite thing about the book is that it allows you to look up positions by name and by function.

The dialogue I found to be incredibly forced in many spots. The characters are mere caricatures, over-the-top extremists with little thought to complexities most people exhibit. Of course, perhaps the book is ABOUT extremism, but it doesn't read like it--the extremists on one side have found the \\"one true way\\" and everyone else is tragically, utterly wrong. Not a complex treatment of any of the topics presented. The description of the world blowing up, often the more gripping parts of this type of fiction, is afforded little attention.Merely average, basically."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who are fed up with Big Brother","review":"If you are patriotic, and do not want to loose any more of your freedoms...this series (over 30 books!) is for you.This series has no middle ground.

After this book, which was mediocre, I started to read number 2 book in a lengthy series. The uncalled numerous foul language and lurid sex scenes detracted from what I thought was going to be a military thriller series. Needless to say, after the 2nd book, the 3rd was very similar and also repetitive in recalling scenes from the 1st 2 books in lengthy detail. I stopped reading the 3rd book after about 45 pages.Needless to say, I gathered up the rest of the 12 books I had purchased and not read, and put them out for recycling.In closing, I would like to state that this is my first 1 star review.Out Of The Ashes"},{"rating":"2","title":"First book of excellent series","review":"After the bombs go off we have a new world but same types of people so they beginning warring all over again.

Don't take it seriously and just enjoy. If you're not careful, you might find yourself reading the next book in the series, then the next, then the next, and......you get the idea. The plot is obvious, the characters cardboard, but it does have a way of pulling you in and keeping you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me started","review":"I bought this book in '83 or '84.

Thank you Mr. Johnstone for hours and hours of enjoyment and excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Ashes...Out of Ideas","review":"This is the first in William Johnstone's \\"Ashes\\" series. I've noticed it described as \\"survivalist literature,\\" which --though an oxymoron-- is probably as accurate as anything could be. I was surprised to find out that the author was an adult when this was written. The simple plot, the terrible dialogue, and the walking stereotypes that pass as characters made me assume it was written by a high school student... and not one from the gifted program. The scary thing is that Johnstone has written so many sequels. With the ultra-right element so vocal in America these days, I imagine it really does pass for literature among the militia types. Btw... I bought the sequel, thinking it might get better. It doesn't. It actually gets worse. And after reading this one, that's hard to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not waste your money","review":"I really tried to finish this book, after all I paid good money for it and I like post-apocalyptic fiction, but this book is just ridiculous. I kept hoping that it would get better but by the time I was half way through I realized it was only getting worse. The author couldn't decide if he wanted to lecture us about the evils of big government and society in general or titillate us with second rate (make that third rate) smut. DO NOT waste your money on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Porn","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book but it disappointed me. The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to follow. Then the book degenerates into basically the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights.

Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMHO Novice reader 1st review","review":"While this is the first review I have ever wrote I'm sure my opinion will vary. I am a sci-fi, post apocolyptic, TEOTWAWKI, SHTF, kinda reader. For ideas and for enjoyment.The scenes are well played out and have a very possible distinction. Not very many far fetched ideas or acts that seemed stupid. The \\"sex scenes\\" were too graphic for younger crowds. I look forward to the next book in the series. I just hope that they don't get stretched out for to long and start to fade.YMMVJohn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a bang, finishes with a wimper","review":"The beginning of the book is excellent; with a rebellion brewing and nuclear apocylpse approaching. The story continues with the day-to-day survival of people across the country. Ben Raines eventually ends up recruiting a base of survivers and sets up a new state- Tri-State. This is where the book goes downhill; it goes downhill fast, in a very short period of time. He sets up his state and turns it into a conservative-utopia (an oxymoron in itself). A barbaric society results. A society with very few morals. A society that at times reminded me of Orwell's 1984. It almost seems as if Johnstone attempted to make more of a political statement than tell an entertaining story. If you are a good true blue American liberal, such as myself, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book ever written, but Hi-Lar-ious!","review":"This book is beyond description. It reads like an eighth grader wrote it, but without the deep thought of said middle schooler. The action is jumpy, the text almost pure exposition, and over half of the book is devoted to an extended rant/diatribe. And even the diatribe is unorganized, jumping from \\"get tough on crime\\" speeches to the main character's desire to \\"screw\\" a reporter he sees on television. All this being said, I couldn't put it down because I couldn't stop laughing. If you've ever wanted to look at truly bad pulp fiction with no attempt at organization or editing, be sure and pick up this book. I also enjoyed the author's musings on the coming race war. Thanks for the info, Johnstone! You are truly the greatest American hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, good philosophy","review":"OK, so this story doesn't have the most original or deepest plots in the world, but what it does have is a strong political and social philosophy, and presents it in an interesting fashion.Mr. Johnstone's protagonist, Ben Raines, leads the way as a warrior-philosopher fighting the human scum rising to the top after World War Three destroys the world. Along the way, he hooks up with a group of survivors, and together they form a nation without crime, poverty, or injustice.Of course, the Washington liberals can't tolerate that, and destroy it.The book is over the top and sometimes thin, it's still a good lead into an exciting series."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average apocalyptic book but politically extreme.","review":"This book makes an attempt to validate the most exasperating elements of the far right and far left. Taking children away from their families because they don't agree politically with Johnstone's utopian government and a sliding tax rate that places an extreme burden on the wealthy are just some examples. On the plus side, not a bad survivalist fiction.I would instead recommend PATRIOTS; Surviving the Coming Collapse by Rawles as an all-around better book with more palatable politics and solid survivalism information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch","review":"Does not work with Nintendo Game Cube at all, only Black amd white picture with PS2.

The lyric haunts too.Sheena has done well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight ahead pop","review":"This is a surprisingly pleasing pop record, with the highlight being Sheena Easton's versatile voice. Sweet and charming on the title cut, resilient and defiant on 'Til Death Do Us Part, wilting and vulnerable on All I Ask Of You, and outright powerful on Crazy Love. There are a couple of nonsense tracks (Next To You and Too Much In Love belong in the 80's) but there's enough here to please even the most die hard cynic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling into the Adult Contemporary Trap","review":"As as is the case with many aging pop artists, Sheena Easton decided to take refuge with safe adult-contemporary music on this album, and the result is not terribly exciting overall (unless you're thrilled with what's played on adult-contemporary stations--I'm not). There are some good songs on here: \\"My Cherie,\\" \\"'til Death Do Us Part,\\" \\"All I Ask of You,\\" (this one is a little syrupy) and \\"Too Much in Love.\\" The other tracks do not really shine, and some are just plain bad or boring. If you like the up-tempo Sheena Easton, you might want to pass on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt And Tender","review":"My Cherie is not about vocal pyrotechnics and acrobatics. I mean Easton had done it before - remember You Could Have Been With Me and power ballad Hard To Say It's Over? On this CD, she gives a very understated and restrained treatment to the songs.The title track's middle-of-the-road beat reminded me of her first hit Morning Train while upbeat Too Much In Love practically had me bursting with joy. Amid the mid tempo stuff, there are a couple of beautiful ballads such as Flower In The Rain, You've Learned To Live Without Me and Dance Away The Blues.Sheena never looked more angelic and the design is filled with cherubs and roses.My Cherie is a testament to musical maturity and to be a great singer - sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternate Fiction!","review":"As a self styled world war 2 buff, I watch the history channel buy read books, and even play games related to world war 2. I'm fascinated by how the world could have been such a different place if half a dozen things would have turned out differently. This book examines a world war 2 where hitler is killed and a himmler takes over. Himmler makes some choices that if enacted in reality may have changed Germany's chances in the war. A great read throughout. I gave it 5 stars because i can't wait for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine alternate history","review":"I enjoy this book; it's a real turn-pager. A well organized story, it keeps you running to see what happens next. There are some minor flaws, as where has Martin Bormann gone? he was not a small figure and not a word is said on him. The Pilot figure is a little gruesome, the worst thing about nazis, was that they perform the cruelest deeds without being crazy psychopath. More accurate are the SS General and Himmler. The war scenes are great, realistic and full of color details. Rommel, Patton and Bradley are in the right proportion. At last the conclusion of the story is something like abrupt, but not unbelievable.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"rating":"2","title":"What If !","review":"If you like WWII and ever wondered what would happen if things turned out differently, well then this book is for you.

The way in which the authors achieves this creates a unique reading experience. The reader will be ready for the sequel. Recommended to anyone who likes history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious fan of alternate history","review":"I believe that the writers had a good, if fanciful, idea when they came up with the premise for this book. Even the unlikely separate peace with the Soviets was an interesting take.The problem with this book is in the writing. The authors are proffessional game designers which, I am sure helped in working out the fictional tactics and strategies used by the combatants, but, they should have employed a writer to at least help them with their style and substance. I found the characters to be flat and in some cases cartoonish. The authors use of German was poor at best, ham fisted at worst.Read this book if you have a few hours to kill, but if you have anything better to do, like trim your toenails, take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point? What is the reason?","review":"Why write a novel with 'what if' premise if the result will be the same? So Hitler dies and there is a chance to turn the war around for Germans.... then let the Germans win or at least have them take France and Poland and call it a draw. What the hell was the purpose of the book if Patton will continue to beat up on Germans? At the least, have Patton or Eisenhower assasinated and come up with a good story. This book was a waste of time and money. You guys can skip this one because you are not missing out on anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Plot Made from a Wargame Scenerio","review":"Both authors seem to have borrowed much from their wargaming expertise to craft this \\"what-if\\" WWII scenerio. How would Hitler's death affect the war? Well, if you know anything about Rommel, Patton, and Himmler, you'll enjoy seeing them act out that plot. The character development is easy for the writers, who stay pretty close to historical alacrity. The only negative is the sprinkling of wargaming references - when describing a combat situation you can almost hear them saying \\"the Panther, with defense factor 5, Attack strenth of 12, and in hull-down position, attacked the modified M4 Sherman from the flank...\\" Those allusions were tolerable and actually made me reminisce about the wargaming days of old. Well done! Very highly recommended for WWII history buffs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler is dead but the Third Reich fights on!","review":"July 20, 1944: Hitler is killed by a bomb and a military coup is attempted. Little did the German military officers know that Himmler would beat them to finishing line, taking control of the Reich and bringing about changes that might save it.I found the plot realistic, along with many of the characters (with all their merits and flaws), and thought the authors did very well. I wish more writers were as good. Rommel, Himmler and Patton all seem to come alive. The alternate history was done so well it does seem like a alternate reality.One of the reviewers complained that the book felt like a wargame, where the two authors just rolled dice and such, and frankly if this is true, I also wish more authors played military role playing games.

The killers are psychopaths, sociopaths, we hear from the self styled scholars of crime. So what? That doesn't explain anything or add one iota to our understanding. It would be better to leave all that out and just give the facts. I've seen TV programs that do a far better job of telling what happened.Skip this set of DVDs.

In Anthony's case, he often shares those thoughts not only with the reader, but also with other characters due to his speaking his mind unintentionaly and due to Lavalle's wonderful writting talents, which make this fit without giving the reader pryor notice as to the fact that Anthony is speaking and not just thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's easy","review":"Picked this book up after hearing about it at school, there were two grad students talking about how the book was really special.

It is brilliantly constructed and edited. This well crafted presentation is a first rate production all around. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. His endearing legacy, \\"The Twilight Zone\\" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form until very recently.

Paid 75 cents for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, wonderful keyboards","review":"This was Porcupine Tree's first \\"band\\" album. Earlier projects were mostly Steven Wilson solo. The songs are melodic and cohesive with some of the rock edge that became so prominent on \\"In Absentia\\" several years later. The lyrics don't always flow very well; this is an aspect of the music that improved greatly on later PTree projects. Richard Barbieri's keyboards are a highlight. Barbieri completely avoids the \\"many-notes\\" style of the various Dream Theater keyboardists (good in their own way) and instead uses very interesting analog synth textures and a keen ear for the perfect harmony accompaniment. More than anything else, his playing gives these songs their distinct feel and elevates the music to something more special than the sum of its parts. I couldn't disagree more strongly with the reviewer below who laments Barbieri not playing more notes. He's entitled to his opinion . . . but he's wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily their best","review":"I heard In Absentia first, barely liked it enough to get this. My world has changed forever, this is my #1 favorite album ever. Too bad they forever changed directions after this release, by putting out the stinky Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. Im glad those albums are widely popular, but Signify(and Insignificance) is their greatest release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 5 bucks.","review":"I heard very good reviews for this band from many places so I went out and bought it and I was deeply disappointed! This is probably the worst album I ever bought. First of all, most of the tracks are filled up with nothing but noise, the lyrics are pathetic and there are no REAL dynamics to any song, just constantly repeating notes. Many people told me this was music genious. I would not even call this music. Playing really slow notes with a bunch of symphonic noise behind it doesn't make you a music genious. This album doesnt belong anywhere near the rock genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Being a big fan of prog-metal, and some prog-rock, I must say this was the stupidest excuse for music I have ever heard. If you like bands such as DT or even Spock's Beard, you'll be dissapointed. I have heard good things about this band, but they were obviously bias views. The entire album is eerie sound effects, that don't even come close to giving you that feeling of pure enjoyment. Music to me consists of a band utilizing their skills in song writing and playing their instruments, not making random creepy symphonic sounds with some lyrics. Only if you're interested in the traits in which I listed, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Porcupine tree is a terrible band. I randomly downloaded some songs, curious to hear what they sounded like. They repeat the same notes over and over then try and trip you out with some weird effects in the background.

If you like this band you have failed in life and dont know what good music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good","review":"Light & airy, like your floating in the clouds 20,000 feet in the big blue sky.

Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Album","review":"This album is absolutely amazing. Some of their best work is on this record, including Sever, Waiting Phase One, Every Home is Wired and Dark Matter. The non-lyrical tracks carry the mood of the album, which I believe to be a somber, darker feeling. I strongly suggest this album for the beginners to Porcupine Tree; it seems to be one of the more popular albums for new listeners. Any Porcupine Tree hardcores already own this album and, more than likely, know most of the details contained on the disc. I suggest picking up the digipack edition only because the sound quality is so much better. Bottom line, buy the album. You will be proud to boast that you knew of Porcupine Tree before the rest of America did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Qualifies as a New Sound","review":"This CD is great music. It's not for everyone. My father can't listen to anything with a guitar in it, and that's fine. This music is quite raw, with simple and date-stamped lyrics that time may not be kind to. There's a \\"grunge\\" aspect that turns many people off, but I find if you get past that, there's a level of sophistication that fairly reeks of Pink Floyd in its early years. (I'm talking \\"Umma Gumma\\" here.) I see traces of Alan Parson's Project style as well. And there's much that is new and unique. I think the middle of this album is absolutely mesmerizing, with it's narrative vocal style. Another thing I just can't quite get over is the album cover: It sets a sort of \\"after-death - purgatory\\" tone to the entire CD, and actually adds to the effects of the musical imagery. This is a good album in an absolute sense.

Even worse very often the authors are simply not knowledgeable enough on the subjects, especially Marines. When I started reading this book, I realized it was different. In this brilliant work I actually got the feeling that the author had somehow been able to go back into time and interview the Marines in the lines, and take notes while the shots were being fired.

Her protagonist, Amelia Jones, is a real person, with a history beyond the front cover of the book. That history is revealed slowly, in fact Amelia doesn't realise how much is revealed, during the course of the story; gradually the reader is drawn into her life as much as her search for a past murder, victim, and murderer(s), until knowing that Amelia is growing and maturing greatly is perhaps more important than knowing that the evil ones will be brought to justice. The only downside to the book is that there is a simply wonderful book \\"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle\\" central to both the plot and Amelia's character; i want to read that book, but Gilman invented it and its sequel without writing them. Very unfair of her, i thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Maze\\" really exists","review":"I loved this book, and with some effort I was able to track down a copy of \\"A Maze in the Heart of the Castle\\".

So don't let it fool you. If you like Prehistoric fiction, you'll like this one. Downsides? The beginning where the heroine's village is massacred is very cliche. Also, Chagrak is only 13, and while I know this was considered an adult back then I had difficulty envisioning her being quite that resilient. Finally, her relationship at the end seemed passionless and uninteresting. I would've liked to see some attraction between the two.

Amazon is pretty much ignoring requests for the stand. The saw I like but it is bulky and not for the average DY. I was using 18\\" tiles and needed something that had a sliding bed for straight cuts. The saw did need adjustments to get a square cut, no big deal. The bed did slide smoothly without binding or wobble. The motor is plenty strong, the blade that came with it is really trash its not for cutting granite or hard tiles get a good new blade right off. The water pump worked fine until the water in the pan dropped a little then it wouldn't coat the blade, make sure you have the tray full. The miter attachments are very acurate. If your only going to cut smaller tiles then this saw may be overkill but for larger tiles its worth the money. Make sure you have a place to store something this big at home it will take up some space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Qep 24\\"","review":"This tool looks good on pictures, but it is very bulky.Instructions for putting it to work are almost useless.The blade is very hard to center due to a slightly smallershaft that has no seat for the 5/8\\" hole in the blade.The motor appears to be much less powerful then it should be.It is very common in Chinese made machines like this.When I wanted to use the saw the first time, it was breaking the stone.This was due to the blade being out of center.I took out my 14\\" brick saw and got the job done.Next day I returned the new saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for DIY Tile and Masonry Saw","review":"This saw is good enough for an advance DIY to do tile and brick work.If you are only doing tile work, I would suggest getting something smaller that is better for the smaller tile cutsI originally bought it to do pavers as it was cheaper to buy the saw than rent one for my job.Later I have used the saw for bathroom tile work.And I had no chipout with the stock blade and I was happy with its durabilityNow I give it four stars because I did have to replace the water pump already and it is challenging to calibrate.Having said this I will say was accurate in doing repetitive and miter cuts as frame is very sturdy.One could ask why not 3 stars given this and I would say it was good enough to get the job done and much cheaper than a rental.And I just didn't this it was fair to ding an low cost DIY saw for not being as good as saws 2x-3X more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll let you know when I can use it...","review":"First saw was badly damaged and didn't come with stand (ships in separate box).

It got used once a week, on average. It was (and is) comfortable. However, it now has a slow leak, which means it doesn't stay inflated for an entire night. My understanding is that it has a one-year warranty. One reviewer also reported his mattress developed a leak just after the warranty expired. Ironically, it looks very well constructed. From other reviews, it appears there is a leakage/ballooning problem with the product (though mine exhibited no ballooning). It is said in one of the reviews that the pump has a 3-yr warranty. Had the mattress lasted that long, I'd have given the mattress a 4-star rating. It fills and empties very quickly, is quite comfortable, and \\"folds\\" up nicely. But its durability--the very thing you buy it for--is questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and good air mattress","review":"This suede areobed is very comfortable and durable.

Just a year after the mattress warranty ran out its seams weakened and it started to balloon. It is now useless. I think the problem originated when the automatic inflation vent--the thing that keeps it from overinflating--stopped working properly. But even when I made sure it didn't overinflate the ballooning expanded, making it impossible to sleep on. Not very deluxe, and since the problem is with the mattress (which has a one year warranty) and not the motor (which has up to a three year warranty), it is not covered. Bad product, they must know the mattress has a short life-span.

It's supposed to engage the sliding hook arm release lever, but the internal plastic bits don't quite mesh.2) The Insta-Gator itself works well as far as it goes,and I like it, but even if the lock worked, it offers zero security. To start, it only engages the front wheel. And while the metal parts are quite rugged, it relies on easily-defeatible plasticware too hold it to the truck and to hold the hook arm in place.

One of the reviewers praised this book because it doesn't focus on diet, but having a healthy diet is good for the heart. I am always supicious of \\"quick-fix\\" approaches to complicated problems and this book falls into that category. I think we are far too quick to rush to instant solutions instead of doing the hard work we need to do in order to maintain our health and correct our problems. Who knows what information will come out about statin drugs in the future, just like doctors are now worried about resistance to antibiotics because antibiotics have been so overused. Old-fashioned approaches like diet and exercise should be the foundation of a heart program. Then if that doesn't work, maybe you need medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and Irresponsible","review":"This book is deeply problematic. The authors recommend a cardiac care program consisting essentially of three components--statins, aspirin and chlamydia testing. There is increasing evidence that statin drugs are linked to muscle wasting conditions, fatigue, memory loss and other problematic symptoms, even when liver enzymes are normal. Too many people who complain of these symptoms to physicians are told that these are just \\"normal signs of aging.\\" That's not true! There are excellent, responsible, integrative methods that can reduce cholesterol and cardiac inflammation without such dangerous means. At least they should be tried, before statin treatment is initiated. Exercise, dietary changes, stress reduction and other means are de-emphasized in this book, and these should form the mainstays of a good cardiac care program.

I found that the mount fits my raft better with the u-shaped bolts facing outward, which makes the poles spread a little further apart, fitting the sockets on the back of the raft more easily.The only problem I had was that one of the four wing-nuts came with no threads in it. So I had to grab a wing-nut at the hardware store. No big deal, really. Annoying, yes. But definitely worth it.

Nothing fits ! I just purchased a Sevylor Fish finder 4-person HF 280 boat and was intending to mount a 38lb thrust Minn Kota trolling motor. First of all, the telescoping bars are too big to fit into the holes on the oar locks. Secondly, the bars holding the transom board are too large to fit into the motor mounts on the back of the boat. Its a complete failure. I have tried to contact Sevylor, but no response. Do not purchase the Sevylor motor mount. Don't know what the engineer was thinking when this was designed. Its a joke.

Exciting at times, it carries the reader along effortlessly from the basement of a Russian museum to a jewelry artist in Seattle, to an ancient low country family in South Carolina. The love story, a staple of these novels, is at times somewhat tiresome rather than sensual.The fact that it's interesting, that it doesn't tax one's mental faculties, makes this a good book for the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so pleased","review":"I am a huge Elizabeth Lowell fan and have read all of the other books in the Donovan series and this was my least favorite.

Ms Lowell grabs you in the first page and holds you until the last page, and than leaves you wanting more. In each of her books about The Donovans she chooses a precious stone and makes it the center of her plot. She than builds her story and characters around this precious stone (In this case Rubies). The story and the main characters are than tied together with the history of the stone. Add to the mix romance, suspense, and murder and you have a read that's impossible to put down. If you are fan of Ms.Lowell you not be disapointed in this story. If you're not a fan you will become one after reading \\"Midnight in Ruby Bayou\\".

I also enjoyed the discussions of rubies, she places through out the book. Not only an enjoyable read but I learned some things as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I enjoyed this book but not as much as Ms. Lowell's other Donovan family books. The story moved along briskly and the romance between the feature characters was as expected. However, I was bothered by the apparent indifference of the hero to the innocent victims who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. As in the other books in this series there was a great deal of detail about the lore of rubies. I find this detail a definite plus.

It reminds me of when the band, KISS (aka Kings In Satan's Service) re-packaged their first three albums as \\"The Originals.\\" At least in that case you had an extra track of \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\", assuming you already had the album \\"Dressed To Kill.\\" On the other hand, maybe Hagee Ministries was using the KISS model, assuming that it wouldn't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy, compact volume of fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The RAT is still a classic for a reason","review":"The RAT may have been published over 30 years ago, but it still remains one of the most comprehensive histories of anthropological theory. Harris starts at the beginning, tracing the development of social theory which would lead to the birth of anthropology. This is something that few book do any longer, and it is very helpful. Harris cannot be said to be objective though, and he tells you this is his introduction. He is out to show the history of anthropology as a develpoment of his theory of cultural materialism. This isn't really a setback though, at least he is honest with what he is doing. Overall, the RAT is more far-ranging and comprehensive than any other history of anthropology I have come across, and I have looked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Turtledove Finally Run Out Of Ideas?","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Ever since reading the Misplaced Legion books, I've been a big Turtledove fan. Unfortunately, it seems like he's finally hit a wall. Into the Darkness is mediocre, at best. The problem may be that Turtledove is currently in the middle of three different trilogies. It may be that after 20 or so books, he's running out of original things to say. Whatever the reason, this book is a paint-by-numbers work. The characters, story-lines and politics are a re-hashing of his better efforts. Unfortunate, really. I had high hopes for this book. The setting is certainly novel. Maybe Turledove should focus less on volume and more on quality. However, Into the Darkness is one of his weaker works."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but confusing","review":"with so many characters and countries it is difficult to keep track of what is going on throughout the book. it seems that the story is told by basically going down the list of characters (at the front of the book) in the same order over and over again telling brief portions of events. since there are so many characters.. by the time you get back to see what is going on with one specific person.. you cant remember who they are and what they are doing. other than the confusion, the plot and imaginary world he creates is interesting. i just wish he cut down on number of characters to develope a few allowing you to become interested in them instead of so many that you dont learn or care much about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Mangled History","review":"Is this a fantasy book? I had trouble deciding. It looks suspiciously like Mr Turtledove took a pretty poor WWII history book and simply changed all the names, and then added a bit of repetitive chat between the many minor characters. How many times did I read 'We've beaten them' and then in the next section someone on the other side say 'They've beaten us'? I found myself laughing out loud at some of it, not just at the intentionally funny bits. Epic fantasy? Dont think so. More a rehash of Harry Turtledove's favourite subjects: the various conflicts of the twentieth century. What next, Vietnam with rabbits ala Watership Down? No, forget I mentioned that. Please, Mr Turtledove, you can do much better than this. Your USA/CSA series is intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start to a Good Series","review":"This is a good start for a good series. It is a bit slow, but very interesting. The characters are memorable and it is fun trying to figure out which country is which (Algarve being Germany, Unkerlant being Russia). This book is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, But Not Up to Turtledove's Standards","review":"I love Harry Turtledove, but this book is proof that his phenomenal productivity is taking its toll. Just compare it to his two other hardcover releases this year (!), \\"The Great War: A Walk in Hell\\" and \\"Colonization: Second Contact\\" and it's obvious that this is the runt of the litter. From page to page it's okay, but it's a draft -- there's little plot unity, with lots of battle scenes that don't really advance the story. I had hoped for a lot of clever and creative magic use, as in the \\"Toxic Spell Dump\\" series, but that never really materializes. The one subplot that revolves around magic is marginal to the story. Note to Turtledove: You have a great talent, so don't waste it on second-tier projects. What, you can't send your kids to college on the royalties from all your *other* books? Note to publishers: Pay Turtledove more money so he can put more time into fewer projects!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but great finish","review":"Like many others when I started reading this book I found it hard to get into. It was much different than other fantasy novels I have read but I quickly realized that Turtledove has his own style and it started to grow on me. I found myself enjoying this book immensely. I always liked reading about the history of other countries and this was like reading about the history of an entirely new world, although it paralleled ours very closely. I enjoyed the battles very much and the creature creation. I did think that there were too many characters to remember at first but after making it to the third book of the series it was like remembering an old friend.If you like war and large scale battles than this is the book for you, especially if you like them with a fantasy twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Unreadable","review":"This was the first and last Turtledove book I ever picked up. I came into it not knowing what to expect, but hoping to discover something new and exciting. I was very dissapointed. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages, and I'm not one to leave books unfinished. I read books for characters, to get into their heads and go through their adventures and their agonies with them, and when I'm 100 pages into a book and still don't know who the main characters are, or even who these people with all these unpronouncable names are, then I just can't take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Time meets WWII","review":"I am sorry so many people liked this book. I wanted to like it, but after reading about 200 pages of mindless ramblings, I just had to stop. I think the book was a good idea, but the author tried to do toom much. Also, since he has apparently written about 100 sequels, reading the books will most likely take longer then world war upon which it bases itself. Maybe Harry Turledove is really Robert Jordan in Disguise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Names","review":"I only read the first chapter in this book, so I can't comment on the story. But the names that Turtledove came up with are horrible. Its like he picked letters out of the alphabet at random and slaped them togetther. I could not tell if what the characters where talking about was a person, town, or country. He has over 100 major characters in just the first book, and about10 - 15 viewpoint characters. WAY too much for my tast, especially when you can't tell them apart. Another thing that turned me off was that this is a planned 6 book series, and if he is like everyone else out in fantast land, it will be more like 8 or 10. Save your money and go out and get something by Robin Hobb or George R.R. Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtledove at his consistent best","review":"This book furthers Harry Turtledove's reputation as an historically knowledgeable and consistent writer. Where his previous well known works have focused on alternate history, this novel takes a different spin on World War II by insinuating magic in place of technology. An engrossing and entertaining read with intersting characters and intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I didn't put it down earlier!","review":"The only reason I didn't give it one star is it had its moments - not many, but a couple. The characters are spread out too far to keep straight. Obviously from the reviews, this is a story about a world at war and it never ends or seems to have a point... perhaps that is the point. I have a VERY bad taste in my mouth after this book. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Turtledove Lost his Touch?","review":"As a total fan of all prior books by this author I was very happy when this book came out. But it really fell short. First of all, there are way too many characters, which prevents the reader from getting to really know or care about any of them. There are also too many different sides and none of them are clearly good or evil. Maybe this is supposed to be some deep philosophical message about the pointlessness of war, but it makes for a pretty pointless story. I regret the time I wasted trying to read through this. Even more, I regret the time that Harry Turtledove, probably my favorite author, wasted writing it, time that could have been better spent writing something interesting and exciting like the WorldWar series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doo Wop ?","review":"Im not much of a music connoisseur, but I was suprised to see my itunes classify this as blues.

They got lost in the punk andnew wave thing. They were just a great rock n roll band. I'mlate on this but the first two albums are in my top albums thatI still listen too and I'm really a hard rock and punk fan butlisten to anything. This album is just classic Knack with greatsongs. I've only listen to it for a few days but very good. Somesongs could've been on the first two albums. They didn't loseanything except the drummer. RIP. He was great.

It is a sticky clay type material. It didnt work. It got soft and gooey on the door we mounted the letters to and they let the letters slide off the door. Then the sticky goo had to be scraped off the door with a putty knife and then the door had to be cleaned and it was a mess. We went to an office supply store and got some similar mounting putty ( teachers use this stuff in their class rooms all the time I guess ) and it worked just fine. Letters have been on the door ever since and the daughter loves it. The paints supplied were good and the glitter glue they provided worked well. Brushes provided too. Just dont use the green sticky putty they provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, fun review of math and science.","review":"Gamow does a great job of teaching all the subjects that were so difficult to learn in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of heavy nu metal","review":"First off, I'd like to say that some songs on this album have a bit too much screaming for my taste, but overall it is a great high-energy album and perfect if your looking for something to bang your head to. Songs I recomend are synthetic, New Disease, Height of Callousness (still a great and addictive song even with all of the screaming!), seamless and negative space."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATH TAKING!!","review":"I never thought I would say this, but Spine Shank has put out one of the BEST albums of the year!! Height Of Callousness is a vast improvement over their less then thrilling first album. They have discoverd a powerful, intelligent and amazing sound for them selfs, that proves new metal is evolving by leaps and bounds! The vocals are shocking, and the lyrics are great! Most of them were written by the drummer! If you are looking to pick up the album of the year, I would go for this one, or one of the others which in my opinion is Mudvayne's LD.50, Nothingface's Violence, Raidohead's Kid-A, Soulfly's Primitive, and The Deftone's White Pony. Those are all the albums you will need. SpineShank is a band to keep your eye open for, because they are one of the bands leading the assassian strike team against bad rap metal and pop, and chessey punk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard better...not \\"best album of year\\" :)","review":"I bought Spineshank when seeing the \\"Asthmatic\\" video on MTV several times, and I thought that this album would be great. I am sorry to say, but this is another album which has only a \\"hand full\\" of descent songs. The single thing that turned me away from this, is that it has a little TOO much techno, it doesn't feel or sound balanced between techno and metal. I don't think that this band is heavy enough for me. For a truly, balanced, industrial band, I would listen to Fear Factory. Fear Factory has just enough techno/electronica, and it doesn't make the overall sound too muddy. I think that Fear Factory's \\"Obsolete\\" and \\"Demanufacture\\" are some awesome albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shank has proven to be ontop the metal food chain","review":"let me start off by saying that this album is just great. These fellas really know how to play their instruments unlike the untalented and unoriginal bands like Sodom, Venom, Running Wild, Iced Earth, Malficarum, Ragnarok, edguy, Megadeth, and Los Tigres del Norte. I seriously couldn't stop listening to this album for a while (well not at least until I heard Limp Bizkit's Significant Other and Results May vary, very intricate albums by the way)the guitar solos are amazing and the singer I think tops those sh*tty death metal singers like Chris Barnes, Chuck Schuldiner, and George\\"corpsegrinder\\"Fisher their vocals are very audible whereas these guys are very incoherent and brutal to the max I think this album deserves 10 stars but just because the cover looke like poop it gets 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Static-X is better","review":"Yes, I AM giving Spineshank two stars because they're too heavy, and yes, I know you're going to call me a poser who likes *N Sync. I'm sure you wouldn't DARE think I listen to bands like Nothingface and Static-X, and like meaningful heavy stuff. However, if you read the fine print in the liner notes, you'll realize that most of the lyrics are written by Tommy Decker, the drummer. This means that John Santos is screaming his head off to lyrics he didn't even write! I don't know about you, but I think that bands sound better if the vocalist wrote the lyrics. If you want proof, listen to Renegades by Rage Against the Machine then Evil Empire by the same band. Notice any difference?Please do real music a favor, and get Wisconson Death Trip by Static-X or Nine Inch Nails' Broken EP instead of this. I promise you, they're a million times better, and have better lyrics, of course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could give it lower i would.","review":"Simple not what I would call up to par. Spineshank is trying for instant stardome and is going about it in the wrong way. Trying to take the current rap-scheme in rock and put yet another dish in front of a already full table is like trying to milk us for our every dollar. These guys have not done anything new and interesting for me to eat up. The CD is short and the songs leave me wanting something more. Save these guys for an opening act to maybe...Cher?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Joking Right?","review":"How could anybody compare this to Revolver by The Beatles. I listened to one song and my brain ran away. I survived the 60's and 70's and listened to Pink Floyd, Van de Graf Generator and so many more you probably never heard of. By far there worse was better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive Sophmore Album by SpineShank","review":"First words: BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!! I made the decision that this is one of my favorite albums of the 2000 year. This is a great follow-up from their first cd \\"Strictly Diesel.\\" The only problem with this cd is...Best Buy or any main electronic stores didn't have it in stock (same case with Nothingface's Violence). This is a great cd and is more aggressive than their last one. Warning: If you listen to this cd in your car, keep it down otherwise it might give you road rage. The production on the cd is great. You can't really explain the album in words, so just go buy it. Trust me it will be worth the money..as for me it was well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who are these guys?","review":"I'm surprised I haven't heard of Spineshank before. The first time I heard the song Synthetic was on a radio station new music compilation, not to mention MTV's Return of Rock v.2. That song rocks, and if it gets any radio time, you're definately going to be hearing a lot about these guys. This is one of the hardest CDs I own (and I own a lot of hard s***), and there's some good stuff on here. Synthetic's awesome, and there's also a few good ones, like Malnutrition and Play God, but the song Cyanide 2600 is one you'll want to play while getting an exorcism performed. There's enough screaming and shouting with heavy guitars to make bands like Papa Roach blush (in that one song alone), and the lyrics are just as hate-filled. If you're expecting the rest of the CD to sound like Synthetic, you'll be in for a surprise. But if you like angry bands, by all means, pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vast improvement","review":"Not that the first cd was bad, but this one is definately better. The production is much better, the techno/industrial samples are used more effectively, and the guitars have the crunchiest tone I've ever heard. Not to mention, vocals are MUCH more defined and controlled. I loved their first album, but this one just blows it away. \\"Strictly Deisel\\" was very Deftones-like with a touch of industrial. \\"Height of Callousness\\" is more original, sounds kind of like a cross between Stabbing Westward, Deftones, and Powerman 5000. A must have for any hardcore/insustrial fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING album","review":"I wasn't planning on writing a review, but after reading the one provided by CD Now, I felt the need to voice my opinion. This album was one of the GREATEST cd's I have ever purchased. Spineshank is an amazing band filled with plenty of emotion. This album maintains a killer, heavy tone throughout all of the songs, but without having every song sound the same, or making the point of each song void. It leaves you with a sense of understanding where Jonny Santos is coming from saying what he is.This album is pure gold, I could not put it away for the longest time when I first bought it, and I still listen to it and enjoy every minute of it. I highly recommend it. Personal favorite tracks: Negative Space, Play God, and Transparent....but the WHOLE CD is unbelievable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is some bada$$ stuff","review":"I hadn't really heard much spineshank before, but a friend of mine had me listen to new disease and i thought it was pretty good. A while later i was browsing cd's and saw this one. It was cheapish (cheaper than on the website, that's for sure) and i bought it. This album blew me away, it's heavy, but doesn't sound repetitive, the vocals are harsh but make good use of melody. The guitar bass and drums are all constant refreshing assaults on your senses. Buy this album, i gauarantee you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely EXCELLENT","review":"There isn't an album out there that gets me pumped the way this one does. It rocks hard the whole way through but it's more than the typical screaming, each song is carefully crafted with pounding verses and catchy choruses. I have many albums but this one is near the top. Way to go, Spineshank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial Fans Who Love Metal Will Love THIS.","review":"If you are a \\"rivethead\\" with a taste for the Metal Flavour and are into acts like Fear Factory, Godflesh, Sepultura, Pitchshifter, Bile and even bands such as Deftones and Tool, then Spineshank WILL appeal to you...especially if you are bored to angry tears with sissy synth/euro-pop, future pop elektro, etc.Smokin' guitars excuted with razor precision, FF styled vocal treatments, tight percussion and just enough neat-o elektronics make this album, as they made Spineshank's previous works, a must have.The soundclips are here on Amazon.com's site, so check them out. I wasn't dissapointed, as you shall not be either.That is all that needs to be said...now go be a good consumer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd rocks","review":"I liked Spineshank from the beginning, when I first heard their debut cd Strictly Diesel. Obviously Roadrunner knows how to sign a lot of good bands to their label, and they hit paydirt again with the group Spineshank. While Strictly Diesel was awesome, it is not half as good as this cd. I was rocking out the entire time I was listening to it, it is one heavy cd through and through. Not only that but how Spineshank focuses on their music lyric-wise. Although I like Static X too, their lyrics are way to simple, not the case with Spineshank though. I didn't like how amazon reviewed this cd, it doesn't even begin to describe how good this cd is. I suggest you fully ignore the [Amazon.com review]and go out and buy this cd, you can thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS WAY TOO INTENSE!!!","review":"Wow, that is all I had to say when I heard this album. It is the most intense albums I've ever heard. Way harder than slipknot, these guys have raised the bar for heavy sound. This sound is hard to describe, its mostly electronicle,and some synthisized. I call it robot rock, because it truly is the sound of the future.To me, there are no favorite tracks because I like them all. This cd is definetly an improvement from thier last. It is going to be hard to sound heavier than this without sounding crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"reveals a lot","review":"great book. read with an open mind before judging. there are things in this book that can't possibly be made up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information book!","review":"I had heard about the book and had quotes out of it, but reading it has opened my eyes to a whole new understanding of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected!!!!!","review":"I loved the Book although I will say this.....I doubt very much enoch wrote it.

On the other hand once you lean the routines(it will take you like 2 min. to learn) then you can skip to a final run through section under routines. This will run through both dances on back to back repeat up to 3 times. The good thing about this is you can pick the music and theres no annoying chatter, which I really liked. Now your not going to win any marathons with this dvd but doing them both 3 times back to back you will get your heart rate up, and hopefully become slightly more coordinated and learn to move a bit more sexily.

The slow movements are tedious to the hilt, while aiming for the heartstrings, and the faster movements are done so \\"rapido\\" that it sets the head awhirl! Too slow, and too fast make for a poor mix. Throw in the fact that these are live recordings, with a sound that is rather hollow and clangorous, with an annoying brashness about it (probably stemming from the pianists' interpretations!), and you have a two-CD set that really isn't quality Handel. Keith Jarrett does, indeed, imbue these baroque masterpieces with the depth and dimension they deserve. His intimacy is spellbinding.

After quoting from portions of the TBD, the author then writes a number of chapters that illustrate what one gay man dying of AIDS might encounter as he enters the Bardo. He takes the abstractions of the TBD and makes them real. Since all of the experiences in the Bardo are projections of the dying persons mind, these scenes have many aspects - some pleasant, some not. They are much like dreams. Some dreams are repeated with different endings. I found it a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough info","review":"This is not a slight toward Amazon because it is impossible to have all the information about everything, but it needs to be mentioned that there is no teachers manual or even a solutions manual with this item.

The legs labeled xB appeared to match up with the screw holes at first glance; however, once I placed the mount inside the dash (without the radio) the legs did not quite fit. It looked as though they could be slightly bend and still work. With the radio secured to the mount it was impossible to mount the kit within the dash. I ended up having to remove the legs labeled xB(now it had no legs at all), screw holes in the side, and mount the original metal brackets from the factory radio to the last of the dash kit.

He doesn't vary the repeats, either with dynamics or with ornaments. In fact, he rarely changes dynamics at all within any individual movement, and never adds ornaments beyond what was written, either by Bach or by his students. In the 1st suite, he inexplicably omits the reprise of Menuet I. He stereotypes the different kinds of dance movements rather than making each suite an organic whole.And you know what? It works beautifully. I've spent hours just listening to the Allemande from his C minor suite, over and over and over, never growing tired of its hypnotic bounce, quiet optimism and elegance. The selections from Stanislav Bunin which round out the set are perhaps even better; definitely a worthwhile set."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure silliness","review":"Finn on the Fly is pure silly.

I was looking for an unbiased book to inform me of both sides of the conflict, and what I found was a book bordering on yellow journalism that uses a combination of careful exemption of key information and tone words to slight the Israelis. It's easy to take it as unbiased on the surface, but anyone who does research into the entire conflict and its history can see that the author leaves out many of the Palestinian horrors that contribute to it. I recommend the book for anyone that is searching for information regarding international law and Israel's offenses of such laws, but beyond that, I caution anyone looking for an unbiased perspective. If you do read the book, please keep an open mind and be aware of its bias, and always research into every claim to find a genuinely inclusive set of facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"One side only","review":"If you are only aware of the Pro-Israel side of this story or if you just want to read more Pro-Palestinian views, this is an interesting read.

The 'badly invented people', a.k.a. \\"palestinians\\", will never make peace with the Israelis because of the humiliating experience of having to wake up every morning and look at their fabulously successful neighbors who don't really give a damn about them or their brethren. Trying to \\"prove\\" that this is not the case seems to be the agenda of the author. But he fails miserably in this endeavor, as one can expect from a history twister like Phillis Bennis.

Damn, I even paid to see it at the theater. The picture is grainy, the plot has no plot and the shark scenes are obviously poor archive shots and extremely hard to see as well as almost non-existent throughout the movie.If you are drunk & bored, then watch this movie, with a little warning - You will probably laugh throughout the first half, (all of 40 minutes), then pass out thinking you had a very bad dream.

It cost me about two bucks and it was by Santana so I thought it would be worth it, and it definately was. While there is no singing on the album, the songs are amazing because Carlos Santana just lets loose and plays (roughly) 10 minutes songs that beautifully demonstrate his (godly) guitar skill. I am not a fan of jam bands like Dave Matthews and Phish, but this album is just so chill that I can't get enough of it; not to mention that it is nearly impossible to get in the US.

I've read Luther's Bondage of the Will and find it refreshing compared to Erasmus' position.

I love some of the music (from selections discs) from the Merry Widow and wanted to hear all of it. Unfortunately, some or all of the German dialogue sits between the songs. When I buy Oklahoma or My Fair Lady, I don't want to hear the actors speaking in between songs, and I don't want to hear spoken dialogue in German either. It's very annoying, to me anyway. Additionally, I thought some of the singing was much more mannered in this production than other versions I prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again!","review":"I must admit I was skeptical when I started reading Dr. Baers revised edition of Getting Control.

This book gave me even more useful information and self help skills. I especially liked the new theory on thought stopping. He covers all the new medications approved for OCD.

That section, at the beginning of each vegetable (the veggies are in alphabetical order, starting with Artichoke, ending with Zucchini), is two pages long.

I wish for all of you who have not made a movie nor have the funds to better one. You shouldnt down a movie because its not to par of a game or book. for one: for those of you who didnt play the game... how would you know \\"how it would or should be better?\\" two: the only way to better sell games, is to make movies of the games and comic books to keep alive, the only way to bring out to the public and show them whats out there. i for one (and a mother who loves video games as well) will go see this movie with anticipation. i love all the resident evil games and will enjoy the movie as well, i own the first and will the second as soon as it comes out.if you havent seen it, dont down it. and if you did, im jealous regardless how you feel about it.thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good action, but they tried to do too much","review":"This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie.I do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games. It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD.Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot. The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done. Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow-up to the first Resident Evil movie","review":"If you are the type of person that enjoyed the first movie, you will probably like this one even more. The movie starts to track the video game more closely and introduces the Jill Valentine character from the game. Jill and Alice make a great combo and the production is higher budget with better special effects and more action than the first movie. There are a couple of really unique action sequences that I have not seen done before. The entire key is to accept the premise of the movie and understand that the story and character development is mostly a backdrop to transition between action set pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Director bad move","review":"I liked the first Resident Evil, the visual style, the camera angles, the lighting, the characters, the casting, the sound track. The fact that they tried to stay true to certain aspects of the video game like the Train, and the scene where the guy was crawling towards Mia Jovavich was right out of the video game. Plus I liked the flow of the movie. I wasn't that impress when I first watched it but I find my self going back to it and watching it time and time again.The second Resident Evil (apocolypse) is alot different. poor lighting, quick flashy camera work(can you say music video) the movie has no flow, the music sounds like some old nintendo video game music, the cheesy one liner attempts, it just seemed like a bunch of action sequences that had no connection to each other, the flow of the movie was bad. I wish I would have rented this one instead of buying it. This was also the first DVD that the special features are actually better than the Movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, Stank, Stunk...","review":"I'm not a videogame nut, so I guess I missed this film's 'good' points. The only redeeming qualities \\"Resident Evil-Apocalypse\\" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts. Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed). Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc. Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right. 1 star, and that's stretching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","review":"Well I have to disagree with most of the reviews here. Usually the first film is the best and the sequel is not so good, but in my opinion Apocalyse surpassed the original film. Milla Jovovich was brilliant. I especially like the scene early on in the film where she crashed through the window of the church on a motorcycle ready to do battle with the creatures. I felt it brought the game to life, and so what if it didn't exactly follow the story line and characters of the game - films based on novels rarely follow the exact story line of the original book, so why should one expect a film to exactly follow story line of a game.I would definately recommend this film and I can't wait for the DVD to be released and will be adding it to my collection.Andy PryceBirmingham UK"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does not work in some players","review":"I bought this DVD at Best Buy thinking it was a pretty good deal to have both the first and second movie on one disc. I didn't watch it immediately and I've since lost the reciept which is bad for me because when I finally did go to play it, the disc doesn't work. It doesn't start, it just freezes the DVD. A friend of mine said he had the same trouble with the same DVD on his player -- which is a Sony. I have a Panasonic home theatre 5 disc changer. So its not just one dvd player that this version does not work on, but several. I'm guessing it is a flaw in the production.While the movies are fantastic horror flicks, the DVD it comes on in this case isn't worth the money you supposedly save buying a compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil Apocalypse","review":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse [Blu-ray]MILLA JOVOVICH, MILLA JOVOVICH.

But \\"Resident Evil - Apocalypse\\", it's disastrous. With a useless explanation by Alice of what happened in the first film and flashbacks. I think they made some kind of mistake when editing the film because the story can be confusing. The dialogues are bad and the performance terrible; why make Alice look tough in the film? And the zombies almost doesn't appear. The special effects are bad and Nemesis is just a mass of makeup, not to mention the music. The only good thing in the movie is Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory, which perfomance as a sexy policewoman reults unbelieveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"closer to 3 stars","review":"i didnt have high expectations to be crushed simply because this isnt that kind of franchise.this isnt like the disaster AvsP is.nothing is.but this is a typical big budget action/horror movie.i dont beleive in leaving my brain,the most important part of most movie goers,at the door,but i didnt have to.i kinda got the gist from part one and this continues from that well.if i were a rabid R/E fan then maybe i would be more thrilled with this.video games turned into movies doesnt really get my undying attention.something about it seems for lack of a better word,''fake''.i liked it enough where as i wasnt bored.i took whatever i saw for granted,i didnt get a headache if everything didnt make sense.so on those terms,its not a bad movie,coming from a person not a R/E fan to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, action packed sci-fi","review":"I was kept very entertained throughout the entire movie, I hope there is a sequel (from the ending it looks as though they have planned for one). I thought the first RE was scarier and perhaps a little more gory than this one, but this is way more packed with action and racing against time type plot with some suspense.

Most movie adaptations of video games tend to fall a bit flat. I don't think these two Resident Evil movies fall into that category, however. While the movies didn't follow the game as close as I (or fans in general) would like, I think it did a good job with story. Unlike most people I know, I'm kind of glad they didn't involve more characters from the games, as I already had their story in my head. At any rate, for $14 or so, you can't go wrong adding this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind blowing","review":"That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing.Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless.The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've always wondered","review":"How do so many people rate a movie that has not yet been released theatrically?

He's in Jill's team! Come on, people, do it right. By not having Chris, you can't have a Claire if you decide to make a third one. It's just an advice coming from a zombie flicks lover. We'll see.

Even the special features DVD looks pretty cruddy on the back. The other DVDs from the same shipment all arrived fine. This was obviously bad before it shipped to me.So I purchased a second one and darn if there isn't something screwy going on with some DVDs. The second one looks fine, but like my THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH dvd, it will not play in my regular DVD player. Somewhat of a fortunate bit of luck, I have a mobile player this second one will work in.Do I now return the second one by shipping the first one back?

Trapped with a small group of survivors, she is forced into finding the daughter of one of the scientists on the t-virus project, in exchange for passage out of the cordoned-off city. But now there's a new threat--along with the zombies and killer hounds, there is Nemesis, a post-human armored mutant. Lucky for Alice she's been given new abilities while she was sleeping. A great excuse for a lot of violence, with very little plot. The makers of Apocalypse don't really understand horror, believing, apparently that special effects and graphic destruction create terror. They don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrasment to the Horror/Action genre","review":"I love the Resident Evil video games. But this movie is sssssoooooooooo dumb I almost started laghing. This is the story line,\\"O crap, the zombies are attacking!\\" Than the shooting begins. And it continues through the whole movie, unceasing, unentertaining and unnessary. This is one of the worst movies of last year. So why, you may ask, did I give it two stars. Cuz the comic relief is hilarious! Me and my freind laghed the whole movie. Trust me, if you really want zombie killin action, buy a video game like Resident Evil, siren, The Suffering, or House of the Dead. If you really want a movie, buy the first Resident Evil Movie, its not great, but its infinately better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than some of the negative feedback...","review":"I enjoyed this movie from beginning to I think the end or was it the beginning.

Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this casehowever the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we theviewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better then the first...but that's not saying much.","review":"Paul Anderson shouldn't be allowed in hollywood period. The guy can't direct, and he can't write a good movie.His second try at the Resident Evil series, while better then the first, is still crap compared to REAL horror movies. It's kinda like asking to be kicked in the nuts once instead of twice...ones better but who really wants either option?I guess this is fine though for people who can't handle the real horror movies, like 15 year old girls and horny guys who only want to stare at the hot main star. It's generic and cheap looking at times, much more so then the budget would suggest.I would only recommend this if you can't handle real horror, or if you've already seen all there is to see in the form of horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love a good gore film","review":"I loved the second Resident Evil because I love those kinds of movies...zombies, violence, gore.

In my opinion this was a terrible sequel to a movie that I adore. For starters, it is unrealistic in its approach to situations presented in the Resident Evil world, and by taking away Alice's feminine vulnerability it detracts from her character a heck of a lot.The staged characters that are in the games are nothing like their counterparts. Jill, for one, does not do the character justice at all, nor does Carlos. And can I say that the other characters while at first seemed interesting, were killed off far too quickly to develop any emotional attachment to them.The pace of the movie was too fast and it was not easy to catch on to what we are supposed to be seeing. Not only that, but every five seconds it seemd like there is a fight scene that has no purpose what-so-ever as opposed to the balanced feel of it's predecessor.Overall I am very dissapointed with this title, and I would not recommend it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the first one...","review":"Shocking! Of course, i tried to take it on it's good points. Before i saw it i was looking forward to seeing the movies translation of nemesis. It was CRAP!

But i guess what can you expect, not much, since almost every video game to movie has sucked. The first one was bad, this one even worse. The movie seems achingly stale and repetive with some of the msot heavy handed action scenes complete with stale bullet time effects and slo motion and fast motion effects that have gone past expiration date. everything adds to ntohing. jsut maybe some geeks wet dream of the game coming to life. as a movie its hacked to pieces"},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say? Paul Anderson hates fanboys.","review":"At least, that's what he has implied by ruining both Resident Evil and Aliens vs. Preditor. Why oh why did Sony choose him over George Romero? He had a script ready to go, and then Anderson walked in and offered to do it for less money, and that was that. The same thing can be said about Aliens vs. Preditor. Dream projects like AVP and RE will never be safe so long as Paul Anderson is making movies.If you want the real Resident Evil expirience, I suggest you play the remake of the first game on Gamecube. If you desire a non-interactive adaptation of the games, read the books. If you must see just how badly Anderson botched up the RE mythology, then by all means see the movies.

This movie is all over the place and I was bored after two minutes. The only good thing about the film is Milla, although she is lost in the midst of a forgettable cast. And the zombies...oh my God this amateur director uses slow motion and some cheesy blur effect to make them \\"scary\\"!!! Terrible.

But rest assure, and what a great relief: this second one is just as awesome!! I love the Resident Evil movies so much that I never grow tired of watching them - and this is a person that doesn't' like one bit watching the same movies more than once.

The \\"Lickers\\" in the Church is a good scene, and a brief scene with Zombie Hookers is cool, and that is the two stars I give it. Nemesis (The huge monster villian in this movie) looks no better than a Power Rangers creature I kid you not, and the acting is non-existent. If you are the kind of person that will enjoy anything with the \\"Resident Evil\\" tag you may like it just fine, but people with a higher-standard on their action/horror films REALLY should look elsewhere..........the Zombie Hookers are cool though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Crap","review":"Lets just pretend there is no such thing as the first movie, and this is the only one. This movie had everything, even a little cheesy-ness now and then (not a good thing.) This is the reason why this is 4 stars, not 5.

Check this movie out, the only thing missing is Arnold."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting flick to see","review":"I believe this movie will put Resident Evil back into the good ol' zombie genre. The first Resident Evil was ok, to put it bluntly, the movie was very much different from the game as well as the books. The movie also didn't contain enough action and therefor left one sitting there looking at their watch. I would also watch which reviews I read here, as many of them are most likely written by 10 year olds who sit at home and play Resident Evil games all day. Overall, as a Zombie genre fan, I can only hope that the release of Resident Evil: Apocolypse, as well as, the remake of Dawn of the Dead do great in the box office."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMMMM...","review":"Ok first of all there is some similarity in the games, in the resident evil series of movies 1 was resident evil 1+2 and apocalypse will have 2+3.

He also describes his father's work, Vine Deloria, Sr., also an Episcopal priest.This is an excellent work which reveals the real world of Sioux life -- one which changed radically with the advent of the Europeans. He describes a saga of how his family, with his people, found ways to survive in a new world that was thrust upon them.Those who like this book should definitely read Deloria's \\"The World We Used to Live In.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly done rehash of old theories.","review":"The author might have sub-titled this book, \\"Wandering Around The World Talking With Every Crank Who Has An Opinion On Hitler.\\" There is nothing new in this book.

The style is pretentious and smarmy. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new under the sun","review":"I went into this book expecting a good, readable analysis of Hitler \\"explainers\\" and their explanations, with an approach more journalistic than historical (I wasn't disappointed; it is all of these things and more). I didn't expect to find material that was news to me ... but I did and it was the best part of the book. That is, the story of the Munich journalists who waged a war of words with Hitler before he came to power and sought to sound the warning that Hitler and his followers were not a legitimate political party but a gang of thugs and murderers. Of course, their warnings failed and most of these brave souls paid with their lives once Hitler assumed power.Also fascinating is the section on Claude Lanzmann, who despite the marvelous accomplishment of the movie \\"Shoah,\\" proves to have clay feet; he's an intellectual bully.A very rewarding, challenging and stimulating book on Hitler and the Holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it seemed like a great idea for a book","review":"Boring, pretentious, long-winded.

The theories about sexual shortcomings and/or deviations being responsible for Hitler being Hitler are ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Look at the Various Ways to Interpret Hitler","review":"This was a good book. The author did a nice job looking at, and evaluating the many theories on Hitler. I especially enjoyed the chapter on Hitler's Willing Executioners. Hitlers Willing Executioners makes an important point, but is impossible to read. This book did a nice job explaining the work in plain English. Also the book has an interesting chapter on David Irving. I also really enjoyed the chapters dealing with Hitler's sexuality and Freudian Interpretations. Again, this book is a great overview of the many ways to look at Hitler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly illiterate and truly fatuous.","review":"I am 55 years old and have a master's in journalism. I am a professional copy editor. When I read this book I became so frustrated I came close several times to throwing it away.This book had to have been published without an editor. About every third sentence in the entire text is not a sentence with a subject and verb -- instead what you get is a clause, dangling by itself, with a period at the end.Also, the author must have sat down before he wrote this manuscript and compiled a list of every obscure word he could find in the dictionary -- or worse, German publications from the 1920s and 1930s -- and made sure he used every last one.If I knew a way to ask for my money back I certainly would do so.This book is a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating idea if you can wade through the prose","review":"Quite frankly, I agree with the professional journalist/copy editor.

The chapter entitled \\"Dark Matter\\" is particularly weak, whereas it should have been at the very core of the book. In an attempt to summarize the Freudian psychoanalytic \\"explanation\\" for Hitler, the author bases his entire argument around one cause, that Hitler may or may not have had only one testicle.

It was that uncle who in turn convinced Adolf's father, Alois Hitler, illegitimate child that he was, to assume the surname of his purported father (and uncle as well!) rather than retain that of his mother (the comic Schicklegruber). Adding to the colorful history of this family is that fact that Adolf's mother is none other than his father's much younger half-niece (after his father had consorted with other women). This curious parentage is seen to be paralleled by Adolf's own obsession with his own young half-niece (and eventual suicide/murder victim) Geli Raubel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short of Title","review":"Although Explaining Hitler does shed some new light into the complexity of trying to explain Adolf Hitler, Ron Rosenbaum fails to come to any conclusion of his own.

Yes, the book is graphic and yes, the book is REAL. The writing is quite smoothly written, however, constant tautology gives the book an overall boringness to it. This does not take away the greatness or the interest of the book, in case. Rosenbaum's vocabulary was quite extensive and some may need a dictionary near by, especially during his introduction. However, for all you word freaks out there, this book is quite for you. But you must have some type of interest in Hitler and a large interest into how he became what he was: A monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant student of Albert Schweitzer's method","review":"Rosenbaum has indeed done for Hitler interpreters what Albert Schweitzer one hundred years ago did for Jesus scholars, he shows that we do not study the past to learn about the past but to learn about ourselves. But where Schweitzer remained sceptical of all attempts to get to the real Jesus, Rosenbaum in his last chapter seems to succumb to one particular interpretation of Hitler, that of Lucy Dawidowicz; this constitutes a failure of nerve on his part. Nevertheless, Rosenbaum has performed brilliantly and his book should be the starting point, perhaps even the finishing point, of all study on Hitler. It occurs to me that the most important thing in life may well be to understand Jesus and Hitler! Yes, that is exactly what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious Asides","review":"This is not really a biography of Hiler, it is more of a search on the margins of the impact the world may have had on Hitler and the influence he had on the world in a very personal sense. It could be best compared to the books of Gitta Sereny, as both authors examine those scarred and impacted by Hitler. Rosenbaum seeks out the places of mystery and people on who Hilter made a lasting impression. It is a journey to try to unwrap a riddle that may truly never be solved. Hitler is not a cut and dried, black and white issue, he is shades of grey, and Ron Rosenbaum effectively presents a lot of these shades. To understand this man of evil, this is a most important book, best complimented with John Lukacs'\\"The Hitler of History\\", Sebastian Haffner's \\"The Meaning of Hitler\\" and Percy Schramm's \\"Hilter as a Military Leader\\" which while dont complete the man provide much of the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot on","review":"Very good book.

Rather than that, the book focuses on other people's attempts to explain the unexplainable mind of Hitler. While the book does have its good moments, I found it to be uninteresting at best. Rosembaum seems noncommittal and at times even afraid to present his own ideas about the subject. For a insightful and thought provoking book try Hitler:The Psychopathic God or other books by the men that Rosembaum critisizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Socks","review":"These are the best socks so far I have bought from Gold Toe.

Would highly recommend these socks for work, play or just about anything. I would also like to add that Pima Cotton is different than regular cotton, it will last 50% longer than regular cotton and is highly absorbent which is good if your feet sweat a lot. It is somewhat thicker and softer than regular cotton and warmer in winter.

One for my Trek 5000 carbon racer which is really light. The rack holds it well.The second is for my sons older Raleigh clunker. It's heavier but not super heavy. It rips the rack out of the wall. I have both mounted into cinder block using number 1/4\\" plastic anchors and a number 14 screw. The leverage on the small securing plate is extreme. Why didn't Racor make the plate longer? or use 3 screws? or have a supporting bracket at 45 degrees from the rack to the wall? The pressure on the top screw is immense. I will try a lead anchor to see if that will hold.So if you are going to screw this into wood, make sure you have a very secure anchoring spot and a light bicycle, or get a different bike rack that distributes the weight better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for road bikes and Came rusted","review":"First, this is -- as other reviewers have stated -- only for road bikes. Mountain, commuter, cruiser or hybrid bikes will not fit on this rack. The same is true for women's frames. Since these frame types represent the majority of bikes currently in the market, I think this is a serious drawback of this product and one that should be indicated prominently in the product description, if not the Product Title (i.e. it should be called a \\"Folding Double Road Bike Rack\\".I was also somewhat disappointed by the condition of the item. The hinge was rusty. I don't know if that impairs the strength of the rack, but it is not okay in a newly purchased product, and it did make the rack squeak when I folded it up and down. Also, two of the screws arrived stripped. Still I might have simply returned it for an exchange, if only our bikes had fit on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"works as advertised hold up one bike without a problem .

The third time putting the bikes on the rack though, the rubber coating ripped off of one of the supports, I'm going to have to wrap tape around it to keep it from coming all the way off. I'm sure I should have lifted the bike higher instead of just pulling the bike off and it may not have happened.Also be sure to pre-drill for the mounting screws as they are fatties. I stripped one pretty good trying to skip that step.All in all an good solution for storing your bikes up and out of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted.","review":"This review is for the single wall mount. I bought it about a year ago. Installation was easy, and, initially, it worked very well. However, after less than a year of moderate use, trying to keep my bike as centered as possible on the mount, the holder has bent severely to one side. As of right now, it still holds the bike, but I don't expect it to last much longer (and it looks ghetto). The torque to one side also cause the mounting plate to dig into the dry wall. I know this is a cheap product, so my expectations weren't that high, but it should last more than a year. I won't be buying from this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"does not work, does not work, does not work, does not work , does not work , does not work, does not work.

First the quality - the metal is thin and with a single bike the arms move a lot. Second - there is no flexibility in the spacing of the arms so that one of my two bikes wont fit on it without laying on the brake cables. I would never park a car under or beside this thing - sooner of later the bike on it will fall. Definately would not recommend this thing unless you have an extremely light bike (Carbon road bike) and dont want to put anything valuable near it (like a car)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike rack!","review":"Item arrived on time..Great bike rack!

Then I went to the hardware store and got some different screws and it still fell off.

Since each bike is for a different member of the family, they are all different sizes (20\\", 17.5\\", 15.5\\" & 13.5\\") and types (Mountain & Racing). One problem is that the space between slots for the two bikes is too small. That in combination with the different sizes and configurations of the frames makes it impossible to line up two bikes. I tried every combination and was unable to get two sets if handlebars, wheels, pedals, etc. fit consistently. Also, the small spacing causes the bikes to rub together a bit too much for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable, lacks durability.","review":"I had this rack for just about a month before returning it.I had it fixed into a brick wall - so had to buy new anchors because the ones that come with it are puny. Even with the new anchors it came off of my wall in a couple of weeks (had 2 bikes on it). The holes in the rack aren't really big enough to hold anchors much bigger, so I don't know what you'd do....In terms of fitting bikes on it - I had 2 on it, but the outside one wouldn't sit properly, it sat with the front slightly raised and off the arms because I just couldn't get enough clearance.....pedals would get in the way, or handlebars resting on seats. I got enough for them both to sit there, just not quite 100% flat on the arms.Then there's the arms.....they come coated in a nice rubbarized(?) black plastic. Within a week it had started splitting and by the end of the month it had completely came off one of the arms and was shredded on the other.

I installed it and here are my comments.PROS:* easy installation* lightweight* space savingCONS:* not safe for heavy bikes. the triangle piece that hold the bike up is not continuous (not one piece). it hooks to the sides of the bike holder by about 1.5 inches each side, and rests at the base. so, if you push the bikes sideways a little, the whole thing will fall on top of you because the hooks slip out!! i know this because it happened to me. (i pushed it sideways to see if it is sturdy - NOT A GOOD IDEA). I had to rig it to make it work...by tying ropes so the triangle piece will not slip out.* not for heavy bikes (example...mountain bikes)* not big enough to hold two adult bikes (they don't both fit in the grooves provided)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not stable","review":"The double is great even with 2 bikes b/c of the bottom support.

Instead of joining Paramount Pictures, and other studios on the brink of Depression Era receivership, Universal thrived! Americans flocked to see the Monster. Poverty Row studios tried to cash in with their own \\"Monster\\" flicks. Thus was born \\"The Monster Walks\\", released in 1932. The story involves people in an old dark house on a stormy night menaced by a killer ape(see short man in gorilla costume). If extremely poor filmaking intrigues you, pick up this lemon. Otherwise, save your dollar. The sets are so cheap they waver, and threaten to collapse at any time.One bright spot is the performance of Mischa Auer, a Russian actor emmigrant in a small part as Hanns.

I've never been happy with the arrangements in most popular sheet music, especially \\"PVG\\" and \\"Easy Piano\\" sheets -- they are too simple and have almost no left hand accompaniment to speak of. Generally, there are no chords or arpeggios -- just single note \\"plink, plink, plink\\" etc. while the right hand has to carry the whole song.On the other hand, many of the arrangements in this book (and in Dan Coates \\"Advanced\\" and \\"Professional Touch\\" books in general) have *wonderful* left-hand accompaniments and dramatic chording and other nice touches for the right-hand. Difficulty ranges from intermediate (\\"The Rose\\", \\"Open Arms\\") to advanced (\\"I Will Always Love You\\").Sure, if you're talented enough to arrange for yourself you might find fault, but for those of us who just read and play and like to play popular music, this is an exceptional book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commonplace","review":"I should have read the reviews more carefully before I bought this book.

The book suffers from long stretches of tedium and some serious lapses in plausibility. The two villains, supposedly ultracompetent supercriminals, seem amateurishly inept at times, and the good guys' narrow escapes often owe more to luck than skill. An awful lot of time is spent on Jane's marital problems, which might have been more interesting if we could figure out why she married this guy in the first place.

My love affair for Irish Spring was born again. It left me fresh for many hours with that rich fragrance. Those are virtually gone except for a small dispenser I tote with me when on a road trip. It was time to get more.This time, however, I opted for that pack of 3 bars of Original Irish Spring. Yes, I'm being frugal as much of that precious liquid escaped to the shower floor.However, the fragrance of the bar soap is not the Irish Spring Original. Not even close. Yes, it's the same striations of various green hues. And it's a pleasant fragrance which I really don't know how to describe.My suspicion? Colgate-Palmolive got their perfume batch from one of their other products mixed in with the Irish Spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I always thought of Irish Spring Soap as ...","review":"I always thought of Irish Spring Soap as having an overpoweringly strong smell, but now it has a pleasant, fresh smell. It lathers great, especially when using a washcloth. Also, the bars seem to last longer than Zest, our usual soap. That's great if I don't need to buy soap as much. My whole family uses it, our youngest being six years old. I'd definitely buy this soap in the store, when my three bars are used up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"Unreadable.

You can take multiple shoot with one button. Very easy to use.There are few things I don't like. There is no time stamp function. It may not bother you, but I like that feature. It may be there, but I can't find it. There is no viewfinder. You probably don't need it coz its 2.5 in LCD is big enough for you to see what you need. Lens cap is not auto.

The panasonic TZ1 camera takes great pictures in a variety of settings. Pictures have excellent colors and are very vivid. The multiple scene settings work quite well and all of the macros are set for you. If you prefer manual settings, this camera does not have the option. Taking short movie clips also works well except the sound is somewhat faint. We have been very pleased with the quality of pictures this camera takes and we also have been very happy with the variety of settings that are already configured. We are new parents and are very happy to find an affordable 5MP camera with reliable settings so that we don't have to fiddle with our camera while hoping to catch baby smiling, crawling or just being cute. Battery life is also very good - over 200 pictures per battery and multiple short movie clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice camera...","review":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet... I LOVE this camera -(so far)... I've used a Mavica camera for the last few years, constantly changing floppies (I sure don't miss that) The pictures are fantastic - and can be absolutely HUGE.

I think I definitely made the right choice with this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lumix zoom camera","review":"Overall a great camera. It is the smallest 10x zoom that I have seen.

Amazing 10X zoom, Leica lenses... Only dislike, from my point of view, is the manual lens cap (should be automatic)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We were drawn to this camera due to the 10X zoom and many favorable reviews. Unfortunately, the photo quality using the zoom is very poor (extreme blurriness), making it virtually unusable for that purpose. No doubt our results would be better using a tripod, but if I wanted to carry around a lot of equipment I'd buy an SLR instead of a compact. Since the 10X zoom is of no use, I would have been better off buying a better camera with less zoom but that is smaller and that has more megapixels for the same price. Regular (non-zoom) photos are OK but lighting, focus, and stability can often be a challenge. Even at regular settings, I've never had a camera that produces so many blurry photos. While the camera sometimes performs well, occasionally it inexplicably refuses to focus and the flash seems erratic. After a couple of years of frustration and very inconsistent results, I am shopping for another camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd bought a Canon","review":"After 10 months I've decided to sell my Panasonic DMC-TZ1. There are too many things I don't like about this camera--the noisy (grainy) photos, the slow USB 1.0 interface, and the fact that I can't hold onto the camera without my thumb changing settings. I had no problem dealing with the lens cap, and the larger size and weight were tolerable. I'm just not happy with the quality of the photos, and I'm going back to my old flame Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One qualm: not great in low light","review":"Overall, this is a fantastic camera that I'm extremely pleased with.However, I bought it to take pictures indoors without flash.

My mistake was believing the Amazon reviews. I wanted to like this camera, it is beautiful, jewel-like, and a pleasure to hold. Operation is a bit difficult due to reflections on the lcd display. But the clincher was the picture quality. More than half of the pictures I take in any situation are out of focus. I majored in photography in college and know how to hold the camera still. The focus is poor even in photos at the wide angle setting, depending on the lighting conditions. Very disappointing!

Unless my flawed example is just a one-off, I would recommend that customers avoid this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penn Plax Heater","review":"I have bought two in the last three years, and both have broken in the area by the bottom heating element. Penn Plaz has a full lifetime warranty, but keep the number, because upon return, they will ask you what item number it is. I guess they don't have the availability to either look it up, or have the number on the product itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Beethoven!","review":"These are brilliant performances of Beethoven's first four piano concertos! Russian pianist Emil Gilels originally recorded all five Beethoven concertos with the Cleveland Orchestra and conductor George Szell in 1968 and 1970. Gilels plays the four concertos on this CD set with extraordinary poetic expressiveness, and the Cleveland Orchestra plays with the crisp precision always demanded by the legendary Szell. The remastered sound is absolutely outstanding. Awarded a three-star rating by the \\"Penguin Guide to Compact Discs,\\" this two-CD set should not be missed my any fan of Beethoven's piano concertos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Laughs: The Best of Dennis Swanberg","review":"Just a hodge-podge of video clips poorly done.

The movie I was looking for was actually the one that, on this DVD is called \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\". I was very pleasantly surprised to find that movie, plus four other great war movies also included on this disc! The quality is good, remastered newsreel footage. I am enjoying this DVD even more than I had expected. If you like watching footage of the damage that is done by the eight .50 caliber machine guns of a P47 thunderbolt, you will love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayers is a great anime series and Next is better.","review":"Slayers overall is a great anime. The second series, Next is even more fantastic. Xelloss is an awesome character as well as the characters from the first season. The first four tapes are really great, and the rest of the season, I expect to be even more spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Liner Notes!","review":"A previous reviewer heavily praised this 2-volume set, and I do not dispute him with respect to the quality of the performances. However, a fatal flaw is the lack of any liner notes whatever. Had I known that, I would not have bought the CDs. For an English-speaking US citizen, the lack of the German lyrics, along with English translations, makes a collection of lieder almost worthless. Arghh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont pay attention to any other reviews","review":"This cd is musically great, vocally new and different from anything you would think this cd is. That is why its great, they took a chance and im sick of hearing bad reviews and how no one enjoyed it because it wasnt as the sun sets. Well guess what, this is Daughters. Not As The Sun Sets. They broke up and formed something new and different, and in my opinion something just as good. Buy this cd, listen to the cd and enjoy it. Dont be a idiot and expect music not to change. If you like Canada songs, listen to it. If you like as the sun sets listen to it, but open your doors and blast this cd top volume and just enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible CD","review":"If u liked as the sun sets or ether of the other daughters cds do not buy this one.

Give employees a financial stake in how the company performs.In summary, experience shows that employees at open book companies act like owners. Case shows exactly how to do it.Give this book to your boss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Tudor buffs.","review":"Mattingly sets forth in very lucid prose the amazing and seldom told story of a woman noble in character as well as birth. Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, is the first wife of England's Henry VIII. Though a foreigner, to the end she is deeply loved by the English people. But that does not save her from Henry's machiavellian machinery when she fails to produce a male heir to secure the Tudor dynasty. Although she eventually loses the battle, we see a woman of lion-like courage, refusing to buckle in an age of moral compromise. Her stubborn dedication to both church and country, and her deep love for her husband, make her a spiritual example to Catholics & Protestants alike. One wonders if there is any other figure of her time who comes off half so glowing. In a word, integrity! This is the English Reformation told from Catherine's perspective-- a fascinating tale and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful and classic biography of Henry VIII's first queen","review":"A masterful work that is a classic biography of Henry VIII's first queen, Catherine of Aragon. Mattingly set a high standard with this work, painting a very credible and sympathetic portrait of this obstinate and devout woman who defied a king's will and set the stage for the launching of the Protestant Reformation in England."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a ukulele player:","review":"Don't listen to the guy from Tennessee. This is a fantastic compilation. Any ukulele player, Hawaiian or otherwise, will tell you that most of the musicians on this CD are the ukulele greats. Ohta-san, Cliff Edwards, Roy Smeck, Lyle Ritz, George Formby and others show what can be done on the tiny instrument that many consider a toy. They show us what a great instrument the uke really is. Cliff Edwards, known as Ukulele Ike, plays and sings with his wonderful voice. Some may know him better as the voice of Jiminy Cricket. Tiny Tim's rendition of Tiptoe through the Tulips is fully understood when one listens to the original 1929 falsetto version of the song by Nick Lucas. (Listen to it here on Amazon.com.) Oh... and there are plenty of Hawaiians on this CD. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"There really isn't a bad track on the CD. \\"Making Love Ukulele Style\\" is one of the best. It's a very good introduction to the ukulele. I only wish I could find more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your ukulele in your hand.","review":"This is an entertaining CD. It covers a variety of ukulele playing styles and music styles. It shows all those non-believers that the ukulele is something more than just a toy. It truly is a beautiful instrument and a beautiful sounding instrument. This is demonstrated by the performers on this CD. Most of the performers are virtuosos, but the most famous ukulele player of all time, Tiny Tim, technically wasn't very accomplished. Not to say that I don't like Tiny Tim, but his playing is amateurish next to the other performers here. Anyway, this CD covers a lot of different styles and it quite entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"I am disapointed with this CD. This is not Hawaian! It's more like 50's music. Amazon should not have put this in the Hawaian section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money or time","review":"Very grainy film quality, poor sound quality and not exciting enough to hold 3yr olds attention. I was very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intention but execution is lacking","review":"I really feel that those involved had very good intentions when producing this dvd, however there are some fundamental flaws with this product. Primarily, the delivering of the production quality is quite low in its excessive use of graphics and extremely poor sound editing. If we, as parents, are seeking a calm and centered experience for our children (especially children with special needs) than the poorly mixed audio and the overabundance of animated graphics has to be avoided.Also, the instructor needs to pace her cues and model centeredness if this is to be more effective.The instructors words are sincere and much appreciated and I really wanted this dvd to be a success. I hope they produce a sequel that will address these issues.Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"Bulgari is a wonderful brand.

The devotionals are the perfect length - not too long, not too short. Each one is memorable and is easy to meditate on during the day. It's music to my ears when at the end of the day I hear, \\"Do you want to hear what my devotional was about today?\\"With that said... this devotional may be a let down if your man is into research and intense study of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps u on track","review":"My hubby and I had a very difficult year and half ago where he had an affair and we were separated. By God's grace, I was able to forgive him not forget and step by step he is able to forgive himself. He recognizes the need to place boundaries in areas o his life that may lead him astray and also leans on God to carry him through. Although he is am avid reader of theology and now has a ereader, he found this book a quick and down to earth devotional that reinforces God's message and mission as a husband. I was well pleased and so will you if you get this book. We all need a \\"back on God's track-quick\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schumann with zing","review":"Pick up this bargain-priced two-fer of Schumann's four symphonies, recorded at live performances in the early '90s and conducted by the late Hans Vonk, and you won't get period instrument textures (a la Gardiner or Goodman) or the textural \\"retouching\\" that once was so common (as in George Szell's cycle). You won't hear the music subjected to rethinking (a la Harnoncourt) or \\"Romantic\\" emphases (a la Bernstein or Barenboim). What you will hear is a direct, energetic approach that is traditional but also fresh, and which neither overstates nor understates the case. The recorded sound is a bit on the hard side, but this is a set to live with--as I have for the past four years. Vonk, whose conducting career was sadly cut short by illness that forced him to retire from the directorship of the St. Louis Symphony, was often identified with the music of Schumann, and this set is compelling evidence of why that was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Collectable","review":"I bought this for short money so I am still quite happy, even though I can't play it. My turntable only does 33-1/3 & 45 RPM. They are not kidding when you read 057 RPM on the jacket. It is fun to see what a Japanese single would look like and the disk is high quality. I wish I could find these tunes on CD though because so far I have only been able to buy 2 CDs by this band and they are one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"A poorly written attempt to lay a guilt trip on western civilization that is equally matched with mediocre acting.

Ms Sterns use descriptive lines that seem to have come out of those old sixties era detective novels. Than there are phrases and name that seem to be trying to drawn you back to a Victorian time. She has several story lines linked together only by death and the inability to deal with that fate. I found that I couldn't quite learn to like any character due to their lack of true human emotion.

I found this tape far more useful and enjoyable than the Susan RoAne tape I bought on the same subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance","review":"I really wanted this tape to be effective. It is important for me to improve my conversational skills in my job if I hope to advance. The tape is just hard to listen to. It is like listening to someone just ramble on and on. It is a taped seminar and I can only assume that the author was required to give a 2 hour presentation. The problem is that there is only about 15 minutes worth of material. The author repeats herself constantly, gives 5 or 6 examples of points when 1 is sufficient, and really just beats around the bush instead of getting to the point. She tells many stories about herself, which frankly are not engaging. Really there is nothing of value here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where or when is this author from?","review":"This book is just horrible. The author gives tips on catch phrases like \\"Nice weather today\\" and other such horrible conversation starters, and ice breakers. I don't suggest this book for anybody looking to break their shyness, or anybody trying to continue a conversation with anybody but a 5yr old. I don't understand who the author wrote this book for, but it is either for a very very small town, or a very very small town in the 1950's. But if you are one of those people who actually want to learn how to continue a conversation without akward pauses, and want to learn to continue or make a compelling conversation with yourself and your partner then I suggest Talking the Winners Way by Leil Lowndes. She gives 92little tricks with examples to make sure you won't forget them, after you read it, it almost becomes a part of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to listen to","review":"I had a hard time getting through this one. I found the delivery very irritating and the content very weak. There were a few valid points but all the useful suggestions on the tape could have been done in about 1/10th the time. Alot of repeated information and \\"fluff\\". Most of the information was superficial, the speaker was not amusing or clever or even insightful, and the overall theme sounded like a seminar for manipulative used car salesmen. If you are interested in this tape I'll gladly give you mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and obvious","review":"The author/speaker took a lot of time to say a very few useful things. The rest was more like a course in conversational good manners for 10- to 12-year olds. I found Ms. Fine's delivery to be quite irritating and not at all illuminating or inspiring. Thank goodness for Amazon.com's return policy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cassette provides a common sense apprach to small talk","review":"This cassette was more of a reaffirmation of what I (and most people) already know. Although it did not give much new insight, it clarified some ideas that most know but do not use. The trick is to implement the ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the whole a pretty good book.","review":"Overall the book does have a good amount of useful information to provide to the reader. Some of the other reviewers have penalized the book for being \\"geared towards businesses.\\" Admittedly, there is a good amount of \\"business talk,\\" however I still think the book on the whole is geared towards anyone. I took off one star because I think that some of her suggested questions to get things going to start a conversation, keep one going, or end one are pretty ridiculous and unrealistic. However, she does have some interesting questions/statements that can be used for conversations, and I do agree with a significant amount of what she is talking about.Even with what I feel are some slight flaws, I would still recommend this book to anyone to read. Overall it is an easy, fast, and practical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing book","review":"This book truly changed my life. It contains tools that actually turned social contact from a dread to a delight for me. Thanks to the tools offered in this book, I am no longer clueless at conversations. I used to believe that good communication skills are inherited not learned, and I surely didn't have them. But practicing the skills taught in this book has actually turned me into a confident small talker. The book has fundamentally changed my viewpoint about social contact. I look forward to parties and social events now and get great feedback too. The book simply and clearly delivers what the author claims in the title. I recommend it to everyone: people who shy away from social events as well as natural smooth talkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful, Period.","review":"I am a 21-year old male who lives in Los Angeles, and I was looking for a book that would help me get off to a good start with people I was meeting for the first time. I wanted a method for finding appropriate topics to ask questions about based on the context and situation I was in at a given time. This book did not deliver at all; among other things, it gives you a list of stock questions that don't necessarily apply to situations most people find themselves in. Does the author really expect us to approach a perfect stranger and ask them, \\"How has the Internet affected your life?\\" or \\"If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what would be your biggest regret?\\" I don't know what kind of demographic this book was written for, but its definitely not for anyone my age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"I consider my self pretty well read in this genre of self-help books. The first thing I would share with anyone reading this review is that the advice offered in this book is pretty obvious and sometimes just plain bizarre. I know this has been shared in other reviews of this book, but after reading some other \\"independent\\" reviews of this book I felt compelled to tell you the honest truth about this book. The lines offered in this book on initiating conversation with strangers in social settings made me and my sister laugh while reading them. They are both awkward and bizarre at the same time. If you're looking for a good book on sharpening your social skills keep moving cause this is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money","review":"I am a sales professional and am constantly looking for books to help better myself. This was definitely not one of them... This book was simplistic and lacked advise that would apply in the real world. The overview suggests that this book will help you with networking and business relations but very little of it applies. If someone approached you at a business function and asked you \\"What was the best job you ever had? What was the worst?\\", what would you think? How about \\"What would you like to come back as in your next life?\\"? These are just a few of the lame suggestions this author suggests to \\"break the ice\\" and begin a conversation. I wish I could return this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I hate small talk books that make such a big science of the whole thing. Debra presents a means to develop the proper attitude about small talk. She gives techniques and examples. She is funny in relating stories and empowering in those techniques. I came to Amazon to see if I could find any other audiobooks by her. Those reviewers here who called her presentation tedious are way off the mark. I often listen to this tape in my car and I find myself entertained as well as trained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Not helpful at all","review":"The \\"icebreakers\\" proposed by the author, supposedly to be the jewel of this book, involve so many personal questions. I am afraid that that will do more harm than good to people whose targets are conservatives. Furthermore, the author had wasted too much time to elaborate the importance of small talk. I think the potential readers know that well or they wont pick this book up at all. Even worse, the writing is real boring. In short, not recommended. For those who want to read something to reduce their fear in public gatherings or to improve their social skills, \\"How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing With People by Les Giblin\\", \\"How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie\\", \\"How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships by Leil Lowndes\\" are much better alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"More harm than good","review":"This book starts off by letting you know that by being shy you are being perceived by many as being arrogant, haughty or pretentous. Great, so it's worse than I thought. What follows are alot of open-ended questions that I can never see myself using and some very general advice about body language, social personality types and so on. There's not much substance at all that I found to be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much there","review":"A slim book with a lot of white space. Wish I had read the book over a cappuccino at a local bookstore rather than actually buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw her on a morning show","review":"I saw this author on Today/Good Morning America. She was promoting her new book, that came out in December. Maybe I shouldn't review this book, since I haven't actually read it, but her advice on television was ridiculous!!!!!! She was talking about striking up conversations with people at Christmas parties. I would feel like an idiot bringing up the topics of conversation she suggested. I hate being mean, but I just don't get how this lady is a best seller of books on improving social skills! The only book I've read on the subject is 92 little tricks for big success in relationships (I think that's the name) By Leil Lowndes (something like that) Her suggestions have helped me a lot!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful book","review":"It is a good book because it teaches you the basics for starting a conversation and keep the same going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly helpful.","review":"I founded this book helpful to fill in some social holds. Many times I find myself in a position were I am always meeting new people backgrounds unknown. Reviewing the information in this book makes these moments less awkward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of weird conversation topics","review":"Offers kind of weird conversation topics/starters - this book isn't for everyone, I'm sure there's a better option for people hoping to learn some of these skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fianlly...help for the conversationally-challenged","review":"The Fine Art of Small Talk is fantastic! Author Debra Fine gives wonderful ideas and tips for starting, maintaining and ending a conversation. The Fine Art of Small Talk is perfect for anyone who's less than completely secure about his or her conversation skills, anyone who wants to overcome feeling awkward or tongue-tied, and especially for anyone who wants to learn to gracefully deal with people who talk to much, offer unsolicited advice, etc., etc. I've found that the tips in the book are perfect for both business and social settings. I can tell that using the advice makes a big difference in how people respond. The Fine Art of Small Talk really has had a positive impact. Be warned, though: you may - as I did - see yourself among the list of the author's \\"conversation offenders!\\" Not surprisingly, the book is written in an engaging, conversational style and, in addition to being helpful, is extremely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it as a present!

Watch out for their ... fanaticism, especially from the Vienna woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Gem","review":"The best recording of Turandot. Better than her 1959 recording with Bjoerling. Her effortless high notes over chorus and orchestra at the end of the second act are beyond compare. Corelli, when he was in voice was superb. He is in voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memory of Franco Corelli","review":"I saw Corelli toward the end of his career, back in the days when the Metropolitan Opera toured the country each spring. He was Romeo and, in his mid-fifties, made my then-19-year-old heart beat faster. He was a wonderful singer, and romatically convicing to boot. In \\"Turandot\\", he is at his best, singing a role so challenging that few tenors attempt it, except the absolute best. His singing is ringing and virile, but also has grace and nuance. This role, I think, defines his abilities as not other does. Treasure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great body wash. It left ...","review":"This is a great body wash.

Hope this author can do better.. she might wanna stick to her magazine, before runing to the bank on being a book author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew? Maybe because of the 3rd grade reading level?","review":"I was intrigued by the hype--Bridget Jones/Sex and the City/Nancy Drew and figured this would be a good summer read. I assumed the heroine would be smart, tough and funny (a la Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum but without the unfortunate fashion sense). Sadly, the plot was predictabe and simplistic; White tries to throw in twists to keep the reader guessing, but the whiny characters that never get past two-dimensions leave the reader not really caring who did it or why and just wishing they could off the rest of the cast. Bailey has more panic attacks than your average Paxil user and never rises to the occasion of spunk and toughness that great female detectives reach. Boring boring boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this was a book club choice at all.","review":"This reminded me of mystery novels I read as a kid. It took me 3 weeks to finish because it just didn't hold my interest. It seemed so standard and ho hum for adults. I wanted to get away from the serious and depressing books from other book clubs and just enjoy a good mystery. This just didn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Silly","review":"Ok...I picked up this book because of Kelly Ripa's recommendation and I don't think I'll ever read another of her book selections again. This book was easy to read, but it was quite boring and therefore, pretty far from entertaining. First of all, it seems like half the book is spent describing what the main character, Bailey, is eating, where in New York City she is going, and how she is getting there. WHO CARES??! Then, I found one motive for the murder/murders to be sooo completely absurd that it was laughable...\\"there's a big plot to kill all the editors of women's magazines.\\" Oohhh, what an idea. I'm sorry, but once again I have to say, \\"WHO CARES??!\\" I am honestly and completely surprised by reviewers who are giving this book great reviews. It makes me wonder what their intellingence levels are. Do they like to watch Ricki Lake and wrestling?? Well, needless to say, I would never read another book by Kate White again and I'm sad that I actually spent money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing read","review":"If you want a funny book that deals with magazine publishing, check out Marian Keyes \\"Sushi for Beginners\\". It's not out in the US yet but can be ordered through Amazon.uk.It's a much funnier book with heroines who actually qualify as \\"gutsy\\". I thought \\"If looks could kill\\" was very [bad] and the main characters were a pretty unappealing lot. Must the women in this books be obsessed with men that treat them like they're disposable? Do most of the men have to come across as jerks?The mystery itself was not terribly clever, the characters were cardboard and there wasn't enough magazine publishing details to really make it fun. Personally I would have much preferred a version where the detective was the deposed editor in chief (i.e. the Helen Gurley Brown character. At least it would have been a little more imaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off tha woozas","review":"This book very good. I like to read book when alone in home. It keep me on toes.

And you know what? It was fun to read. It was fun to read the writing itself. But as a book, it just wasn't very good. The only time I got excited was when I thought that maybe the whole \\"A Bailey Weggins Mystery\\" was a brilliant device to keep us from suspecting that Bailey would get killed in the end.

The first person past tense makes it feel like Bailey is retelling her story to you...but in a boring way. I didn't feel the suspense of being there with her, solving the mystery. Also, I couldn't identify with Bailey's character. She lets her boss, her lover and many others walk all over her.

Three hundred and fifty pages led to a ridiculous and disappointing ending. Do not waste your time or money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and simple...","review":"I was interested in something along the lines of Johnathan Kellerman. What I found instead was a simply told and predictable story. It had no twists or turns. It was written on a level that would hold a teenager's interest. That could be due to the fact that the writer is an editor for Cosmo mag (correct me if I am wrong). I like books that are fun to read, but I expected this to be spooky and mysterious. It wasn't. The few attempts at plot changes and twists turn out to be false. Usually when I finish a book, I am almost sad that I am done.

The past relationship between the Coast Guard and Admiral Loy's progeny lends serious questions about morality and nepotism. That the Admiral's progeny continues to receive preferential employment now from the TSA, leads any thinking person to question the credibility of the author. The Admiral's words ring hollow.

This book is all about the women he's known, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's full of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at describing sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended.

The group definitely matured from the first 2 outtings, and to me it was what they needed. A good swift kick as now they cranked out one of the angriest albums out there. It even rivals with Anthrax's \\"Persistence Of Time\\". It kicks off with \\"Love Destruction\\", and I should say it pounds off because it's ferocious. \\"Party and Beligerent\\" is I believe a cover of a underground punk group of the 70's, but it's raising Cain right here. The crescendo actually occurs on the title track which is the last song on the cd. From the mindsplitting guitar riff to the angriest vocals out there it's just full of rage, and this released shortly before Clinton was innaugurrated. Well anyway... this was thier pinnacle as thier next album \\"Chill Pill\\" bombed, and then they disappeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the picture","review":"The product I reveived is just grease, and doesn't resemble the product pictured in the least.

An earlier book - \\"From Sabbath to Sunday\\" provoked some debate, and has been effectively answered in \\"From Sabbath to Lord's Day\\" (Carson, ed.) Bacchiocchi however seems unable to get to grips with the the case made by former SDA scholars like Robert Brinsmead, let alone those in the theological and historical mainstream, which long ago demonstrated that Sabbatarianism of either the Saturday or Sunday variety was something of a non-issue in the early church. Bacchiocchi lays praise for the Sabbath on thickly, but stands in danger of missing the point entirely. Just how brittle Bacchiocchi's apolegetic is may be gauged from his championing of schismatic sects having their origin in the now non-Sabbath-keeping Worldwide Church of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soap that is hard to find","review":"I have used this mild, pleasant soap for years.

I called the telephone number on the soap and was informed by Dial that their Dial Basic was the identical product and the Pure & Natural label had been discontinued. So instead of spending a fortune on soap from here, shipping cost more than my 9 bars, look about in the supermarket for Dial Basic because it's the same thing with different packaging.

Di Stefano one of the top three tenors of the century. You must be joking. He has no high notes. The voice is flat. There is no ring. There is no squillo. There is no pathos. He can't act. Should I go on? He only is famous because Callas chose him as her choice for tenor. Why, because he can never outsing her. Sorry, but Di Stefano is totally unremarkable, and if you open your ears, try the following: Corelli, Gigli, Pavorotti, Carreras, Domingo, Caruso, Del Monaco, Lanza, Bergonzi, Melchoir, Kraus, Gedda, you get the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine introduction to a renowned operatic pairing!","review":"Choose this reasonably-priced CD as a gift for a friend, or even to yourself. It provides a fine introduction to the renowned and near magical operatic duo of Maria Callas and Giuseppe di Stefano. There is a rare electricity here, their voices blended well, and they sang with tremendous conviction together. The \\"Puritani\\" excerpt is perhaps the weakest but still shows them in fairly good stead. And the Tosca? The lengthy excerpt (most of the last act) of their 1953 classic is generous by any standards. The Miserere from Trovatore, while a short excerpt only, is precisely etched and haunting. The Manon is propulsive and the Boheme is charming. Have friends who THINK that they wouldn't like opera? I've dazzled a good dozen by showering them with this invaluable \\"little\\" purchase---one of the rare real bargains in this lifetime. This was one of my first opera purchases, and I haven't stopped since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Callas & di Stefano","review":"I think Callas sang her best when singing with di Stefano - their voices seem made for each other - they blend beautifully (I've heard that Callas sang with Jon Vickers - I'd like to hear that someday). Both Callas and di Stefano are passionate singers and these duets are perfect for their voices, in my opinion. Callas' voice is almost strident at times (which accounts for the incredible emotion she could bring to operatic songs) but di Stefano's voice seems to balance the sound out. I enjoy di Stefano very much - and when I hear him I always wonder if Domingo patterned his voice after di Stefano's. Another great CD worth having in one's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The opera pair of this half century.","review":"the opera pairing of this half century, Di Stefano and Callas. Both had a dedication, and passion that has been unmatched. Callas the greatest singing actress of all time, and Di Stefano, whose unmatched beauty of voice is still talked about. Callas said of Di Stefano \\"He sang like a god.\\" The only pairing of equal prestige was Caruso and Ponselle."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET IT","review":"This is the best opera CD ever produced whether or not you think Callas or di Stefano were the best female and male opera singers ever.

It also gives specific examples of the concepts and formulas to show how to use them.This book doesn't just cover the fuel cells themselves but goes into fuel reforming, pumps, electric motors and DC/AC inverters.

The characters are so pathetic, it is painful to watch. However, there is no real plot to thie movie, beyond \\"life sucks.\\" Imagine if the whole point to the movie was \\"life is great\\" and showed happy people. It wouldn't be considered a masterpiece, it just would be considred pointless and trite. Also, those conversations between Bill and Billy never would have happened, they were just put in there for shock value.The one thing I liked about the movie was Bill's wife was so condescending towards Joy it kind of makes me glad her husband was so messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy?","review":"If you consider this to be a comedy, then go rent \\"Schlinder's list\\", you'll laugh your lungs out!Now, seriously, I know that the director of this movie always felt alienated in his life -he said it in an interview- and through his films examines all the dreadful and sad things about life. Well, this is just not very pleasant stuff for me too watch on films.

Another part of me, after watching this movie, wants to condemn the creators for their explicit depiction of these desires, namely, the father who fantasizes and acts upon his desire for tween boys. As the above reviewers have noticed, this movie makes it it's mission to concentrate on negative-\\"Let's stir up some controversy!\\"-shock value.If I were making the comparison between the 'behind the scenes suburban lonliness' movies that I have seen; I would certainly say that movies like American beauty or Donnie Darko had more of an effect on me.What I am left with after watching this movie isn't a lesson, or a moral.

The separate but inter-related stories of social interaction in today's society. specifically that of the netherworld known as New Jersey, is simultaneously a hilarious mockery and poignant expose of humanity ---- people are lonely, deprived, weak, and most of all, stupid! It is brilliant in its vision alone, if not the actual execution of the vision on film. I laughed my asp off, squirmed, winced, and came away thinking \\"Yeah, it's really like that, isn't it.\\" If you are unable to see past the elements of the messenger (pedophilia, etc.) to get to the message, then please, don't see this movie, and especially do not comment on it! This isn't the type of film to be embraced by the mainstream and win awards, but if you want to be entertained and like satire, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me feel uncomfortable...","review":"I think everyone should be subjected to this film.

Simply put , it is the story of three sisters and the \\"comings and going of the people that pass in and out of their lives\\" ( sounds very after-school-special-ish) Except for for the fact that this story involves pedophilia, dismemberment, suicide, masturbation, rape, not to mention dogs eating semen. absolutely amazing film, with all around great performances, however I am no hurry to see it again in the near future, (similar to the effect of \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick and Twisted","review":"This is a sick movie.There are 5 intertwined stories involving 1 family.A father who is a molester.three sisters who lives are just not what they expected...A Grandfather who decides to leave his wife after 40 years.and another neighbor who is a killer.This movie is funny nasty and pittiful at the same time..The person who wrote this has a sick mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly boring","review":"The people in this movie are creepy, all right, but unfortunately there's little if anything interesting about any of them. This is one of those movies in which you're sure something is going to happen any minute now, but nothing ever does.In reaction to the reviewers who are making a fuss about \\"child abuse\\" in this movie - well, it's not there. A little suggestion or two, but hardly anything to work up a sweat over.In fact, there's nothing at all in this movie to get worked up over, or even to wake up for. This movie might be good to put on the TV if you have unwelcome houseguests to get rid of; otherwise, NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere...","review":"I can't believe I wasted not only my hard earned money, but my precious time watching this DVD.So many people have referred to it as \\"brilliant\\", \\"funny\\", and \\"artistic\\". It is none of the above. The characters in this movie are sad, boring, lonely, sick, and perverted. I made the mistake of pausing the movie on many occasions just to get a break from it. Unfortunately, that only made the movie seem three times longer than it really was.Please don't make the same mistake I did by buying/watching this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad state of affairs","review":"I found this an extremely disturbing movie - in the same genre as American Psycho. It has some really disturbed people... and Moliere style - it blends them into a noxious brew. I had to view this for a class - and I've done that... as entertainment or something deep even to watch with a good friend it is a bridge too far. I'd not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely look at humanity","review":"I think what resonated for me was Solendz' extraordinary insight to the quality of delusion-- either self-induced or reactionary-- that pervades modern life. All his characters in Happiness, and their interactions, are based to varying degrees on misconstruction, or misinterpretation, of reality: the fly in the ointment that acts as common thread and common ground for all. The perversity in the movie is just more of the same emotional/intellectual disconnect joining everyone at the hip/groin/head/hand/foot. They are all skewed. No one is truly able to see or feel the world without faulty thinking and perception altering the outcome. If it isn't their emotions getting in the way it's their thought processes.I love this movie. Recommended for anyone old enough to understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to watch","review":"I must admit I never expected to be this disturbed by a film from the USA. The director, Todd Solondz's ability to provoke such a reaction can only be an expression of his masterful filmmaking ability, however no-one should expect to like this film. It is not entertaining. But it is life.Whereas others seem to be able to sympathise with Bill Maplewood, or pity him, I'd be more inclined to sympathise his son's friend. All things considered, the kid has not much of a hope for the future.I give this movie a very high rating but stress that it is not at all enjoyable. It shows us things we'd rather not see, and every single character could actually exist, and probably does. The bottom line is we need movies like this, that open our eyes and show those of us who don't know from experience how harsh the world can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps one of the Greatest Comedies Of All Time.","review":"Some of the reviewers here who hated \\"Happiness\\" seem to suggest that that they are not 'uptight, conservative or nave'.. Well this movie was truly about them; their denial and their failure of autonomous cognition as psuedo-moralistic sheep of society.Thank god that a lot of people don't get this movie. This movie was made to alienate and subjugate mediocre americana.\\"Happiness\\" is a 'top-ten' cult classic and will stay that way for a long while. This is absolutely one of the most scandalous and devious comedies of all time, reminiscent of early John Waters but less-overt and more psychological. Brilliant in its subtlety within a perversion of american ethics du jour and one of the best comedies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strangest movie I've ever actually liked","review":"I can honestly say that we got this movie because we thought it would be sort of a funny look at Happiness. Strangely, Happiness is the LAST thing this movie is actually about - instead its about a lot of people who think they are happy and then arean't. In a strange and disturbing way, this movie turns out to be a fascinating look at the often unspoke of side in our society - really worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sickening realistic","review":"I pray that I never live with any of the situations in HAPPINESS. Why is it so sickening? Because unfortunately, it is a reality for many people. Todd Solondz unflinching look at familial angst and human perversion creates an unsettling movie that sticks with you for weeks. ... From the uncomfortable discussions between Bill Maplewood and his curious son to Philip Seymour Hoffman's twisted fascination with female voices, this movie never pulls punches. All of Solondz choices are justified and needed to propel this story forward; nothing is gratuitous when you realize he is being true to his characters.This isn't a movie for the faint of heart; it's a brutal look at selfishness and perversion, and how they are the downfall of mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filth!","review":"This movie glorified the shock value of sexual peccadillos to its maximum. I actually felt violated watching this movie. Completely unentertaining. Made me feel very uneasy watching it. It seemed to have no point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I thought this a slow, poorly written, poorly acted film, that tried to get a rise out of the viewer with shock value, like a comedian who has no talent, so resorts to toilet humor to get an audience response. To those who were offended by the pedophile stuff...I don't know how you could have been, the acting and directing and writing of that whole episode was so amateurish, for it to shock, those involved would have had to have some TALENT!! I saw DOLL HOUSE and liked it okay, but this movie didn't work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness","review":"Happiness is certainly not a movie for everybody. Since I like movies like \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\", I thought \\"Happiness\\" dealt with the same explicit matter. I was wrong. Happiness is a immature, disgusting, coward piece of movie. We are introduced to a man that has strong feelings for little boys. There's a guy who makes random explicit phone calls to women while he pleases himself. There's a woman who tries hard to make herself happy. But she always picks the wrong road. I ask myself, is this entertainment? Or is it drama? Should we feel sorry for them? These is the kind of people I dread to meet. You never know who they are until you know them. This movie is complete junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing film","review":"This is a very disturbing film. I didn't watch the whole thing because I was so disturbed. I even got scared of it towards the middle. It started off kind of funny and I thought it was just a dark comedy. As it went on it was just disturbingly dark, not funny at all. I understand the meaning behind it, which is a good meaning, people are different behind the scenes, everyone wears a mask. That's what this movie is about. Yes it's sick...is that wrong? No, different strokes for different folks. Everybody likes diferrent type of movies, this could be yours, it may not. I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Society's human waste products on display.....","review":"This movie motivated me to quickly jump in the shower and scrub thoroughly.

Excuse me while I go vomit again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Squeamish","review":"Ugh. You'll find yourself saying that many times during this dark movie. Yes, it's a good movie. No, it's not a cheerer-upper.All the characters in here are depressing .... Except maybe the housewife and writer. And speaking of the writer--WHY DOES SHE ALWAYS HAVE TO WEAR BLACK? That's the oldest stereotype in the book. The first and only movie director to have a writer character finally NOT wear black, should win the NOBEL PRIZE for ORIGINALITY and NOT SUCCUMBING to dumb stereotypes.This is one of those four-star movies that get four stars for technicality and artistry. But it doesn't get four stars for putting a smile on your face or making you feel good.It's a good movie, but not for everyone. I know some people will disagree with my review and what I've said. That's fine with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Awful DVD","review":"Nothing more needs to be said about how excellent this film is. HOWEVER, if you get the DVD, it is one of the worst quality transfers ever...there is so much pixelization and artifacting that people's heads actually pulsate and change in some of the close-ups. Unwatchable. TRIMARK should be ashamed to release such a travesty. Are all of their DVD's so cheaply made? Buy the VHS instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome film from Todd Solondz","review":"I had no idea what Happiness was about when I bought it, but I had seen and loved Welcome to the Dollhouse, so I took the chance. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. Solondz takes filmmaking to the next level. What's great about this movie? The colors, first of all. Notice that everyone's clothes, every scene is painted in bright, summery colors as if trying to brighten up the mood of the film. All of the characters are over the top (Phillip Seymour Hoffman is unbelievable), but that's what makes it fun. These are people that could be living next door to you, if only you knew all of their secrets. This movie is about people trying to find their happiness, people who are blinded by the glare of their life and convinced that they are happy. A truly awesome movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, reality on-screen","review":"This was the most breathtakingly REAL film I've seen in years: a true slice of life from the REAL America, which Hollywood usually tries so hard to whitewash over. There is no lazy, comfortingly formulaic outcomes or cheap moralizing here---just beautifully brutal and brutally beautiful honesty. The humor is jet-black, subtle and brilliant.A lot of people are not going to like this film's refusal to give them what they're used to seeing or what they would like to see of themselves and the world they inhabit. A lot of little universes are bound to be disturbed by this film---and justly so, if not long overdue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Disturbing Film Of All Time","review":"Happiness is a great black comedy/drama it is by far one of the best films of all time. The film pushes the limites so far dealing with subjects most films want even touch. Most studios wouldent even disturbute the picture cause of its content it is rated NC-17 for a reason. But the film is true and honest possibly the most honest film ever made Todd Solondz made a great and honest picture. The DVD is good you get the NC-17 version pluse good sound and picture quality.WARNING: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Adult Thems including thems of Rape,violence,Pedophiling,Masturbation,Sex,Language,and other graphic disturbing subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such potential...","review":"After seeing this movie again after 2 years, its weaknesses are even clearer. So many obviously unrealistic lines and a general contempt for just about every character. It's also unsettling to imagine the child actors' perceptions of what they're called to do in this film. Some isolated terrific moments, but, overall, too cartoonish, too self-consciously controversial, and just basically unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"What an awful, awful film. As to the much-vaunted \\"taboo\\" subject matter, nothing rings true. Its perfectly legitimate to attack difficult subjects, but to simply exploit them in an attempt to add fire to an otherwise flat script and unimaginative direction and production merely bores and offends (the intelligence, not the sensibilities) of the audience.

But for anyone with an open mind (and a strong stomach), this is one of the funniest flicks out there at the present time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting garbage, disguised as art","review":"This has to be the worst film I have ever seen, for a multitude of reasons. I only gave it one star because it wouldn't let me give it none. Besides its' sick perversity, the script is at best dull (only moved forward by ever more disgustng acts of moral perversion), the characters are cliched, and the dialogue is stiff and unnatural. This is shock-cinema at its' absolute worst. I find it amazing that the film all but celebrates pedophiliac serial rape. I deeply regret seeing this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the director's problem, not ours","review":"As a young film whelp, I prided myself on having an iron stomach. I sought out \\"challenging\\" films like \\"Salo\\" and \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" to prove to myself that there was no movie too dark for me to appreciate on its own merits. I don't know whether I got soft with age or just realized that real life has enough unpleasantness of its own, but I walked out of \\"Happiness\\" (just after Dylan Baker fantasized about gunning down people in the park, if that tells you anything), wise enough not to mistake the nausea that Solondz had successfully induced for anything like artistic accomplishment. Or, to put it in cruder terms, a sociopath can throw his excrement in your face but that doesn't make it a Pollock."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but this is NOT art, it's just boring and sick","review":"You are probably thinking, \\"WOW half the people here think it's a masterpiece and the other half think is sucks! This is a must-see movie.\\" Well that is not the case. I really don't understand what people like about this movie. I don't understand what is it they like about a movie that portraits misery and pedophilia. This movie is so boring and at some points so disgusting (literally not metaphorically) that when I saw it at the cinema, about a third of the audience left at the middle of the movie. If you want to watch a movie about suburban life I would highly recommend AMERICAN BEAUTY. Finally my advice to you is, 'find someone who owns the movie so you can see for yourself before actually decide that you want to spent money over this'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with this film.","review":"More like, disturbed and forever traumatized. Okay, maybe not to that extreme. Maybe I'm just not used to the whole \\"pedophile\\" concept being portrayed in films but this movie just made my stomach churn. I don't find happiness in watching perverts fulfill their own happiness.My only favorite scene was the first scene of the film with Jon Lovitz \\"No you're not!\\". Jon Lovitz, great guy. Too bad he only had one scene. I thought I had made the right choice renting this movie, but after that scene, it went all downhill from there. I do understand why it's titled \\"Happiness\\", but it's just too overwhelming for me. Child molestation is a very serious topic, and I don't find it something to be joked about.Good thing I only rented it (based on the raving reviews on Amazon) and right after watching it, I jogged back to the video store and returned it ASAP!

I could have watched something a lot more enjoyable... I practically had to hold my eyeballs open to get to the end....MY ADVICE::: Watch something else instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted and totally gripping; very overlooked","review":"This movie isn't for everyone, but it you like independent film and can handle a look inside the dark side, give it a try. It has everything to capture the audience with pure freakiness--masturbating crank callers, a teen trying to learn how to masturbate and asking for advice, a pedophilic father, a woman who cut someone up and put him in the freezer, and that's just scratching the surface. I'll admit that at times I didn't know where the movie was going, but I was always interested in learning more about the characters' sick, twisted, and intertwined lives. Give this a try if you are adventurous and can handle a dark, dark, dark comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't watch it","review":"This film was gross, shocking, dark and uncomfortable. I really wish I'd never seen it. I can't even begin to understand why it gets such great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"NASTINESS","review":"I am hardly an uptight person, making me all the more surprised that this is a film I could barely handle. This movie sat with me like a bad meal I just want to get out of my system. I normally like unusual and groundbreaking film. And I did like Welcome to the Dollhouse too. But this movie, aside from it being slow... this movie was perversion in the guise of art.Some things are better left unspoken. Unless you need to have your eyes opened that perverseness can be your neighborhood superdad, I'd say the aware people have no use peeking in the window of a pedophile's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sick & twisted film.","review":"This is quite a disturbing and challenging film. It is entertaining in a sick sort of way; but after it was over, I wished I hadn't seen it. The direction and acting were good, but the story was just too disturbing for me. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most offensive movie. Ever.","review":"There is nothing funny about molesting children. If you think this movie is \\"cute\\", \\"funny\\" or provocative, then you either don't have children...Or shouldn't.This film is hideous, offensive, and insulting to human beings. The director, actors and fans should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick. No thanks","review":"Go see a real movie. For instance, American Beauty. THIS is a REAL movie.

Save yourselves, your family, and your friends, and never, ever watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, unappealing and offencive","review":"I rented this movie with my girlfriend to watch on a saturday afternoon expecting it 2 be like \\"very bad things\\" a black comedy. I found NOTHIN at all funny in this entire movie. The \\"big name\\" stars in this should b ashamed. The use of children in this movie is nothin short of vile. How this could be called \\"ART\\" is beyond me. I found this movie more offencive then KIDS and all those other so called \\"controversal\\" movies of the 90's. This was not shocking it was symply gross and a movie I would go as far as saying \\"should never have been made\\"I gave it 1 star as it did have an appealing cast, who did nothin to make this movie anything more than trash. In the bin is where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"relax, calm down, listen, think","review":"I see many negative reviews on this film. Do you people have an imagination? Lighten up. Sure the film may let some in on a little more then they care to know about and yes it may also stomp through the dark territory of the mind so what? Just because you people cant handle it does'nt make it a bad movie all around. To those of you easily turned off or on by other peoples opinions i would simply just advise you to see for yourself. And to those who cant seem to understand that there are disgusting things in life out there and apparently dont wish to deal with these things and write bad reveiws on other peoples works stay inside your cozy homes and stay out of our consciousness. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Desde Siempre' is 100% for Latin Lovers(and everyone else)","review":"This generations most consisted and best latin ballad artist.

Yeah, go ahead call me whatever you want. But just a warning to you youngun' virgin ears. If you can hardly handle the edited \\"Real Slim Shady\\" well don't buy it. I have the whole edited CD and sometimes i just hear nothing in the song for a few seconds while they edited out all his perverted comments that made him so \\"great\\". I'll give it up a little. Some song on here are good, but if your expectin to hear fun, hyper songs Like \\"Real Slim Shady\\" Maybe you should try something else. This is one of the CD's I'm hoping to sell to somebody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem's Got It Here","review":"Okay, I really didn't like rap until I heard The Real Slim Shady at a school dance. I thought it was pretty cool so I bought the edited version of the CD. IT ROX! I couldn't believe how something so controversial could be so expemplary. If anyone actually listens to the CD, they would know the Eminem doesn't really mean anything in his rapping. Most people don't like rap and just read the lyrics, but its not about the lyrics. I mean most of the time, you can't even understand the lyrics at first! This is a good CD for people who have overprotective parents. IT ROX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a listen or five","review":"it's true that this isn't the Slim Shady EP dark joy-ride. however, it is a good 2nd offering, and it would take a miracle indeed to live up to his debut album. he isn't producing albums with the intent of pleasing his fans, and if you listen to it for the venting and production that it is, i think fans of his previous album will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album....","review":"Eminem comes very good on this album. When I first heard \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" I was so mad. I was worried the whole album was gonna be like that.. its not. From the first track \\"Kill You,\\" until \\"Criminal,\\" Eminem gives off very good lyrics. The best tracks in my opinion are \\"Stan,\\" \\"The Way I Am,\\" amd \\"Marshall Mathers\\". But the rest of the album is very good also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD is the best I've bought all year. It is better than the Slim Shady LP by a long shot.

Even me, being a huge rock freak, i enjoyed every track on this CD. Eminem dishes out one great song after another! The only exception is \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", which was obviously only incluided to get a real radio song in the mix, as it totally kills the whole flow of the album and the wicked beats. Anyhow, pick up this album ASAP cause it's Eminem's best yet and surely one of the best of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marshall Mathers LP","review":"Eminem's new cd is awsome.

He also raps about stupid things. Even the Dr. Dre beats on here aren't even all that to me. A few good tracks, mixed in with a bunch of lame ones. Em has the skill to make a really hot album, but he needs better production. This album sounds very corny and cheesy at times. Em's best album was the Slim Shady LP where he proved himself to be a witty and funny lyricist. He tries way too hard to sound all hardcore on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"<---is there a way to add another star here???","review":"I bought this album way back in the day. I think when I was 16 or 17. All I really remember is that when I heard it I LOST MY FREKIN MIND!!!! It was like nothing I had ever heard. Eminem is a wordsmith . Through every song you can live out his point of view clearly, regardless if you agree with it or not.This was always in the car and always in the stereo at home. I could still listen to the whole thing straight through.

I have not bought a rap album since Public Enemy's \\"Fear Of A Black Planet\\" in the very early 90's. This cd has restored some of my faith in rap music as a credible music form. He's not spewing out how rich he is or how many cars or women he has, instead he just goes off on, well, everything. But, Eminem uses his rage to create some very witty, surprisingly intelligent and savage lyrics which will make you fall out of your seat (either from shock or from sheer laughter). A bit rough around the edges, true, but he pretty much offers a commentary on how things really are, which we need more of in a somewhat phony society. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem is tight!","review":"Eminems Cd is one u should by, but if u got to be all perfect and doesnt like things that are violent and harsh about sociaty be cautiosh when u by it its filled of that but if u dont care ITS A PHAT CD! by it if u want im just giving u advise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem- modern poetry for the modern world","review":"If anyone thinks that no real thought, emotion or skill goes into producing a Rap album, they obviously haven't listened to this album! No words can describe what I feel when I listen to \\"Kim,\\" (arguably the best Eminem song to date.) The emotion is so real- you hear his voice crack as he screams and cries- had it not been for him doing the female part as well, you'd almost think it actually happened! Eminem's skills are unmatched and his poetry more impressive than anything I've ever heard. He has tamed the English language and made it work for him in ways that no one else has. It's almost sad that so much of the world can't appreciate his talents enough to take him seriously- not that HE cares at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy lyrics and great beats combine to form a great album","review":"Eminem returns with a second great album, The Marshall Mathers LP. NOT FOR CHILDREN OR TEENS, this album uses strong language to speak about tough upbringings and the consequences of drug abuse. It DOES NOT glorify the use of drugs or violence (as anyone who has listened to and grasped the lyrics would know) but does not hide you from the truth. A must-have for fans of the Detroit rapper."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best release","review":"but that isint saying much this cd is alright at best i hate when people sell 9 million records you dont deserve that there are so many emcs that have been in the game long then em and 10 times doper that none of the people who purchased his cds will ever know in there lifetime ex.Ras Kass,BigL,Chino Xl by the way eminem style is so jacked from chino xl's its not funny and slick rick eminem jacked his style to yet people think he is the best the greatest show some respect you pop loversFavorite Track:Bitc*h Please II,Remember MeGuests:Sticky Fingaz,RBX,Dr.Dre,Snoop Dogg,Xzibit,D128 of 10 lyrics 8 of 10 beats"},{"rating":"1","title":"too old, too quick","review":"well, ive been an eminem fan since \\"slim shady lp\\", so i just had to have \\"marshall mathers lp\\". i got it on the first day it came out. and the first 2 months i had it i loved it! my favorite song is \\"Stan\\". but like 2 months later i started to hate this cd. every song (except \\"Stan\\") got too old! it just was so annoying hearing f- this and f- that and killing his mom and everything. if you want a real cd that actually doesnt get old, get \\"slim shady lp\\" (a classic).

I'm not a huge rap/hip-hop fan, but this CD has to be an exception. I only listened to it because Dido was featured on track #3, Stan. Anyway, I've read all the past reviews and everyone is praising \\"Stan\\" and the gorgeous background vocals. If you are all wondering who it is, it's Dido. Please check her out. Her music is completely different from Eminem's, but it's still hella tight music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST CD!","review":"I think this CD is very creative and I love everything that Eminem makes. The songs are catchy, the beat is phat, and I love it all. He's unique with his own style and I don't think I've heard of another rapper with so much guts to say what he really thinks. If you don't mind swearing and you want an album that you'll want to listen to over and over again, this one is definetly for you! I can't stop playing it, and I'm sure you won't be able to, either! I give it two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eminem once again proves he has no talent...","review":"with the exception of stan ( a truly great song), this album is worthless.

He also showed no support for the victims of 9/11. When other bands and artists are doing charities for them, feminem showed no sypamthy for them at all.

The topics of this album, while violent, are very powerful and honest. \\"Stan\\" is the most powerful song I have heard in years and deserves some sort of award.

When the first single from \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" entitled \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" came out I was extremely excited. He showed even more ability on that single than on any other song he had done. Unfortunately, Marshall has gone for shock value on his new disc in such a way that he completely forgets to make good music. On certain tracks he shows some of the promise displayed earlier in his career, but quickly fades into an ocean of shock lyrics for the sake of being shocking. There are really only 2 or 3 good songs on this disc. Not worth buying.

The follow-up to his very interesting (and at times amazing) debut album is nothing more than crass \\"hip pop\\" which appeals to the lowest common denomenator. The production is lame, the rhymes are repetitive and uncreative, and the scenario is always the same: Hmmm, what can I do to disgust my listeners now? Don't get me wrong, Eminem does possess a great amount of mic ability (for anyone who disagrees, just listen to \\"Any Man\\" off the Soundbombing, Vol. 2 comp).

I loved it. All my homies wanted to listen to it. There are a lot of tight raps on it. All the songs are funny and have nice beats. Eminem is great and so is Marshall Mathers. My favorite songs are tracks 8,11, and 16.

The beats on the cd were some of the best i have heard, but eminem doesn't really rap about anything on this cd. i loved his last cd, but this one is no where as good. other rappers are rapping about things that they go through or things that have meanin and it is worth listening to. But the except for a couple songs, the lyrics on this cd made me embaressed to listen to it around any of my friends or family. I would tell someone unless you don't listen to lyrics and only listen to the beats, ..., i consider it a disgrace to rap.b ,b ,jb"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"wow! incredible! this is a great album, I mean, it's amongst the dumbest and worst I've ever heard, but who cares, it's cool right!

If he's not open-minded enough to appreciate a more lyrical than melodic musical form, then he oughtn't bother stating his opinions in places of irrelevance. It's true that for some kids listening to Eminem is more a declaration of rebellion than anything, but it's got little to do with MTV. If you want to know the real driving force behind Eminem's popularity, look to Dre.Look: He's not the best rapper in the world, but he's nothing to sneer at either.

The whole thing about beating and then killing his wife after he catches her cheating is just a little too intense for me. Eminem shows origality with this CD. If u just like his song \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" the rest of the CD is not really like it. The \\"Real Slim Shady\\" is pretty much the only song that can be played on the radio.

I am very disturbed that a song like this is on one of the best selling albums of the year.ility to compile and deliver such a torrent of words with such speed, precision, inflection, and meaning. The only bad track on the disc is #3, \\"Stan,\\" but maybe it will grow on me in time. \\"Kim\\" is, as MTV's Kurt Loder said, \\"the most disturbing thing I've ever heard,\\" but it makes me glad that Eminem gets this stuff out in the studio, instead of in real life.

No matter how cleanly they try to take out the utter bigotry, racism, and down right ugliness, it will never remove the images set forth by eminem. Even though you cannot hear Eminem's words, you know exactly what he is trying to say. When you settle for the \\"edited\\" version because you don't want to know about his profanity, Eminem laughs all the way to the bank and somehow still manages to give off the same impression as before - images of sex, violence, hatred, killing his wife (HIS MOM!?) and other things I think could spawn a whole new generation of terrorists!

Although I really believe that half of what he says is just for the controversy (and controversy sells), eminem is a tight mc who can do things on many different styles. The CD lacked a bit of variety in content and the beats could have been better in some songs (but they kicked ass in other tracks like Stan) but the fact that eminem has such an amazing ability to put lyrics together (and in a way a bit different from other rappers), he definently deserves five stars.

He sure hasn't toned down, that's for sure. The only problem I got is all the lashing out on this album is a way more venomous on this one than it was on Slim Shady. But anyways... the best cuts here have gotta be Stan, Kim, Drug Ballad, and The Way I Am. Stan is definitely the most haunting track I've heard, and Kim is hands down the most chilling.

The only thing I like on this cd is the song \\"the kids\\" which i cant find on the unedited version of the marshall mathers lp. its a very good song even though it is edited. so my advice to u is to get the unedited version if u like eminem. its a good cd, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable album by one of the best there is","review":"Eminem is one of the most talented rappers in the game. He has witty, funny, and unbelievably complex lyrics. I really believe that it comes down to him, Jay-Z, and Redman as the best emcees living. Em starts off with \\"Kill You\\" where he has a sick beat to support his sick flow. Other unbelievable songs are \\"Stan\\", the hilarious \\"Who Knew\\", the dark and disturbing \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"I'm Back\\", and \\"Marshall Mathers\\" (someone finally clowns ICP, thank you Em), \\"B Please 2\\" and \\"Criminal\\".

I can't listen to Kim because the violence against his wife makes me uncomforable. Paul is a great song. The beat is good and I like the woman singing in the background. The lyrics is what makes the song so powerful.

Not very unlike anything else Slim's released so far though, the only difference is the fact that he's singing with a bunch of other guys with him (the rest of D12).

If you don't like swearing this cd is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time.","review":"Eminem is my favorite rapper (along with Eazy-E R.I.P.) and this is his best album to date. It includes some of the best rap songs ever recorded including The Way I Am and Bitch Please II. Nonetheless there is only one song on this album that is not that good (Drug Ballad) and every single other song is perfect. The album flows perfectly together and is lyrically incredible. Most people thought Eminem was going to hit a sophomore slump but this blows his first album away. Every beat is perfect... every rhyme is unique and every featured artist does an awesome job. I can't express enough my love for this album except to say that it can't be beat. All his albums are great but I just wish they were all THIS great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so much hate?","review":"Come on people, Eminem is a very talented rapper. Sure, there is profanity. But seriously, curse words have become a huge part of our language. Now, I am not saying its a good thing, because it isn't. However, kids curse in school all the time and little kids hear their parents fight, and I'm sure quite a few parents throw around some bad words. Sure, he may sing about drugs and killing, but I don't think that would have any effect on kids. As long as they are being raised right and are tought right from wrong, thats all that matters.When Eminem was talking about killing his wife in the song, he wasn't telling millions of people across the world to kill their spouses. Remember, its all about common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I can't believe I used to like his music.... how embarrassing! If you are a fan of rap music in general (poor you) then I suggest you should listen to Dr Dre or something but NOT eminem. His lyrics are pathetic, the songs are all the same with the same repetitive beat and he just skits everyone when he's not exactly perfect himself! This is the music I cannot stand when all the scallies go around in their cars with it on full volume. On the other hand, if you want to listen to talented music and hate rap in general (like me) then go out and buy an Opeth record or punk like NOFX. This is just commercialised rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is overrated live with it.","review":"The Marshall mathers lp has got to be the most overrated album in the history of hip-hop and music, to say that this is better than classics like It takes a nation to hold us back, Ready to die, Illmatic, must be on some kind of acid trip, I Thought every single song was useless, eminem claims he's anti-pop, yet he has the same fanbase as the backstreet boys & NSync, the real silm shady was a ridiculous song and everything else is just silly. (with the exception of stan)This rapper paved the way for so-called hardcore rappers aka Poseurs like 50 who's making rap look bad then ever.and 50 didn't get shot 9 times, that was just a gimmick, he got shot 3 times.If you want a real good album of 2000's based on a white rapper look no futher than Bubba Sparxxx's deliverence.Eminem is not for me, only for pathetic useless stans who only thinks this is a good album.This album is the most overrated album of all time live with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 million thumbs down","review":"my brother bought this cd, and since I liked \\"the real slim shady\\", I borrowed it from him to listen to it.

Also there are some very controvertial songs in the album like Kim. I thought that this song was alittle satanic at first, but when I listened to it more I realized that it was all just a big joke. Anyway this album is Eminem's best work. It is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lighten up","review":"After reading all of the negative reviews of the marshall mathers lp, I had to share my thoughts. Eminem, whether you like him or not, is one of the best rappers and lyricists that I know of. Check out some of his freestyles if you want proof. I mean, the depth of his lyrics don't compare to the likes of Outkast, but they are extremely clever and perfectly delivered. This disc is better than the Shady LP in that he comes out and blatantly tells everyone that he is only kidding. Come on, if you can't tell that he is kidding, that's just sad. Yes, the lyrics are \\"dirty\\", so no, parents should not let their 12 year old listen to Eminem. That's just what Eminem says on this cd. Everyone just needs to lighten up and enjoy the music for what it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Em rules! except for....","review":"One of my friends had this cd and I had herd \\"Slim Shady\\" on the radio several times before, so I thought why not. When I got the cd I right away started listing to it. Most of the songs are fine, some are great, the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because 2 of his songs(3&16) are skits about him killing his wife, all the sound effects, and another about his fan thowing his wife over a bridge. Its impossible not to take it the wrong way, ugg. Otherwise Id say anybody should get it just don't take the songs the wrong way."},{"rating":"2","title":"HITTIN THE LYRIC","review":"EMINEM is back with a HOT album that is just one cut below his debut joint which was almost perfect. from the 1st track, kill you, to the last, criminal, this cd has some tight lyrics and great chorus'. eminem sticks to his style which most artists dont and is more edgy and cunning in this album. he gets his message across and doesnt care what people think. this is a must have for any rap lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be serious","review":"God, y'know if you people say \\"His lyrics are sick and twisted-- he doesn't need so much swearing-- he just has to be like this in real life--\\" Well, i don't see you coming out with a platnum album. Actually listen to the c.d. I mean really listen to it. He's not serious. He's expressing himself. and if you say \\"this shouldn't even be released--\\" then why don't you go on a protest? Huh?

I mean Slim Shady has it's high points, but Marshall Mathers was just warming up. This sophmore release has a much more serious side to it and feels as if alot more of his true thoughts are displayed. Tracks like \\"Stan\\" and \\"Kim\\" are high points that will blow your freakin' mind and the rest of the CD is just as good. As most of you Eminem fans did on Eminem Tuesday, GO BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly better than first","review":"I exepected this album to be like most of the other sophomore products in the rap game: Worst than the first. Well I was dead wrong. \\"Stan\\" would agree with me that Eminem did a much better job on this album than he did on \\"The Slim Shady\\". Most songs are very dark but great and he attempts to let everyone who didn't get it the first time that that's \\"The way I am\\". He won't change, he will keep on being Eminem, just like Tupac kept on being Tupac, no matter how hard they criticize him. Let's see how the public react to his sophomore soon-to-be classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD ever","review":"The best CD I have ever heard since Makaveli the 7 day theory Every song should be listened to carefully I especially like the song called Stan, and the way I am you could feel what he is going through and the song stan is just plain sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Gold","review":"wow... i got this cd back on the first day it came out... its still a cd i listen to on a regular basis. yo DAVID im 15 my mom likes eminem ... i still listen to him. but i can agree eminem gets to overplayed on mtv thats the reason for most his friends. i bet you never heard eminem's nail in the coffin, the sauce, quitter, hit em up (d12 remix) invasion, conspiracy, hail mary 2003, bump heads. i could go on for ever. this cd came closest to all of those tracks. eminem isnt to different from your black rapper except for his commercial songs. this is eminem's best album. the best songs are criminal, stan, amityville, b!tch please 2, and drug ballad. I highly recommend you buy this cd and also look for any nyc mixtapes with the name DJ Green Lanturn on it (thats eminem's dj), thats where he shows his more \\"gangsta\\" side.

The CD starts with the violent song \\"kill you\\" were Eminem talks about raping his mom. Then \\"Stan\\" a story about a fan who kills himself becuase Em won't wright him a letter. Then song 12 \\"ken kenith\\" it's basicly a three man orgy (witch made me feel sick). Song 16 the prequil to \\"97' bonie and clyde\\",\\"kim\\" is about Em killing his wife (kimberly mathers). Criminal is just a use of profanity for no reason. I don't recomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the same...","review":"Slim shady has done it again with a lyrical explostion packed in this single disc! He has shown his strong feelings on freedom of speech, busting out with non-stop offensive rhymes objectionable to anyone and everyone. But also in this album, he has shown he is maturing as times go on learning how his fans reactions are so strong toward him and there are times to take things serious. Stan is a track that shows this extremely well. Personal favorites are 2,3,5,8,10,11,15 and 18. As you can see Im hooked on this lp. Go get it. Peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"I like encore, and the slim shady LP the best but this is pretty good with songs like criminal, remember me, and stan, buy the album after you buy his 1st and newest one.

I'm usually more of a rock/punk/ska fan like blink ect.... but i really enjoy eminem i LOVE the track \\"Rock Botton\\" off of his first CD and i LOVE \\"Stan\\" off of this one. i like them beacuse it shows that not all rappers rap about chicks and guns and stuff. I think \\"Rock Bottom\\" makes a really good point and even my mom likes it (and she doesnt exactly LOVE rap) and \\"stan\\" is good just cuz it shows the singers opinion/side of the whole \\"obbsession\\" deal, to let the fans know how the singer feels about the way the fan acts, i mean come on if this is how Em feels think how the members of the boy bands must feel with the 11 yr old stlkers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"eminem","review":"When I first heard this album, I didn't really care for it that much. It is an O.K. album, but he just didn't try hard enough on this one. Don't get me wrong, Eminem is a great rapper. I found songs that I liked on it like \\" Kill you\\" that was a great song. I really like \\"Stan\\" it has very great lyrics to it. Then from track 3 every song [wasn't good] till track 14 \\"Amittyville\\", I like the beat to it, phat song right there. I didn't care for tracks 15 and 16. Now the best song on this entire album is \\"Under the influence\\", the rhymes are tight and so is the beat. Overall I found this album alright, but most of the songs [weren't good]. There were funny ... skits though, they made me crack up. The thing that I really like about this though is that eminem says whatever he wants to say, he doesn't care whatever tha hell people think, that's the main reason this album gets 4 stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothin' but attitude","review":"Eminem really sounds angry in this cd. I warn you, if you get offended easily, this cd is NOT for you. Basically, this cd trashes homosexuals, talks about how Eminem doesn't give a care about anything, and disses \\"pop\\" groups. \\"Kim\\" is nothing but a screaming fit given by Eminem. \\"Slim Shady\\" is a good witty song. The rhymes and the beats is the reason I gave this a 4 star rating. Another thing to look out for is the cuss words. I would recommend this cd, but if you get offended easily, please don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opion","review":"I have always like Eminem and his old albums but this one beats them all.

After hearing his freestyle cuts and this new album, I gotta say I'm a believer.

Deserving of at least 5 stars, no doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, but 1st album was better!","review":"Ya don't get me wrong this album is pretty good but only like 4-5 songs are good, his first album was all good, all the songs were tight! Eminem is a tight rapper but he still needs to get some more guests on more songs like number 15 on this album, he's got Dre, Snoop and others who make it sound really good! go out and get album cause those 4-5 songs are really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL SLIM SHADY","review":"I just got this cd. I like #3 Stan (is about a dear fan that is writings letters to Eminem trying to get him to be friends and Eminem finally writes him) Criminal is a great song, IM Back is about how he dissn all of boy-bands. Marshall Mathers is another ausome song. All the songs have rap and very upbeat songs. Lots of good beats. Kim is a song about Eminem's girlfriend but on the clean version it is replaced with a song called The Kids it is a South Park type of theme. If you want to know the others songs get the cd. One more thing Eminem shows his sense of humor on the cd and you will crack up.. If you like rap. Get this SOOOOO COOL CD! PS: EMINEM IS THE REAL SLIM SHADY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Marshall Mathers LP ~ Review","review":"In short, this CD is great. Fantastic. Eminem has matured as an artist and you can see it in his music. The way that he shares his thoughts with the world may be somewhat vulgar, it was better than my expectatins. I love it. You should try listening to Stan, I'm Back, Marshall Mathers, Kim, Under the Influence, or The Real Slim Shady, which has been on the radio. The Real Slim Shady is one of a kind though, and it is the only song like it on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is tight","review":"Slim's lyrics are hot. Hes not afraid to say whats on his mind and his beats are pretty phat. I definitely recomend this to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Rap","review":"Alright, this is the ONLY RAP I listen to... I can't stand anything else. For some reason though when I heard bits and pieces of Stan I wanted to hear the whole song. So I did some research to find out who the artest was, and what CD it belonged to. I had heard nothing of Eminem, so I went out and bought the Marshall Mathers LP. I sat there with my headphones on, and listened to the whole CD. There is just something about Eminem that draws you to his music, there's a lot of emotion there. This CD is great, and it has the honor of being the ONLY RAP record that sits in my metal collection. Don't listen to the news of Eminem, just be smart when listening to his music. Do just that listen. He's got talent, and is well worth the money spent of the CD. His lyrics are very well written, (Unlike this review), and the beats go great with his songs. So even if you're like me and can't stand rap give Eminem a chance, perhaps he'll grow on you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rap cd but...","review":"This Rap cd is by far very amazing material by the artist and rapper Eminem but I had an issue with three tracks off this cd of his. Those tracks were 9, 12, and 14. Rememeber me was track 9, Ken Kaniff was track 12, and Amityville was track 14. But as for myself my favorite songs were The way I am track 7, Track 18 Criminal, and track 11 Marshall Mathers. This cd got a lot of heat when it came out from lot of religious groups and political groups and so forth. Just like his first album I believe this surpass the first one both in style and lyrics. But if your a true fan of his material both in style and lryics then pick this cd up if you dont have it by now and listen to it with open mind and be prepare to be amazed by the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate rap music, BUT:","review":"Eminem and Dr. Dre are absolutely talented. The song that sold me on accepting some rap was California love by Tupac.The reason why I rate this CD at a five, even though it is a type of music (rap) I don't generally like, was because of the song Kim- it has power. Pure adrenaline, pure brutality, pure genius.That song makes Eminem an artist in the true sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem's Best","review":"This is by far the best album to ever come out of that controversial rapper we know as Eminem. You may think that I'm a little biased though since I really enjoyed his debut, The Slim Shady LP. But Em showed a different side to himself on that album. The side that he shows on The Marshall Mathers LP, however, strikes me as the best. It is a darker, and way more mature version of Eminem than he has, even until now, ever shown. The lyrics are that of a genius, the melodies hypnotic and even the order of the songs and the way they are presented makes this album a masterpiece, not just of rap, but for all music. Even if you do not like rap music, or are just now getting to know Eminem, listen to this album. It's one of the few albums that I can listen to straight through, without skipping any tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Slim Shady","review":"I love this album. The song that I really love though is \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". Also,1. B**** Please II Feat. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit & Nate Dogg2. The Way I Am3. Stan Feat. DidoHe is definitely okay in my book if he rolling with Dr. Dre and Aftermath/Interscope Records. Holla back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... but no classic....","review":"Eminem is probably one of the only white rappers i respect. Some of his songs may be about nothing, but other times he spits the truth. This guys lyrical skills are better than 2/3 of the black rappers lyrical skills. This is definatly his best album, with \\"the eminem show\\" being a close second. The two best songs on here are \\"the way i am\\" and \\"stan.\\" I wanna see eminem and lil wyte go at it once. Both are lyrically gifted and both can flow like a mothaf*cker. Pick this album up if you dont got it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Slim Shady","review":"This is just quite simply one of the best rap albums I have heard next to All Eyez On Me and Doggystyle. Em's style has really matured since his last album and is now very distinctive. Lyrically the album is superb but the delivery is also faultless.Perhaps the ultimate compliment though is that he outshines all of his guests on the album and, when you consider that they include Dre, Snoop and Xzibit, that is not easy.The tracks of real distinction are The Real Slim Shady, Stan, Marshall Mathers, B-Please 2, and Under The Influence with the D-12, who also come off well.All in all, this is one of the albums of the year and no rap fan, or fan of good music, should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Shady","review":"This cd is the best album i have ever heard! The rhymes are off the hook with phat beats. The only two tracks I dont like is Ken Kaniff because it makes me sick, and The Real Slim Shady because I have heard it so many times that it is just annoying. Radio and MTV and BET have ruined an awesome song. The best song on the whole album is definitely \\"The Way I Am\\" Number 7 it has the phattest lyrics with the tightest beat ever. Stan is also good because it proves Eminem can show a seriousness to himself. I like \\"Criminal\\" too. I really like the interlude in the middle of it. If you like the Slim Shady LP and thought it was pushing the limits The Marshall Mathers LP will blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem, still the best!","review":"I just bought Eminem's Marshall Mathers CD. This is by far better then his first CD, even though that was tight. I've only got to listen to the first 11 songs, but all of them have been great. This album proves why Eminem is the best all around rap artist out there. He puts ICP to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eminem preaches togetherness, tolerance","review":"On his \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\" Eminem implores listeners to \\"love one another, sister and brother\\" and cherish our differences rather than let them lead to hatred and prejudice. \\"Don't need no hate, love is my fate\\" he raps in the tender ballad \\"Kim\\". He also makes a bold statement in support of gays and lesbians by defiantly rapping \\"I'm Eminem and I'm here to say, I love you whether you're straight or gay.\\" Other controversial topics Em weighs in on include the environment, euthenasia, capital punishment, affirmative action, the tension in the middle east and racial profiling. Em's message throughout seems to be \\"let's heal the wounds of the past and work on making the future a little brighter for our children\\". Soldier on, Em!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair but still could have done better","review":"I like Eminem dont get me wrong but I think this second CD is so much better then his first. I only bought it for that one song but when I heard the rest of the cd I was like people actually like this stuff my first rap CD. I always hated rap but now I am starting to like it more. So I bought his second CD expecting to only like one song \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" But I ended up liking at least 3 or 4. So I say this CD is worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it's scary...","review":"A towering achievement. The triad of entities being Marshall Mathers, Eminem and Slim Shady meld as never before, with incendiary raps, literally breathtaking production values, and real storylines that'll hook you instantly. Take songs like \\"Kill You\\", \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and the masterpiece \\"Stan\\"...those alone would form the nucleus of a classic rock album. The latter song uses pencil scratching along with the Dido clip, and a true acting performance from Eminem (if you know this song, it won't surprise you he can act...) to just grab you by the throat and wake you the ... up.Where does Marshall end and Eminem begin? How much of Eminem is the real Slim Shady? Is he just messing with our heads, and laughing at all of us?

I mean he this guy has some talent and he is expressing his feelings by singing instead of going out there and killing people. His words express how he grew up in the world.

Look at you now, keep rising to the top. Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily his best","review":"Eminem is truly in his prime on this record. His rhymes as well as those of his collaborators are very very good, and the beats are very appropriate. Very few hip hop artists can match the intensity seen on songs like \\"Kim\\" or \\"The Way I Am\\". And if you share his sense of humor, tracks such as \\"Amityville\\", \\"Kill You\\", or \\"Remember Me?\\" will make your sides ache. I was also impressed when I learned that he played guitar on som of his songs (\\"Marshall Mathers\\" comes to mind). In my opinion, this is one of the best albums of this generation; definitely worth a listen to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for newbie Em fans...","review":"Okay, this is the first Eminem CD I've purchased. I did listen to \\"My Name Is\\" about a million times when it was overplayed by the radio stations before. And I recently watched \\"8 Mile\\" which was good. After seeing the Hollywood version of Eminem, I wanted to see why there was so much controversy over this guy. So I chose to buy the most infamous CD he had. \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" did not disappoint! There are MANY great tracks here, including \\"Stan\\", \\"Kill You\\", and \\"The Way I Am\\". I definitely recommend this as a good starter CD for new Eminem fans.Be forewarned however, like it has been discussed before, the track \\"Kim\\" is totally messed up. Has a catchy chorus that will stick in your head though. :-pAnyway, I'll be getting \\"The Eminem Show\\" next. See you then!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"I heard this CD when it first came out, and was... well, disturbed. If you thought his first album was bad, wait till you get a load of this. However it is not without its merits. \\"Stan\\" is a pretty good song.

If you are an adult and you own Eminem, shame on you.Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured, talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each \\"song\\".

A lot of his famous paintings (Where was Guernica? Jeez...) are sorely not covered in the film which runs for measly 20 minutes. The price of the movie absolutely isn't justified. Also, I give the film points off for not being cubism. It's just ironic that it is an animated film that is covering cubism yet isn't cubism itself. All in all, Dropping in on Picasso is a serious waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning of a Legend","review":"Arrival, the first 4 episodes in the Dragonball Z series, takes place a while after the Dragonball series left off.

The funniest thing about it is that some of them are actually under the impression that Dragonball Z is an adult show. Message to any and all children who believe they are watching an adult series: Dragonball Z is not nor has it ever been intended for adults. In Japan it is enjoyed by little children no different than yourselves except that they get to enjoy the completely uncensored versions of these episodes.

Because the author has been behind-the-scenes with the Clintons; he's seen her without The Mask (What-you-see-is-what-you-get with Bill, although that changes in a kaleidescopic manner). The Clinton apologistas - I consider them stark raving mad, but that's their perspective - are a lost cause. I'd urge readers who feel they are open-minded on the subject of the Clintons to read this book, and Ed Klein's.

Claiming the memoir is distorted and incomplete, Morris critically appraises the New York senator's potential for higher office. No better time to read it then now, as she is in the running for the Office of President.Mr. Morris was someone who worked very close with Hillary Clinton on a daily basis for years. He reveals both some of her hidden strengths and weaknesses, so the book reads as if it is objective. The facts just keep coming in this book, and it seems dull at first, but keep reading. I would rate the book four-and-half stars. This book is worth reading but does have some strong language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda at its best","review":"This is another example of the conservative dominated media pandering to the public. Despite what he claims, Morris realizes that the country is conservative leaning today (despite being liberal leaning when you evaluate Americans views on each individual issue) and sees an opportunity to make money by giving the public what they want to hear.PS: Before you respond to conservative media comment, remember the primary purpose of the media in our capitalist society is to make money (not reporting the facts). Therefore, if you continually give consumers news that shows that they are wrong in their beliefs, they'll tune out (i.e. report the facts in a non-bias manner when the country is conservative leaning, especially since 9/11). In all fairness, the media was liberal leaning in the 60s because the country was leaning that direction.

He went and wrote a mean spirited book about the people who made his name famous.Morris' book is so vindictive and meanspirited that it obscures some real concerns about the person of Hillary Clinton. He sees everything about her in a bad way, and I can only conclude that the Clinton's snubbing of Morris is the cause of this.Yes, Morris was an advisor to the Clintons at various times of their career, but so were a lot of people.

I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect","review":"I'm a conservative; no doubt what the New York Times would call the extreme, right-wing fringe.However, I found Dick Morris' book a tome that didn't want to \\"dis\\" Hillary as much as a man seeking to find reasons to praise her.He comes across as a true left-wing moderate, one wanting for Hillary to be bold in her espousal of left wing causes and honest in her past history.This, he reveals, she has sadly failed to do. In her laser-like focus on gaining political power, she shifts with every political poll.He reveals how she has thrown away every core principle except her pursuit of her own definition of women and children's rights.It portrays her not so much as political savant as a desperate woman seeking to validate her own life and her many ambitions.It's a difficult read for the true right wing, such as myself, however it's an entertaining discussion and Dick Morris carries the story well.It's also a telling insight in the woman who would be president."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring books I ever read.","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read.

I would also check out their self titled album, it takes time to get used to some songs, but you end up appreciating it.Overall \\"Patiando Piedras\\" and \\"Corazones\\" are their best albums, the first being social and the second being romantic.

At 900+ pages, I can only emphasize \\"huge.\\" We read it for our book club, which was the only reason I finished the story.

Gram told me how, as a girl, she and her friends read this book wrapped in brown paper so no one would know they were reading such a racy book! She thought it had been banned in Boston! Of course, that made it much more desirable.

The novel is so well written, that I could actually \\"feel\\" all the pain, sadness, or joy that Amber felt throughout the book,and even though the story is considerably long, I was so completely enchanted with the story that I didn't even notice. I have read this book a couple more times as an adult and have recommended it to many friends to read. To my extreme disappointment, the last time I lent my old, worn copy to someone, I never got it back!

I was lucky enough to have had this book catch my eye. I was intrigued by the comments on the cover of how the book had been banned decades ago - it was a big \\"to do\\" back then --- hmmmm! I found the book to be interesting from a historic point and loved the \\"twists and turns\\" - I never could predict WHAT Amber was going to do next. I found her to be a selfish and unlikeable creature yet very fascinating (very much like Scarlet O'Hara from Gone With The Wind). The writing style of the book seemed very contemporary (it was published in the 1940's and the story took place in 1600's England). I could NOT put this book down and I was sorry when it ended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Crazy For Amber","review":"I gave this book a star only for the historical details, and for Barbara Palmer's side story. Otherwise, I didn't care for it at all. It's very long - which is fine if the content changes to keep your interest - but how many times can one really stand to read about Amber's ongoing infatuation with Bruce Carlton? The man clearly has no intentions toward her being anything more than his mistress, and yet she chases him and chases him and acts like \\"a silly whore\\" or \\"a useless jade\\" for the entire novel. A poor female character, Amber embodies every stereotype of an ill-bred country innocent. I felt sorry for Bruce Carlton, not Amber, to the point where when he strikes her, I actually was on his side. Enough with her stupidity already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THe life, loves and times of Amber St Clare........","review":"Kathleen Winsor's 1940's novel of Amber St Clare and Restoration England remains one hell of a book. She runs away from her adopted parents and village with a handsome Cavalier whose love she will pursue throughout her eventful life. 1660's London springs a multitude of up and down surprises for the novel's irrepressible heroine. The historical accuracy : the court and loves of Charles the Second, the theatre life, the plague and the fire of London, is particularly entertaining. Personally think that this book shadows \\"Gone with the Wind\\" - and it calls to be made into a TV mini-series"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Forever\\" is Appropriate","review":"Forever is exactly how long this book seems to last. It is the tale of the beautiful and ambitious Amber, who sleeps her way to the top of Restoration society in London. Amber lives through husbands, lovers, plague, fire, etc; but she never seems to grow up and does not change. (Even the oblivious Scarlett O'Hara had an epiphany at the end of GONE WITH THE WIND) I could not identify with any of the unlikable characters, and did I mention that the main character, Amber, learned nothing in her journey? Look for my copy at your local Goodwill store."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a love story!","review":"Great book, keeps you turning the pages! Amber is a fun character,I love the era. It is a long book that does not get boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever a great read","review":"I just reread this book for the first time in years, and couldn't put it down. From the first page, Winsor grabs the reader and takes you on an extremely entertaining, fascinating journey through one woman's life against the backdrop of Restoration-era England. Amber is far from a moral paragon, and makes foolish decisions, but her story is still gripping years after this book was written. Other historical romances are pallid when compared with this vivid narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best!","review":"When I was a kid, my mother told me about sneaking \\"Forever Amber\\" out of her older sister's room and being grounded for two months when the book was found in her possession! Naturally, when I came across it in a used bookstore, I immediately snapped it up. Although by today's standards it's pretty tame, \\"Forever Amber\\" must have been quite shocking back in the forties when it was first published. But it's not the racy tidbits that will keep you reading--it's the astounding historical details and just plain old good storytelling. It's got its flaws--Amber's complete wishy-washiness when it came to Bruce being the major one--but this is still an escapist classic. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, Funny, Bawdy Historical Novel","review":"FOREVER AMBER is remembered mostly as the sort of novel that a lot of 40's teenagers read at the back of the closet with a tennis racket shoved up their backs. It's mild by comparison with today's bodice-rippers, but Amber is still a much more daring character than is found in these sort of books; she is tough, unscrupulous at times, angry, and restless. But she is smart and funny and resourceful as well and when she suffers serious heartbreak at the end, you feel for her. In short, Kathleen Winsor has written a historical novel with a real human being at its center, which is the mark of good literature . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still readable after all these years","review":"I first read Forever Amber back in the 60s and have to laugh when I realize that everything I know about 17th Century England I learned from this book. It's very well researched and extremely readable. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched Ending","review":"The book was absolutely captivating. I passionately hoped that Amber and Lord Carlton's would persevere and they would marry despite the fact that she was supposedly the daughter of a country man. Which she was not, she was actually the offspring of great and powerful people, this was never discovered by Amber or Lord Carlton which disappointed me. But i still had hope that they would still marry but this was diminished when he married another girl that he met in Virginia while Amber slowly climbs the ladder of high society. She becomes wealthy and gets the title of a duchess. She is loved and envied. The only man she ever truly loved, Lord Carlton is now married, but i still have faith that they will be together. All my hopes shatter in the end of the book. It's a great book but the ending is wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Amber","review":"I read Forever Amber as a teenager and did not remember the ending. On reading it now, I realize that I didn't want to remember the ending. It's a most depressing morality play that leads the reader down a dark emotional hole. I don't recommend it unless you are judgmental and will be happy to cheer for the utter demise of Amber and her dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who knew of my entrancement with Gone With the Wind. All I can say is Amber is no Scarlett O'Hara. I would have enjoyed the book far more had it just been a work of historical fiction without the lovesick heroine who I did not feel anything for other than pity involved. There were storylines in the book that I thought should have been explored and weren't. I forced myself to finish the book, because I don't like to leave books unread but this is one book that I am severely disappointed that I purchased and didn't just take out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Amber","review":"The book is interesting, but the Heroine is horrible. People who pick this up because they think she is like \\"GONE WITH THE WIND\\"'s Scarlett are going to be disappointed. Scarlett is a survivor, who (IMO) does experience some personal growth and at times was unselfish, in spite of herself. The only time Amber thought of anyone other than herself, was when Bruce was sick. Otherwise, she caused many deaths because of her stalker obsession, and only one guy really deserved it. Awful, terrible woman and the ending was not good.That said, If you like to read about Princess Diana's great great great (whatever) grandmother Barbara and Restoration England, it's a page turner-- for at least that."},{"rating":"1","title":"for goodness sake, leave the man alone!","review":"this book has some interesting parts but for the most part it was a bore. the book is too long with many unintresting details. it's pathetic to see the main character's desperation for a man who only sees her as a whore. i usually keep all of the books i buy but im willing to give this one away for free to anyone willing to spend hours on a story that really ends up nowhere. what a useless ending it was. im not usually this pessimistic about books but thats how much i dislike this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Forever Amber was a book that I became so engrossed in. I fell in love with Amber's personality and love for Bruce. Although the author used explicit details, I found the ending to be a great dissapointment. The book simply ended leaving the reader unfullfilled. (At least in my circumstance.) With how much love Amber had for Bruce, and for how well the book was written I felt it left me angry with the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"forever incomplete!!","review":"Forever Amber was a complete disappointment! The book was interesting and the history intriguing, but I was utterly thwarted by the absolute lack of character development. The author never explains or alludes to the reason Bruce won't marry Amber. The book lacks a climatic ending. What happened to Amber's family, her father? She never finds out about her mother? These questions were never answered! I was so frustrated!!! I also got bored with the repetitive story...it was so long one would expect Winsor to answer these unanswered questions. She simply did not complete the story and I was left feeling relieved that it was finely over and aggravated with the crappy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I was intrigue to read this when I heard it compared with Gone With The Wind. I won't deny that the historical side of the book is well researched and interesting. And I won't deny that I read it from beginning to end. However, I just wanted it to end, and I felt I was wasting my time through the last third of the book. The ending is abrupt and out of sync with the rest of the book. The characters are contrived, and manipulated to fit into scenes and settings. I don't recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Period piece indeed","review":"The subplot that revolves around the king was useless and boring. This book was 700 pages too long. Do not recommend if you are a plot rather than character related person."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book Ever - I'm So Glad That It's Back In Print!","review":"I first read Forever Amber as a teenager, and I loved Amber's fiesty nature from the start! Sure, she hardens over the course of time and trouble - but since she always gets her way in the end, I can't but imagine that she got Bruce in the end, too. Amber is a terrific character, but what really makes the book is the historical backdrop in which Windsor has immersed her. I once read that she spent ten years researching the novel - believe me, it shows! Every corner of Restoration London is explored - after reading this book a few times, you will feel like you have lived there. If you love English history with a little spiciness thrown in, you must read Forever Amber!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and wicked","review":"This was a great book and definitely a guilty pleasure. If you are looking for a saintly heroine then turn away immediately for Amber is an amoral, gold digging, devil and a selfish, scheming, seductress. Inspite of all her flaws I absolutely could not stop reading about her! I kept hoping she would grow and learn from her experiences but no such luck, which makes her a very memorable character. As much as I liked the novel, one tiny complaint is that the ending felt unfinished and left me with the feeling a sequel was needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite historical Novels","review":"I read this wonderful book shortly after having finished \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" by Ken Follett (which was extremely boring, but I read every page, hoping it would get better at some point) and although Kathleen Winsor wrote \\"Forever Amber\\" in 1943, it felt like a fresh breeze compared with this very slow novel by Follett on cathedral builders. One reviewer even claimed \\"Pillars...\\" was a historical thriller. I thought \\"Forever Amber\\" was much more suspenseful!Since then I re-read \\"Forever Amber\\" several times over the past decades and watched the movie which is also very good.Only one other author writes such great historical novels and that is Anne Golon (\\"Angélique\\"). I tried to read Diana Gabaldon, but never really managed to get into the first volume, but will try once more.I don't think 5 stars are enough for this great book! But unfortunately 5 stars are the most one can give.Wish it would be released on audio CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non stop reading","review":"A friend of mine got me into historical romances.

I read Forever Amber because I didn't think that was possible. She was right. Forty years later I am still recommending it to students, friends and teachers, who say they can't put it down. Everyone I have recommended it to says it is impossible to put this book down. This is a wickedly romantic book with impeccable historical detail. It tops my list as the best ending in any book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I forced myself to finish","review":"I do not insist that I love or identify with the protagonist of a story. Rarely have I disliked one as much as Amber. Not for any moral reasons, though she is vapid, greedy, and (spoiler)somewhat murderous. I found that to be fairly accurate of the times in which she lived. As another reviewer noted, the story goes on a loop. I love you Bruce! Bruce leaves! Amber becomes involved with someone else....just rather tiring. Amber is naive in the beginning, but doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes. I would say I disliked her most for that.I did enjoy the portrayal of Charles II and the events surrounding the story-hence the two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"This is a GREAT book - don't miss it.

It helped me to redefine the way I think about pleasure and society's relationship to it. I was raised with such a puritanical \\"if it feels good, it must be evil\\" way of thinking that Leary's point of view - \\"if it feels good, it's probably good for you\\" - was downright liberating for me. Although I don't subscribe to everything Leary says in the book (for example, I don't think doing LSD once a week is a good idea), his essays are always provocative and full of food for thought. Even if you're put off by Leary's associations with hippie and drug cultures, I'd still recommend reading this book. Leary was an intelligent man with ideas worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living each day like it was your last","review":"Although a few of the methods offered in this book weren't my style, I have to say it gives very good insights into helping individuals discover exactly what they are doing with their life, how they are wasting, it and why. If you REALLY thought you have a minimum of time left, what would you really do? Since none of us know how long we really have, (a month? 2 years?) what are they things that you would really want to make sure were settled before you were gone? For me, and I suspect for many, once you truly start to act like you are soon to be departed, the things you find are important to you really AREN'T what you thought( in passing) they would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Year to Live","review":"A Year To Live by Levine proves the old saying: \\"There's nothing new under the sun.\\" This book, which claims to be on the cutting edge, might offer something to someone who has never given the subject of dying a second thought, but the banal, maudlin, self righteous approach left this listener - I bought the tape - begging for silence. On top of that, Mr. Levine reads his work as though he were trying to induce a hypnotic trance or s p e a k i n g to the mentally impaired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very practical","review":"This book has potential but it does not spell out very clearly what to do, How to Live This Year As If It Were Your Last. It is mostly poetic and full of jargon that the average person will not relate to. Maybe if one knows his language from being more familiar with the author it would be more clear, but this book on it's own is not easy to \\"grok\\".

It's not a book that will appeal to those who bask smugly in their own self-sufficient world and think not of others. It is a book that can provide deep insight into the true nature of the human condition -- that all life is suffering with occasional happy moments. I'd recommend 'A Year To Live' to anyone suffering from a bereavement, or expecting one; to those struggling with elderly parents or relatives; to those trying to find some meaning in the life process and interested in 'what comes after' and above all, to all who are frightened of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"too many urban legends!","review":"Egad! this book is really really funny, the only problem is 2 fourths of the storys in the book are not true! some of the urban legends are so stupid too. like anyone would belive the story about the pulsating cactus that exploded baby tarantulas all over the house. My input on the stories is that its not supposed to be funny when they die, its just funny how stupid they are.it makes you think , \\"How the heck could that guy think he could do that without getting killed!?\\" like the lady who tried to look inside a gas can with a lighter? yeah, I think you know what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior sequel - more mean than funny...","review":"Talk about cold leftovers. \\"Darwin Awards #2\\" is as weak as most sequels to successful 'humour' books.

(I think it was the story about the sad sad man who clipped dozens of bunjee cords together and forgot that those cords do stretch. He leaped from a high place, and hit the ground like a rock. He died of course.)The first \\"Darwin Awards\\" was hysterical. Virtually all of this sequel is obvious filler that was rejected for the first edition. Interestingly, the focus of the second book shifts from seriously dull people doing idiotic things with predictable outcomes. It shifts to average people dying from too common bad luck. And that's not funny - just sad. This book left me cranky & paranoid.(If you do buy this version, I'd suggest ripping out the 4 or 5 funny entries and folding them into the first \\"Darwin Awards\\".

If your squemish at every little drop of blood (or, perhaps, someone having a rusty pipe shoved at their groin...) then you should really turn back now.

Wendy Northcutt also writes The Darwin Awards and The Darwin Awards 3. Wendy Northcutt does a lot of things well in her books but one of the things she does really well is that she doesn't make each story long and boring but that she shortens them and gets down to the point.

I knew about the Darwin Awards, having received samples of same over the internet. The better part of my nature informed me that the very notion of finding something funny in stories of stupid misadventures with tragic consequences was . . . (how you say?) . . . wrong. Wrong and stupid. If a dim-witted child guffaws at these stories, one makes allowances. For an adult to enjoy them is beyond the pale.There are some who are horrified at the practice of book-burning.

The film is typical for one of those, from the early 1930s. The disc, however, is pretty bad. First, it is a DVD-R....that in and of itself isn't necessarily bad if it weren't for the asking price of $10. The transfer of the movie has terrible contrast, is very dupey with soft focus. The disc has no main menu and no chapter stops.

I had heard great reviews about this book and it lives up to every one! I feel much more prepared to proceed with the surgery I have been considering. Dr. Kotler's book helped to ease my concerns and allay my anxiety. I would suggest this book to anyone wanting more information about cosmetic surgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physician's report on this book compared to others","review":"I found this book to be quite simplistic and full of self-serving letters to the author about what a fine surgeon he is. It supplies information that is so basic that it is almost worthless. He supplies lists of questions to ask a potential surgeon, but does not discuss how to evaluate the answers one might receive. A far better book is \\"A Smart Woman's Guide to Plastic Surgery\\" which is full of helpful and specific information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TV Reporters review","review":"As a news reporter, I am always looking for the most understandable and comprehensive information on the subject at hand, so when I started seriously thinking about cosmetic surgery, I went to the bookstore and started searching for answers. When I found, bought and read Dr. Robert Kotler's Secrets Of A Beverly Hills Cosmetic Surgeon, even though I live thousands of miles away, I felt pretty much like he was there to comfort and guide me. He offered the pros and cons and seemed to really care about his profession with a passion and care if his reader had a successful, safe experience. Whether you are thinking about some type of surgery, or have already made up your mind, I would recommend reading Dr. Kotler's book because face-it, when you are about to do something this important, you need all the support and all the facts you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"msiguided auther","review":"well I have read the book but it did not offer any new information that any consumer could get from Operah.

One of the doctors even commented on how smart of a patient I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"No guess work","review":"This is terrific book, even if you're not now committed to cosmetic surgery. What is unique is that it seems to take the guess work out of the entire process of selecting a surgeon, which obviously is the most important of the decisions to be made. What I learned is that the world of \\" cosmetic surgeons\\" is inhabited by a wide range of different specialists; the variation in qualification can be surprising if not scary. I sense that as cosmetic procedures become more popular that even more MDs will enter the field. That will make the doctor- selecting even harder. This book will always be there to help erase the confusion and that is why I believe it is worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I wish I had access to this book three years ago. Had my nose done and it turned out poorly. Looks worse and my breathing problem is no better. After the surgery I found out my plastic surgeon had very little experience in nasal surgery. He was board certified and I thought that qualified him to do my surgery, but in fact his practice was mostly auto accidents, hand surgery and cancer work.. Dr. Kotler's book tells you how to avoid this misdirection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaucer's Tale Beautifully Told","review":"Chanticleer and the Fox, an adaptation of the Nun's Priest's Tale, is a simple and delightful tale with a moral (or three) at the end. Chanticleer and the other characters learn about the dangers of failing to be watchful, talking when one should be silent, and trusting in flattery. Barbara Cooney's illustrations are simple and warm, yet she gives a glimpse of what life might have looked like for a family in the Middle Ages. The book is suitable for an early reader or for reading aloud to younger children, although older children and adults would enjoy it as well. If you want more Chaucer for older children, without the rhyme or Middle English, you might want to try The Canterbury Tales, Retold by Geraldine McCaughrean, Illustrated by Victor G. Ambrus. Some material in that book, however, might need some parental guidance for younger readers. Chanticleer and the Fox is appropriate for children of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be reading it to my children","review":"I read this one today to preview it for my children. While I like the moral of the story, do not trust in flattery, it comes about in a disjointed way at the end of the book. I had to read the rooster, foxes, and woman's comments twice to be sure I was getting what each one said!Throughout the book there are references to \\"all the rooster's hens,\\" \\"his 7 wives\\" and so on. I find this inappropriate for a children's book. Including \\"when I see the beauty of your face...my fears die away\\" and \\"groan in his throat like a man troubled by his dreams.\\" Too many references as though this rooster is really a man.

Barely.","review":"I took a chance on these because of all the positive reviews you find on this product on multiple websites. I ordered a 5lb bag of the Haribo Happy Cola's and I have to say I'm very disappointed. They are extremely chewy.. it's literally like chewing on a dry piece of caulk. No matter how long you chew, it doesn't break down.. it may as well be a piece of rubber. If you suck on them they last for quite some time, obviously, but that cola taste is not there. You get a slight hint of cola when you first pop one in, but after that time passes (5-10 seconds in) you're left with a wet noodle made out of caulk that tastes like corn syrup.There must be a huge group of people who like generic candy out there or a heck of a lot of Haribo workers boosting these reviews.

He started out a Presbyterian, but later was an Anglican vicar. This book covers just about as much as could be expected about the Jewish social life at the time of Jesus. Edersheim makes use of Josephus, Philo, the Misnah, the Talmud, and the Bible to sketch out such things as what life was like in Galilee verses Jerusalem, dating and marriage, how death was handled and viewed, the Pharisees, as well as how they differed from the Essenes and Sadduccees. What is most interesting is his sketch of the Essenes, because Alfred wrote well before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. One might would think that this work is outdated, but truthfully, this is a minimal problem. This is a classic standard work on the subject that is written in a lucid and interesting fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information","review":"I found this helpful in getting to know some of the background of all those events in Scripture.

It is only du Pre who is able to bring out the passion, the flame, and the intensity to the concerto, espectially for the 1st and 4th movement. The 2nd movement also shows her technique - full of semiquavers, yet she plays with clarity and has that sort of drive in her playing. This piece has certainly touched me. The Haydn concerto is somewhat too passionate for a 'Haydn' style. Nevertheless, a very 'down to earth' playing. As for the Beethoven Ghost trio, again, beautiful solo passages, and good coordination with the violin and the piano, yet i would say the tempo is a bit too slow. Other than that, it's just perfect. As an overall, i would certainly recommendthis cd to all cello music lovers, a very very touching performance indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A desert-island cd, without doubt.","review":"This is an amazing album: four amazing works played with such passion and communication by Du Pre.

My favorite is the original white bar, the nutrium bar with vitamins or the sensitive skin bar.The Dove products really do what they say. I also adore their line of deodorants! Can't beat the price either. Great product at a great price.

When I first opened the box, the soap had a wonderful scent although it was just a bit overpowering. With me being allergic to a lot of fragrances, I was unable to use the soap for very long because it caused me to sneeze. On the upside, the soap did leave my skin feeling soft and clean unlike many soaps that leave my skin feeling dry.

The story enscenates typical Belgian persons in a typical Belgian multicultural environment. It is about a former '68 anarchist who helps a young African boy to recover his father who was unduly sent back to Africa because of not holding valid identity papers. The language is beautifully typical of the Brussels surroundings, with a mixture of Dutch and French, all with the local accents.I am sure that any Belgian now overseas will get tears in the eyes by looking and listening at this film.Jan Decleir is an exceptional Belgian actor.

Installed nicely into the awning, but when I rolled up the awing, and hooked the end with the awning tool, the loop fell apart. This makes me wonder how strong the other end is INSIDE the awning. If THAT goes out like this loop did, my awning rolls up like a cat on a hot stove..not good, risking my awning. So, bought one at the local RV store. My 8 dollar strap has now turned into a 16 dollar one...can't return it, packing material is gone..who'd a thunk a strap made of cloth and rubber would be defective.

The problems are of the same type as those found in Calculus with Analytic Geometry, and they are explained in the same dry way. In other words, the Calculus with Analytic Geometry Study Guide doesn't really help to clear up any confusion, nor does it serve as a \\"guide\\" of some sort--it's simply more textbook problems!If you are having trouble with Calculus with Analytic Geometry, the Study Guide will do you no good.

I see this girl improving as she gets older, and becoming a worldwide star - well, at least she deserves it because she has an amazing voice and some great songs.

The first single, \\"Absolutely Everybody,\\" has stormed its way into the top 10 in Australia, where this artist is based. This single should hit stores throughout Europe within the next few weeks, with the States set for later this winter (their summer). The track is an infectious, upbeat dance song that's ripe for club play all over the globe. This should attract leading CHR stations and set up the second single, \\"Take A Look,\\" in a perfect manner. The first time I heard this song, I honestly thought it was Hanson.

Unfortunately, whoever did the electronic version was too sloppy or too lazy to check and see if the spell-checking/auto-correct was screwing up the author's work. 'Torc' now reads 'tore' among other nonsensical things... It's so bad that when the Dougal character mistakes the Non-Born King for a character from Narnia, he calls him \\"Asian\\" instead of Aslan!

In my enthusiasm of finding the Golden Torc series on Kindle, I went ahead and bought them all at once.The first 2 books were marred by occasional transcription errors, but not so many as to spoil the experience. Not so with the 3rd and 4th.In have really tried to get over the constant misspellings created by a very poor OCR product, and without any perceptible quality control, but when they are so frequent and of core words too, it's impossible.This has detracted to such an extent that the joy of re-reading a much loved classic in Kindle format has become an irritant.Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to go on without rectification. Others have previously commented on this and you have done nothing about it. Do you actually read the product reviews?Bottom line, overpriced for such shoddy quality. Please sort it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Proofing Rather Poor (Kindle version)","review":"As usual, Julian May writes a great book, the 4th in the Many Colored Land series, which is in itself a continuation of her Galactic Milieu series. This book has an exciting climax as the Pliocene Exile is changed forever and the stage is set for the other, temporally earlier books in the Milieu series.I like this book and the whole series, but the Kindle version of this book is clearly a poor OCR conversion of the original book. I didn't find it as annoying as some, but it IS fairly annoying that most of the more glaring issues could probably be fixed in about an hour or less of editing. Heck, a search and replace of torc for tore would likely take <10 minutes and would fix about 50% of the issues.Anyway, I think it is is still worth getting this book in Kindle form, but I do hope the publisher eventually updates and fixes the editing/proofreading."},{"rating":"1","title":"too time consuming","review":"Really not worth the time it takes.

Her style on the horn owes alot to her vocal method: calm, world-weary and quietly amused. That's how it sounds to me, anyways. Jim O'Rourke also plays on the record, and his presence lends it a few more non-guitar sounds than are heard on the other early SYRs--and with that a bit less guitar sound--but especially on the third track the electronics blend wonderfully with what the other Sonics are doing. Note: this isn't really a pop record, and if you expect it to be you'll probably be disappointed. But if you're in the mood for 50 minutes of beautiful sounds and slow yet inevitable development, this is the record for you. And it rocks quite a bit towards the end, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUNDS FROM WAY OUT","review":"Where exactly are Sonic Youth going with this? - one might ask. I'd be very surprised if they could answer the question themselves. But this is excellent sound-pollution, and take nothing away from Sonic Youth.

Sort of like classic turnbased Battletech at full throttle. Its not an RTS. The package says its 'timed-play'. There is definitely a different feel to this game style. It has role-playing of the team which you create to pilot the Titan-AT vehicles with stats, attributes and skills which can be improved with experience. You can also design the Titans from scratch to an almost incredible level. There are about 20 different chassis which can hold any number of weapons and systems. This is an extremely deep, well thought out strategy/tactical? Roleplaying game with a lot of design fun. A real man's strategy game. It is definitely not dumbed down for the masses increasing its overall brilliance. A great strategy game for battletech. Its the best battletech style wargame I've played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"This game is simply a must-have for fans of good turn-based PC strategy. It's the closest thing to a PC version of my beloved Battletech tabletop system since... well, ever. It even feels like a board game, though with the added bonus of being able to watch your Titans stomping around on height-mapped terrain and shoot things with all manner of cool weaponry. You can design your own Titans from the ground up and outfit them with tons of components and electronic warfare systems. You can create your own teams of pilots and customize their skills to suit your play style. Your pilots get better with experience, and you really develop strong attachments to them over time. It's all extremely addictive, and multiplayer is a complete blast! This is the most enthralling and downright fun game I've purchased in quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is horrible...","review":"First off, let me say I'm not a graphics junkie. I'm still playing stuff like Icewind Dale II and enjoying it plenty on my aging Sony Vaio. But Titans of Steel was horrible - plenty of great gameplay ideas visually displayed in a manner reminiscent of \\"Jumpman\\" on my Commodore 64 some 18-20 years ago. Okay, maybe not that bad, but really - this is horrible. And everything (including graphics) is great up until the moment you actually take your carefully designed character out into the game to play. Then the extreme burdensome detail put into all the rules and calculations that determine battle effects immediately become exasperating, and you scratch your head in perplexity as to why such effort wasn't put into the visual aspect. Did this game run out of money and get finished on someone's home PC or something???"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is terrible - not recommended","review":"This is a terrible game. The previous reviews were glowing, so I thought I would try it out. However, as soon as I opened the package, I knew I was in trouble. The graphics are a nightmare (looks like it was created 20+ years ago) and the commands are burdensome (walk one space east, walk one space south, shoot, etc). If you like retro games maybe this might be fun for you but for me I prefer older games like BattleMech many times over before I would retry this game. After I bought the game I noticed that many of the glowing reviews were written by the same person, bumping up the recommendation. My recommendation: stay away from this game but look at the BattleMech series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Dont waste your time.

I personally was looking forward to Crackers new release Greenland.However this album in a nutshell is dry and weak. There are no catchy tunes like in the past. The single \\"Something you aint got\\" is strong, as is \\"everybody gets one for free\\". The rest of album lacks something. Its full of repetitive choruses, and weak guitar riffs.Countrysides was great, and I dont like country at all. Their last studio album \\"Forever\\" was great too with a strong mix of rockers, ballads, and dance numbers.OVERALL A DISSAPOINTED CRACKER FAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I have to agree with the disappointed fan below -- I'm greatly disappointed with this CD. If you're looking for catchy Cracker tunes like what you'll find on all their other CDs, this is the wrong place to look. For me, a good Cracker CD is one that has a couple of immediately catchy songs and then others that grow on you with repeated listens -- Forever was a good example. So was Gentleman's Blues. So was everything they've done, until now. What happened? In these days of dying rock stations I thought I could count on Cracker, but I guess I'll have to stick with their previous releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe my favorite Cracker Album","review":"From their alt-country to edgier rock tracks, this album sounds like a mature version of their early work. Nothing sounds like it was thrown on here to appease the radio crowd. The dark heavier sounds of Sidi Ifni and The Minotaur contrast perfectly with Where Have the Good Times Gone and Darling We're Out of Time. And after seeing them live The Riverside earns new respect. If you like Cracker, and crave a more mature sound, this album is definitely for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PartyBall will spellbind you !","review":"This album is like a treasure you come across by accident. Dont be fooled by the cover. It is such a well produced album with such musical diversity you feel like you are reading a Raymond Chandler book with its eccentric tracks that are exciting to the imagination and send you off to a world of imagination that propells into becoming your very own film director as the stories unfold.

This is not to say that P-B was copying Sibelius, for he has his own voice, I believe, within the late Romantic idiom, but they both share a love for the starkness of the sublime, a love they both communicate superbly through their music.

The problem is, there is too much history there and bad memories. His brother was killed by hoodlums way back when they were younger, and the hoodlums were then hit by a train on the same day. Now the hoodlums have returned to finish off the brother. Sounds ridiculous but it works. Everybody can see these guys but nobody believes the teacher when he tries to convince them that they are very evil. It has a very eeery feeling to it, and remains one of my favs from the early 90's.DVD - Has been released twice on DVD both with an average print quality. Looks more like video quality. The first DVD edition is just the film, while the second DVD release includes the dreadful sequel which has nothing to do with the original (look for a young Hilary Swank in it).Ignore the sequel, and enjoy the first installment instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The story was a \\"cartoon\\" with a narrator and a person \\"signing\\" for those with hearing difficulties.

This one is geared toward hearing impaired children or someone learning sign language. While I think this is great for hearing impaired children who can not yet read, if you are thinking you'd like to add to your library with a few more stories you don't have yet, you might reconsider this one. The people doing the sign language are right in the middle of the screen in front of the pictures and are quite distracting from the story. We love these stories and were disappointed that it was not very enjoyable to watch in this format. Too bad they don't make another series with all of these done for hearing impaired children and another done the original way. The product has a sign language icon but on the cover but be warned it isn't an option to toggle off and it's very intrusive to the story being told."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooring!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Unless you have a child who is learning extreme sign language, do not buy this movie!! what a waste of money its not even a real cartoon its just pictures from the book and people standing there doing sign language blocking the picture. my daughter was so disappointed and got bored very fast...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Little Monkeys..............Disappointed!","review":"Don't even buy this unless it is for a impaired child.

Oh, forget it. This minor curiosity from the early 60's combines the schlocky production values of Grade-Z sci-fi films from the 50's with a bit of the campy excess found in the Saturday-matinee serials of the 1930's. The result is watchable but not especially fun.Dean Fredericks (better known for his short-lived \\"Steve Canyon\\" series on TV) is stiff and humorless as the astronaut but he has the right looks and he gets the opportunity to do an extended bare-chest scene. (If you can't act, flex.)An old, tired, and almost-pathetic Francis X. Bushman pops up in a small part.

As usual, Bobbi's style and elegance shine (no pun intended) in every word, picture and explanation. It's a great tool and workbook for any woman.There isn't a look that isn't covered : from all age ranges, getting older (which let's confess - we all are) dealing with health issues, taking care of your glorious skin, day, work, night, and special occasion.

Did Bobbi Brown really write this?","review":"My daughter ordered this book and has these comments:This book attempts to cover each age group in the population, suggesting targeted beauty, well-being, and health tips. It fails miserably, because it is not accessible for most readers, who might get a single page devoted to them personally. The tips are mostly common sense (exercise, eat right, etc.), and while this book tries to be holistic in it's scope, we all know we should take care of our bones and relax...it's nothing new or anything to get excited about. It is a bare-bones collection of photos of people who could walk the runway at any age, and tips that read more like the sugeon general's recommendations, and less like a true beauty insider's secrets. Really no practical info here, I expected more from a makeup guru like Bobbi Brown. Did she even have any part in this book's production? Seems like it could have been written by anyone...and had her name slapped on to sell more copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"like her books, not this one.","review":"I think this book is pretty outdated now.

Years of reading fashion magazines and getting makeovers had put me into a comfortable groove. Yet Bobbi did teach me a few new tricks with the tips she suggests in this book. I whizzed through it in one evening and found it to be an easy read. I think the biggest thing women forget is that if they're 40 and still treating their face as if they're 30, they're not doing themselves any favors. Bobbi reminds us of the essentials we need to know at each age. Sure, there are some unnecessary bits in the book that I already knew. But maybe the next woman won't know those things already.

There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life. However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication. I would only purchase this book at a bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing you haven't read before","review":"I'm a makeup junkie, so I eagerly awaited this book. If you have other makeup books, especially those by people like Kevyn Aucoin, and her earlier work \\"Bobbi Brown Beauty\\", save your money. It is just a feel good about being a woman book, not a makeup book.

While watching the movie, I was extremely disappointed. Like for example the fact that Pee-Wee has this hyper-active libido. He's supposed to be child-like, and immature. Not sex-crazed! Plus I think I laughed like twice during the movie, as opposed to being doubled over in laughter every time I watch \\"Big Adventure\\".

Whereas 'pee wee's big adventure' explored more of pee wees quirkiness (remember the scene with the tape in the bathroom) 'big top pee wee' tried to take the character move him to a different setting and make a sort of romantic comedy.. This is probably where it all falls apart.. pee wee should not be a romantic figure - he is the opposite.. he is best when he remains a sort of neuter or man child.. the second romance enters the picture.. pee wee loses all of his charm and comedy.. there are a few funny moments in big top pee wee but on the whole it falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Top Loser","review":"I can't believe this unfunny awful movie compared to PWs Big Adventure.

It has a couple tiny laughs, but they don't last long.

Randal Kleiser, the director of such films of Grease and The Blue Lagoon, flubs up Pee-wee's second and ultimately last feature. The movie starts off OK, with Pee-wee hamming it up as a Frank Sinatraesque crooner but then goes down hill from there. Movie somewhat redeems itself with the longest screen kiss in movie history but then finally hits rock bottom. The ending is horrible, and leaves a feeling of insecurity and confusion. When I first got this movie, I was expecting a funny movie, what I got was an overly bland mess of a movie. It still is interesting to watch but doesn't leave a feeling of satisfaction.

There is not even a decent message to take away with you. Who doesn't know that chat rooms are not the key to finding love? This film (and I use that term lightly as the picture quality suggests videotape) is so rushed that it is over by the time you get back from the bathroom and even a child would be able to figure out the entire plot within the first 5 minutes.

It is a little bulky and takes up quite a bit of room but it was easy to put together and is the right size for a young child. The only issue I have had is that the paint scratches/chips easily, even without rough play. For example, a plastic horse has left black hoof marks on the top that cannot be removed, and red play-dough stains it and is hard to clean off without removing paint.

The hardware to attack the table-top to the base is sub-standard metal that was bent in shipment and i was able to bend back with just my hands.

The cute storage compartments are also great, but not as much for a two-year old who takes things out of them and doesn't put them back. Not only do I have problems with the 2 year old, but also I have problems with the puppy who does the same thing.

I've been in education for over 20 years, and have taught university courses on educational technology. This product is beyond horrible. It's just a collection of multiple choice quiz items. Even the interface to select those is stupid.Basic pedagogy dictates that first you teach students something, and then you assess them to see if they learned it. This skips the teaching part all together. The loud buzzer for incorrect answers announces to all within earshot that the student is dumb, and just adds injury to insult.The claims on the box about \\"lessons\\" and \\"tutorials\\" are a complete lie.

His writing shows a real craftsman's touch and sureness of hand.

Additionally, he is a hard read and it is often said that most people only read the first chapter (which outlines the basic principles) and skip the rest. Nonetheless, the book has value as a historical document. For good or ill, Mahan had a profound influence on the formulation of American Naval Policy. Today's Blue Water Navy (most recently promoted by former Navy Secretary John Lehman as the \\"Six Hundred Ship Navy\\") is built around the fundamental Mahan principle of building a fleet to destroy the enemy's fleet on the high seas. The U.S. Navy, one hundred years after Mahan, is only now adopting a new, littoral strategy fundamentally different from Mahan's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A interesting Thesis on how to become a world power","review":"Mahan uses how the British Empire fought with its navy and withs its econmic navy how it rose to become the empire that is was in the 18th-19th century.

Passages bemoaning the state of the American navy in the late 19th century are sprinkled throughout this text. U.S. policy in the following years and his remembrance in Annapolis, aside from famed anecdotal readers and devotees, attest to his being heard.While the thesis is self-evident in the title, this book is a worthwhile read to those interested in history and the history of empires.

It's well enough written, and the advice is generally sound and perfectly applicable. But since it's so old, I certainly could not recommend it to clients or others with a straight face.

This is because it's the unplugged version and each song is different from it's origional format. However, this cd is great for easy listening and the music blends perfectly. It's all very beautiful and consistant throughout the album.

So maybe even the hard core rockers might find it pleasurable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good CD","review":"The Seventh Night is all an all-acoustic album. Most of the songs are really soothing and light. The other more fun ones, like 'Papa Lapped a Pap Lopped' and 'Mirror', are a great listen, too.

Sound is very good...although a bit choppy when the slide is either all the way up or all the way down. Pretty long whistle, and that problem is only at either extreme...hence the whistle has a good, clear sound for the most part. Surprisingly sturdy.

You would have to have a heart made of stone to not enjoy this cute whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grover plastic slide better than Yankee metal","review":"When I wanted a slide whistle to accompany a storyteller, I chose the Yankee cause it was made of metal and a bit more expensive than the plastic Grover. The metal slide whistle works for 2 blows and then gets very airy sounding. The pitch range is very limited. After working with it for several months and trying many different ways of blowing into it, tightening it, wiping it etc--I gave up and got a Grover--a good ole classic plastic slide whistle. Sounds great--great pitch range and consistent sound for long periods of play. Get it if you want a good slide whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, budget friendly, well made whistle.","review":"Well as other parents, I had to get this toy after my kids saw the slide whistle episode on Spongebob.

Bought it after hearing her performance at the Bethel Perfoming Arts Center in NY during the jazz weekend in Aug '06. Some of my favorite songs with lots of intelligent sarcasm and truisms. I listened to the 2nd release and was totally bummed. Poorly produced (stick with the elders, their mass appeal talent is why they stay in business), no bite (but lots of screaming), and generally dull. Not sure what Lauper and Lang contribute since the combination of 3 voices with unique styles is grating. Hope she considers a 3rd release and gets some help in performing and producing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Nellie","review":"Folks, if you are looking for songwriting brilliance than please check out this release. There is no person recording today who has any talent remotely close to her and I am certain you'll not regret buying both of her recordings. What can I say?

Having never heard of Nellie McKay, I gave it a chance, and listened to about the first 30 seconds of each track on both discs. Not only does she sing out of tune over half the time, but the melodies and harmonies are so unimaginative, it's practically unbearable to listen to. My dad told me her songs have great lyrics, and maybe they do, but since you can't understand them 90% of the time, who cares? I'm a musician myself, so maybe I'm harsher than the average critic, but I don't know how anyone in his right mind could listen to a whole song without being bored and without wincing at the obvious pitch problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the debut first","review":"Her 18-track debut \\"Get Away From Me\\", produced by legendary Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick in 2004, is a masterpiece. Workaholic Nellie self-produced this 23-track followup just a year later, so it's hardly surprising that it's not as consistent, witty, or polished.Classics: \\"The Big One\\", \\"Beecharmer\\". Rockin': \\"The Down Low\\", \\"Real Life\\", \\"Columbia Is Bleeding\\". Good: \\"I Am Nothing\\", \\"Mama & Me\\" (despite the start and finish). Perfect trifles: the hilarious \\"Pounce\\", \\"Lali Est Paresseux\\", \\"Food\\". The rest: a lot of nice musical ideas with fairly banal lyrics. Buy this anyway and support one of the most promising new artists of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The test of time - with flying colors!","review":"I have had this album for a couple of years, and listened to it again this morning (for the I don't know how many-th time).

Hers is about the most original music you are going to find these days, yet it is totally accessible. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No words can describe...","review":"Even though Columbia Records put a delay on \\"Pretty Little Head,\\" all that I can think is that this album was entirely worth the wait.From the opening track \\"Cupcake,\\" Nellie proves that she hasn't lost her edge since \\"Get Away From Me\\" two years ago.Buy it. Listen to it. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you should listen to the suits","review":"Get Away From Me is one of my favorite albums of the last 6 months or so (I came late to the party). The first time I heard it I listened to it three times in a row.Not so with this album. Didn't really need to hear it again. It lacks the individualistic qualities of Get Away. Where are the biting, ironic lyrics and the toying with the traditional music forms that made the first collection so much fun? There's just nothing here that grabs the listener. It's unfocused, just about all the songs are the same mid-tempo pace, and the production is muddy.The story of the put-upon songwriter struggling with the big-bad recording company doesn't make this collection any better. Sounds like McKay did a tremendous amount of work to get this together, so it's a shame the end result isn't better.I'm sure she still has a great career ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 27","review":"Rarely seen nowaday , this movie could be considered as a study of class relations in the Middle Ages between the Nobles, the Church and the rest of the Nation.

And Nicky, now fresh from the shower, is astonishingly patient while gently helping Nigel get on with life. The murder seems incidental--the growing relationship is the thing set against the crime which means that the heroes must fly around the West to solve the puzzle. Ah well, with that kind of money, who needs an advance purchase ticket?

I'll wait for his third offering and hope it's the real sequel to his first CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"idont really like it","review":"i dont really like usher he has a nice body but an ugly face just like chris king without the nice body"},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay album","review":"usher is catchy but overall his voice and music don't have much substance.he is a dime a dozen.he is about the same as genuwine.both inspired by bobby brown in dance and style but no vocal ability at all and no persona.you make me wanna was good and catchy and now it's all but forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"His way indeed....","review":"I was impressed by his sophomore album.

I wish Usher the best.","review":"This cd was a big change for Usher. The lyrics aren't just for people who are into R&B, they are for people who have been or are in love. I like Usher's music because I can relate to everything he is talking about. Whenever I'm feeling stressed out, all I have to do is come home and turn on Usher. After the songs go off, I feel like a new person. Before, I thought his music was good, but now I think his music is great. I wish Usher the best of luck, and I hope he continues to do it \\"His Way.\\" Good Luck Usher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Usher.

I found his writing to be quite engaging, and felt as if I had met Hesse myself. The section on Jung piqued my interest enough for me to search for his, The Undiscovered Self, which I loved as well. I also went on to read Mr. Serrano's, The Ultimate Flower. Unfortunately most of Serrano's other works are out of print. Get this before it goes o.o.p. too. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miguel was a member of the Chilean Nazi party! and Hitler supporter!","review":"I read this book and really enjoyed the intimate details about Miguel's meeting with Hesse and Jung - I have been a Hesse fan most my life. However, I was incredibly shocked and disappointed to learn that Miguel was a Nazi supporter! and supported Hitler throughout the war! Absolutely disgusting and disturbing that someone who could love Herman Hesse, so much, could also be a strong Nazi supporter. I'm at a loss of words. Like me, I'm sure most readers of this book have no idea about Miguel's dark roots. It depresses me to have to write this review.

Klemperer has really created a vivid, romantic performance of this score. It's of epic proportions. Yet, the orchestral playing is quite poor. The Philharmonia is suposed to be this world-class orchestra, but you wouldn't know it by the way the play here. The final chords are marred by sloppy attacks and reckless tuning. It leaves you with a very bitter taste. I agree that the choir is increadible, but the orchestra is just not up to the challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great!","review":"As heralded as this recording is, the CD simply does not reflect a good transfer from analog to digital. Compared to other performances of this work, the sound seems dead at times and the recording level extremely inconsistent at others. The finale is as advertised--together and generally inspirational. But it doesn't make up for the flaws noted above. The tempi are a bit unusual as well, ranging from plodding to agitatingly quick. Klemperer may have been one of the greats, but based on this recording alone, I have some doubts. Good, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"missing planes of the 452nd bomb group","review":"This book in a \\"matter of fact\\" manner graphically provides an insight into the lives of our brave WWII heroes and what they contributed to the defeat of Nazi Germany.

There are three chapters full of ideas, all with beautiful pictures, easy-to-do instructions with project patterns and cut-outs. Another chapter is devoted to personalizing your projects with unique details. There is also a chapter with instructions on decorative detailing; Antiquing, Gold Leafing, Crackling, Marbleizing and more. There's even a Metric Equivalency Chart for those of you who like to use exact measuring."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOLO EFFORT","review":"Maybe Ric Ocasek decided the Cars would be his multi-platinum band and he could release his more unconvential songs on solo efforts. Whatever the case I find this to be more satisfying than anything the Cars did after it and it is chock full of interesting and moving songs. More along the lines of Panarama than over produced Cars records that would follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIC'S BEST SOLO RECORD!!!","review":"The first two reviews listed here pretty much tell the truth about Ric's first solo record. I compare it very much to The Cars \\"Panorama\\" because of it's starkness. I must correct the first reviewer here. The only other Cars member featured on Beatitude is keyboardist Greg Hawkes, who contributes to several songs here as well as co-writing one with Ocasek \\"Out of Control.\\" Easton and Orr are not on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I was glad to see that this record was finally released on CD. As other reviewers have noted, it's very similar to Panarama.

Unfortunately it didn't happen that way. I've listened to it time and again over the years and never find myself able to make a connection with anything but Something To Grab For, no matter how many serious listenings I subject it to. After this Ric's solo stuff got progressively more odd, so I guess it's to be expected that he started losing me right off the bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GREAT SOLO EFFORT","review":"Not a great start for Cars' frontman Rick. Connect up yo You, Jimmy Jimmy, and Quick One, are the highlights of a rather stale cd. The songs seem uninsipred, and the production sterile. Pick his later cds, or his CARS cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrgh","review":"I grew up listening to the Cars. I love every Cars album ever made. I also like all of Ric Ocasek's solo albums... except for this one. I actually picked this one up in a bargin section of a record store that I can't remember the name of in Plainfield NJ. My friend and I listened it on the 1 1/2 hour ride home. It is the single worst thing I have ever heard...period. I tossed it out onto Route 287 it was so bad. Now, I know what you are thinking, i didn't give it a chance, well, to that I say, why would I want to take another bite of a turd that made me vomit up everything I've eaten in the last 12 years?

Also, even though we all love Susanna Hoffs, it's nice to see videos with the other band members singing as well. I own and frequently watch the video. It is reminicent of the time period as well as a great rock band with women who could really play their instruments, not to mention looking cool at the same time. No all-girl band ever looked cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened? Better than nothing I guess.","review":"I agree with the other statements about this DVD collection. It is better than nothing but why such a shabby treatment to a great band. I was a huge fan of the band and had seen them many times. Look for the good looking guy holding the bangles1 License plate in the \\"Be With You Video? I have the VHS copy and was excited to see it was coming out on DVD. It looks ok then really grainy and then ok again. They added nothing on the DVD that would make you want to buy the DVD instead of the Video. With the release of \\"Doll Revolution\\" I thought we might actually get a quality DVD. The fans got slapped in the face. We can hope that they will redo the DVD the way it should be made. If you can find the VHS copy get it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"\`80's Pop videos of an all-female quartet","review":"Has there ever been a more beautiful love song than \\"Eternal Flame\\"? The music videos in this collection range from that pretty one to the to dance to chart-topper, \\"Walk Like An Egyptian\\". There are a few special guest star appearances, Leonard Nimoy (on \\"Going Down To Liverpool\\") and Little Richard with a cameo by Randy Quaid (on \\"Walking Down Your Street\\"). This collection by the all-female band fronted by Susanna Hoffs concludes with the in-concert music video, \\"Be With You\\". The DVD also includes song chapters and a discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipped Hazy Shade Of Winter","review":"As another reviewer pointed out this collection does not include the video for 'Hazy Shade Of Winter'. They also missed one of the Bangles earliest videos 'The real world' from 1983 and 'Everything I wanted' from 1990.I would have liked for those videos to have been included but the ones that are here are great and I enjoyed watching them again.This DVD is just videos with no commentary from the artists or anyone else.

I found the book absolutely delightful. It gives great insight into the administration of Jackson and also into the other men who made up that administration. Schlesinger writes a page-turning biography if that doesn't sound strange. Plus, the use of footnotes lets the reader know the book is an excellent source of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I quit reading this book halfway through. Having said that, I'll offer the following observations. First, the research is incredible- he made good use of primary source material, and cited it very thoroughly. That's why I gave him two stars. However, he is terribly tedious, unfocused, and slants leftward at a ninety-degree angle. I would only use this book if I had something that slanted rightward to the same degree to balance it. He is certainly not as objective as a historian should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dizzied","review":"There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked up this book off the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed Masterpiece","review":"In the sixty years since Schlessinger wrote TAOJ, our attitudes towards history have changed. Sparked in part by the civil rights movement, we now realize the importance of Jackson's policies towards the Native Americans. In this sense, as Schlessinger and all other historians before the 1960s fail to note, Jackson was deeply flawed. Still, no one is either all good or all bad. Schlessinger paints a very good and convincing portrait of Jackson's policies towards white Americans. He shows the logic behind Jackson's opposition to the Bank of the United States and support of hard money beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Not only is this a classic Progressive interpretation of Jacksonian era politics, it offers great insight into how intellectuals of the forties understood the New Deal and saw it foreshadowed by Jackson and Van Buren. It is far from comprehensive in scope, and lack of attention to the Trail of Tears says alot about how New Deal liberals thought about diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson deserves better","review":"When Arthur Sclesinger wrote this book about 1939, he wanted to justify American involvement in World War II. He told Jackson's story alright, but from the hidden perspective of his own times. Today, we have many different interests and Schesinger's book is passe. There is much more to the age of Jackson than wars and politics, although from the content of this book you would be hard pressed to see that. Save your money. But Remini's biography or any number of more uptodate accounts of this great age."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was terrible!","review":"This book was most definetly a mild attempt to be a great American non-fiction author.

However one of the tiles had paint on the side, and that was an issue. Anyone who plays Mahjong knows that you don't want a tile that identifies itself when it is in your hand or on the board. We were able to sand the paint off, but I am not sure how you would deal with this kind of issue if you weren't able to remove the paint, unless you sent the whole set back. This is just the problem of ordering something you have not been able to inspect before hand. The set did not come with enough plastic coins to play our version of MJ, and there was not an options to order more. Frankly this set is pricey, and while the wood trays are nice, the tiles are the same as the ones you get with the less expensive version of the set with the plastic trays."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bargain here...","review":"Now I can see why this was in the bargain bin.

In contrast to what I was hoping for in this book what I did find was refreshing and touching. I would have never thought someone having to hold a big secret like that could really tear at your very being, making your life sort of revolve around the subject. I would recommend this book to a younger reader, but as short of a story as it is the journey that Luna takes on gives hope to some who may have very little to none. The fear of actually living with gender dysphoria in a household that turns a blind eye to it as if to shut it out or make it seems fallible would add tremendous strain on oneself. The writer does not really give way to many emotions throughout the book until the very end which was a bit upsetting.

She's torn betweeen supporting and standing by her brother and yet wanting to avoid it all and live her own life.

It shows off their amazing virtuosity, tonal beauty, and meshed musical instincts. The arrival of the ABQ on the scene reinvigorated the whole quartet scene in Europe. But their second cycle, recorded in live oncerts, was even more assured and musical. Connoissuers can enjoy comparing the two sets, but it must be said that EMI's low-budget transfers to CD are execreable. The shrillness of the first violin at high volume makes the performance unlistenable, a shame given the ABQ's ravishing beauty of tone. Avoid this CD unless you absolutely can't afford their later versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Narrative Poem","review":"The Diviners is McDowell's book length poem about a family as it falls apart through five decades.

Otherwise I wish I hadn't read it. To become involved in a story & there is no ending is depressing enough but there also is no beginning & a real lack of character development.

It was a disappointment. There was very little character development, a disjointed plot that seemed to be more repeats of other plots than a new one, little deep emotion between the hero and heroine. In short, an unsatisfying read. I highly recommend every other book in the series, most especially Dark Prince and Dark Desire.

I have had this book on preorder for months. I read it last night and was very disappointed. Part of the problem in the Feehan story seemed to be the editing. There was one part where Gary was able to communicate telepathically with Traian, but the story never indicated when the two had exchanged blood. The end was also very strange. I turned the page and thought to myself \\"Are you kidding? That's the end of the story??! Nothing has been resolved!\\" I really hope this is just a little bridge to the next full length novel because I was very disappointed when I finished the story.I bought this book for the Feehan story alone, so if you are in the same boat, you will want to read the story just in case it is setting us up for the next book, but be prepared to be left hanging!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"I was very much looking forward to the next book in the Dark Hunter series (Christine Feehan) This was a big disappointment. Where was the character development? I could complain at length about inconsistances but would end up giving away the story. It read like a comic strip. The story seemed full of teasers for future books. The ending was terrible, this was too short to engage the reader (who would have to have read previous books in the series to make any sense of the plot). I felt like that about the other short stories in this anthology. I kept thinking I was missing a big chunk of the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I AM A HUGE CHRISTINE FEEHAN FAN, I HAVE ALL HER BOOKS. I LOOKED FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THE ONLY ONE AND WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. THIS STORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL LENGTH NOVEL. THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON THAT COULD NOT BE FULLY DEVELOPED IN SUCH A SMALL BOOK, THE CHARACTERS GOT CHEATED BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL BUT WERE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED AND THE END JUST LEFT YOU HANGING. I HOPE THIS BOOK IS REWRITTEN FOR A FUTURE RELEASE DATE BECAUSE IT COULD BE GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"As someone has mentioned in a earlier reivew, I can understand their disappointment. I am a great fan of Christine Feehan and even her story line was not good. There are no words to describe the remaining two stories because there was no plot build up at all. If you are a fan of Christine Feehan, I would recommend any other books than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three excellent stories!","review":"Susan Grant's The Star Queen was fantastic! If you have read any of her Star Series, you will definitely want to read this. You'll get to learn of The Dark Years and how the Vash Nadah began. As always Ms. Grant's detail is exceptional. Both h/h are so likeable and fascinating, and yes, the hero is very sexy. If you haven't read any of her Star Series (shame), get them: The Star King; The Star Prince; and in August, The Star Princess.Christine Feehan's Dark Descent was wonderful and thrilling, as are all her other books in the Dark Series. As a regular reader, I didn't have to read the same background and descriptions. It cuts right to the chase and I though that was very refreshing.Susan Squire's Sacrilege was so entertaining. Susan's writing makes me shiver, laugh, gulp, and I can't seem to turn the pages fast enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"I like Christine Feehan's books, and have read all her Carpathian novels...this short story is too short. I couldn't believe it when I turned the last page and the story was over...many issues are not resolved. I imagine that some of the issues raised in this story will be dealt with in a future novel, but it is still disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More does not mean better","review":"Maybe I'm spoiled,but,and I did buy it, Ms.Feehan is a fantastic writer. Putting the other two with her made the whole book a watery read if not worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't read this either","review":"another one star cause haven't read. I will say I have read some of feehan's book and if you've read one you've read them all unless things have changed in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, enjoyable, worthwhile, not 5-stars","review":"I gave the book 4 stars because Dark Descent ended too abruptly with too many unanswered mysteries. I was enjoying reading it, then BOOM it ended. I turned the page and was totally surprised that that was it.But I also very much enjoyed the last story in the book about Magda. I will read more by Susan Grant, I've discovered her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Wow! Fantastic!","review":"Christine Feehan's Dark Descent was incredible. Joie and Traian's story looks like it might continue a bit in a following book - yay!I love her \\"Dark\\" series -- can't get enough of them.All of the stories in this book are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes on the Book of Exodus, C.H. Macintosh","review":"If a person wants a rich devotional and insightful experience, it can be found in reading C.H. Macintosh's commentary on the Book of Exodus. The man's writing will feed your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed! What IS all the fuss about?","review":"I decided to check in and see what sort of reviews this CD has received and now I must put in my two cents' worth in echoing the negative comments. I read about Ades in the New Yorker about two years ago and then picked up this CD to check out his music. What a disappointment! To sum it all up very quickly and be done with it: the music is TOTALLY derivative. Anyone who has a fair knowledge of 20th century composition will not be in the least surprised or inspired. What was amusing about the New Yorker article was Ades' rather callow criticism of Brahms as being a bit tired or something along that line. Please, Tom! Don't be silly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot him with your bop gun","review":"Absolutely soulless \\"uptown\\" music, self-absorbed, incredibly white, lacking in humor (except for the liner notes, which are a scream). If you like to hear all that's wrong with classical music coming out of academia today, this one's for you: this stuff makes Milton Babbitt sound funky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!","review":"This book brought me in touch with the generations of women in my own family...those I adored but took for granted. Recommended to anyone who is looking for a connection to themselves and those they love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tending to Virginia","review":"Did not even get half way through the book before I deleted it from my Kindle Fire. BORING & SLOW. Have never read this author before and probably won't do so in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, but heavy...","review":"Wear good wading boots when you use these. They propel you very well through the water, but are a bit on the heavy side if you are walking a long way into a remote area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst fins made...","review":"The buckle system is useless. It's sloppy, poorly designed and frustrating. The fins are barely adequate. Tape a couple ping pong paddles to your feet and you will do better. Thoroughly disappointing product and design. The only viable description is \\"junk\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good option","review":"These are heavy, but don't seem to cause much problem in the water. Very easy to fit to almost any boot. Easy to step into and get out of. Much better than the type that you put your toes into. A good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great.","review":"huge!very hard and stiff.rear strap ridgid and rubs wader foot and they weigh a ton!I found much better light-weight ones for the same price and sent these back."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Loved this book. Wasn't sure I would at first but once I started reading it, I could not put it down. Good author. Can't wait to see what else she writes. The faith and scriptures mentioned in this book touched me in many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"You are more\\"","review":"There is a song by the band Tenth Avenue North called \\"You are more\\", it epitomizes this book. \\"You are more than the coices that you've made/you are more than your past mistakes/you've been remade\\". And while Annabelle spends most of the book finding that out, which I am perfectly fine with. It is just that I would like to see this character fully accept herself in Christ. Which by the end of the book she doesn't. Does Matthew ever forgive his father? Does Matthew and Annabelle ever end up saying \\"I love you\\"? And what happends to Sadie? Lots of questions that didn't get answered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump","review":"Purchased this pump for a large interior waterfall. It works great and it is very quite. Very happy with the purchase so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted for a 1.5 years","review":"Mag drive pumps are a really good pump. They are simple and last a long time usually longer than 1.5 yrs but mine is making a really loud noise now but it still works. Noise is similar to a hard drive when its looking for a file kind of a random grind/bump noise. But I have had a mag7 run for 3yrs w/o problems until I sold it. So in conclusion they are good pumps easy to take apart and clean. It heats up my 55 gallon about 2-3 deg above room temp so keep that in mind also keep in mind the watts of the mag pumps more watts = more heat = more money in electricty."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"very good examples of Stieglitz photos. excellent use of dark and light . in this day of color everything you forget how interesting the shades can be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these reviews real?","review":"This soap has 8 reviews written in a span of 3 days. Most of them look alike. I really suspect if these are geniune reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really did enjoy using the Caress soap. ...","review":"I really did enjoy using the Caress soap. It left my skin feeling very moisturized and the smell lasted a lot longer than most of the soaps I've tried. (But I did think the smell was a little strong for me.) It cleaned really well, also unlike most of the moisturizing bars I've used. I'd definitely tell my friends about this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the scent of the Caress bar. ...","review":"I enjoyed the scent of the Caress bar. I have very dry skin and it didn't dry my skin out. I felt, for bar soap, it was very moisturizing and left my skin feeling clean without any dull buildup. I'd recommend this product to family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this product. My skin didn't ...","review":"I really liked this product. My skin didn't feel as dry after using Caress. Other bar soaps seem to leave my skin very dry. I still prefer to use shower gels, because I think they work better for dry skin. I'd recommend this product to any friend who asked about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of The Robin and the Kestrel","review":"This was a great book and it kept me on the edge of my seat. There were no boring parts to it. I can't wait to read the Eagle and the Nightingale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibrant Baroque!","review":"What a refreshing cd to listen to! Nice violin playing and teamwork! Very period like. This guy is just as potent and effectual as Vivaldi. Vivaldi had many contemporaries and here is one of them. Just listening to this will change your mood a few degrees more positive and productive. Good crescendos and decrescendos throughout for added ambience and texture. Glad I purchased this. Thanks to the CPO label for recording lesser known composers and their works.Good day !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Naxos version is amazing","review":"I don't have this CD, so I can't comment on it, and gave a rating only because I had to. But the Naxos CD of Manfredini's Opus 3 Concerti Grossi is absolutely amazing, crystal clear, and very energetic, so it is hard to imagine this CD could be any better. Check out the Naxos version by Capella Istropolitana, which I believe is the only other version available. Also, I don't understand why the version here does not present the numbers 1 to 12 in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only butterfly you'll ever need","review":"I own four recordings of Madama Butterfly, each with its merits--the old classic with Gigli and Toti dal Monti, Bjoerling and de los Angeles, and Campora with Tabaldi. Then there is this one, in which the orchestra,the singers and the conductor are all on the same page. All of the singers are perfect for their respective roles--Bergonzi is subtle and insightful and even more so is Renata Scotto. There are other elements that bring this together in one of the \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\", to which I would add, of any century. In the final analysis, however, the deciding factor in the success of this great work of musical and recording art is Sir John Barbarolli. If you are a lover of Puccini and Madama Butterfly in particular, you should own more than one recording, if only to make comparisons to this one. Each will have its qualities, but none come close to the completeness of this one. Get it before it disappears as so many great ones do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotto","review":"Outstanding!! Best Choices. La Boheme (Beecham) is fantastic Tosca (Callas, Gobbi) also two of my favorites.I've owned this for awhile and just now appreciating it. Check out Carmen (Troyanos, Domingo) for some awesome opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding God and Finding Each Other","review":"For those who believe that marriages can't be saved after tragedy, this book proves not only that they can be, but that life can be even better through the power of a committed relationship with God. A truly remarkable story and one that the reader will never forget. Awe inspiring. I feel very fortunate to have read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fist and Beauty","review":"I think the idea of this movie is to mimic Enter The Dragon whileshowcasing the star Etsuko Shiomi, in that respect it was asuccess, It helped that Etsuko Shiomi is a real karate fighterin real life, few will remember that she once issued a challengeto a chinese actress who also portrayed tough girl roles, It wassuppose to be full contact, needless to say the chinese girldeclined, such was the reputation of Shiomi in her heydays,I wonder where she is now. If you like Kill Bill or Azumi, youwon't be disappointed in this movie specially as the star herehas real fighting talent. I could have rated this 5 stars butthe transfer to DVD could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Haydn recording","review":"Haydn's music is like the Bible. It never ceases to give out riches to satisfy the soul. And expositors of both are always finding new gold. When I first heard this recording on air, I was impressed and sought it out. It has not disappointed. In the two CDs there are 6 symphonies, four of them 'named' ones, including the lovely 'Farewell' and La Passione'. The Haydn catalogue is so full that it is difficult to choose favourite recordings, though Dorati for me often comes out tops.( see my review of the Dorati recordings) However, this is very fine playing indeed from a first-rate chamber orchestra and its conductor is a man of international stature. Interpretation often is a personal matter and ' one man's meat is....'However that may be, here you'll find vitality and finesse in playing and much pleasure and satisfaction as you listen. It has given that to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love the smell and the feel of ...","review":"You'll love the smell and the feel of your skin after using this for a week! What a difference! I used to use Dove, but I know that I'm now going to be a devoted Oil of Olay Bath Bar user. They were wonderful!!! It's amazing; the texture of my skin feels so much softer, and a lot of the dry patches I've been fighting for awhile have nearly disappeared completely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This soap is just wonderful.

Tremendously cool!! A lot of chops here on a diverse record. This seems to be a \\"lost\\" record. I was told the record company went bust, but it is a gem for Stray Cat fans.

I'd rather be the wiser and never order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check this dude out!","review":"I \\"discovered\\" Andrew at a Caedmon's Call concert recently.

It was fairly transparent and predictable. The characters were a little one-dimensional and really not that interesting. It reminded me of the story about the Christmas box. A lot of sentimental, overly dramatic melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit together","review":"The holder looks great, but needs to be assembled and the pieces do not fit together. Would be great if it could be assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed","review":"I bought this beautiful paper towel holder for the new home we were moving into. I have only used it a handful of times since the two months that I've had it (and by using it I mean unscrewing the rooster off the top to replace an empty paper towel center). The rooster will no longer screw on. I've probably changed paper towels on there MAYBE five times. It was a bit of a pain to have to remove the rooster anyway. I don't recommend this product at all. Also, there is a slight chip on the rod that holds the paper towels, but doesn't make a difference in screwing the rooster on."},{"rating":"1","title":"rooster comes off","review":"I agree with review that states the roll is too tight and you have to manually unroll the towel. When you can unroll, the rooster unscrews and comes off and the metal screw also falls off. Chance of losing the screw. It goes beautifully with my kitchen and I am planning to order some of the matching accessories. I already have the trivette. Too bad the mechanics of the towel holder are not suitable for rolls of thicker more absorbent towels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good...has issues","review":"Looks great, nice and heavy, excellent red color. Only problem is that once you screw the rooster back on after putting the paper towel roll on, it's almost too short and makes it hard for the roll to turn easily. The screw is metric of course...so waiting on the hubby to change that out wasn't going to fly with me, I added a washer or two on the bottom where the roll goes on and that seems to have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is too tight","review":"I love the look of this paper-towel holder, but it doesn't function very well. The space between the guide bar and the rod is too small for a full role of paper towels. I have to leave the rooster off the top until I have used at least 1/4 of the roll, otherwise I can't get the roll to turn & the towels won't come off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from Heather, exactly what I would expect!!!!!","review":"I have been a Heather Graham fan for sometime now and I look forward to her books. She takes you to the era in which the event take place and as you read you are truly there. When you read her books, you just can't put them down until you have finished the entire book. She keeps her audience turning the pages; one after the other, over and over.I will continue to purchase her books and will anticipate each and every moment as I read them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my type","review":"I deleted this purchase .

It took all the grid I had to finish this one (I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't). The plot was so promising, but the heroine was dumb as a boot and extremely self-centered, and never grew up. By the end of the story I was hoping our wonderful viking hero would wake up and leave her on the mercy of her enemies. Melisande keeps repeating herself in all the conversations, so it felt like I was reading the same page over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow up to Alphabet Adventure","review":"I bought this book for my four year old daaughter because we both loved Alphabet Adventure so much. The story centers on little x this time. He decidedes to run away because he is a letter that isn't used very much. All of the other letters embark on an adventure to bring him home. This book is especially perfect for this time of year. There is a spooky castle and a monster M that evokes images of Halloween. At the end of the story little x realizes that he is a very special letter after all. Children love the idea of a mystery and the illustrations in this book are really wonderful. Everytime you read it you will see something new. My daughter especially loves the page where the letters match up to an object that they begin with. My daughter has learned a lot from this book and Alphabet Adventure. I highly recommend them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son loves this book","review":"My 2 year old son is obsessed with the alphabet so he was so thrilled to see a book that treats letters like cartoon characters. When we first got the book, he wanted me to read it with him at least 3 times a day. If your child loves letters, they will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute Mom's Birthday Book","review":"I first got the book from the local library to read to my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson about the Alphabet.

It was a mega hit. I also teach at a University and will share this book with our children's literature faculty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"At the start, this sounds like a standard Ludlum setup. A spy doesn't remember who he is. He gets out of the psychiatric holding facility with the aid of a sympathetic woman.She goes on the run with him, etc., etc. Add in a Chinese assassin and some US-Chinese political motivation and things improve a little. Not too many thrillers star auditor characters, either, and there is a CIA auditor in this one.It ends at a World Economic Forum in Davos, where Ludlum throws in a plot twist. So, it becomes a decent enough book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIME TO RETIRE A DEAD AUTHOR?","review":"As a long time Ludlum fan, I can't help but be disappointed by this book. The pace is erratic, the characters lackluster and the ending uninspired. I couldn't help but be reminded of the original Ludlum with that heart-pounding suspense when I read the recently published espionage novel by Ward Larsen, The Perfect Assassin. This is a book with an intelligent plot, incredible characters and a pace that really does keep you up at night. A lot like Tom Clancy but not with the interminable details."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"What a disappointment. I always really enjoyed Robert Ludlum's books. And some of the books that appeared after his death, 'co-authored', weren't that bad. This however is absolutely awful. It is so bad and so unbelievable and so badly written, I had to give up. And I rarely do.Don't buy this, buy an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the Thesaurus","review":"I have enjoyed all the Ludlum books over the years and even after his death, I still found the replacement writers have carried on his skills....UP TO NOW!!!This edition was a rambling stroll thru endless eruptions from a thesaurus that continuously injected wording that was so totally distracting that I lost interest in the storyline. I believe it is time for me to remove the Robert Ludlum series from my future interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Men Tell No Tales","review":"With so many authors out there, writing good books, it is a shame that people are being fed these Mcbooks...Ludlum and Harold Robbins are the worst case...of novels written by others, but using the originals name in order to merely make money.

Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contemplative warning","review":"If I had $1.00 for every time I heard the words \\"contemplative\\" and \\"visage\\" on the \\"Ambler Warning\\" audio book I would be very wealthy!

Where am I? And why are they constantly drugging me? That's pretty much the starting point of this book about Hal Ambler. A spy novel from Robert Ludlum extremely well written with a relatively simple plot and an ending that you're not going to expect.Once our main character clears from the drugged haze and remembers bits and pieces of his former life as a spy--and he remembers his name, he finds that the entire world has no record of him existing and no one knows him. His old College yearbook doesn't have a Hal Ambler. His old college roommate never heard of him... Flawed memory in our hero or world class conspiracy?? Read the book to see!I just listened to the UnAbridged version of the book--all 14 CDs worth of contents.

I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first half was good","review":"I wish I would've read the reviews before I got this book. First I did not realize this author is dead. I do not that Ludlum has some good books, so I will go look for some of his older novels.The first part of this book was awesome. Than it dragged and dragged and dragged. I knew who the real killer was and was not surprised by the ending. Also, some of the story line was so confusing, or maybe I was just bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambler Warning degrades Ludlum's name","review":"I bought this thinking it was, at the very least, an unfinished Ludlum novel. Boy was I disappointed! I had no idea 'authors', who are either in witness protection or too ashamed to use their real names, were allowed to peddle books using Ludlum's good name??? Aside from the cliched opening escape and the highly predictable ending, the author of 'The Ambler Warning' seems to want to impress his/her readers by using dozens upon dozens of the most obscure and arcane words he/she can find in his/her thesaurus. Now I have a pretty good vocabulary, but having to put this book down every 10-15 minutes to look up words just made the reading experience annoying. I, for one, will not read/purchase another novel not written by the master himself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good suspense thriller","review":"This book was hard to put down and almost always kept me on the edge of my seat. The author does a very good job of building up the anticipation; having several different story lines going that gradually converge, providing some answers, leaving others unanswered until you get further along in the book. I wouldn't call it \\"great\\" but do call it \\"very good\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"I'm extremely shocked by some of the bad reviews on this site, as I thought \\"The Ambler Warning\\" was a really exciting, well-written, interesting read! While I have only read a few of Ludlum's books in the past, I thought this was on par, if not better than the earlier ones I have read.After narrowly escaping from a secure and secret facility for psychotic and/or mentally ill former intelligence officers, Hal Ambler must figure out who he is, who put him in the facility, who are the people after him, and most importantly, why. The book is extremely fast-paced and full of twists and turns you just don't see coming.I HIGHLY recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Ludlum's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just rolling, but spinning! in his grave","review":"I'm a person who, once I've begun a book, keeps thinking it's going to get better so I tend not to give up...but I skipped most of the last 1/3 of this mess without losing the drift and by the time I put it down wished I'd never picked it up.The author should be ashamed and so should the decision makers for the Ludlum Estate to have perpertrated such a fraud on Mr. Ludlum's fans. The glaring errors in the first fifty or sixty pages are enough to make the whole plot suspect and the author, whomever he/she may be, uses the word 'madness' so many times the reader begins to cringe at it's appearance.The 'surprise' ending is predictable, the character(s) is unsympathetic and there are so many bad guys and agencies involved, I lost track of who/which was who/which.Don't waste your time...find a new (living) author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"Publishing this book was a shameful marketing attempt to cash in on Robert Ludlum's name. This unsatisfying book was very boring and left many loose ends, certainly nowhere near the exceptional writing and high standards of the legendary Ludlum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever - a page-turner","review":"I understand that people feel betrayed, etc. I had no idea who Ludlum was, this was just somehow at the top of the stack of paperbacks that have been waiting around a few years to be read.I started in and was soon fascinated by Hal Ambler's identity crisis. What does it mean to be me? And then all of his adventures skirting so-called \\"security\\", that was very enjoyable. And, my gosh, when do we have a zero-knowledge proof figuring into a story?It was so enjoyable (not deep, just enjoyable) that I took the train two days in order to finish it off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT by Robert Ludlum, and it shows.","review":"I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died. About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile. It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher! Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious. I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore. Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched even for a novel of intrigue","review":"I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring. I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar.Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, \\"There is NO way he'll get out of this\\" or \\"That would never happen.\\" I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a \\"spy\\" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief. However, this one passed those limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to be Ambler...","review":"I thought this book was pretty cool. I wanted to be the main character or at least have his abilities. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to a friend. I might even keep it and read it again someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing, equally poor story","review":"Lets face it, no one can ever compare to the master story teller. Any attempt to imitate Robert Ludlum since his death, has been, in my humble opinion, horrible. The Ambler Warning was fragmented and disjointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--not up to the standard of Ludlum","review":"This book was a big disappointment. The pace was slow and repetitive and the plot was mired in extraneous details. I easily predicted the ending. If you like suspense thrillers, look for someone new. Posthumously published Ludlums aren't the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAUD!","review":"The publisher, St. Martin's Press, oughta be indicted. Secreted inside the book is the info that Ludlum is dead and they've dug up someone called Myn Pyn, who I suspect just graduated from a third-rate writing school. He/she glories in long, boring paragraphs and obscure words that had me scampering to Webster's. May we hope St. Martin's Press will issue a call back and refund our money? Hah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close To Ludlum","review":"What a disgrace to Robert Ludlum. As a faithful reader of all of his works, I am used to starting a Ludlum thriller and hardly putting it down until completed. Against my better judgement, I purchased The Ambler Warning with the hope that the \\"ghost writer\\" could even come close to Ludlum.What a huge disappointment.I could not get through the first fifty pages before I realized that the Warning in the title was, \\"This book is terrible\\"What a shame for readers that have not previously read and enjoyed a true Ludlum book. They will be completely turned off by this pitiful effort that bares his name. Obviously the estate thinks more of the money than his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars","review":"Whoever is writing these novels under the Robert Ludlum name is not doing him justice. Stop while the Ludlum name still means something. I thought this novel to be both dry and convoluted. I struggled through most of it. There's a reason that whoever wrote this didn't put their name to it. Ludlums 'Covert One' novels, written by Patrick Larkin, are far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, but way too long and rambling","review":"If you're looking for a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this isn't it. If you're looking for hours of imaginary political diatribe interspersed with what could have been a good thriller, you've found it.I listened to the audiobook version of this on some scratched CD's and found myself being pleased when the CD's skipped, just so I could get through this long-winded book quicker. This would be a great candidate for a Reader's Digest Condensed book, simply because they could remove all the irrelevant political diatribe about imaginary people in imaginary governments that don't matter to the story anyway, and have a nice short story.Very long, and about 75% of the book is totally irrelevant to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ghost Writer wrote this after the author's death","review":"Most authors do their best work when living. Ludlum's heirs hired a ghost writer to write this work after he died and it shows.Robert Ludlum is a great author, read something he actually wrote.While I highly recommend Ludlum, this book should be at the very bottom of any list of Ludlum novels you want to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambler Warning","review":"Super book with different exciting elements that kept you guessing and wondering about what was going to happen next, then a great ending .............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought at a used bookstore","review":"I bought this book at a used bookstore. It looked good by its cover. I had never heard of the writer before. I really enjoyed the book even though now I realize it was written by someone else. It kept my interest throughout. I would definitely recommend it to others. I didn't give it five stars because a few parts were a little difficult to follow. Overall though, I'm glad I read it----very thought provoking and relevant to our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"Ludlum\\" I've Read","review":"I typically love Ludlum books, but as some of the other reviews indicate this book was written by somebody else(who they don't even care to identify). If you want a good Ludlum, look for one that he actually wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Lite","review":"If you don't know by now, Robert Ludlum is essentially a Trademark. The poor guy has long passed and the books keep churning out by ghost writers. Some are good...and some not so much. This is one of the not so much variety.This story tries unsuccessfully to recreate the basic Bourne concept. A super-duper spy guy assassin with memory loss. He's not sure who the real person inside him is. Past that, it's standard spy fare. Big conspiracy plot, corrupt government officials, and other spy template stuff. I was able to finish it, but could see the big plot twist coming a mile away. It would've been better to go re-read one of the Bourne trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing book. I've like many of Ludlum's books over the years but this one isn't very good. It begins similarly to the Bourne Identity but instead of waking up on a beach without knowing what has happened Hal Ambler wakes up in a psyche hospital. At times the writing is exciting but then it just slows and is downright boring. I stuck with it and had it \\"figured out\\" early on. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambler Warning is disappointing","review":"Because Ludlum is my favorite author, I was disappointed to see a publisher use Ludlum's name without providing the true author's name and produce mediocre work. Bottom line, this book lacked the terrific content that you would find in a typical Ludlum novel. It was so cut-up that the book lacked any continuity to previously described incidents within the book. Furthermore, the true author spent more than half the book describing surroundings and things that had nothing to do with the plot. Out of boredom, I found myself skipping parts and not skipping any of the plot. Its only redeeming factor is the surprising ending, even though it took the author less than three pages to cover it. It doesn't even compare to the last two Ludlum novels written by other identified authors. If I was the publisher, I would be ashamed to use Ludlum's name in this manner. But of course, Ludlum's name sells books. Alas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"Any modern writer who uses \\"My Darling\\" as an endearment should be strung up. I'm a strong proponent in SOD (suspension of disbelief) when it comes to written thrillers and movies, but from the initial Tylenol thing to the ending trigger thing, this piece of work pushed even my limits. It was whiny, highly unlikely, and, in the case of the audiobook reader, passionless, and highly undeserving of the Ludlum name. Skip this one and let Mr. Ludlum rest in peace. Those executing (pun deserved) his estate aren't doing him any favors by condoning the creation of this gargage."},{"rating":"1","title":"ought to be illegal","review":"Selling books under the name of an author who's been dead for several years... that's what ought to be illegal.This author, whoever he/she is, ought to be embarrassed. My two major complaints.... 1) this author decides to use obscure words every couple of pages (likes that thesaurus apparently) when more common words would be fine, and certainly less distracting; and 2) the main character is the typical super-agent who you would think would know better than to think he'd be untraceable if he uses a computer to search the internet for secret answers (you guessed it - the bad guys trace the IP address and show up with guns blazing) - BUT THEN THIS SUPER-AGENT DOES THE SAME THING TWO MORE TIMES! By the third time, you're rooting for the bad guys. This is just plain lazy writing - an author not clever enough to find new ways to get the good guy in a pickle.Save your money and your time - skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at Best!","review":"I am a Ludlum fan - having read his books for years. Until this point, I was happy with the collaborations and/or ghost authors that have continued in the spirit of the \\"Ludlum\\" style. This book, however, was so wordy and pontificating that I was annoyed rather than intrigued by the contents. The dialogue is stilted and uninspiring - in some cases verging on riduculous. The descriptions are endless and often meaningless to the story. It does not apprear that the author ever heard the advice given to novice authors: \\"Don't describe a rifle over the fire place unless it will be used somewhere in the story.\\" I found myself constantly asking myself \\"Wasn't there a seasoned book editor involved?\\" I have read worse books in my life, but if you are looking for a fast paced, entertaining spy thriller, there are better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Ludlum Rest In Peace","review":"A travesty on so many levels. First the ghost author tries to overcomplicate a plot making everything harder than it needs to be. Next he tries to impress us with the size of his dictionary - since no one would ever use so many obtuse words on a regular basis. To top it all off, the audiobook matches the level of ineptness. The reader is passionless, devoid of any ability as a storyteller. He is but a reader - and a bland one at that. I forced myself to stick it out to the end (only because I was painting the house and needed background noise). On occasion, the bookmark was lost and I debated whether is was worth going back to find my place. There is a reason this is headed for the bargain bin. Do yourself a favor - avoid it and go back and reread some of Ludlum's early stuff. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The editor should be shot","review":"I regularly read thrillers, and was looking forward to this one. From the first few pages, it was clear I would be disappointed. How can a man whose hands are tied behind his back \\"cradle his ribs\\"? The Baretta is shining under a bush. Two pages later--the baretta is lost forever. Please. I can't bear to finish this book, a complete affront to an exceptional author. I agree with previous reviewers who suggested enough with the ghost writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ludlum","review":"Classic Ludlum, maybe not a rivetting story as some others but held my attention throughout. Quick read and enjoyable. Reminds me more of his earlier work, which was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad","review":"A rambling, boring plot; major characters that aren't remotely plausible; potentially interesting characters that make a brief appearance only to be killed off; major plot elements that aren't really resolved - all this and more in what must be one of the most poorly written books I've read in the last decade. Don't waste your time on this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters. After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go. This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.Two - The reasonable female. The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here. No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really like this","review":"The themes in this story were SO repetitive - I get it already! And there were so many details, they bogged the story down. I found myself skimming in lots of places, and don't feel like I missed anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Lets start with the essentials then, firstly the material is good stong yet lightweight, the design is of a good quality, not iron on tranfers or any of that rubbish, and the style!!!! THE STYLE!!! the amount of attention you get with this shirt is immense, and its always positive, Well worth buying :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to what it claims","review":"This mask claims to be a miracle mask. It left red blotches on my chin, and no noticeable difference after many applications. The tube is difficult to work as there are 2 separate creams which are supposed to be rubbed together to create your mask, but at the beginning I could only get one of them out of the tube. What a waste of money. You are better off buying a $4 mud mask from a discount store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for congested skin","review":"Other than the difficulty of getting the two creams out of the tube, this mask works great on decongested skin. My skin feels a lot smoother after the mask. Great product but I hope Bliss works something out on the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"No illusions, but still alive","review":"Poland in the 60's.Characters drawned as with no illusions, a boy always drunken not to remember the present and the lack of love and understanding, his sister the only one who has sparkles of faith in the possibilities of humane changes, but at the end breaks down. On the background the system, the lack of morality that becames going over morality and only a try in surviving, no hope in joy. Everything seems to collapse, but at last Poland will remain the same, forever, for only humane beings will fall in dust, the spirit of the country'll remain the same, stifling and atrophying. The country survives because feeds on his inhabithans, on their blood and hopes.Hlasko recreates the disillusion himself lived, and died too early to realize that was right in his prophecy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great....","review":"As a fan of Bendis' 'Powers' line, I wanted to like this graphic novel, but I had to stop halfway because the story wasn't going anywhere. Sure, the characters are interested in a stash of money that some dead junkies spoke about, but there is nothing of high stakes really pushing this story.As another reviewer mentioned, the 'story' consists of individuals talking...and talking. Unfortunately, Bendis is trying to mimic real-world conversations, which doesn't always work well here. (Of note, there is a black character who happens to be a bounty hunter like the title character Jinx; unfortunately, Bendis decides to have this character speak stereotypically 'gangsta' which is particularly grating). Moreover, there is no one I can really root for in the story. Everyone seems to be self-pitying, or back-stabbing.Where he did a good job with 'Torso' and the aforementioned 'Powers,' I think Brian Michael Bendis misses the mark with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"Gives a bad name for noir comics. Dialog is terrible, plotline is a weak rip-off of \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\\" and the art is unimaginative and bland.Even the characters are unlovable, I thought I liked Jinx until I realized she is a whiny, two-dimensional femme-fatal wanna-be.Go pick up \\"The Hard Good-Bye\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing; xeroxography is weird","review":"If you enjoy Brian Michael Bendis's prose then you will like this work. In tone, it is much more similar to Powers and Alias than his more recent Marvel work. The illustrations are often done with xeroxography (xeroxing pictures), which is quite distracting and detracts from the story, but I doubt he could have published the story without it.The primary characters, Jinx and Goldfish, are both interesting and textured. Jinx is a bounty hunter who has been beaten down by life, and is a precursor to Jessica Jones. Jinx is a small time con man in Cleveland who makes bad people choices. The over story and under story meet in nice confluence that enriches the reader's experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"La Voz de los 80 is one of the greatest chilean album ever made.Los Prisioneros was a chilean musician group who worked with more soul than technology during the 80's.

It is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried me out","review":"I was hoping this soap would work for my dry, itchy skin due to the 1/4 moisturizers, but it pretty much dried my skin out like any regular bar of soap. For the claims & the price, my experience = a rip off. I really wanted to like this soap . . . sadly I don't because it strips my skin of the little moisture it already has. Not too fond of the smell either. The lather is good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reduces facial redness","review":"I just started using this soap after reading online that it is recommended by dermatologists for rosacea sufferers. I bought a two-pack from the store and used it last night ad this morning. I can already see a substantial difference in the way my face appears.

The one thing I don't like is that can cause flaky dryness, so use a mild moisturizer afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best out there!","review":"Got a 2 pack for the price of one on these.

I've used Jack 3d for almost a year now for atleaste 5 times a week. Never had any side effects and always feel very energetic when it starts kicking in. On top of that, they have a taste that everyone can handle.However, I cannot say the same for this Universal product. The taste is just awful, it taste just like the powders in pills.. VERY bitter. Also, I've tried 3,2, and 1 scoops, I felt no energy and it leaves me nauseated. I had a very hard time working out with it because me really makes me to NOT want to workout at all.Its just a bad product. Sure you get more for your money, but whats the point when this product doesn't even work and sets you back? Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"A dreamy affair, this book traverses the boundary between reality and the hyper-real with breathtaking skill. The storylines are often unimportant, taking a back seat to the prose, which flows and twists with great dexterity and poetry. This is a strongly visual book that would certainly appeal to readers of all ages. It would be of particular interest to those with a predilection towards fantasy. There is a strong thematic of family bonds throughout, and though no time period is mentioned, the nature of the writing and storytelling (strong family themes, the near absence of any technology) gives me the impression that most of the stories are set in the distant past, which only adds to the otherworldly qualities. I like the title as well because blackness is a strong image created throughout, almost like the book is an anthology of stories from the dark ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince Charming is much, much better","review":"I read Prince Charming by Wendy Leigh and it is a fabulous beautiful book, a marvellous memorial to John. really worth getting. so don't waste your time with this book.

However, upon trying to put them on the wall as they show in the picture of the product where the butterflies are angled, that's where things didn't go so well. The butterflies have a metal loop type hook on the back which doesn't really allow for adjusting the angle of the pieces and they will hang more straight up and down than at an angle. We were able to get it to angle a little bit by just pushing it to the side a little and let friction keep it in place on the wall. However, they tend to naturally want to point straight up and down. You could put something on the back of the butterflies to stick them in place if necessary, but that's a workaround to the problem.

Some wedding books from the 90s still have relevant things to carry into the present but this book does not. Many lacy/silk flowery/embroidery/cross stitch kind of projects. I only checked it out from the library because I saw that it had a tiara in the table of contents and even that looks super old-fashioned.

If you enjoy modern/timeless fashions pass this over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gateway Drug","review":"This is the band that got me into hardcore/metalcore. From the moment I heard 12/23/93 I was hooked and addicted to this band and this album in general. The fast in-your-face drum solo in the beggining to the melodic singing during the heavy parts. This is hardcore gold. Fav tracks are Track 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. You should also check out the first E.P. and the third LP \\"You Come Before You\\"...it's better than what most critics say when you compare it to \\"Tear From The Red\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poison the Well = Best in the Business","review":"This band is by far the best band of all time... they having crushingly heavy parts, offset with gorgeous melodic interludes. If I could make love to this CD, I would. It is by far my favorite disc in my collection. If you like emo, metal, punk or hardcore, you would be a FOOL to pass up an opportunity to listen to this wonderful piece of music. 10/5 stars, easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"The record that started a new directon in metalcore","review":"Poison The Well came into hardcore/metalcore scene and changed it all. The music is at times beautiful and then chugging, but their lyrics are sincere. The Opposite Of December is a fairly good cd, but it's not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"a season of separation: Opposite Of December","review":"This is a great hardcore cd from poison the well, its also beauty in lyrics. The songs are heavy, but slow down for those song moments that become favorites of most. the first 3 songs are not so good, mostly just music with no melody, just sound.\\"Slice Paper wrists\\" is a song that takes up the cd with its screaming lyrics and guitar riffs. \\"Nerdy\\" is a hardcore love song that makes lovers cry its so beautifull. The following songs are pretty good, and \\"My Mirror No Longer Reflects\\" ends it all perfectly with the best calm melodic outro that will stay in your head for hours after listening to it. I recomend this cd to hardcore fans,open-minded musicians, and people who felt or feel love in their hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive hardcore/metal","review":"Anyone with a love for emotional filled music but a hatred for whiny junk (in other words 85% of emo) will love Poison The Well. This album is a step down from their new one Tear From The Red only because they went in more directions with that one and I just like the overall feel of that one better but this one follows very closely behind and doesn't really lack anything. The only problem with this one is that it's way too short. Anyone who makes music this good should make it for longer than 30 minutes even though all 30 minutes are worth the money you pay for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"After hearing this album, poison the well turned into my favorite band. The cd is full with awesome breakdowns but also very nice melodic parts, and even a couple of punk beats, and I hear they put on an awesome show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but monotonous","review":"This cd has some great moments in it, but the relentless sameness of it can be a bit numbing. I'm sure that a lot of people love albums that are nothing but loud, indecipherable screaming, but I'm not one of those people. If you actually like some semblance of a discernable melody with your music, then look somewhere else. Also, all of the songs are extremely short. The average length of any of the songs is about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The longest track is less than four minutes. So you're really not even getting a half an hour of music. Only buy this cd if you're just really into this kind of stuff. This is definitely a \\"special interest\\" band."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal in every way","review":"This was a major disappointment. I have been a hardcore fan for years and this is NOT hardcore. The lyrics are whining and the vocals are terrible. The music is quite soft for a supposed hardcore album and the vocals are screaming and high pitched. The album just isn't special at all. I've heard these songs a hundred times by many different artists. The first three tracks are ALMOST listenable. Overall I would say it isn't worth paying money for."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I bought this cd on the reccomendation of a friend and all I can say is that this is the most worthless piece of junk that I own.

But do stay away from the well because it is infested with the worst sounding poison there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre metal/hardcore","review":"I was thoroughly dissapointed when I first listened to this album. Despite some desperate attempts, poisin the well fails to come anywhere close to being, or even sounding emo.

I consider this album a mediocre metal album at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible just like the rest...","review":"Well every one has said that this is ptw's best cd and if it is i sure dont want to hear their worse! Too bad i already have and their latest work \\"you come before you\\" is prolly the worse music i've heard in a while... If you think this is a goodmetalcore album think again because its far from it. PTW has no good songs and their vocalist is terrible prolly the worse vocals ever! There's no metal or harcore here simply a bunch of no talent wiggers trying to sound like a metalcore band! Skip this and buy any shai hulud album or unearth or killswitch engage or even between the buried & me now thats real metalcore right there! Ptw is nothing but a pop emo band and that's all they ever going to be...So dont waste of money on garbage like this okay ? Laters!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing short of amazing","review":"Well, this cd just doesn't get any better. Half of this record is the normal metal core your used to by now, yet still excellent, it's got the fast pounding drums, the heavy riffs, and the crazy low vocals. But this cd has something different, along with all the chaos going on, it's got some of the most beautiful melodies ever made. the music goes from the crazy fast heavy chaos to slow breakdowns of pure emotion. This singer is one of the best ive ever heard. there is no need to talk about the best tracks, considering the fact the every track is just brilliant. Definately worth every cent of your money. This is definately in my list of the best hardcore records ever made, next to shai hulud and glassjaw among others. Check this band out, and check out their first cd too. This stuff is nothing short of amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the 3 best hardcore CDs out there","review":"This CD is good enough that I bought a new copy of it after I lost my original. Many hardcore bands have 1 or 2 songs that are awesome - filled with a great breakdown and keeping the song interesting and powerful. PTW manages to do this with every single track on this album. The closest thing to it is One King Down's \\"Bloodlust Revenge\\" but this album kicks it up several notches. Other hardcore bands should look to these guys as a model of songwriting, musicianship, drumming and vocals. If you are breathing, this album will get you moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"plagiarism","review":"This is a horrible little book that borrows material liberally from Cooperative Extension bulletins from Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

These boys, Nick cannon, Bow wow and all the other little boys did not know what went on in the 70's and neither did the director.

He get tanned so bad that he'll end up white (just joking).If you didn't see it already, don't see it.

Roll Bounce was underrated and under publicized. Teenage friends pursue their love of skating and transition from the 'southside' to an upscale skatium and challenge the reigning skating heart throb, Sweetness. The underlying storyline is that of a Father struggling to raise his teenage son and young daughter after the unexpected death of their Mother. Father and son are often at odds as they cope with their grief. The ending is uplifting!

While not on par with Skipped Parts or Sorrow Floats, this book is still more entertaining and worthwhile than most.

Both are charmingly dysfunctional and find themselves in situations that provide for melodrama and warped comedy. Once again, the main strengths lie in Sandlin's distinct voice and offbeat humor. The casual way his characters talk about everything from violence to insanity to statutory rape might be off-putting to some readers, but to me at least, it all seems pretty harmless and awfully funny in Sandlin's capable hands.On the whole, this isn't quite on par with Sandlin's best work, its far from his weakest.

Joe Matt can't see past the warts, and has come to the erroneous conclusion that simply recording his problems and fears equals *A*R*T*. It ain't that easy!Pekar, although he writes about himself, also pays attention to the people around him. They're forever saying things that you find yourself remembering.

Frankly, to get the sock on with this thing, you need to be able to get the device onto your foot--if you can do this, you'd not need the device at all. The same limitations that keep you from putting on a sock will frustrate you with this device. You will break a sweat trying to get your toes in far enough as you wiggle your foot and the device. It is not the answer. In fact, it is the wrong item to buy for someone struggling to get dreessed. Then should you get your foot in it, you have to muscle it up your foot. The sock will not gently glide up onto your shoe. I would think this a great Aprils Fools Day toy at best, but at worst it is not something even worth trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sock aid","review":"This product can work fine if one adds lotion to the surface that touches the heel of the foot when putting on the sock/stocking.

Useless!!!!!!","review":"Unless your foot and leg are equal to or less than the diameter of the compession stocking (which would defeat the purpose of compression stockings and provide no compression) do not purchase this item. The stocking is stronger than the stocking aid and shrinks the opening to the smallest diameter of the stocking opening, making it impossible to slip your foot into the opening, let alone insert your lower leg. If you can insert your foot, pulling the stocking aid results in the removal of the aid without pulling up the stocking. Exhausting work and not returnable. The label says: Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged. What a racket!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sock Aid a real help","review":"We bought it for our 97 year old father who was having trouble getting his socks on because of problems with reaching his feet. It worked well for him. The terry cloth on the outside holds the sock until he pulls it up and his toe hits the end of the sock. Then he can pull the aid out of the sock. He did have to experiment with how far onto the aid to put the sock so that the aid doesn't slip out before the sock is on. If you put the aid too far into the sock, it can be too difficult to get it out of the sock. Used properly it's a handy thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for us.","review":"I bought this item for my husband. He has a difficult time putting on his socks. It did NOT work for him.

He directly addresses the pitfalls of living in Western civilization and trying to be spiritual and compassionate. His approach, as always is direct and simplistic. There are enough lessons in this tape to keep you busy for another millenium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Timely Book","review":"These days when we've got Christian fundamentalists trying to convert us to their way of thinking or taking control via the election system, it is so incredibly refreshing to read the Dalai Lama's words of compassion and love and tolerance for others. He does not wish to convert. That is not his agenda. He is considered the 14th incarnation of the BUDDHA OF COMPASSION and that tells one a whole lot right there. His agenda, if he has one, is to help his persecuted people in Tibet and maybe help the rest of us find a way to lead better lives despite all of our surface differences. Just imagine what the evening news would be like if we all adopted those principles and really tried to live each day by them, regardless of our religious or non-religious affiliations?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting book on ethics and values","review":"The Dalai Lama is an inspiration for westerners in search of meaning in their lives and a spiritual path.

It is a good book with some interesting insights; the Dalai Lama has a wonderful mind, and all of us can learn something from him.

Although I gained some insight in a number of areas, I didn't find the agruments compelling enough to reach someone who isn't already familiar with the ethics. As a book which is supposedly aimed towards people who aren't already familiar with applying some of the concepts in their life, I found the treatise too difficult to follow. There were not enough practical suggestions, implementations or meditation suggestions to help someone really find what to do.As a philosophical treatise explaining the logic of ethical and compassionate behavior, I found it was too drawn out and read like intellectual acrobatics. I am an admirer of HHDL, and I have read some of his other books, but found this one did not really hit the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book that touches your spirit","review":"This is truly a beautiful book. Speaking as a healer and an author, I am the world's first Post-Op Transsexual Two-Spirit Shaman and Chi Gung Master and I found that this book has truly helped me. The healing art that I practice is called The Way of Beauty and with it I have helped cases of everything from migraines and insomnia to infertility, strokes, and ovarian cancer but the art that the Dalai Lama practices could be called the way of happiness and it works on our spirits and our hearts. He is an incredible man with a beautiful perspective on life.Read this book, it can change your life as it gently shows you ways to improve. The neat thing is, by improving yourself, you can then help others and that's when you can make a difference in the world.-Lily of the Valley Carnie, author of Chi Gung: Chinese Healing, Energy, and Natural Magick"},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer the Dalai Lama in person.","review":"I have always followed the Dalai Lama - movies, tapes, live appearances etc. I have always enjoyed his teachings, so I thought I'd try a book. However, I found this book to be too intellectual. I felt it was work to read it.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know people aren't going to like my review","review":"I read half the book and kept falling asleep as I was reading. The book struck me as naive, tending toward Pollyanna. Excuse me, all you admirers of this book, but this is honestly how I felt about it. I find life to be so much more complex than his thesis seems to propose - not that there isn't some truth to what he says. I like what Alfred North Whitehead said, \\"Morality.... is what the majority then and there happen to like and immorality is what they dislike\\". The Dalai Lama seems to say it is absolute, but I see it as relative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen and the Art of Intellectualization","review":"This book was a major disappointment and source of frustration.Perhaps in the East people are capable of \\"...think,think,think[ing]...\\" their way to compassion and harmony.In the West we need something more experiential and practical to bridge the split in body-mind that lies at the heart of our individual and collective psychopathology. There is nothing in this book that hasn't been available to us for many years through western spiritual tradition and it fails for the same reason those traditions do.The heart of compassion is not a philosophical concept,it is a felt experience.It can only become a way of being in beings who have achieved a degree of balance and integration in body/mind/spirit.

These things need to be said, although they can't be contained in a pop-culture sound bite. He builds his case carefully, logically, and with practical suggestions. You just have to look around to see the validity of his message. Bless him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to Live By","review":"In Ethics for the New Millennium, the Dalai Lama introduces a new way to consider ethics, very different from the views of Kant, Mill, and Socrates. It is a passionate explanation that says we do not need to consider a deity or religion to understand that it is compassion that should drive our ethical behavior. A compassion for other sentient beings who seek to maximize happiness and minimize suffering: a core Buddhist teaching. After setting this foundation, the Dalai Lama then expands upon the idea, giving us examples of how we can implement these strategies into our lives as individuals and then what changes would help ease this process in society. The overhaul will not be quick and easy, but when it is applied to your life, it has the potential - he guarantees it will - to increase your happiness; not with material happiness that lasts only temporarily, but spiritual happiness that will last for the rest of your lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows a great deal of study and thought on human nature.","review":"Reading this book is like sitting with a friend who shares the benefits of a great deal of his insight. It is a little lengthy, and could be easier to read, but its contents overshadow any drawbacks.It is obvious that the Dalai Lama has spent a long time studying human nature and philosophy, and this book gives everyone the opportunity to share in that knowledge. I particularly enjoyed the discussion on happiness; that some activities bring pleasure only because they are transitory. And the example that the pleasure one derives from the finest meal lasts only until the next time they are hungry.An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a better world this could be...","review":"I recently watched the movie \\"7 days in Tibet\\" which inspired me to buy and read this book. EXCELLENT! His Holiness delves deep into the root problem we as human beings faced today. The book is centered around our loss for the human spirit which entails basic caring and concern or lack of it for the people who surround our lives. His approach is very practical and he is openly honest about things that he himself should do but fail to do as any normal human. I highly recommend this as a guide to regaining our senses around us as human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not very helpful","review":"I threw this book away in annoyance after reading it.

What a great show - probably the last great spy show we'll ever see on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth the wait","review":"This is without a doubt THE BEST collection of a beloved tv sitcom ever. Even though it is unavailable in retails stores till later this year, you can order it through the Time Life website where they are selling it exclusivley. There are bonus features that show in-depth interviews with Barbara Feldon (Agent 99) and Bernie Kopell (Ziegfried) as well as numerous other flash-back spots. Don Adams was (is) a truly gifted comedic actor and it's unfortunate that he did not live to see the upcoming remake of Get Smart Movie (being produced by Warner Bros. with Steve Carrell as Max and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99). Some of my favorite episodes are the wedding of him and 99. Seeing characters such as Hymie the Robot and The Admiral made me chuckle. Watching each episode takes you back to a time when our world was a little more innocent (perhaps naive) but it'll leave you with a smile on your face regardless. A definite MUST HAVE!

Fields. I did not expect a crystal clear video image, as these items are about 70 yrs old, although overall the quality is not that bad. Similarly, the audio track, while a bit \\"crackly\\" at times, was quite acceptable. What did make me threaten the life span of the TV, player and disc however, was the lack of sinc between the video and audio tracks. It is rather off putting to find a second or so difference between what you see \\"being said\\", and what you actually hear. You feel you are watching a poorly dubbed foreign film. The comedy is still very appealing, but this attention to fine detail on the part of the makers of the set leaves a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"WC Fields Deserves Better.","review":"Two DVD package showing six of the great man's two reelers. It is unfortunate that the MADACY ENTERTAINMENT GROUP responsible for the release of this DVD package do not seem to care about QUALITY, something which also applies to their other releases. The picture seems on par with pirated VHS, smudged, and grey, copied without the aid of a timebase corrector (verticals sway from side to side). Audio recorded through AGC circuits, only found on non-broadcast equipment, thus the level pushed up when no speech is present, then lowered with a bang when it does arrive.

This, however, is probably the worst I've seen. The company has spat upon the great comedian's grave. Several public domain shorts have been slapped on this DVD with terrible picture and sound that is downright disgraceful. In fact, this is the worst sound I've even heard on a DVD. There are also the traditionally stinky Madacy extras (Biography, Trivia, Quotes, Filmography).Don't be fooled by the label at the back of the box (\\"a must for collectors and fans of this comedy genius\\").

I usually can tolerate some silliness in pulp horror, but this book was awful. Moore makes Bentley Little look like James Joyce. A series of drawn out fight scenes makes up the plot.

And then he wins the lottery and that's never mentioned again - why? And those aliens/monsters that Mr. Moore seemed to have created from a bad Lovecraft story - the descriptions were horrible and I could never picture any of them. And where exactly did they come from? And why were they after the Western Key? And why did Chris's mom have the key in the first place? Nothing was explained.

I think that reading it to a class could lead to some very enlightening conversation, and it would also make a great additional read for any high school psychology class.The lovely illustations and the rhyming text make this an easy book to read even though it deals with such a heavy topic.Every parent, social worker and educator should have a copy of this book to refer to so that they will never be tempted to put any child into a big box."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any Specail Ed.

The books main theme of being \\"locked\\" up and having basic freedoms taken away, is what many special education students often feel. I work with emotionally disturbed students and the impact made by the children in the book made me feel a bit of what my students often do. Though the book is for a higher age level, the book can be read to and explained to a much younger group of children. It is always a healthy experience to talk about any idea or feeling, and this is a perfect example! The feeling of having your freedoms taken away because you are not like everyone else and do not conform to anyone's image! Thank you Toni and Slade Morrison for this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Discussion book","review":"I read this book aloud to my fifth graders.

I have over three hundred DVD's to date in my collection and I have never seen a transfer this bad. It appears to have been copied from a third generation VHS tape originally recorded at SLP speed. The scratches, dropouts' lack of contrast and poor sound quality makes this DVD a waste of money. The color in Jack in the Beanstalk continually shifts and bleeds through each scene and the black and white sequences also shift from B&W to blue at scene changes.

There is a scene where Ajax's shield is jabbed by Hektor and his spear goes through 7 layers ofthe shield.The god Zeus controls the fate of all of those involved with the Trojan war.

Lattimore is brutally literal, sacrificing smooth, flowing syntax for an attempt to duplicate every word of Greek in English. Certainly, if you are interested in the problems of Greek translation, this is an advantage, and you do probably acquire a more thorough understanding of Homeric society and culture with this method, but I still prefer the only other translator I have read, Samuel Butler, who, despite his dubious 1900-era language, does manage to infuse some vitality into the text.

The text is microscopically small--the spaces between lines are so tiny that it's enormously difficult to read the cypher that Indiana University Press has printed this book in. The line breaks are numbered in groups of 5, which makes finding which line you're on very hard: splitting into groups of 4 (like almost every other play, or poem ever written is) would have made this work that much easier to enjoy.Get Lattimore, but don't get this terrible edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"As far as the story is concerned, this is as rich as they come. The conflict between Agmemnon and Achilles, the power of Hektor, the war sequences, the heroics and villiany, and the comradery all add up to be one of the most important works in our history.As far as the translation goes, Lattimore stays very true to the original Greek and to the cadence of poetry.As far as readability is concerned, it is not the easiest traanslation to read. Having compared it with 4 or 5 other translations and with the actual Greek, if you want accuracy read this version, if you want readability read Fagles.A great book, and a serious translation. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive and strangely relaxing","review":"I had to read The Iliad for a class, and I honestly dreaded it. I was worried that it would be boring and impossible to read. The Lattimore translation was neither. It managed to be easy to read with enough notes to cover important things that you needed to know. It still probably isn't a book I would just pick up off the shelf and read again, but if you have to read the book, get this translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"I don't read Greek. And this is not a review of The Illiad. This is a review of the Lattimore translation. Of the three translations I have, for my money Lattimore is the most muscular, affecting, and powerful. Fagles is a close second. Fitzgerald, whose poetic inclinations led to some beautiful language, is in third place. Lattimore is also reputedly the translator who strove to stay the closest to the original's structure, rhythm, and diction. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of the above translations and I often like to have at least two open side by side, but I wanted to endorse Lattimore's as my favorite, for the Odyssey as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Behold the sheer force of Homer! Wheeee!","review":"All the reviews here seem to be about this book's translation. Bah, I say! Don't take it so seriously. In the first month of 1995, my college friends could hear me saying, \\"I hate the Iliad!\\" But when I got further into the text, I read the last 14 books (of 24) straight through in one night. Outstanding! Perhaps the translation does indeed lend the words a certain energy, but the true wonder of Homer's masterpiece lies in its characters and stories. Thrill to the adventures of Hector and his alternately tragic and heroic life! This book is an otherworldly triumph and should be enjoyed by everyone. Drop the snobby academic talk and recognize \\"The Iliad\\" for its universal dopeness. Yeah, I said it, this book is the raw, uncut dope!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Font Size","review":"I am not giving Homer a single star. His work is one of the greatest pieces of literature in history. However, be very cautious of this edition. The font size is very small and makes for difficult reading. I would strongly urge you to choose another edition with larger font size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally abridged! Only 3 of the \\"chapters\\" present!","review":"Anyone who's ever read Lattimore's translations of Homer knows what a marvelous poet of a translator Lattimore is. If you didn't like Homer when you were forced to read him in high school, you'll love Lattimore's translation. That's why I was so looking forward to having this classic on audio cassette to listen to as I walk -- but unfortunately, ONLY THREE OF THE CHAPTERS are narrated -- 13, 15, and 16, if my memory serves me. SURE, they're some of the meatiest stuff in The Iliad, but it's sort of a rip-off to sell only 3 chapters. What were the editors thinking? I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Upside-down pages","review":"In the copy I received, pages 59-90 were upside down and reversed. These pages included sections of the introduction, the translator's note, maps, and most of Book One. This misbinding was a careless oversight; I will be returning the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richmond Lattimore...Genius!!!!!","review":"Richmond Lattimore was an absolute genius. I recommend this book to very advanced classics students, but especially to those who have taken many years of Latin and Greek courses. The translation is most certainly not intended for anyone prosaic. It is more literally and accurately translated than any other translation in existence. For the lover of poetry, this translation is a must! Bravo Lattimore!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythology Rules","review":"The Iliad by Homer is a book that i think everyone can enjoy it comes in a lot of different reading levels and is relativly easy to understand. I thought the book was well written and the plot kept me reading for more. i recommend this book to anyone who likes the old school style of art of war and sword vs shield style genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward translation","review":"The major problem I have with this translation is the awkwardness of its language. There are long, unwieldy sentences with twisted syntax. Sometimes, the translation is obscure. For example: \\"...and the will of Zeus was accomplished/since that time when first there stood in divison of conflict...\\" Not every line is as bad as that, however. There are some passages that read fairly smoothly, and the last two lines of the fourth book stand out. The translation as a whole, however, mutilates the English language. There are better options if you would like to read the Iliad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"The Odyssey was a much better book. Skip this one if you can, you get a good summary of it in the Odyssey, it'll save you some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy by Roald Dahl","review":"Boy, by Roald Dahl, takes place in Norway, England, and Wales. His family lives in Wales and vacations in, his parents' former home, Norway. When Dahl was a kid, he was schooled in England. An important person is his beloved mother who raised him, and his sibling, single-handedly. Dahl's siblings were also important to him. Important childhood events are: when he dropped a dead mouse into a sweet shop jar owned by an evil woman; getting bullied by Boazers, which are like school prefect if you didn't know what a Boazer is; getting his adenoids removed; getting a job in Africa as a young man; and almost having his nose cut off in a car accident.Our opoinion is Boy by Roald Dahl is boring, if you're like us, who like fiction books; it's an autobiography. It was also very boring because, he gave small details, and not all of our questions were answered. But, if you like non-fiction books, you'll probably like Boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I thought this Biography very interesting but I have to say I will NEVER read it again, The horrible beatings he had to endure as a nine year old boy left me sickened and depressed,I made myself finish it, so I could write this review. The cruelty displayed by the Matron and Headmaster was terrible, especially since these boys were away from home with no one to talk to.If you enjoy reading about such things than this is the book for you.What is truly amazing is Dahl's humor in writing these memories, I guess he had to go through this so he could write his books,,,,,sad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy","review":"We didn't like the book very much. Because: It was not so intersting to here about Roald Dahls lifestory. We guess that he had a exciting life, but as you know it's more fun to experience the episode by yourself, than to read about Roalds stories. Some of the episodes was fun, like when a drunken doctor amputeded his fathers arm. And the carcras was also fun. But sometimes the book became \\"to funny\\", and you most of all wanted to cry..... That's the reason that we only give the book to stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"The reviewers who said that Boy is not as good as some of Dahl's other books are right. But that doesn't mean that it isn't excellent. There are some bits that are a little bit boring, but other bits make up for them. There is more gruesomeness in Boy than in any of Dahls other books! In fact sometimes I felt phyisically sick reading this book. There is a bit where he has his tonsils removed that is really rough. And the part where he gets the cane is almost unbelievable. Surely they wouldn't have been allowed to make your 'buttocks' bleed? This book rather makes you think about how lucky we are today."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very vivid memory!","review":"His childhood has begun with his father's death and has finished with graduation. Such a long story can be so boring but it's not the case of this book. It has full of vivid memory of one of the best storytellers. You can't stop reading once you pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Review","review":"Dear Reader,Boy Tales From Childhood is hilarious! It's so neat to learn about someone's childhood. Roald Dahl definately had an interesting life as a child. Your bookshelf is not complete without it! So go get it!

Also Roald dahl Pretended that he was ill to go home Because he did not like the matron.I recommened it because it has mixed emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy","review":"The book Boy is about Roald Dahl's life. I thought it was a good book because I didn't know anything about Dahl's life and I never knew he got in so much trouble. I also assumed that he had been writing all his life but he actually was a photographer before he even started writing. His life was also very tough, when he was little he went to a school where he was hit with a cane and all the people were mean. His mom was very adventurous and witty. Overall his life was very fun and it was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the BFG","review":"I think that this is R.D worst book. It is less interesting than the other ones.

I've read enough to realize these shouldn't be children's books. They have a lot of abuse. My daughter has had nightmares. Roald Dahl definately has a dark side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy....By Roald Dahl","review":"Book cover was very grimy.

Personly i didnt like the book because there was hardly and action or real exciting parts. So I didnt like it because i like alot of action. I think this is he worst book he has writen so far. Just because its only about his childhood and growing up going to school witch doesnt intrest me much some parts like were he Savtadged his sisters boyfriends pipe. His whole family thought it was funny exept his sister and her boyfriend. So all in all i gave the book 1 star because there was no action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is recommended for anyone who is looking for something funny, sad, adventurous and just fun.Wonderfully written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"''Some are funny. Some are painful. Some are unpleaseant. Perhaps this is why I have remembered them so vividly. All are true.''","review":"So says Roald Dahl in the introduction to his autobiogrophy, BOY. The book is a collection of his childhood memories, from the magical summers in Norway to the dreary days at St. Peters boarding school. As in all of Dahl's works the characters are quirky and memorable,but more fascinating here because they really existed. The auther recounts the adventures of his childhood in vivid detail and with tenderness and dry humor.BOY, TALES OF CHILDHOOD is a terrific book, much more interesting than the average autobiography!RATING:A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, little Boy","review":"The book is a easyreader. It describes the childhood of Roald Dahl himself. But notice this - it is not a biography. It is just funny tales of real things that happened to him. Roald Dahl has Norwegian parents, but grew up in Wales, and went to boarding school in England. He tells about pranks, holidays, teachers, his family, and more. We had good laughts when Roald Dahl found a dead rat, and when the matrone stops a boy from snoring. It is easy for us to picture what life was like those days. We enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendiferous!","review":"Roald Dahl, the most scrumptious story-teller of all time does it again with this compilation of tales about his own childhood. From planting dead rats in jars of jaw breakers to being a Cadbury's chocolate tester, Dahl's life is colorfully recreated. It hides nothing from the reader, not pain or joy. It was enchanting (and fun) to read! Perfect for both adults and kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just couldn't put it down!","review":"A beautifully written story on the life of Roald Dahl. Stupendous photographs and pictures. It seems as if you were right there with him. I thought the part on Llandaff Cathedral School was the best part. It makes me think he had a great life. Although it seemed like it should have a sequel, I'd still think this book was the best of the two. I think Roald Dahl's writings are amazing, but after I read this story, I thought his life was interesting too. I've been inspired by this book to write stories too. It amazes me that anyone could write stories this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Book","review":"Boy by Roald Dahl is an amazing book. It is one of the most hilarious books I have ever read. Some of the things that happened to him seemed pretty painful like getting his nose cut almost completely off. My favorite part of the book is when Roald Dahl and his friends put a dead mouse in the gobstopper jar in a candy store so that when the shopkeeper put her dirty fingers in the jar she would grab the mouse and not the gobstoppers.Also reading this book I found out that Roald Dahl based some of his books on his childhood like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He wrote it about how he and his friends loved candy so much, but they had barely any money to buy it. It would have been awesome to have candy for a penny or two pennies and it sounded like they had some good candy.Well, anyway I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it for readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roald Dahl's life","review":"My twin eight year old sons are just loving all the Roald Dahl books.

Cabot has also included an array of secondary characters who round out the story leaving the reader wanting to know more about them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING...","review":"I have read all of Cabot's works and I was anxiously anticipating this book after I read her last book -An Improper Proposal. Sadly to say that I was highly disappointed with the book. I did not like the characters - Burke and Kate. There did not seem to be much chemistry with the two characters. Developing a romantic relationship was also a bit difficult with Burke's daughter - Isabelle in the story. Cabot's other books had characters with more spunk and heart. The story line was boring. I say take a pass on book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!","review":"My friend got me hooked on Cabot with her last book which I enjoyed very much. This book was not her typical style. I really did not like either character much. He had way too much baggage - anger with ex wife for her betrayal so the rest of the women will take up where she left off, a daughter who is a handful, and a missing heart. I liked her other books when she concentrated more on developing the characters and showing their vulnerability without the trite baggage. Usually her characters have spunk -- something I did not see any of this in the book. All in all, I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money...","review":"I suggest that you save your money and pass on this book.

Indeed, I found it to be an eclectic mix of styles and themes lacking a core identity. The tracks are melodically rudimentary and rhythmically flat. Weak attempts to borrow techniques from trip hop. The only oasis in an otherwise desert-like sonic landscape is track 7. Too much negativity to bring? Sorry, because overall, Baduizm lackluster musical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Debut!","review":"Released in 1997 Baduizm became a big hit all over the world. 1997 was a year of both good and bad albums and this album is among the good ones. jazzy, soultry and R&B ish . Baduizm becomes one of my personal favourites of the 1990's. Just an album that everyone should have and suits for everyone. Badu vocal ranges and creativity and her style is represented here in her beautiful and powerful debut album. the music just puts smile of people. Every fan of music should own this album. It is brilliantly made and made to peace and smooth our soul. great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tape is wonderful, if you are into the things she says.","review":"Erykah, you are my girl!

The songs are original and thought provoking. But it could contain more material. For example there are two Rimshot songs, an intro and an outro, which are relatively similair. There are two versions of Certainly, a regular one and a mix. Then there is Sometimes(Mix #9) and Afro which are more like interludes then songs. This is a really good CD and Erykah Badu is one of my favorite artists but there could be more material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched","review":"I got my fiancé a record player for Christmas.

Fortunately, I purchased this LP on sale here for a little over six bucks so it's worth keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl's got it going on!!","review":"What can't you say \\"good' about Erykah Badu. She has a very unique style and her voice takes a melody and just plays with it. The arrangements are not only soulful, but they have a new'sound' and she sings so smoothly in an original style which she shows off beautifully. Some tunes have a jazzy, funky beat,but the blend takes you to a wonderful union of R&B, Jazz,& Soul. Everyone that hears it comments\\"who's that?\\" or\\" I've got that CD and I love it.\\"I was amazed, that in my circle of many different friends with a multitude of different tastes and styles, all had purchased this CD and loved it! You Go Girl!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Major star potential","review":"Erykah Badu has drawn comparisons ranging from Billie Holiday to Sade, but her threads and worldview seem similar to that of early Queen Latifah. And while many artists try to strike the balance between honoring the past and pursuing the cutting edge, few have done it with the poise and class Badu shows on her debut album, Baduizm. Hip-hop beats and modern lyrics blend with an old-school groove as Badu shows consistent artistic direction unusual for a debut artist. Like Holiday, Badu doen't possess a big voice but has a keen understanding of how to use melisma and phrasing to maximum effect. The second half of the album blends together somewhat blandly, but Badu has the makings of an artist who will sustain a lasting career, which is rare in the hip-hop/R&B world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baduizm","review":"nothing to write home about.

The music just seems undeveloped and tired. The vocals are lackluster, and the lyrics are sub par. Even the song Tim Amrstrong guest stars on is short and weak. His lines are short and he hardly adds to the song. Just go to youtube and watch the video for \\"I hate emo\\" and you'll not want to buy this album. Not because hating emo is lame, but because it's just a poor undeveloped song by amatuers.

Also, I am a student of \\"classical latin\\" whereas there are no \\"W\\" and no \\"J\\" letters in the alphabet. In medieval latin, those letters were included. Modern Latin also has the letters. On the product information it said nothing about classic vs. medieval vs. modern styles of latin so receiving this book in medieval is quite disheartening.

It does have pictures in it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a wonderful book, appealing to all audiences.","review":"_Winnie Ille Pu_ has been an amazing help for me, as I am beginning to learn Latin.

Camus describes such a man as our true friend, one who sleeps on the cold ground while we are in prison, hoping for our release through his effort.Through fear, and fear only, many prefer the savage, vengeful God of the Book of Revelation to the courageous man of Mark's Gospel, described here so well for us by Kazantzakis.

I believe he was fully human while on earth, but it seemed Kazantzakis went too far in giving his character traits that bordered on irritating.

It stands in stark contrast to \\"The Master and Margarita\\", another book which tells of Jesus' life - but interestingly and compellingly. The part that annoys me most about the book is the complete lack of historic research. The story occurs in Israel, about 2000 years ago. How come the people are eating grilled corn and tomatoes? These were brought from the Americas 1500 years later! And seeing gunpowder mentioned shocks me too.

If one reads it to the end you will understand what I mean.Are there are few uncomfortable moments? Yes! But that is the point of the book. The title of the book explains everything and is ITSELF explained on the last page.If you are a Christian don't be afraid of this book or what others might say about the film.

For this CD, the harmony is nearly perfect, but the music can be more deep. When I retrospect those great cds recorded by king singer's, for example, the english madrigals and beatles connection, I feel a bit unsatisfied with this one. It sounds sweet, with some excellent new songs (Lalela Zulu, Poor Roger, etc) and good percussion by Evelyn Glennie, but it can ,and should ,be more deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get it","review":"maybe I missed the boat on this one, but kept wondering 'where's the beef' in this book. nothing profound here other than a bunch of strange headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Cheers for Poppy!","review":"With a clever rhyme scheme and beautiful illustrations, Poppy became an instant star at our house. The rhymes stand up to repeated readings and there is nary a stumble when reading the text out loud. Poppy, a precocious pig, believes she can be the star of the circus in a highwire act. After a few stumbles and a little self-doubt, Mom reminds her that \\"some dreams take lots of trying\\" and Poppy returns determined to reach her full potential. The message, not at all heavy-handed, has prompted my own little ones to reach for their own dreams (and not a few requests to install a highwire in our back yard.) Quick! Grab your own copy of Poppy. You won't be disappointed with the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable book","review":"With fun rhyme and cute illustrations, TIGHTROPE POPPY is a charming book about following your dreams!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a great deal but very poor quality","review":"After using the product for less than a year, one of the bands snapped and caused a small injury as the rubber hit my skin. The rubber looks like it is weakening around some areas...mainly near the handles. I wouldn't recommend this product for long term use as the other bands look like they're about to snap too. I think its a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"the Gaiam tricord resistant cord bands are very badly made.the cord comes out of the handle easily and can snap you hard with itas you are using it, and brakes easily.I do not recommend this at all.The dvd the comes with it is not that good.Do yourself a favor and buy the ones Walmart sells they are better madeand cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous product, poor workmanship","review":"After fewer than 15 uses, the grommet sewn into the handle of the heavy resistance cord tore and caused the cord to snap back with considerable force. I looked over the rest of the cords and saw that the second handle on the heavy resistance band was also frayed around the grommet, indicating it would give way shortly. The medium resistance cord has the same problem as I can see the issue beginning in both handles. If you are using the product and pulling it near your face, I would recommend retooling your workout because if it breaks you can receive serious eye or facial injury. I was lucky as it only bruised my foot, but examine the grommets near the handles and discontinue use if any fraying is occuring. Poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!!!","review":"I am a relatively active and healthy runner, 36 at the time of using this.

Hero Fraser just needs to find her aunt to help her since her family no longer can or will. They make the perfect couple. True highland romance fans will love this story!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that is fun to read and a hero \\"to die for\\".","review":"Highland Jewel is, indeed, a jewel. The hero, Ciaran, strides across the highlands, an avenging warrior, intent upon discovering what happened to his family, and punishing those responsible. The heroine, Hero, is trying to find what's left of her family, and much to Ciran's irritation, he must take her into his life to keep her safe. Between them, the warrior facing death and the innocent, self absorbed heroine find that the bond they forge together in their trials leads them to a new life where two lonely people can triumph together.Within Highland Jewel there are enough tartans, clan skirmishes, and highland honor to beguile even those not devoted to 18th cent. Scotland. For those who do love this era, it is pure delight. Ms. Wilhelm's book is well thought out and well researched....even better, it's fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book! Very sexy, very exciting.","review":"Highland Jewel has everything--a wonderful, unusual setting, a spunky, loveable heroine, and an unforgettable hero. It also has a tender--and quite sexy!--romance between two strong, exciting characters. You'll hate to see their story end. I've read other books by this author, and I loved them all. She completely captures the feel of the Highlands--and she uses both humor and deep emotion in every story. I especially love her heroes. They aren't just gorgeous men. They always have a special, tragic nobility, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast paced wonderful love story","review":"This book is great the story flows easily and keeps you wanting more.The love story between the main characters is warm loving and full of spunky passion.The love story by the supporting charachters is charming,fun,and helps to bring alive the lives of all in a whole.The action is great with out all the excess gore that some writers use.Terri Lynn Wilhelm gets the reader so involved you dont want to see the end of there journey.I wish she would keep writing about these characters since there is so much unexplored possibilites and directions to go in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best Scottish Romances!","review":"As an avid book-reader, especially romances set in genre, I was very disappointed with Highland Jewel. I spent so much time trying to figure out what the characters were saying and how it related to the story-lines that after 90 pages, I was ready to give up.Hero, the lead female of the book, was so uppidy and self-centered that I was hoping the story would lead to another \\"hero\\"ine coming to the aid of Ciaran.I recommend Julie Garwood's books for anyone looking for a romance set in this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay Buchanan?","review":"Not sure what to make of this guy, seems to be a lot of stir about him, but in my opinon, I don't see it!

This album is very entertaining and has a few bonus tracks that are NOT found on the original album. For the most part you can ONLY purchase this album from Asian countries. Unfortunately, I would have to say that it is NOT worth paying OVER $25.00 altogether UNLESS you are a true die hard fan of one of the above or ALL of the above. Hope this review helps. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same band","review":"This CD was shockingly bad. It doesn't have a single thing in common with the 1984-85 Power Station. None of the songs are catchy at all. If it wasn't for Robert Palmer's voice, I'd swear this was a different band. I have no clue what type of sound they were going for. There's no power pop, no kick *ss drumming, there's dumb lyrics, and boring guitar work. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST albums EVER","review":"It's hard to believe these are the same dudes that made the classic 1985 debut album one of the most memorable of the 80's.\\"Living in fear\\" however, is poorly written, un-inspired, and uneven.Bernard Edwards played bass on this one, and even THAT didn't save the album from being one of the worst ever made, by any artist.Stay away from this one!The melodies won't make a bit of sense to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but needs much better packaging and shipping!","review":"The item and price were good. But as other reviewers have said before, the backboard came in scratched due to lack of proper packaging. Needed 2 hours, and 2 adults to assemble. A good set of tools helps too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, fairly easy and straightforward installation","review":"I got this for my 7 yr old son and he loves it. Given our driveway/landscape configuration that includes an irrigation system, we opted not for an in-ground backboard system but a portable one like this unit. For his age, we also needed needed one with adjustable heights. The height adjustment system with this unit is very easy to use: simply grip the handle, hold the trigger and within seconds the height can be adjusted. Although this unit does not have the stability of an in-ground system or more expensive portable system, this provides decent stability and again it is easy to adjust the height. Much of the installation can be done by one person with assistance required for roughly one-third to one-half of the steps - all in all a fairly straightforward installation process. Once installed and with water used to stabilize the base, I do find the unit very hard to manuever - this is my key criticism. Otherwise, good value and good function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while . . .","review":"My Lifetime 1558 worked well enough until tragedy struck . . .The system was blown over by a strong wind even though the base is full of sand. The rim landed on the court and was bent. More importantly, the frame was bent where the rim connects to the backboard. Now the rim is angled upwards at 30 degrees and is horribly out of round.Lifetime customer service doesn't offer any repair advice for \\"liability reasons\\" or provide repair service. The two replacement parts are expensive, two-thirds the cost of the original purchase. I'm just not sure I want to invest more in a system that was so easily damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"The basketball system arrived in three days,which was really great. It took about fours hours to put together working mainly by myself, however you will need an assistant to finished it. The backboard is nice and wide, but could have been a little more solid. The height ajustment level is really easy and simple. My ten year old daughter changes it with no problems. Overall it is a great basketball goal and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the money","review":"Took 3.5-4 hours to assemble on my own- much easier with a helper. Directions are ok but could be better- bigger diagram would help- read then carefully! Once up hoop works great. Only issue is base could be counter balanced better- it tips over when base is empty, this makes filling it with water a 2-person job- Or stand on it while it fills. Sand is harder to remove and so I opted for water in the event I need to move the hoop around."},{"rating":"2","title":"took awhile to build","review":"I wouldve given this hoop a 5/5 if it wasnt for the time it took to build it. It took about three and a half hours for me and my 13 yr old son to finish. However, after watching the fun he had with it, I believe that it was defiantly worth the time. I especially love the fact that it can be raised and lowered with a simple push or pull of a handle (10ft-7.5ft). Whenever my son wants to seriously practice, he can raise it to regulation size and shoot. But whenever he just wants to play 1 on 1 with his brother and be able to dunk, he can set it to one of the lower standards. I also appreciate the huge 52\\" backboard. So just incase you're shooting and the ball slips out of your fingers, it wont go soaring over the entire system. Instead it should hit the backboard because of its size. So overall, I give this hoop a 4.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for younger computer users","review":"They played I Spy with their Grammy and loved it at her house so I tried to find the same one...turns out this is not the same one but this is a very easy one.

I became concerned when I was about 30 minutes into this one hour long CD and they were still going on with testimonials and claims. Only in the final 15 minutes did they get into any practical visualization technique. And I use the word 'technique' loosely, it consisted of a simple relaxation exercise followed by an exercise to ask my inner guide for help. Really??

It has a nimble, imaginative plot that grabbed my interest early and held it to the end. The story juxtaposes the present and the past in a way that might seem implausible. But Gershon makes it work extraordinarily well. Readers also get a fascinating look into modern medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is way too easy","review":"We had been shopping for cribs for a while. After reading reviews of cribs that had bee shipped we really want to find one in a store. We found this one for a great price, it looked nice and the floor model seemed really sturdy for a drop side. They had 3 in stock at our nearest store. We were still a bit wary of opening the box and putting it together, apparently for no reason. We put it together in no time. Of course, afterwards we realized they didn't have the stabilizer rods on the directions (it was very stable). But we took it apart and put it back together again with the rods inserted. Maybe the entire process took an hour, but probably less.Very stable, very nice looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southpaw Manners","review":"I may be biased because I'm in the band but check out Southpaw Manners' version of Mouth and Trousers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to Chessboa","review":"Even though i have yet to play this game, most other Matrix games are low budget and low quality.

The best game that i have played is Hearts of Iron, by Strategy First. This game, although 2D, is the most strategic and fun to play game i have ever played, but it doesnt have a ton of fans due to the low-end graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best floss","review":"This is the only floss for me that can get into tight spaces without breaking.

The tape is thin but wider than regular dental floss. It's easy to use and doesn't break. That's important for those of us with tight contacts between our teeth. It has a cool, minty taste.

This one was totally different than any other tape I've bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I floss my teeth every night using tape-type ...","review":"I floss my teeth every night using tape-type floss. I had tried the regular Glide and really hated it. This is better because it was thicker, but I still didn't like it nearly as much as my regular brand. The two primary things I disliked about it were: it's made of a plastic-feeling material and cut into my fingers when I used it, and because it feels slippery, it doesn't seem to remove plaque nearly as well as my usual brand. I don't expect to use it again, nor would I recommend it to friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD production values for a great film","review":"With a newly restored version of Things to Come out there is no reason to ever buy this disk.

It is good to remember times like these, but it is even better to take a stand here and now and then watch God work in people's lives today.

This movie could have been longer and would have got the five stars from me had it been. But that is probably the only drawback of the film other than the fact that part two seems to be almost identical to part one (although I didnt get to finish part two because my DVD kept messing up). Overall, it is worth buying and would be a good Christian movie to show to the kids and guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate but...","review":"I purchased this DVD because of the good reviews I read and price. It was certainly worth the price. The acting and cinematography left much to be desired, and the timeline was unfollowable. The individual events themselved appeared accurate to scripture, and in truth the Bible cannot be read as a narrative with all events following a chronological sequence; but when watching a movie one expects a certain amount of streamlining and storytelling which just isn't here. Particularly misleading is the fact that there are two volumes. Be aware that the volumes are not 'part one' and 'part two' of the story of Jesus. They tell the same story with different scenes, or possible different takes of the same scenes. This DVD could certainly be used as a graphic tool in teaching some of the events in the gospels, which is particularly useful when teaching children, but don't expect a cinematic tour de force, because you won't find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untold Life of Jesus","review":"This is the worst film of the life of Jesus. It tells nothing of the life of Jesus and is really one HD slideshow but in motion. When you turn on the movie all you see is someone doing something that you will have to know appears to be like what happened to Jesus. You need to know the story to follow the acting because it seems as if this story took place a few years ago. The actors are so bad that you even have to figure out that too. I think someone just made a home movie and went into business with High Tech DVD burning. I get better acting than this in junk mail DVDs. The only people that should get this movie is the actors, so they can say I did star in a movie in my life thanks to the life of Jesus. -99"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Beethoven I ever heard","review":"The Furtwängler's performance of Beethoven's Fifth is simply the best I ever heard. The interpretation is powerful, full of passion and intensity. The sound is quite good for a 1954 recording, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays as well as usually. If you really like Beethoven's Fifth, you must have this recording. The 7th interpretation is also very good, but the sound is not so good. But the allegretto sounds so beautifuly!

The author breathed life into the characters primarily to evoke sympathy for them from the reader or hatred for them in the case of Simon Legree. I saw this black and white silent movie for the first time at the age of 13. Up until that time I had only occasional contact with black people and did not understand why they were so radical about the topic of slavery. My only understanding of slavery was the Shirley Temple version and I thought black people were being overly sensitive about it. Seeing Uncle Tom's Cabin was like an awakening that changed my understand of the whole relationship between black people and slavery. The silent movie was much better at bringing across the true purpose of the novel without the hollywood slant of modern versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncle Tom Video","review":"The movie does not lend itself well to the text; it is flat and does no justice to the literary piece.

I had this recording on vinyl along with many others. I now have the CD and couldn't be more pleased. She was at her prime and sings beautifully from beginning to the tragic ending, capturing the feelings and emotions of Violetta perfectly. She is one of the very few singers who enunciate the words and make the lyrics understandable. I have recordings of Sutherland, Callas, Caballe, and others, and for my liking, none can touch Beverly. She is the American Prima Donna! Bravo, Beverly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting La Traviata","review":"Beverly Sills sang countless performances of Violetta Valery, this beloved and most tormented heroine was one of her greatest and earliest roles. Even though she wasn't a dramatic coloratura soprano she gave the role more drama, more details and more colours than most famous Violettas (Including Sutherland and Caballe). Her charm and sparkle in ACT I is undeniable. Her voice glitters and shines with sunny warmth and silvery polish. Her \\"Sempre libera\\" is fiery and glowing with seamless coloratura and wonderful acuti. In Act II she and Panerei give one of their best performances ever. The \\"Non sapete\\" and \\"O dite alla giovine\\" are heartbreaking jewels. But Sills complete triumph is in ACT IV where she sings with Lucia-like intensity, yet still sounding vulnerable and fragile. Gedda a is a terrific Alfredo, nothing else can be expected. A beautiful, essential Traviata. Nothing boring or dry to be found. A++++++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"In my opinion, Sills is a remarkable vocal artist. I find her voice quite beautiful, yet with a reedy edge to it that gives her vocal instrument an incredible ability to express many colors of emotion (much like Callas). She also has brought a quality of intelligence, warmth and vulnerability to the character of Violetta that I haven't heard or seen in others, and I own 5 different recordings of La Traviata, and have seen 3 productions of it. So if you are looking for advice on what recording of this incredible opera to get from someone who has listened to many different recorded and live productions of it, my advice is to BUY THIS ONE!

It 1) clicks annoyingly, 2) can't be turned off halfway through the toaster cycle if you think your toast is already done, and 3) ALWAYS burns the bottom of your toast and leaves your toast top raw.

The bake function also burns things.DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER OVEN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, burns toast.","review":"Toaster ovens have never been known for their toast, but this is ridiculous. I can only advise using the broil setting because otherwise the bottom of your toast is burnt before the top is done. Oh yeah, the other bonus prize if you use the toast setting is...if you look at it and it's done, you can't just turn the knob and shut the thing off (although I didn't FORCE it)...you can either wait it out or remove your toast as the machine continues to toast nothing.On the other hand, it works quite nicely for tasks in which you use the little pan.

It felt pain; passion; dismay; hope; joy; and above all else desire. It spoke with cold logic, never wasted a word. But its nanosecond thoughts were lavish with emotion. As with tales of soft-spoken heroes of the martial arts or the Old West, they think much and speak little -- and only then carry a big stick. Honor and desire, not mere power, are the Bolo's allegories. The authors of \\"Unconquerable\\" have insipidly shifted the focus from guts to guns.

Tiffany and her motley assortment of friends had some funny observations on life, and I enjoyed bits of the snarky humor. I did find Tiffany a bit self absorbed and hard to like, but figured she would redeem herself part way through the book. I mean, everyone has to grow up, right? But the truth is, by half way through, I not only found that I didn't like or empathize with her, but that she was a bit of an idiot. I couldn't see why her friends liked her, since everything seemed to be about her. She never did grow up. So, for over 400 pages, I was reading about someone who had the emotional maturity of a 4 year old, AND SHE NEVER CHANGED. Then, the ending came. And it wasn't an ending.

But instead, Wolff just goes over and over in circles with people and conversations that just don't belong in the novel. I haven't read any other book by Isabel Wolff, so the unnecessary foolishness in this novel may not be attributed to her writing style as an author.

The characters were one dimensional and boring. Half way through the story I could have cared less if I even continued. The premise of the story is that Tiffany Trott is a single girl, who mind you gets dumped on her birthday and is trying to find love. She places an ad in the paper and gets a number of responses. One is from Seriously Successful, whom she falls for. But, the catch is he is married. She works hard to meet someone else ... and as you can tell ends up happily ever after (or there about). I really wish that the story could have been more interesting. Create some characters who a 30 something woman can feel for. Instead I read this wondering how she could write so many pages of dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I recently, just finished reading this book. At first it seemed like a good book to read. But in the end, I was very disappointed.

I looked for recomendations based on that book and \\"The Trials of Tiffany Trott\\" was suggested to me. I did not enjoy the book. If you are looking for a story about a sad woman who cannot ever find a man, then you might enjoy this. The whole book is date after unsucsessful date. And the ending was very disappointing to me. If you enjoyed \\"Getting Over It\\" like I did, I would steer clear of this book, it is not the same humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"The characters in this book are absolutely pathetic! Tiffany is a desperate woman looking for a husband through personal adds, dating agencies, etc. Not only was the leading lady pathetic, she was absolutely boring too.

I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fun, lighthearted comedies, because this book is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"... I decided to give Tiffany a try. Well, she's no Bridget Jones. The characters are cliches. The plot (such as there is) offers few surprises. And as an American, I just didn't get some of the humor. But most of the book is so unamusing, I'm sure many Brits don't get it either. In short, save your money and re-read Bridget Jones instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very witty and also human","review":"A friend lent me this last weekend and I read it in a day - couldn't be parted from it, kept having to sneak back to it to find out how Tiffany's latest date had gone. I was really taken aback by how funny this book is - the writing and jokes are very clever, and I laughed out loud a lot - especially when she went o the Bahamas Club Med. As the book went on it got deeper, especially with the way Tiffany becomes her friend's birth partner - the baby classes were just a hoot and the birth of the baby made me blub! I really liked the way Tiffany is so polite and self-controlled whilst thinking quite vicious things which she keeps to herself. I thought that was very true to life. The characters and situations were so vivid and dramatic that it was like watching a movie - the dialog was so smart and lively. In short, a gripping, intelligent comedy of manners with a lot of feeling too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight for single ladies -- and just about anyone else","review":"As an unpartnered lady, I think this book was EXCELLENT -- funny, sad and true-to-life. And I just LOVED the \\"thoughts\\" -- the \\"I-didn't-actually-say-that\\" lines! I thought they were GREAT! No, this ISN'T Bridget Jones, it's different (I liked BJ too, but I don't really get all the parallels. They're two different characters, two different books, by two different authors).As a romantic with a Valentine where her heart ought to be, I didn't care too much for the ending, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, but on the whole, this is a wonderful read for unpartnered ladies -- and just about anyone else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bridget Jones","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be full of fun, witty British humor about a single gal. Well, I got the part about single gal right. The book dragged in several places.

In my opinion, the book was only mildly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"the trial that never ended......","review":"for me, i found this book to drag on and on......it finally made me 'laugh out loud' on page 280 with the description of childbirth which, for some reason, struck me to be hilarious, having gone through it three times myself. the rest of the book was fun, but too bad it took 280 pages to get there.the author described too much in detail, leaving not much to the imagination. when she said things she retorted with \\"i didn't really say that\\", this got annoying after the eleventh time. she also went on and on with giving examples, endlessly.anyway, all-in-all, i am glad the trial is finally over. the end was predictable, even though she left us with quite an uncertainty......on to a more funny novel.....i hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best Work...","review":"Tiffany Trott is a boring, repetitive novel with a weak main character.Actually I didn't say that at all...wait, yes I did! This novel had potential, but it spent more time describing to us Tiffany's odd dates then it did developing the main characters. Tiffany spends so much time pondering love and marriage, and Seriously Successful, that we never hear about her friends, who sounded promising. Tiffany herself also seemed interesting, but you soon lose interest and find yourself not caring if this woman ever finds love or not.There were a few amusing moments, but none that would make this book stand out among the better ones out there.A weak imitation of the better written, and much more appealing, \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\". Another one to try is \\"Asking For Trouble\\" if you want to genuinely want to laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trials of reading Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is not a likeable character. She whines too much about the most trivial things and the funny moments throughout the book are sparse. It's repetitive, with no storyline and you loose interest in her ordeals a quarter into the book.. I can see why she's single...she's utterly annoying. I wouldn't want to date her. TT spends the entire book pining for \\"super successful\\", who is never fleshed out, really, and when he finally is available, she doesn't want to be get married--her main objective of the entire book. She will probably be wondering, ten years from now why she didn't marry him, like she did with Kit--then the sequel will follow: \\"The dilemma of Tiffany Trott: still single at 47!\\"Reading all the glowing reviews claiming TT is better than Bridget Jones Diary, I wondered how they could have read the same book I did. The Trials of Tiffany Trott is a \\"skip it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I found the trials of Tiffany to be not so funny . It was a bit long and I found myself skipping paragraphs.

Bit boring and not terribly funny. The ending was good but what a pity that it was really only the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I read Wolff's other book (the making of minty malone) before this one, and was very disappointed when I read this one. I felt attached to the title character, but felt she was in a lose lose situation that did not resolve by the end of the book. My suggestion...read Minty Malone...you find out what happened to Tiffany anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelously Funny - Buy it !!","review":"I'd heard a lot about this book, but only recently got round to reading it - wish I hadn't waited so long as it cheered me up after a bad break-up - my problems seemed to pale in comparison to Tiffany's. In short this book is a fabulously funny rollercoaster ride through the dating scene in London, with too many laughs to count and a lot of poignancy too - the birth scene in the hospital was wonderful. Despite the garish cover, this is not a girlie read, but a very intelligent one. A thinplot is more than compensated for by the quality of the characterization, the crisp, witty dialogue and the excellent humor. There are some great British chick fic books out there right now - Marion Keyes, Lisa Jewell - and this is one of the very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"By the end of this book, I was thoroughly exhausted with Tiffany Trott. It looked like a fun read, but it took too much effort for it to actually be called \\"fun.\\" It was more like work reading about the extreme minutae of Tiffany's dating life and quest for Mr. Right, or Mr. All Right. I'm not even sure she was such a great catch herself - she wasn't funny, or very sweet, or endearing in any way. If I were Tiffany, I'd be exhausted with myself. It was just too many darn pages to sift through to find out that Tiffany is happier being single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous!","review":"I thought this book was so funny, I was laughing a lot and a lot. In Germany where it has just been published we are all finding this book very very funny. The Lesbians at the birthing classes are very amusing, lovely characters. The scenes at Club Med are also brilliant and so well written that I felt I was there. And I so liked Tiffany Trott herself, she is very engageing and nice and also real. I felt I knew her, and I laughed such a lot. This is an unusual book also loved the character of her friend Kit. In short, there are so many great scenes and wonderful jokes. I would love to read anything else by Isabel Wolff as I think she is a very, very funny author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Total Grin-Fest from start to finish!","review":"I could NOT put this book down! I had a big grin on my face the whole way through, and I laughed out loud, over and over (no mean feat with a book, yea many books make you smile, but few can actually make you laugh out loud. I totally loved Tiffany and her pals, she is brilliant! And the way she describes the whole relationship \\"jungle\\" is just superb! I am really jealous of all the people who have not yet read it! My only criticism is the way the author kept saying a witty retort, then saying \\"Well actually I didn't say that, but...\\" This sentence was used at least several hundred times (well it SEEMED like it) throughout the book, I found it most tiresome.Please, please - there HAS to be a sequel?! There just HAS to be!! I for one cannot wait, and will be checking out the bookstores 'til it arrives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic Realism!","review":"I saw the other reviews for this book and am appalled at how many people didn't like it!

Definitely pick the book up if you're still in your thirties and love chick lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending, sometimes annoying","review":"I picked up this book because of the apparent similarities to Bridget Jones' Diary. It was an okay book in that I wanted to finish it and find out what happened. However, it just so happened that the copy of the book I had was missing the last pages (the pages 344-377 just kept repeating to the end), so I had to go through the trouble of going back to the bookstore to get a new copy to find out if Tiffany finally found the man she was so desparately looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiffany Trite?","review":"This book should really be called the TRIALS OF TIFFANY TRITE.

From some of the descriptions and reviews, this book SEEMED to be a perfect fit for a comic relief. What a disappointment. I cannot think of any redeaming quality of any of the characters. Fool that I am, I stuck with it, hoping that it would get funny somewhere in those pages. I should have known better as this \\"light read\\" took me about 2 weeks to finish.

Maybe it's because I'm not British but I didn't think it was hilarious. Every now and then I chuckled but still she was kind of annoying. Then there was this whole \\"Actually I didn't say that, what I said...\\" was extremely annoying. She wrote it like 25 times throughtout the book and it would've been ok if she didn't say it exactly the same way every time. A little variety would have been helpful. By the middle of the book I could predict when she was going to put \\"actually I didn't say that...\\" before I read it, then I realized I was right and rolled my eyes. I just didn't enjoy it but I had to finish it just to see how it was going to end. And that was even more disappointing.

I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent beginning, but there are far more enticing reads...","review":"....a light novel, full of rather predictable yet vaguely compelling scenerios and characters. Isabel Wolff is a very popular author, and one does appreciate the occasioanl Book Lite -- but a far funnier and better book is Otherwise Engaged, by Suzanne Finnamore -- or Bridget Jones by Helen Fielding, or Girls Guide To Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Banks. They are more thoughtful and original, sophisticated yet truth-bearing -- and overall more enlightening on the state of the singlehood.I think if you don't come away with a satisfied feeling from your ten dollars, it just isn't that good and could easily be borrowed at the library. Great is the enemy of Good, I suppose....thus the popularity of Jane Austen, still!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book...","review":"This book is pretty good, athough compared to books #28 and #29 in this series, it is not that great.

Chad Walker and all the other guys are pressuring Dylan, telling him riding is a sport fo girls. Which will Dylan chose? Riding (and Christinia) or Soccer? I think this book was VERY bad. One thing that bugs me is that I am the exact same age as all the characters and I don't have a boyfriend, I'm not dating, though I have had crushes. I think these kids are to young to date and have serious relationships. Thats what really bugs me about this book. One good thing in these books are that the characters don't always win. Thats the only thing thats realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to my favorite series.","review":"I don't like Christina's character she is a brat.

I LOVE TO JUMP, but Christina is obsessed. It's all she thinks about. She doesn't remember how to have fun on a horse. She also thinks everybody else has to be as serious about riding as she is.

Bad picture quality (with compression) is evident on both films, along with wafer thin sound.The extras are typical of Madacy.

This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a prime example of why. The most obvious and infuriating problem is that the soundtrack is not synched up to the action; it's about 2 seconds behind. Unless you enjoy \\"the boys\\" looking like a dubbed Japanese movie, this is going to drive you crazy. The picture quality is also really poor; I have a VHS copy of \\"Flying Deuces\\" that looks better than this. The trivia game was a nice idea, but poorly executed; \\"what color is Stan Laurel's hair?\\" How would I know---all their movies are in BLACK AND WHITE! Oy.

It is a crime that such a great comedy duo should have bowed out of cinema with such a calamitous come-back such as this film was. The pair looked tired and well past their use-by-date (Hardy died six years later). I found myself confronting my own mortality as I saw the two old men bumbling about the screen. I tried to laugh because it WAS Laurel & Hardy but it was an empty laugh, like I owed it to them because their former selves had given me so many laughs in earlier films. A comedy it was not, more a tragedy then anything else. Basically I will say this: if you are just a fan who likes to laugh at their antics then give Utopia a big miss, you will feel empty and disappointed that they ended up like they did - if you are a hardcore fan who wants to see/have all their films then by all means subject yourself to Utopia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio not in sync","review":"The movies are good, especially Flying Deuces, not so much Utopia but the aggravating thing is poor quality of the Madacy distributed DVD.

Other than perhaps the difference between the common law and FRE, I found it to be too brief. I feel like there is little debate in evidence as to what the rules is, but rather, it is when it applies, which this book barely addresses.

One of Phillips darker books - more in the vein of the Jook than his others - Bangers is a real page turner. The characters leap of the page. You can tell Gary knows LA and the book is littered with real locations. I can't say enough about this book. I have read most everything Gary has done, and this is the book I give to people as an introduction to his work. Check it out. As Gary himself said below he has a chapter you can read at his web site http://gdphillips.com/bangers.htmDon't bother with the other review on this page. That guy must have read a different book...seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the stuff!","review":"Fantastic read. Yes, might be too dark for a beach or subway/commute, but wonderful for a rainy afternoon, in the lounge chair!Who was it would put Gary Phillips' stuff under a Gary Hardwick book? Wow. Harwick, the guy who brought you cerberal stuff like \\"The Brothers\\" and \\"Deliver us from Eva\\" (without giving Willie Shakespeare a footnote?)?

The worst part is you have to buy the solutions manual separately and I can't find it anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Quiet than you would think from other reviews!","review":"I bought this to avoid the phoenix heat and some winter snow. So far, it has proved to be a worth while purchase. Quiet enough that I can still talk on skype and use it. The resistance is just fine. I don't need anything extreme. I just helps me keep my heart rate where it needs to be. I absolutely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"For indoor workouts","review":"When it is too cold to ride the trainer is perfect for your fix. I love my cycle-ops wind trainer because it allows me to get a good workout whenever it rains etc. It is relatively quite as well as being easy to fold up and put away. The bike fits easy with the built in skewers that lock perfectly without coming loose no matter how hard you hammer the pedals. You will feel confident locked in because it is very stable. The video is a little cheesy and I only looked at mine once or twice when I bought it. The girl and guy are just too darned happy, meanwhile I'm going through pain and grimacing trying to keep up with them. If you are into spinning you can spin away and never leave the comfort of your home. All in all it is a good accessory to have if you are a dedicated cyclist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth but loud indoor trainer","review":"It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to set-up--took about 10-15 minutes with minimal tools required. The noise generated by the wind is quite loud, making it uncomfortable for others to be around while riding on it. Regardless of the noise, it serves its purpose at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"this unit works great!!!!!","review":"The trainer works great, was easy to build well worth the money use it 30 min aday everyday very happy"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This trainer is stable, well built, and easy to assemble. however this thing is way to loud to use without disturbing others, watch tv, or hear a radio. Ultimately it wont get used because it is so loud and obnoxious that you just wont use it. do yourself a favor and buy a cheaper brand fluid trainer that you will actually use. the only thing this might be good for is warming up before an outdoor race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructions could be clearer","review":"I'm not a cyclist. I purchased the CycleOps to use indoors during cold weather on a bike I was given. The instructions should be for \\"dummies.\\" I took the bike apart when it was unnecessary. Cost me $18 to have it reassembled. Instructions for the CycloOps itself were very clear and I had no problem with assembling it. Just didn't realize that all I had to do was to set the bike on the CycleOps. It was too simple...but I didn't realize that. Egg on my face but I'm sure I'm not the only one out there! That said, I'm extremely pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine but really loud","review":"I definitely agree with the other reviewer - this thing is pretty loud. I live in an apartment building and ended up shoving stuff under my door to quiet the noise. Unlike one reviewer, I could not hear a TV (even turned up) so I turned on CC so I could read what was being said. I am not a 'fast cyclist' by any means, but it was really loud at the faster parts of my workout.It was really easy to set up, and the resistance was really smooth. Overall, this would be fine if noise was not a constraint."},{"rating":"1","title":"So noisy I can't use it","review":"I bought the CycleOps Wind Indoor Trainer to train at home when I can't hit the road because of work (or weather) complications. If you are like me that means weekdays late at night, or very early in the morning.I'm terribly frustrated because I can't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes. My neighbors can't stand it. Hey, I can't stand it! The noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner. To give you an idea, I don't even hear the music from my iPod while riding this thing.Don't buy it! Go for the magnetic resistance models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable for watching TV","review":"While this trainer is a cheap alternative to the fluid 2, it is so incredibly loud that it isn't possible to watch TV while using this. I am very disappointed.

I have mine located on a second floor porch, facing the trees and the creek and ride 3 or more times a week. The noise is not an issue. I feel like I get a great workout and the convenience is the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?? I can't hear you","review":"Sure, this trainer was super easy to set up but HOLY GODS is it LOUD!! Had I known that it was going to be as loud as it was I would have sprung for the Magneto.

The sock aid without covering lets go of socks and they pull right on your feet. This had been a great help since back surgery. Easy to use for anybody who has trouble bending over to put on socks. Would recommend to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrating","review":"This book is very frustrating, they put the Japanese text in tiny lettering, they have this really nice page and they barely use any of it for the text. Look at the first page and you'll see what I mean, not only is the text very small, but it's crammed in the lower right hand corner of the page, into the crease in the book. The translation is lousy, the book opens up with \\"mukashi, mukashi\\" which should be translated as\\"long long ago\\", but they have a completely different English text that does not correspond properly. A lousy book if you're trying to learn Japanese. I found a much better version on line for free at \\"The Japanese Page\\". Don't waste your money on this poorly presented and horrible translated junk. Who ever approved the layout of this book should be fired for incompetence."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorite books","review":"I came across this book while on vacation in a cabin in Minnesota. I read the entire thing in two days, and loved it so much I considered taking it with me!This was back before the Internet, and it took me nine years to find a copy of it that I could buy. It was worth the wait.These are some of the best short stories I've ever read. They are very well written, original, and gripping tales that are fun to read and reread. If only there were more writers like Mr. Ellin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Simple Sand Castles","review":"I found this book beyond what I wanted to get involved with;especially with my seven year old. This book is geared for the serious sandcastler. For setting up your sandcastle base, it recommends using roofing paper & other tools that I'm not quite ready to carry out to the beach. It is interesting, but for the serious sandcastler. Not the casual kid builder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cooler","review":"This is one nice cooler - large but not too large, great lid, nice handle design, wheels... For about a year is has been used an abused - left outside in scorching heat or freezing temperatures, dragged in grass, on the deck stairs or the gravel driveway, and after a nice wash it still looks almost new. Never leaked, both wheels are still tight, and the handles are intact and strong. Now, I have not tested this too see if it keeps the ice for days, but for my needs (occasional picnic, groceries during summer, or just cooling some brewskies) this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size","review":"The size is great for almost everything you could need a cooler for.

The customer rep I talked to said she hadn't heard of any problems but she immediately knew what was wrong and how they would fix it. Never heard of the problem? Huh? I wonder how many trunks, car seats and floors have been swamped by their new coolers. You might want to check yours too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty, not in OEM packaging, scratched, smelly and used.","review":"Would return it to Amazon but need it for event tomorrow. Paid for overnight and it arrived on time but poorly wrapped in a plastic garbage bag, not the original manufacturer box. No literature with it. Was scratched - deeply on lid - dirty and smelled of food inside. There was no literature from Coleman, i.e., warranty etc., and clearly been used. Must have been returned to Amazon by someone else and they sold it to me as new. This is really disappointing for Amazon to do this to me. We have learned from this experience not to trust Amazon for anything expensive or delicate, especially electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cooler","review":"I don't really have any of the \\"X day\\" coolers to compare this to, but it did keep our food and beverages cold for 4 days while camping. We had large freezer packs plus ice in there and I did have to replace the ice on the 3rd day. There was some melted ice, but not that much and I drained that water off and replaced the ice. Everything stayed nice and cold. The wheels are definitely a nice feature for a cooler this size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for long trips!","review":"We need this for a trip from Southern California up to Lake Tahoe, about a 10 hour drive. We filled it up with all our perishable groceries and ice and it kept everything cold they way it should. It is very sturdy and easy to move around. It is pretty to lift when filled with ice and groceries so you may want to have two people to lift it. Anything bigger than this and you would certainly need two people. The outlet plug is a must and works great to release the water without making a mess. Overall I am pleased and I look forward to using it again soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not deserve even one star","review":"The lid cover was loosen and taken off on the first day of my camping trip. Coleman used a tiny and cheap bolt to tighten the hinge and it is a complete mistake. There is a wide gap between the cover and the container; then, I found tens of ants in the cooler whenever I open the lid. Best product for those who wants worst experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice cooler","review":"My wife and I were looking for a portable cooler for our trips to the Columbus Zoo. This fit the bill for sure,easy to tote around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factory second - good deal but not perfect","review":"I bought this cooler as a factory second. I knew it was going to be a refurbished model. Appearance was not my concern and it is a good thing. The inner liner and the bottom blue outer evidently was not properly glued in the original manufacturing. The fix-it shop appears to have pried open the unglued area and applied a plastic adhesive to fix the production line errors. The glue job was sloppy and not pretty. The cooler however works as advertised and keeps the ice long and thus my food fresh. Since I am banging it up in a river raft the appearance is far from a priority, the quality is good and sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooler","review":"Very nice for fishing.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Had bought the Igloo of the same description a couple of years ago and it preformed great. Unfortunately the ice chest was damaged, so I bought another. The second one did not preform as well, but not bad. The Igloo wore out and based on reviews I purchased the 5 day Coleman. On the very first trip, the chest was never in the sun and outside temp.s were in the low 80s. The ice in the chest turned to water in a day and half. One of the many flaws is the lack of a latch. The wheels are also not very good. Although the Igloo 5 day may not be as good as it once was it seems far superior to the Coleman."},{"rating":"2","title":"coleman rocks","review":"This coleman is what it said it is ice last longer than any chest i've owned. If your looking at it you should buy it you will be happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike this cooler","review":"I dislike this cooler very much! I just spent $30 in ice for a 5 day camping trip. The cooler already had ice and cold beverages in it from the day before and I put only cold beverages in it and filled it with ice. The weather was cool most of the time and only in the 50s at night. I had to replace the hinges this summer and have to be very gentle with the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cooler","review":"Good cooler for the price. I sure this happens with every cooler but the first batch of ice melts pretty quickly. Once you get it cold and add some more ice it stays cold for a long time. This is the kind of cooler where there's still lots of ice the next morning. Very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made","review":"This seems almost unbreakable. It rolls easily, there are two handles for carrying, and a spout on the side to let water out. There are also 4 cup holders on the top. I am very happy with my purchase. I got 1 22lb bag of ice and it filled it about half way. The ice has been in the cooler for 24 hours and the ice is still whole with no water from melting at the bottom. I got the chance to use this yesterday, when I was first looking for a cooler, I wasn't exactly sure how big 62 quarts is so I have uploaded a picture of it with soda cans inside. It says that it holds 85 cans which, maybe possible stacked with no ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"We had decided it was time to get back into camping this year and basically had no supplies to do so. When we started making a list of important items we would need to get started, a quality 5 day cooler was high on the list. I read a lot of reviews before making the purchase on this particular cooler. What puzzles me is all of the reviews were pretty good. We have used the cooler a couple of times now this summer and even on days that weren't particularly hot we can't hardly get a bag of ice to last longer than 1 day. From the time we purchased the cooler until the time we used it, our return window has expired and we are stuck with what we have. With the money it is costing us in ice, we will probably have to go out and make another purchase. I have always been a fan of Coleman products, but am highly disappointed in this cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cooler","review":"This is a perfect sized cooler. It fits easily in the back of our car and is easy to handle. I recommend the wheels. This cooler is amazing in holding the cold temp even in our AZ 100+ temps.

It keeps food cold for at least five days with the original bag of ice!

Then helps to keep the other products cold for about two more days. Definately worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"coleman 62 quart xtreme cooler","review":"Bought this cooler because we were going to travel and needed drinks and food kept cold for awhile, the product said 5 days, we refrigerated everything before we put everything in the cooler and put ice on top, put in in our air conditioned jeep and 8 hours later ice had melted.

Very pleased with purchase and delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, has a couple of flaws","review":"This is a great cooler; I love the handle and it pulls very well. I just wish it had 4 wheels. Also, it seems irrational that Coleman put the drain valve at the handle end, rather than the wheeled end. That would make it much easier to drain. That said, this is a great cooler, isn't too big and keeps stuff cold. The lack of wheels on one end does make it handy if you want to sit on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"We've used this cooler a few time so far this summer, and it works as advertised.

The Marianas are depicted on all these globes and maps where they are - nearly 4,000 miles west of Hawaii. Further, his conclusion is refuted by numerous authorities including La Perouse, Herb Kane, the staff of the Madrid Naval Museum, the late journalist Bob Krause, Wendell Carlsmith, Capt. Richard Rogers and author James Jarvis. In his \\"Legends and Myths of Hawaii\\", King Kalakaua noted that during the pre-Cook reign of Kamaluohua a ship was wrecked off Hawaii with five survivors. Oral Hawaiian histories noted pre-Cook foreigners landing there.

I found a class in Wisconsin that could teach this program and the results are LIFE changing! Traditional teaching methods with worksheets and 90% teacher talk are not the way a dyslexic student with attention deficit takes in information, nor can they commit it to memory. Even greater, I have learned that they offer this program for school elementary teachers and others to be taught in K-3 programs.

With that one short sentence my daughter was convinced that she was to \\"blame\\" for all of the problems caused by her dyslexia. Yeah. Nothing helps a dyslexic learn to deal with the challenges they face like being told they did it to themselves.Ronald Davis may be a dyslexic - but that doesn't make him an expert.

It seems to help some people, but certainly not for the reasons the authors state. People with dyslexia have problems with language and they can be taught to read and write well if their teacher has the ability to use a systematic, structured approach.

It is based on science and works for ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"A farce and a waste of time","review":"While his definitions of dyslexia and understanding of the pain and struggle children go through may be accurate, his solution is complete and utter CRAP!!

The Orton-Gillingham based method is the ONLY one researched by the National Institute of Health.

It worked for my 8 year old daughter and it is not cumbersome or complicated. After just the first \\"Orientation\\" session she went from reading one paragraph with 20 mistakes, to reading the same paragraph with NO mistakes. I've also called the helpline at the back of the book whenever I got stuck implementing the program and they were always happy to give advice. If you are wading in a scientific sea of information on how to help your dyslexic child, this is one method you should not be afraid to try. It just might by the thing that works for you.

This book also gave me an appreciation of the pictorial thinker and the benefits he/she brings to the world. As a teacher and trainer, I believe every teacher, trainer, and parent should read this--regardless of whether they work with or have a child in this category.

While I overcame my difficulties much in the same manner as the author Ronald Davis, and graduated from high school and college with high honors, my son has not faired so well. Instructional methods in public schools have changed since I attended, and Davis has reminded me of how I was able to overcome.

Unfortunately you get what you pay for. The pommel fell off one of them during shipment. Nothing that a little glue couldn't fix but disappointing nevertheless. They are made from decent hardwood and the routing is quite nice but the \\"blades\\" are quite thin, fragile, and (shockingly) rather sharp. For small children this is an accident waiting to happen. For older kids like my son it means that they can't do much with it since it is so delicate. Nice to look at but that's about it. Better glue and a bit thicker design would be much more useful. Given how they are built, however, I'm really not sure what they are designed for.

Every guy listening to this is going to relate to the song \\"Stupid\\" cause we've all been that way about a girl before.It only gets 4 stars cause these guys are SO much better live. The CD doesn't come close to capturing the feal and power of the mighty D'bombs on stage. I saw them with the Sights at the Black Cat in DC. What an excellent show. So if you like Detroit rock like the Stooges, MC5, and hard rocking '60s garage and soul you're going to love this.

Why this album is in print and not \\"Surf's Up\\", \\"Sunflower\\", \\"Holland\\", or \\"15 Big Ones\\" is a mystery to me. This album is extremely awkward to listen to because it feels as if the group is trapped by their success in the 60s and unable to bring their music forward past that point. Now that Dennis and Carl are gone and Brian seems disinterested, maybe the point is moot. For a group that brought us so much great music over the years, this is a sad way to end up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike is okay, but Bruce and Terry saved the day!","review":"This Album is no doubt not one of their best albums. However Bruce Johnston's music is ALWAYS refreshing and wonderful. Terry Melcher is an awesome producer. You can thank him and Mike for making such cool hot-rod hits. Even though Brian didn't contribute much(Okay, not at all) It still is a very good album. If you like modern rock and enjoyed \\"Still Crusin'\\", you will prbably like this. \\"Slow Summer Dancin'(One Summer Night) was my favorite on the album. Bruce proved once again he(and Carl too) could make songs as good as Brian's, such as he did on albums like \\"20/20\\",\\"Sunflower\\",\\"Surf's Up\\",etc...Lahaina Aloha has a nice melody, but still \\"Dancin'...\\" is still my favorite. Try it you never know.( One more thing: If you didn't like \\"Still Crusin'\\" DON'T GET THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a new low for the beach boys","review":"This is a dreadful album. But what do you expect when Mike Love is in charge? The only half decent track is 'Forever', but Denis Wilson's original version on 'Sunflower' is much sparser and more moving. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beach Boys hit a new low","review":"Perhaps this should just be a Mike Love album, since he pretty much put the thing together. The Beach Boys try to cash in on their \\"Kokomo\\" success with pointless remakes of \\"summertime songs\\" as well as less-than-interesting new ones. While the average listener might not see what is wrong with this album, the problem is, the Beach Boys are quite capable of making good music; they have several out-of-print albums which contain some of the best music ever, but instead of trying to build from that, they build into a cheap parody of themselves. And with Carl and Dennis gone, Brian doing music on his own, it looks as if \\"Summer In Paradise\\" is the group's \\"swan song\\". How sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer In Paradise","review":"Mostly a good album, some things could have been skipped. It is the one Beach Boys album that features Full House cast member John Stamos as a soloist (he also appeared on Kokomo, plus some Jan & Dean albums as well). He first played drums for the group in 1972, after a hand injury prevented Dennis Wilson from playing drums on stage. This recording of Forever was used on a Full House episode. It features a 90's version of Surfing (a song dating back to the Morgan sessions in 1961), a family-friendly take of The Drifter's Under The Boardwalk, plus great classic rock hits such as Hot Fun In The Summertime, Remember Walking In The Sand, and One Summer Night. The rest is Mike Love/Terry Melcher penned tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disastrous album","review":"A cd of recycled and mediocre material. Unfortunately,Mike Love was allowed to have control for this terrible cd and the result is recycled surf songs and re-recordings because all Mike Love can do is copy.He has no talent. This cd damaged the Beach Boys reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"This is by far the worst album the band ever put out, and the worst involving any band member except Mike Love's Looking Back With Love solo. Anyone who thinks this is good should go and listen to the box set, to Pet Sounds, to Brian, Carl and Dennis' solos, to any of the dozens of great albums this band put out, not this embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful Awful!!!!","review":"You know you're in bad shape when the cover art of an album is actually better than the music, but that's exactly the case here. It's really quite sad to see just how bad a once great group has become. OK, Brian Wilson wasn't involved in this debacle, and it shows. There is NOTHING about this CD that has any redeeming value. The songs are just plain BAD. Horrible melodies, juvenile lyrics and overall unlistenable songs are prevelant throughout...all courtesy of Mike Love, and his cast of idiots. Even the cover songs don't work. This is without a doubt, the WORST CD in my varied and vast collection. The Beach Boys will always be a favorite band of mine, but this CD belongs in only one place...The TRASH can!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album Cover","review":"Once you get past the beautiful album cover and disc, you put on the album and go why did this get released? Mike's leads are aweful. Bruce and Carl sounds good. Al is barely audible. Sadly, you have to believe Carl believed in this project in 1991 and 1992. I suggest looking for the European release of this album rather than getting this U.S release. The Beach Boys actually redid several songs on the U.K. release with better results. Also look for the Summer In Paradise- Live version(recorded at Wembley Arena)found on another compilation. They should have released a \\"Live\\" Album instead of this one in 1992. Definately a disappointment from the Beach Boys"},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment--watch for it in the cut-out bins.","review":"What a sad way to end an amazing career. This is the Beach Boys through Mike Love's eyes, and while he can be a great singer, he a man is stuck in a rut and unwilling to climb out. It's sort of like listening to a skilled but soulless Beach Boys cover band, which come to think of it, is exactly what the current Wilson-less touring incarnation of the Beach Boys is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Only knows","review":"God Only knows why this album was ever released. It is pablum for the Beach Boy fans that stopped growing after Shutdown and Little deuce Coupe. Mike Love was the guiding force for this album as he was for Fifteen Big Ones. Truly bad retro Rock and the guy charging over $40.00 for it is a crook and if you buy this you are a willing victim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting the beach","review":"The highlight of this album--and the reason I bought it--is the last track, \\"Forever\\". Originally featured--of all places--in a Full House episode, the lyrics are those of a simple, sweet love song. \\"If every word I said could make you laugh, I'd talk forever. . .\\" Some tracks, such as \\"Surfin'\\", are rearrangements of classic Beach Boys songs. This album isn't \\"Pet Sounds\\", but it's still excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiosity Only","review":"It gets to the point where once you've heard everything by a band and you still have one nagging release left to hear; you're just too curious to pass it up and so you think why not? I picked this up having read that the cover art fairs better than the musical contents. There are points here when I could fool myself into thinking this is a decent Beach Boys album. Now, if it wasn't so overproduced I could see it having a chance at just being a lesson in pure mediocrity. Kids might actually like this as it really does sound like a bad children's record, but please spoil kids with quality whenever you can. This is not quality Beach Boys music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, not again.","review":"\\"The Beach Boys' best album since 'Still Cruisin'\\", someone said. It's the Beach Boys' *only* album since 'Still Cruisin'. And strange as it may seem, there was a time when the Beach Boys actually did _new_ things on an album, instead of blurry photocopies of songs from twenty years earlier. Why is \\"Sunflower\\" out of print and this one still available?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Paradise?","review":"To prove my point that this is one of the worst Beach Boys albums ever (along with the truly dreadful \\"M.I.U.\\"), just look at these insipid lyrics:Surfers recycle now dont you knowLike everyone from california down to kokomoWe're gonna keep on rockinAnd raising world consciousnessWe gotta fix this messThe only mess they need to fix is this album. Sadly, it's the last one that included the incredible voice of Carl Wilson. Try not to remember this as his swan song, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant background summer disc","review":"This would line up nicely for a summer song party background mix. It is what it purports to be...the Beach Boys beautifully making summer music. The covers are better technically than some of the originals & had they gotten hold of the songs first, perhaps would've had the hits. Some people would pan Beethoven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Reading","review":"Anyone who wants to understand what went through the minds of the torturers, and comprehend how they could perpetuate their atrocities needs to read this deeply moving book. The grubbiness, the gangsterliness, the banality, the bureaucracy and the horror are conveyed in their true magnitude. Yet there is a detachment about it that adds to its credibility. This book is not about left or right, it condemns no political ideology, it doesn't blame the USA - it just tells us what happened and explores deeply how it could happen. I read this book and could not get its vivid presence out of my head for days. Like some psychological trauma, I needed to talk it over afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreadful Translation","review":"This is an essential read for anyone interested in the contemporary Argentine history. The writer is an acknowledged expert on the subject. Why then have I awarded it one star? Because the translation is appallingly bad, at times bordering on the incomprehensible. One gets the impression that it was done one word at a time, dictionary in hand.

Steps often aren't in a logical order, and they don't present considerations in a timely manner--notes often appear too late. It's the type of cookbook in which a complex recipe will call for an ingredient on page 120, and then when you get midway through the recipe on page 120, an obscure note says, oh yeah, by the way, this seventh step takes three days. Or you'll follow a recipe to the letter and find that while you had to rush to make twice the dough called for, you have to throw out a pound of unused pasta. In short, this book was written by amateur writers...and it shows. They place a great burden on the reader to read ahead and figure out what the heck they meant to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped product was different than what I ordered and paid for","review":"This product was listed as $84.

I really didn't enjoy it at all, The characters were not developed enough, Michael was weak, even pathetic and Hanna was not a likeable person. I would have liked it if I could get into the characters more, it was hard to enjoy when I had such feelings of indifference towards them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Frustrating","review":"Oddly engaging, yet wholly unbelievable. The first-person narrator is charmless and preachy, and the circumstances surrounding the relationship between the teenage boy and the older woman (not to mention the relationship itself) is completely ludicrous and poorly motivated. I like the idea of a novel dealing with later-generation Nazi guilt from the German citizen perspective, but the issue is so weighed down with theoretics, rather than true feelings or thoughts, that it comes across dry and essayist, instead of compelling fiction as truth. A different author with this material may have hit gold, but Schlink fails to ignite much of anything here, and the result is disappointing and a bit frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a great book! It has many themes compiled together in it: love, lust, hate, betrayal, compassion, and friendship. At times, the book seems to turn the unexpected direction, which makes it interesting to follow. Great mixture of imagery and literary techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I am an English teacher and read constantly. In the past I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Oprah's selections. I was excited to see that this novel addressed the Holocaust. Wrong! The first 30 pages of text dwell only on a licentious relationship between a woman and a boy half her age. There is little character development of either character, so I found myself caring about neither. The ending, while slightly shocking, is very contrived and contains no closure. I could not put this book down; not because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next, but to get it over with so I could move on to something more enjoyable. A grave disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting account of the period","review":"Written from the angle of coming to terms with the contradiction of personal experience of a woman versus her involvement in the Nazi concentration camps. Sheds some psychological insight on the experience of the next generation. Well written as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"jolted by honesty","review":"If someone were to ask you to write a story about a Nazi war criminal--one which allows the reader to sympathize with her--could you pull it off? I couldn't. But somehow, Schlink's \\"The Reader\\" manages to do just that. In just a few deft strokes, the author paints a compelling picture of an intelligent boy having an affair with a mysterious older woman, which is to become the springboard for a much larger story. Rather than take the safe, easy route of portraying Nazis as inhuman (\\"monsters!\\" we'd say, \\"nothing like ME\\"), he asks us, through Hanna, \\"What would you have done?\\" A compelling story, written with clarity and compassion--not to mention devastating candor--\\"The Reader\\" is the best book I've read this year. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligently written.","review":"Schlink casts out a line to the readers, using an intriguing thought provoking theme as bate. Once you've begun reading, it becomes almost impossible to stop. The story will move you into a mode of thinking unfamiliar in most American novels. Intelligently written, it challenges your morals yet invites a particularly wonderful sense of commonality with life, love, and forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it?!","review":"I expected it to be riveting, but it wasn't, although I managed to finish it easily enough. (probably because it was realtively short)I still don't understand why she had an affair with a 15 year old boy. Nor why he never got over it. The book didn't educate me at all about the Holocaust like I hoped it would. I don't know why he wouldn't visit her in prison or why she killed herself. Seems to have a lot of missing links. Maybe I didn't care enough about the characters to think about these situations. This was is a take it or leave it kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good weekend reader!","review":"I really enjoyed the combination of the love affair, Nazi Trial, and the ironic twists in Schlink's novel.

Not that my time is better than anyone else's but i just do not have a lot of it. My main complaint with this book is that it just seems so unrealistic. Dont get me wrong I know that it is horrible not to be able to read. I sure your self esteem would be rock bottom. However, I just can not imagine anyone going to prison for almost twenty years just because they would not admit they could not read. I also can not imagine letting someone I knew was innocent and someone I loved or at least loved beyond comparison at one time , go to prison. This book read like a soap opera. By the way just because Opera recommends does not make it worthy, Although I think very highly of Opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this an Oprah pick?","review":"This was not a good read at all. Something must have gotten lost in translation because I found it to be quite uninteresting. What was the point? I was very disappointed in this book and could hardly even bring myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring and difficult to get through","review":"I usually find the Oprah books very interesting, but not this one. This was one of the most boring books I have read. I skimmed through it just so I could find out what happened to Hannah and Michael. I did not like the fact that Hannah referred to Michael as \\"kid\\". If the author did not specify Michael's name, we would have never known it until very late in the book. I don't give this a good rating at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, BORING, A WASTE OF THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON.","review":"I don't consider myself an insensitive boor, but I wanted to throw this book out the window! Michael is nothing but an arrogant wimp. Hannah is ashamed to be illiterate, so she'll take the rap for a horrendous crime rather than admit she can't write? Please!! I read this only because it was chosen by my local book club. Don't waste your time or your money. It's depressing with no redeeming qualities at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book S**KS!","review":"This was horrible. It was dry, boring, and EXTREMELY hard to get through. The plot (what little there was of it) wandered, and at times was completely pointless. It was HORRIBLE, I am so mad I spent the money on it.

I bought it at the bookstore, and after reading the back, thought it sounded good... it says something about the woman has a dark secret, darker than murder?!?! Well, I figured out her little secret before the author tells it, and I thought it was pretty stupid and obvious. I won't tell you what it is, in case you go ahead and buy this book =)But I guess I just got the impression that this book was going to be more of a mystery, and it was more romanic and historic, two subjects I am not fond of reading!! OH WELL."},{"rating":"1","title":"It draws you in but leaves you hanging","review":"The book draws you in with Michael and Hanna's relationship at the beginning, and character development would naturally seem to follow - but it doesn't. Michael has more passion and evokes more interest from the reader at 15 than at any other point in the book. I wish more could have been written about the reasons for Michael's failed relationships and his generations' attitudes towards the horrors of the holocaust. The book just was not very good. I expected much more from an Oprah book club book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining","review":"At first the book was good, but it grew tiresome. I found myself skipping pages at a time. You really didn't get to know the characters. I didn't connect with the main character at all.

If you're looking for a quick read, but no feelings this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reader","review":"though i devour most books i come across, i had to force myself to finish this one. it is not one of oprah's better picks. realizing we all appreciate different books at different times in our lives, depending on \\"where\\" we are and \\"what is going on in our lives\\" at the time, this book left much to be desired. the characters were flat. i had no empathy for any of them. although there were sentences that caught me up, most of the book left me down. a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why recommend this book? It's not worthy!","review":"Why Oprah recommended this book is beyond me! This is not a book I liked reading. The main character is an over-sexed teen and later judgement is passed on the ex-Nazi woman he regularly bed down with. She reads in prison... so what!

Then this is the story for you.","review":"I was hoping this would be a great story (being that the movie is causing all sorts of hype and it won a number of awards). I had a lot of trouble finishing this book. The characters never fully develop. The writing is sparse and poor. The main character asks questions throughout that are meant to be thought-provoking but detract from the story and make you feel like you're sitting through a seminar with a boring professor. There are plenty of good books about the Holocaust--and this isn't one of them. Don't waste your money OR your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once more about the Holocaust","review":"It really seems that German people can't get over their shame and guilt about what happened over 50 years ago; this is another book on the same old subject, but I must say one of the best. Schlink doesn't fall into apologizing, he tries to explain why it all happened. It's simple: nazis weren't inhuman, they were very human, and the reason we are so horrified about their deeds is because we can imagine ourselves in their places. This idea in itself makes the book worth reading, but it's also a story of love and human relationships, and a very true one, if somewhat cynical and pessimistic. A fascinating tale indeed, even if it's a bit difficult to read in all its heaviness."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth buying.","review":"I saw this book on Oprah's show and decided to buy it because of Oprah's glowing remarks. I do not recommend this book for many reasons. The primary reason is that the character development is weak. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, whether it be hatred or love. The plot was not very interesting either, and although I did finish it within several hours, it was not a page turner. Obviously, being a page-turner is not a primary reason to read a book. However, it offered very little literary value, and it was not a book that challenged your mind. The only reason that I continued to read it was because I had hoped that it would get better. It didn't. You will be very sorry that you wasted your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"Even more surprising than how boring this book was is the fact that some people actually loved it. It had absolutely no depth or insight as to motivation, character, or more importantly, the gravity of the holocaust. I'll never forget the glorious moment I finished it. Keep to talk shows, Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I was really dissapointed with this book.

I didn't enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite book","review":"The Reader is a story that everyone can identify with. The identification does not have to be literal. The questions are thought provoking for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, I expected more....","review":"I was hoping this book would provide me with something much more. As a person born in post war Germany with parents who were teenagers during the war, with grandparents who experienced their realities I thought this book could have given more. I found the inner struggle that the protaganist expresses superficial and empty. I kept thinking maybe the book lost something in the translation. I gave the book to my parents to read and they felt the same way. Fortunately it was quick to read but at the end I felt nothing. I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me look into myself a little deeper","review":"This book at first seemed to simplistic for such a deep subject.

Over all I enjoyed the book it was a very quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"It's a quick read, but it nonetheless provokes hours of self examination. In another time, in another place, faced with the same difficulties, what would you do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"He tried, but he didn't quite succeed...","review":"I read this book as part of a short class on the second generation of people after the Holocaust. It was thought provoking, but, in many ways, flat. The narrator is, as my professor said, \\"a collection of ideas,\\" and never evolves into a real person. Some of this is intentional on the author's part, however, it becomes inconsistant with what he is able to determine about Hanna (he doesn't have that much insight!). Hanna is the most well drawn character in the book, and, despite her past, has some integrity (she admits to her what she has done and denies what she has not). Her illiteracty explains how SHE became involved to the extent she did, but is by no means an explanation for all participants. It made me think about what I would have done in her postion, and the most real part of the book is when Hanna turns to the judge and says, \\"...what would you have done?\\"--and truly wants an answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the connection is?","review":"First of all, I never found any connection between the part of the book where Hanna and Michael are having a deeply sexual relationship and the part where she is on trial. I know that Michael ties it together with illiteracy, but to me that seems weak. I also didn't understand Michael's having an obsession with Hanna, which was not always sexual, for all those years. At the end something did seem to be showing a deeper message but I don't understand it still. The language kind of confused me, but it's really not that difficult. I don't know, see if you can understand this book or just enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"This is an amazing book about Post-War Germany and the guilt of the \\"second generation.\\" It starts as a love story, but ends as a thought-provoking tradegy. Well written as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Divided","review":"The beginning was beautifully written and sensitive. After Hanna leaves, the story goes down such a different path that is so disconnected from the beginning which I call the first story. While I appreciate the message that the second part of the book was sending, it was like reading a book written in two parts by two unequally talented authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the hype??","review":"I absolutely could not wait to read this book. As it turns out, I could have waited all my life and not missed much. The Reader's premise is a very intriguing story line with so much potential. Unfortunately, the outcome is a disappointing and depressing book that leaves much to be desired. The story develops in a very uneasy way. I felt like this story wanted to almost stop itself from being told. With all of the wonderful books out there I am a little dissapointed that I spent my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show us, don't tell us","review":"This book is a pure example of why that classic tenet of writing is crucial. Too much of this story is the author/narrator telling us what he's thinking, rather than showing us.For all his introspection, Michael was quite an oblivious guy. Hanna's big secret was obvious (and I don't typically catch on to these things unless I'm hit with a two by four...) well before Michael figured it out.Both Michael and Hanna had few, if any redeeming qualities, which is unrealistic and why some reviewers are saying the character development is virtually non-existent.The real secret, and more interesting angle than Michael's teenage angst that he never outgrew, is how did Hanna become the person she was? Michael didn't seem to want to know, therefore neither will we."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"Not a very good book. I thought it would get better as I read and it never did. It is very slow moving and described basically the same scene over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Simplistic","review":"The story never went beyond the surface. It is a quick read but nothing more. There are no moral lessons to learn from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze.....yawn...zzz....","review":"What a BIG disappointment. Boring, redundant, kept waiting for the plot to thicken...I forced myself to finish it, and was relieved when I turned the last page. No clue as to what all the hype was about...snooze city!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and depressing--Oprah what were you thinkin?!!","review":"Although I found the premise intriguing, the main character and narrator had the appeal of a wet sweater on a hot day. He lived his life without conviction or passion and whined about it. The woman might have had more life, but through his eyes was flat and unsympathetic. All in all the book was depressing without containing any redeeming insights into human nature. Somebody should give Oprah some upbeat, multidimensional books to read for a change. Or if she insists on depressing books, how about \\"Grapes of Wrath\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY","review":"What a boring disappointment. I could not even finish this book because I kept falling asleep. The author couldn't have made the love scenes any less romantic. What was with the baths? Weird, Weird, Weird. The Father didn't want him going back to school so soon after being ill, yet where was he when the kid disappeared for hours and days? Who even cared that she couldn't read. I figured that out right away. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough donkeys in the story","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be about me. Plus the author had a funny name. How wrong I was! And why was it written in Dutch? And with a horrible Flemish accent? The whole plot about the miner's daughter from Oxford, England, who becomes a famous ice-skater at age of 40 in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia is ludicrous. Did I mention that the whole book is in Dutch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"Felt like I was going to have to do a book report on this book. I only finished it to say I read it. If you're going to read it, don't buy it, get it at the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"I think something was lost in translation. There's an excellent story buried between two covers, it's simply one-dimensional, lacking humanity, feeling, hollow? I really don't know what was wrong with it. I do know I felt like a doctor was describing the symptoms of the characters. A bit sterile for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i read the same book?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I felt no real connection to the characters. I kept thinking that something got lost in translation when they made the book into English language. Perhaps the film will be much better at showing this story. I cannot recommend this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reader is a great read","review":"Intriguing and a real page turner. I read this book after the movie was released and although I haven't seen the movie, i can totally see Kate Winslett as the female lead in the story. It is well written and really captures emotions and images of the era and people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"best seller\\" that isn't any good. Alas...","review":"Reviews summarizing The Reader made it sound like a good book, but I had to stop less than half way through because it was so uninteresting. Nothing in the development of the characters made me want to find out anything more about them. The \\"story\\" has great potential but needs a writer who can make it happen. Another \\"best seller\\" that isn't any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"the writing nor the plot were inspiring","review":"The book started out with such potential with the backdrop of the holocaust behind an adolescent's first love/sexual experience. However, the character's were unsympathetic, bland and vanilla. This was especially discouraging since the book was about sexual passion and the most emotionally laden period of our history, the holocaust. Neither Hannah nor Michael were characters I wanted to know better which made for a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it......at all","review":"At first I thought it's going to be a good story but I really got tired of it after a while. I wonder why this book is on the top of the best-seller chart. I really thought it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY BORING!!","review":"GAWD WHAT A SLEEPER!! I found myself scanning through in the middle of the book just to get to the end! And why the heck didn't he say anything about her being illiterate!!?? Uh...i don't get it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"After hearing raves about this book, I read it in an afternoon. I just didn't get it. The relationship between Michael and Hannah didn't ring true; therefore, his lifelong obsession with her made no sense to me. Michael should have used Hannah's money to put himself in psychological counseling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distractingly simple","review":"I began reading this book in a kindof \\"captive audience\\" situation in which I had nothing else to do for a stretch of time. After an hour, I had already finished a 1/3 of the book. Now, I can't seem to force myself to pick it up again. The writing (perhaps due to the translation) is overly simple. And I don't mean \\"simple\\" in a poetic way. I mean \\"simple\\" in a childish way.The premise itself sounds very promising, but I can't get past the writing style. Thinking it might be me, I gave the book to a friend, who also passed it back to me -- not caring if he finished it -- after getting only 1/3 of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible book","review":"The Reader was a horrible book. It was just this side of pornographic, and kept going on and on about their sexual encounters. Hanna was an interesting character though I thought she was quite undeveloped in character. I'm surprised at Oprah's selection this time. A lot of her other recommendations have been very good. I hope she does better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have to even give it one star????","review":"Okay, maybe picking this up after reading The Testament and The Client was a bad idea, but this book isn't something I'd recommend to my best friend, or a stranger, for that matter.First of all, it started out very very slow. There wasn't any human dialogue until the second or third chapter.The book is divided into two or three parts. I didn't get past the second part, so I'm not sure. The first part is an intriguing read, I must admit. Maybe the idea of a 15 year having an affair with an older woman drew me into it. But in the second part, when the trial begins, it is boring. The only setting is the courtroom and it gets really slow. I couldn't stick with it, so I put it down, permanently, and picked up The Street Lawyer, which is pure poetry compared to this book.Give it a chance, but only if there's nothing else to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Be Missing Something...","review":"Boring! I am an avid reader who has read--and enjoyed--nearly every Oprah pick. However, I can't understand how this book was chosen. The first half of the book trudged along, while the second half was completely unbelievable. When I finally realized that Hannah's true \\"secret\\" was that she couldn't read, I thought, \\"So What?\\" I think the main problem was that the characters were so two-dimensional that it was difficult to care about their dilemmas. I actually had 20 pages to go, and I never did finish reading this. The moral of the story: Don't assume an Oprah book is a great book--she makes mistakes too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one, helped to understand the main character's feelings from the film, but...","review":"...I would just have loved to know more about Hannah's background, her family, how she grew up. But, maybe that was intentional on the author's part, for Hannah to remain a mystery. Recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Literacy","review":"This novel packs a great deal of power into its scant 218 pages. The basis for the film that earned Kate Winslet her well-deserved Oscar, The Reader examines profound questions of love, morality, guilt, forgiveness, social justice, and the power of the past in beautifully written prose that I imagine is only more powerful and beautiful in the original German. The theme of literacy (and lack of it) is also quite prominent in the novel. Schlink manages to achieve an almost impossible task in The Reader, as he creates a sympathetic character out of a former Nazi--and that's only one of the many complications this novel depicts with such skill and artistry. He bravely tackles this problem, as well as the sexual relationship between the then 15 year-old narrator and the adult Hanna. I plan to pick up another one of his novels, Homecoming, in the hope that it's as good as The Reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ausgezeichnet auf Deutsch!","review":"Der Roman \\"der Vorleser \\" von Bernhard Schlink ist einfach Super! I absolutely loved Schlink's novel \\"The Reader\\"... I had picked up the German Edition of this novel in Germany this summer, and finally got around to reading it. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours. I haven't read the English translation, so I cannot judge the version that others have written reviews about on this site, but the German novel is the best thing I have read since Patrick Suskind's \\"The Perfume\\" a few years ago. It is extremely thought provoking and makes one seriously think about love, relationships, guilt, responsibility,shame etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Oprah thinking lately?","review":"I do not regularly get Oprah book club books - not to sound snotty, but what appeals to the masses in the literary sense does not usually speak to me. However, encouraged by my enuthusiasm for Wally Lamb and Jane Hamilton, I read on. Ugh. First the Pilot's Wife (atrocious) and then this? Oprah, come on. Character driven books with no plot I can deal with. Plot driven books with no character are harder to deal with but still carry SOME redeeming value. Books which meander and look deep within them for some sort of introspection which does not exist and then ultimately do not lead you anywhere (and don't even throw you the bone of having brilliant, delicate or delicious passages to revel in) is out of the question. Certainly not as contrived as the Pilot's Wife - and since it only takes about 2 hours to read, not as big a waste of time - but certainly not worthy of effusive praise, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed reading a selection of books from Oprah's Book Club including Jewel, Where The Heart Is and Black and Blue. However, this book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. I must admit Part Three was the best section of the book. I could never find any \\"attachment\\" to the characters; could not sympathize with Hannah or feel any emotion toward her or the narrator. All in all, this book was extremely different from all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitive and unusual treatment of the Holocaust","review":"An unusually poignant rendering of a country coming to terms with its past through the machinations of an intense sexual relationship. I felt that this novel sensitively approached the idea of 'masking' the responsibilities and inherent guilt, which are nowadays associated with those who played a part in The Holocaust. Post 'Schindlers List', it has become perhaps acceptable to view this terrible passage in history with a quiet ,reflective dignity. And yet, this novel manages the remarkable feat of personalising a sense of incomprehension and genuine grief through, of all things, a bizarre adolescent 'rite of passage' and, in so doing, conveys a powerful sense of helplessness and misery. This book is a valuable and necessary addition to the canon of modern Holocaust-related 'fiction', and, as such, demands to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Story Line","review":"What potential this book could have had! Here is a young man walks into a courtroom and finds his lover of years past accused of crimes during WWII. One would think this book would be gripping. But it is not. The characters were shallow and simplistic. The writing was dry. Ultimately, in spite of the promising story, The Reader is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time and mone on this one.","review":"When Oprah anounced this book as a book club choice, I bought it the very next day. A few hours later I was holding the closed book in my hand trying to decide what I had just read. I was blown away. The book did not touch me as much as it revolted me. I wanted to know why? I felt that nothing was ever resolved. It was an absolute pointless read. I have gained more insight reading a trashy Daniell Steele novel. You can bet I will be more causious next time I choose a book off of the book club list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different look at the era of 1945.","review":"This was the most unusual book. Such a different viewpoint for the era in time. It was disturbing but also riveting. It gave great insight into how the main character felt about her secret. A fast read also. It moved and didn't drag on with needless descriptive passages."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Excellent - I read it in one sitting!'","review":"One of the best books I've read in a long time! The story keeps moving and keeps you anticipating the characters actions and reactions. The story from past to present keeps you wanting more and more. If the book was twice as long, I would have stayed interested and wanted more. A novel that takes on the aura of a true and riveting life story. A believable real life drama! You won't be sorry with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you've never read a book on this subject ...","review":"Actually, I'm not sure if I think this book deserves even two stars; it's not terrible, but it's pretty weak. Why are there so many questions the book leaves unanswered? I keep on coming back to the possibility that the author, while starting with an interesting idea, couldn't execute it very well. The translation was totally banal, and it may be that the original was banal, too. I had no sympathy for either of the main characters, both of whom lacked any depth. I got tired of the author's philosophically superficial musings; the whole thing started to come across like a term paper. If you want to read a great, well-written story that deals with the German character and complexities of WWII, pick up \\"Stones from the River\\" by Ursula Hegge. That's a five-star book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dissapointing","review":"I am surprised by Oprah's choice of books. I found this book to drag on forever. It was very vague with some interesting areas and went into way too much detail about nothing. Hanna's side of the story was never discussed much and left you feeling depraved of half of the story line. The one chapter at the end is the only one that lets you get to know her. I might have had more compassion for her if I had \\"known\\" her better. Definately not one of the better books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader, not what I anticipated","review":"when I read, or more correctly tried to read, the Reader, I wasn't taken by it very much. I was surprised by that, as I had previously read Black and Blue, and Jewel, and just got done with Where The heart is, and I couldn't put those down. I guess I didn't much care for the sex in almost every page, for such a short book, and I am not really too interested in WW2. This one, for some reason just did not send me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love in Troubled Times","review":"This is a good book about a boy who falls in love with an older women only to find out she has a very troubled past that is coming back to haunt her. He never forgets her and can't understand what is going on until he grows up and finds out exactly what is going on. Tried to avoid spoiling anything in my review. Try it out I think many will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please don't give away the ENTIRE story in your review","review":"I am about half way through The Reader (enjoying it so far) and was curious what other's had to say. Well the reader who titled his/her review \\"A bitter portrayal of a young man's bliss and its aftermath\\" just gave away the rest of the book for me! A review is not a blow-by-blow synopsis of the book, especially not on an e-commerce site intent on selling readers the book. I am so disappointed that I read this review, and I'm nowhere near as excited about going home and finishing the book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlink disappoints his Reader","review":"I did not care for this book in the least. First off, I felt that it read at a High School level and was in no way interesting to the adult reader. Schlink begins The Reader in mid-story. We have no background or character development. One day Michael Berg, the main character, is sick in bed and the next he is having sex with a woman twice his age. Then we turn the page and she is a Nazi war criminal. As Schlink takes us down this some what interesring story line he still forgets to develop the characters. Why should we care what happens to Hanna? Schlink did not reach me on a moral or philosophical level, he could not even reach me on an erotic level. All in all, this Reader was a let down and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I thought I would pick the book up to read because so many people are recommending it and the subject matter seemed interesting. Unfortunately, I found the book to be emotionally detached and hard to relate. The main character is hard for me to sympathize with. While the woman is a tragic figure, I wish I could read more about what is driving her silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre is an understatement","review":"I found this book disturbing as it abdicates personal responsibility for the evil things that people do. The author has written this book to dupe the unsuspecting reader. His distant style and debauched view of the world, leave a bitter taste in the mouth. We are not all that prison guard as he would have us believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can you be so removed from everything","review":"I thought this was an excellent, quick read on a topic I, as an American, certainly haven't pondered in great depth. One thing that struck me most about the book was how removed Micheal is from virtually everything in his life. He reports on everything in a most dispassionate way - his near fatal illness, his affair with Hannah, the trial (he doesn't even become outraged at the ineffective assistance of her counsel), law school, his relationship with his father, his marriage, etc. For example, look how he went to the judge and could never bring himself to talk to the judge about Hanna and the episode instead focuses on how the judge is just a civil servant after all. I would have thought that any or all of these events would have produced more passion. Oprah continues to do a great job of picking good books on thought provoking topics and getting Americans to READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a love story woven around crimes and issues of the Holocost","review":"This novel uses a unique love story to remind the reader not only of the horrows but the legal issues of the Holocost. Suberbly crafted and excellent read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touchingly poignant!","review":"This is not an easy book to read and some may even think it's depressing. One might glibly describe it as another 'rite of passage book' or toss off Hanna as a 'German Mrs. Robinson'. But to dismiss either as such is to be facetious. What this book does is to make one think of one's own prejudices; to reconsider youth's idealism and how this sometimes turns into unintended cruelties. It questions the notions of love and forgiveness, of loyalty and betrayal. The prose is poetic without being mawkish; there is pathos but no bathos! This is a quiet little book that echoes and reverberates in ones mind long after one has closed its covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think hopeful is the most positive thing you could say.","review":"Even though this book is written in a very simplistic style, it took me two weeks to get through the book because I did not enjoy it. Character development was poor, you can finish the book and not know much about any of the characters, their motivations or goals. The plot was shallow and unbelievable. This book did not effectively convey any message, or story. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent WASTE of time & money.","review":"I picked this book up because it was a \\"best-seller.\\" I felt compelled to finish it knowing that I had paid for it... but I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. How could I waste my time on top of wasting my money?I'm surprised that so many people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars actually got through it... Where was the substance? The relationship between Michael & Hanna was appalling and twisted. And what about Michael's parents, didn't they notice he was gone for hours?What about the Holocaust? German Society at the time?Unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, I wouldn't bother picking this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated bore","review":"i read this book because of oprah, i had to force myself to finish it, it was beyond boring!!you knew the big secret from the beginning!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a novel, novelette, barely a short story","review":"The entire story could have been told far better in 10 pages.Maybe less. But to get their 20 bucks, the author, editor and publisher pack in another 180 pages are pure fluff. As for the \\"secret\\", I'm sure everyone thought it had to be a little more a good deal more significant and surprising than it turned out. As the reviewer says above, the woman would rather do hard time than admit she can't read? I can see the sequel even now: woman kills self and rest of world because she's not online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book on a 16 hour flight to Thailand. I finished quickly, and what a waste it was. This book was boring as could be. There was only a few parts that were captivating. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Unberable Lightness","review":"This story, one which very well could have come form the imagination Milan Kundera, has the basic makings of a masterpiece. Unfortunately the author fails to make his point, can not offer the lyrical prose of a master and ends up instead with a trite, boring read. The characters are one dimensional and dull and the climax of the story leaves you wondering \`is that all?' Trust me stick with the proven master. Read Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being and leave The Reader where it belongs: on the bookshelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and the \\"big secret\\" is so silly!","review":"I can't decide if I am disappointed that it went by so fast because he could have put in a lot more interesting historical information. Or, I'm glad it was fast because it is so stupid! I expected Hanna's big secret to be something worse than being an SS officer, but it's not. The book is hastily written and there isn't much there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had so much potential","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. For a short novel, it ran too long with unnecessary details. I felt nothing with any of the characters. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reader","review":"This book will have a permanent space in my library - have already recommended it to my friends as a 'must read' book. It is profoundly moving. What an excellent teaching tool this would be for students, for history buffs, for anyone trying to define 'MORALITY'. I cannot remember the last book that had such an impact and felt so true to it's form. This is a book whose message goes past World War II, it is universal and expresses important thoughts without preaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book. Boring, predictable.","review":"How arrogant that her shame in being unable to read and write would be the premise of such a pitifull life. It is really almost sick and I too and surprised at Oprah - I have enjoyed almost all of her previous picks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring ....","review":"After all the hype about this book I expected much, much more. Usually I avoid all \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" books but I was so interested in a book that would cover the \\"digesting\\" of the Nazi past in Germany that I picked it up nevertheless. But it lived up to all my negative expectations of an \\"Oprah\\" book....First I thought it was the translation ... However it is the content that is not developed well or written well. Michael's realtionship with the woman is not believlable which is the center of the story. The reaction to the Nazi years and the Holocaus is superficial, simplistic, \\"unimaginative\\" and predictable, i.e. he is not writing it any differently than 100s before him. The word \\"transition\\" has not made it into his vocabulary. Character develelopment is limited. Very quick, boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty and unsatisfying","review":"This book has large type and is very short, and yet I almost did not take the time to finish it. It is as satisfying as Bridges of Madison County, another Oprah book, which is to say, not very satisfying. The main character falls in and out of relationships with extremely scanty character or plot development. This becomes quite evident from the beginning when the 15 year old boy and \\"woman twice his age\\" fall into bed together, without exchanging hardly a word. You would feel just as connected to a stranger who tells you his or her life story in 3 minutes or less. I never learned enough to care about any of the characters, and only finished the book because it is short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus and Meretricious","review":"The voice of this book, even in translation, is so compelling that it can almost blind you to the fact that the book, despite the kudos, is psychologically bogus to a repellent degree. Quite simply, despite all the window dressing about the joys of literature and reading, it posits that a guard at Auschwitz didn't know about the Holocaust and that she was more ashamed of being illiterate than of being a murderer. Having studied the Holocaust for over thirty years, taught Holocaust film and literature, written about the effects of the Holocaust on the \\"Second Generation,\\" most recently in a memoirMy Germany: A Jewish Writer Returns to the World His Parents Escaped, and even co-authored books about shame itself, I found this central conceit of the book unbelievable. Unfortunately, it seduced even Oprah, but then she has a history of being taken in by fakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the short amount of time it takes to read it","review":"I read this book in under 3 hours, simply because I just wanted to get it finished. I don't give up on a book, even one as awful as this.Truly, I sensed no emotion and very little depth. The story is not remotely interesting and the characters are nothing but names. It is completely dull and did not make me wonder once what was going to happen next. I could not have cared less.The people who find this book amazing and thought provoking and worthy of deep discussion are reading into things just aren't there, or even hinted at. There's just nothing to this story.Schlink, on pg 118, has the narrator referencing another book. Of it, he says, \\"It does not invite one to identify with it and makes no one sympathetic...\\" I smiled as soon as I read those words because he had just described his own book perfectly.Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better enjoyed in the past...","review":"I did not enjoy reading this novel. I would not have even picked up this book except for the fact that I am involved in a book club and this is what we were reading that week. Only a couple of us from the book club, enjoyed The Reader. The rest of us despised the character Hanna and felt that Michael was a very confused and simplistic character. The novel didn't seem to have purpose. I will admit though, that I am only a teenager and I think I will enjoy The Reader much more if I read it again in about fifteen to twenty years. I didn't enjoy reading this book, but I definitely understood it a lot better after I had finished reading it and I was looking back on the novel. If you are reading this book, you should finish it and then think back on what happened in it and what this novel was truly about. The Reader is more appealing in the past than in the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we lose something in the translation?","review":"I am puzzled by this book. The characters are cold and unyielding. The prose is spare and lucid, though many parts read like the narrator's soul-less observation or statement of facts without revealing or even hinting at his pain and troubles. What is about the war and Hannah in his childhood that made him the unfeeling and unloved adult? The Holocaust forms the background for much of the novel and Schlink does suggest the hidden psychological impact of the atrocities but if his intention is to tickle without eliciting any giggles then he has succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book, avoid it","review":"did you expect a book oprah told you to read to be good? probably not... here is another case of a book picked by her that is very _bad_. would have given it a zero rating, but there is no option to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"Had to read for book club but could not finish it, it centered around an older woman involved with a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and intimate exploration of morality","review":"\\"The Reader\\" feels like a Kubrick film - clinical and detached yet intimate and profoundly affecting. The sparse prose and rapid development allow for a quick read. Like many good novels, you spend much less time reading it than you do thinking about it afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable tour de force","review":"Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is a storyteller's masterpiece, featuring Homeric similes, profound psychological insights, memorable and fully developed and motivated characters who struggle with difficult ethical dilemmas, and unforgettable vignettes of the Holocaust, all told in simple, direct, unadorned prose. It is much more complex and nuanced than the movie that it inspired, and the fact that its author is a German professor of law dealing with Teutonic generational guilt renders its success all the more stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another average love story","review":"For me, The Reader was just another average love story that I read for class. Man falls in love, loses love, finds ex-lover again and falls in love again. The story, in my opinion, followed too much of a pre-set standard that has been seen in literature for years. There were a few good plot twists, and a good use of scenery, but overall I was disappointed. Another part of the novel that disappointed me was the lack of flow. The plot jumped around a lot, skipping what I felt were crucial years in the development of the protagonist. I was often baffled by the thoughts of the protagonist, and I felt that I got less out of the book because I could not see where he was coming from. The book also had a moral of sorts, and I hate morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in All","review":"Schlink does a good job of keeping the reader, in \\"The Reader\\" interested from the get go. From the beginning of the novel he talks about sex. Then he craftifully transforms to the more serious topics of love, war, death, the holocost, and court room actions to name a few. The novel has everything you need in todays Hollywood movie. I am actually surprised that it has not been made yet. I also like the shorter chapters to make it seem like the book is going along fast in time. This is another way Schlimk keeps the reader involved. When I read his novel I think of Anne Frank and all her turbulations she went through. I actully think that Schlink makes reference to her in his novel during the court room chapters. I love this novel and reccomend it for not only the novice reader like myself, but for more educated readers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"reading is FUNdamental","review":"When reading The Reader, the person reading the book is drawn into the story through the excessive use of sex, intrigue and sickness. How the author uses the vast age difference between the main charater and his \\"lover\\" in addition to the mode in which the two meet, leaves the audience mystified. after the intial shock, the pages begin to calm down, and things, like the main charater, micheal, grow distant yet closer still to his surroundings. As Micheal grows older and more mature, the audience, too, grows. In all, this is a very fast and easy read, any person mature and/or willing to see from a new perspective will greatly enjoy this book. The history used as a backdrop in the main plot will offer other books to be explored. Or, it will trigger the audience to discover more about the underlying subject. So, in a nut shell, I believe that I would recommend this book to all of my friends and associates to read for enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just a title","review":"I enjoyed The Reader because of Schlink's use of point-of-view. This novel, written in the first person, allows the reader to slip into the shoes of the characters.In places, the imagery and detail are somewhat lacking, and the reader finds him/herself a bit confused and yet unable to do anything about it. At the same time the reader sees Michael's inability to affect what's going on around him, and so the title has more significance as we relate that feeling to our own lives.It's not a difficult read, you could probably do the whole thing in one sitting. It's got sex, mystery, dirty little secrets, desire, and everything that we want to see now days."},{"rating":"1","title":"like an English assignment","review":"I found this book to be like an English assignment. It didn't flow from section to section and the characters felt undeveloped. I was disappointed when part one simply ended with Hannah going away. The trial section was equally as blunt. I never felt anything for the main characters.I would not recommend this book to a friend because it didn't seem like a finished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endearing but very sad","review":"The affair profoundly effected his life. We never realize how deeply we may effect someone else's life. This book was well written but overall I think it was a very sad story without a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reader","review":"This book was artfully and eloquently written. The author's use of simple language to express complex human emotions in Post WWII Germany is rather refreshing. There is a simple twist to the book that one might not expect, but the book does not go much in the way of suspense or even drama for that matter. It's a nice quick read for those blue rainy days at home when one reclines next to a window with fruit, tea, and chocolate...or not. However your preferred ambiance it's a nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"swift and entrancing","review":"I found 'The Reader' to be very addictive and quick. Before I knew it, I was well into the book. While the story is on some levels possibly disturbing, I found the overall effect to be more thought provoking. The writing is very economical and to the point. It conjures up images and feelings of love and lost and insecurity and wonder that everyone can relate to and grasp. In all it is a sombering tale of human nature that sticks in your head well after you've put the book down. I enjoyed it very very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going nowhere","review":"This book's concept is good, BUT the story does not develop. The characters are not developed and the more importantly the story does not develop well. You don't care about Hanna because you really don't know who she is. I couldn't understand why the narrator so tirelessly obsesses over this girl when we the reader has not had an opportunity to sympathesize for either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggled through it, but it did have one interesting moment","review":"Boy, the first part was bad. All about this teenage boy'ssexual awakening in the most clichéd terms. But in the 2nd part of thebook, when Hannah is being tried for Nazi war crimes, she explains that they were all under Hitler's orders and they themselves would have been killed if the orders weren't carried out. Then she turns to the judge and asks the crucial question of the book, \\"What would you have done?\\" And he has no answer for her. I think the people who said this book was about how terrible the Holocaust was, or how hard it is to love someone who has done something terrible, or how a boy's first love is never forgotten, all missed the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enticing, Exciting, Exactly what you've been waiting for.","review":"The Reader written by Bernhard Schlink is a historical fiction book about a young boy that falls in love with a woman who is double his age. When the story starts it explains how the main character, Michael Berg, meets a middle aged women when she helped him when he was sick one day. Once Michael is better he goes back to thank the women, Hanna, and from that moment on his life is never the same. Michael falls in love with Hanna and her womanly confidence but one day she oddly vanishes. Despite his efforts to move on, Hanna is always on the back of Michael's mind until one day when she randomly reappears.I would reccomend this book to someone that likes a story with twists. The story is short and very well written, it is an easy read. I liked that the book was based on historical events. The Reader is a love story with a wicked twist that you never even see coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought it would be an engaging story about a woman with a dark secret and a boy struggling to find his sexual identity. Was I wrong! This book is deceptive, in that it promises an engaging story but does not deliver. I was glad that I borrowed the audio tapes, becasue Campbell Scott's great voice kept me listening. I am not sure that I would have finished the novel otherwise. Oprah, please pick some more uplifing novels next year! I understand your choices of books that are supposed to make you think, but not put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a romance novel","review":"Thought this was a great book. The writer took on a difficult topic and managed to come out with a realistic story that didn't have the typical happy ending. (Sorry guys, it doesn't always happen). Maybe if you thought it so boring, you should go back to your romance novels, where there is no thinking involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great short summer read!!!!","review":"This book is definatly worth reading. It starts out very intersting with the hot love affair, which keeps you turning the pages. The middle did get somewhat boring, but things picked up again towards the end. The ending was vey unexpected!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great novel","review":"This book has the basic outline of a great novel/story. Unfortunately, it reads to me as a manuscript. Unfinished, and unexpanded. The story could have been developed more. The author didn't delve deeply enough into the characters or history. I was very disappointed by what should have been a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and monotonous","review":"I am a senior in high school and an avid reader. The first half of this book was enjoyable, but then it just got plain boring. Maybe it is my age or lack of interest, but I just ended up skimming the end because I wasn't about to give the time to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"When I first picked this book up, I thought this would be a real thought-provoking novel about the Holocaust. I was very disappointed and could not wait until I finished it so I move on to something more enjoyable. I thought the book lacked character development. What was worse, was the ending which left me feeling very unsettled. Even if I enjoyed this novel and wanted to recommend it, I would be too embarrased because of the sleazy relationship between the woman and the boy half her age."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzz","review":"I found myself skimming through much of \\"The Reader\\" just to finish the book.It was wrong of Hanna to take advantage of a young Michael. That whole scene disgusted me.The trial was dragged out and boring.I didn't feel for any of the characters in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sick Result of Gender Fascism","review":"If we really live in a world of true equality, then all the people who love this book should love the book of a male ex-SS soldier with no regrets for the atrocities he committed who commits statutory rape on a 15 year old girl before deserting her, leaving her miserable. Imagine the western world's response to that book, and then you have some idea of the gender fascism which rules the show there. I have respect for people who would like both books equally. But all others should seriously think about what has lead them to believe that men's crimes are worse than women's, that is, what has made them into sexual bigots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A criticism of an underlying theme","review":"I found \\"The Reader\\" to be a powerful,fascinating and disturbing book. The moral issues were very well presented. However, it seemed to me that there was a hint of an apology, an overly sympa- thetic attempt to explain away criminal behavior. the proposed notion that Hanna chose not to fight for her so-called \\"innocence\\" did not sit well with me. WHAT INNOCENCE! Hanna chose to join the SS. Hanna chose to allow the church full of women prisoners to burn to death. Illiteracy does not create criminal pathology. In our efforts to understand the criminal mind, we must not forget the eleven million people who perished nor in any way trivialize the enormity of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense and disturbing novel","review":"This is a novel that should be required reading for anybody who wants to learn about the German side of the Holocoust. Although the narrative didn't quite flow at times, Mr. Schlink's moral considerations are worth everything in the novel. The end of the novel is perhaps the saddest I've read in quite a long time, but it teaches a valuable lesson and brings some hope. It would be interesting to see a movie based on this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one needs to be told","review":"This is a deceptive story which leaves echoes, questions, perhaps doubt in one's mind long after the last page is turned.The style of translation slides along so well that it is hard to remember that it is from the German original. I wanted to have more, yet had there been more, it would have ruined that which we were priviledged to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"A judge of human behavior","review":"Bernhard Schlink is a lawyer and a practicing judge but he also is a man who knows the intricacy of human nature and behavior.The book can be divided in two parts and te firt could be a short story by itself. It is a boy's dream which is over when the object of his love suddenly dissapear. In the second part we find that Hanna had two secrets and we realized how a person can be good and bad at the same time and how an uneducated person can love good literaturae and appreciatte Tolstoy.There are some literary references such as Emilia Galotti that I would like to investigate. An excellent book , well written and full of psychological insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Another typical Oprah type book, regular snore which I couldn't even finish...I didn't see the point, as there was nothing captivating about this book at all. The characters and prose were dead as a door nail! So I went to the libray and returned it unfinished for a new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I found the concept superficial. Small book but didn't hold my interest even for that short amount of time. No depth to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I read this book because of the attention that it received from Oprah. I cannot believe how much they went on about this book. I found it very boring and lost my interest right from the beginning. Because of what I heard on Oprah I kept reading hoping it would get better but it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"I bought this book, hoping for a good read, but I definitely did not get that. It did not keep my attention; I didn't feel connected with the characters; I feel like I wasted my money on this one. The author assumes that the reader knows all about the Holocaust, making it difficult to understand to the person, like me, who was never taught the Holocaust in school. I very rarely come across a book that I feel so negatively about, but this is certainly one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was disgusting.........","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I felt very disgusted that I used my hard earned money for this. Who picked this book? Who wants to read about a woman having a fling with a young boy. I feel that a better book could have been chosen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, easy to guess the \\"secret\\", don't bother","review":"It was boring. It was easy to guess the secret. It wasn't gripping. I only finished it because it was our bookclub choice. 6 out of 6 of us thought it was awful. I read Sesame Street stories to my 3 year old son that have a better plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this a painful read! In the end, a waste of time.","review":"I read the book mostly because so many people were saying things about how offensive the affair between the 15 yr. old and the 36 yr. old were. I thought there had to be something of more merit than just a meaningless sexual encounter. But, in the end, I felt that this was graphic and meaningless. The characters were lifeless and seemed to have no value systems. They had no connection to each other or the world around them. It was rather sad and pathetic. I finished it, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't watch Jerry Springer and I don't like this book","review":"I am a thoughtful, avid and intelligent reader who does not watch daytime talk shows. I found this book boring, offensive and pointless. Don't be bullied into thinking that you are not intelligent if you do not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Selection","review":"This book was easy to read, but it was sort of boring. I only finished it because I bought it.I've been reading Oprah's pick since \\"I Know This Much Is True\\", and they have been good for the exception of \\"Jewel\\" and \\"The Reader\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a quick read, but the thoughts it provokes last long.","review":"There must be a Hanna in each of our lives in some way, whether she is the lover, the love lost, or the misunderstood. This book brings together so many different ideas--first love, social issues, moral issues, history. The story told here is too real to not be true, too possible to not be real. Though it is a quick and simple read, the messages it contains are profound and will last much longer than it takes to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah....don't know what the hoopla is about.","review":"Wish that I hadn't wasted my time reading this book...too many good books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, horrible ending","review":"Normally while reading a book you are drawn into the characters and sympathize with at least one of them. These character were badly written, you felt that even at the end of the book you knew nothing about them. And the trial, which I suppose was supposed to be the pivotal point in the novel, came from so far out in left field and with no explanation or logic. I felt let down after reading this, especially after all the praise Oprah had given it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, thought provoking, and intelectual....","review":"I picked up The Reader from a local bookstore yesterday and finished it late last night. I was moved by the story and found the themes of love, morality, and honesty universal. There were so many layers in this novel that I was amazed that he could relate so much in such a short read. He is very blunt and to the point, which made it an easy read, but the subject matter gave it a depth that astounded me. His style reminded me of Albert Camu because his discriptions were real and beautiful without being over-discriptive, but it exuded a dark optimism that is difficult to express."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"Once I started reading, I could not put it down. The author describes the complex relationship between Michael and Hanna in such a way you can almost tell what they are thinking and why. A different book that makes you think for a long time after you have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best example of post war Germany","review":"I read this book in one night. I thought that there was going to be a climax of sorts; that something amazing or unexpected would happen; nothing did. I didn't like the way the author portrayed the characters. I thought that the beginning of The Reader was good, but I didn't enjoy the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to read books this bad","review":"I read this accidentally. If I had known it was an Oprah book, I would have stayed away from it, but as it were, the copy that my sister had was without the telltale sticker. I finished it in one day, so the only positive thing I can see is that it's a quick read.The plot is silly, the writing (perhaps the translation?) is poor, and the characters are entirely unsympathetic. The narrator is despicably self-aware, and every action and word in the book is over-analyzed to the point where the one conclusion I was able to draw myself is that I made a bad decision at the bookshelf. There are so many wonderful and beautiful books out there -- please don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a terrible book! I wouldn't reccomend any of Oprah's books. It's very poorly written. The worst $15 I ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this book didn't say Oprah Book Club...","review":"Nobody would read it. I found the plot quite slow and boring. I wonder how much Bernie and Carol paid Oprah to recommend this book. I will no longer read her selections because it's obvious that she's getting paid to pick this slop. The main characters are shallow, and I didn't believe them. I would have been better off watching Springer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I thought the \\"surprise\\" toward the end was quite obvious from the very beginning and really not that intriguing. I also have a hard time empathizing with either character."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fool; Or you'll feel that way after reading this loser.","review":"I found The Reader to be unusually trite and effortlessly transparent. Apparently, the reasons for us to even care about this story get lost in the translation about 40 pages into the plot. The novel is but a pathetic attempt to shock the audience of readers into a page turning frenzy. However, it doesn't work. The plot is so apparent that within the first 75 pages you will find yourself belaboringly turning each page, just waiting for the author to admit truths that you've known for at least 40 pages. Unless you just have a dull afternoon to waste, don't bother! Instead, may I suggest that root canal that you've been putting off? I'm sure it will prove to be far more entertaining than this novel. I wish someone had warned me before I wasted my time. It's the last time I'll ever listen to Oprah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much more!","review":"Once I started it I finished it merely on principle. I thought the story was flat and lacked development and interaction between characters. It could have been so much more. There was absolutely no spark to this story. I think that too many of Oprah's book choices are zoomed up the best seller list strictly because of her name and not for the enjoyment factor of the story. I think this choice really misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic and trite","review":"the book was more hype than anything else. a trite representation of a young man's affair and an illiterate woman who took advantage of everyone she could. another example of the minimalization of the importance of the holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, horrible book!","review":"yay! another amazing (yeah right?!?!) book that operah \\"recommends\\" to be good. stay away from this bad writing! should get 0 stars, but there is no option for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, thought provoking.","review":"This book is Interesting holocaust story that moves very quickly. Gives you lots to ponder. Not as depressing as I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the book offerd a unique glimpse of some areas of the Holocaust, but the characters within the story come across as detached and with no emotional depth. Both Hanna and Michael seem like cardboard cutouts, and just totally disconnected. I think because of this, I was never invested in either of them and the anticipated 'love story' of the first chapter falls totally flat. Also the callous unemotional way Hanna behaves towards her young lover lets you know she is clearly broken, and a tregedy is yet to come. Her sudden departure was almost a given, as to me they never bonded in any real way. I also realised Hanna was probably illiterate from the start, so the big revealing 'secret' was a non-event."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reader: Outstanding book, fair translation","review":"This is a timely novel, during an age of awareness of the emotional impact upon a teen-ager of a sexual affair with an adult. This is not, I don't think, the main theme. That deals with the Nuremburg trials and the ambiguity of guilt when those without authority are left without orders in a confusing, unprecedented occasion.In my opinion, Oprah was right to choose this book. I first read it in a Spanish translation, then found out it was a book club selection and ordered it in English. I suspect the writing was better in German, but wholeheartedly recommend it nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and disconnected","review":"Reading this work, I had the feeling that Schlink had come up with several reasonably good ideas for short stories, but then unwisely decided to knit them together into a novel. The trouble is, they don't assemble well. The result is a contrived, stiff and disconnected effort, with the whole adding up to less than the sum of its parts. A failure, though briefly, here and there, an interesting failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline porno and can't believe Oprah picked this","review":"I was very disappointed in this Oprah selection. I did not enjoy the so called affair between a young teenage boy and a grown adult woman. The explicit description of the exploitation of an impressional adolescent child was uncalled for. I had a hard time reading the rest of the book and appreciating the rest of the story about this woman who had been a guard at a Nazi German camp. The details of their sexual encounters was unnecessary. Oprah should know that her audience is large and should be careful about the books she recommends. What if my young teenage son had decided to read this book because of her suggestion???"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst selections Oprah has made!","review":"I have read every book Oprah has selected and this was the absolute worst. Did not hold my interest at all. It was easy to tell it was translated from another language..very cardboard sounding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the hype I had heard about this book and the movie, the actual read was very disappointing. The writing was flat and 2-dimensional; it failed to involve me. The characters the same. They had no depth, no qualities to make me care about them or what happened to them. The \\"love\\" relationship was worse than superficial; it was manipulative and cold. It was all described in a distant sort of way; nothing was \\"shown.\\" I never felt I was pulled into a scene, into a character's feelings, or into any of the described emotions. I couldn't wait to reach the last page and get on to a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelming","review":"A searing novel of guilt and responsibility, The Reader has the relentless pace and stunning power of The Triumph and the Glory, unforgettable characters rivalling any in any of Oprah's recommended novels, and the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain. Thought-provoking, stark, yet fulfilling, this is a must-read novel for anyone with a conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent, wrenching and remarkable","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is a haunting work of fiction and a political allegory, as well. To appreciate the story, you need to understand the author's intent: to delve into the wounded post-war German soul and extricate the pain and guilt that is harbored there. The protagonists are not merely characters in an ill-fated romance; they are the embodiment of the German archetypes of obsession with absolute power, and slavish acquiescence to those who pursue and exercise that power. At every turn, the story reveals ethical and moral dilemmas that the characters have difficulty navigating; the search for truth leads them to difficult - and different - conclusions about what is required of them. This is a fascinating book that will intrique anyone with an interest in the history of WWII, philosophy, German culture, or the Holocaust. I recommend it for readers who are looking for a challenging experience with a work of literature. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflicted - both in content and theme","review":"This book is interesting in that the reviews are either 5 stars or 1-2 stars. People either love it or hate it - no middle of the road. I have read it once and will have to read it again before giving it an intelligent review. However, I think it is a book that everyone should read, just to gain their own opinion - it isn't something you should take someone else's opinion for. Kind of like \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" or \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" - you may not like the message or even enjoy the book - but you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, thoughtful and haunting novel.","review":"This book is beautifully rendered, poetic and philosophical. It provides a unusual perspective on Nazi Germany -- about the roles and impacts on ordinary people that makes you stop and think about the nature of evil. This is a book that helps go beyond cliched thinking. Good and evil are not black and white here. I read a lot of novels and this is one of the few this year I am recommending to everyone. I continue to be haunted by this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking depth, but still OK","review":"There are some books in which the characters are extremely loveable. They are intriguing, interesting, and I enjoy reading about them. This did not prove to be the case, and the book did not live up to my original expectations. I read the reviews, saw the little \\"Oprah\\" symbol, and excitedly bought the book. But I was extremely disappointed. This book was missing something. I'm not exactly sure if I know what. Even still, the overall plot was excellent, and I think the story COULD have been absolutely fabulous. I guess it was worthwhile to read this, though I know I have read much, much better books in my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and moving. A deeper understanding of life/love","review":"Wonderfullly written despite being transalated from German, Schlink provides us with a deeply captivating story of lifelong love, shame, anger and guilt. He writes with a personal voice, speaking his emotions with great detail. A book one must read; an exploration of elements which makes us human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast but not great read","review":"Fortunately you can finish this book in a couple of hours. If I'd had to spend more time on it I would have been VERY disappointed. It was an o.k. book but nothing to talk about. I won't be urging anyone I know to read it. I had been looking forward to reading it as the conversations about it on \\"Oprah\\" were interesting...much more so than the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reader is one to read","review":"This book took my breath away. The author does an excellent job of describing scenes, feelings, and events. The devotion, love and commitment that the main character has is unbelievable. This story of true love is told from the male perspective, which makes this book even more unique. At a young age he finds the love of his life and she remains in his heart even when she is not in his life. The events don't unfold as you may expect in a love story.....which is what makes this book so unforgettable. It really touched my soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves you with more questions than answers","review":"This is an easy read, I picked it up because I needed something easy to read after taking a lot of hard college courses. It moves very fast, and there's a big twist. A typical Oprah book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid but never received","review":"I submitted my order on 3/19, transfer of money was on 3/20. Delivery estimate: March 26, 2009 - April 10, 2009. It is now 4/23 and I still have not received my order. I have submitted a request to cancel my order along with a full credit. I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplaced morality","review":"I did not like this book, not because of the writer's style, but because of its contents. The protagonist has a moral dilemma because he once loved a woman who became an SS guard during Nazi Germany. This woman was on trial for the atrocities she committed. Since she was illiterate, the argument went, she could not properly defend herself. That sums up the protagonist's moral quandry. I'm reading the book wondering why someone would want to use ANY defense for the monsters of the Third Reich! There isn't a punishment on this earth harsh enough for them. The protagonist once loved this woman, now is trying to say that what she did wasn't as bad as it sounded in court. In my opinion, he is monstrous as well for loving such a cruel person in the first place. He further demonstrates what a selfish coward he is later in the book by how he conducted his marriage. I was generally disgusted by the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was very excited to start The Reader because I had heard such wonderful things about it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I found the relationship between Hanna, a grown woman, and a teenage boy really sick. Then when I saw how their relationship paralleled the relationship that Hanna had with the children in the concentration camps, I was even more disturbed. In addition, I did not find the book thought provoking, or educational as many other readers have. As I was reading I also felt that some of the lack of fluidity must be from the translation from German, which was more interesting to me than the story itself. As a side note, I read this book for a book club, and no one else enjoyed the book either."},{"rating":"1","title":"repugnant","review":"I find the three basic premises of this book so repugnant that I am blinded to any redeeming discussions of post-war German guilt. These premises are: (1.)the dysfunctional, abusive relationship that the young boy has with the older woman damages his ability to form relationships for rest of his life, (2.) the shame of being illiterate somehow excuses her from the horrors she perpetrated as a Nazi concentration camp guard, and (3.) treating the weak prisoners well before she selects them to be executed somehow mitigates her horrific crimes.I did not see Oprah, however, no amount of pontificating about \\"complex\\" and \\"profound literature\\" can get me past these basic tenets which are wrong, no matter how elegantly or passionately you spin the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quick read","review":"This is a quick book to read and worth reading. The issues in the book are not often addressed in novels, such as how the Germans dealt with the aftermath of World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reader","review":"I recently saw the movie that was based on the story with the same title. I really enjoyed the film version so I decided to order the book to see how close the film was to the book. I liked the book very much, it was easy to read and follow. It was amazing to see how close the producer could stay to the setting and pick the perfect caracters described in the book. However, books are usually much better at describing emotions and feelings, which could be experienced in this book as well. The story is a real mind breaker and you're not done thinking about it after finishing the book. You don't even know whose side you want to take, although it seems obvious from about half way through the book.If you want to dig up a little bit of the past, you should really consider reading the book, then see the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved reading this.","review":"This was such as great book. It's written in the voice of the teen boy (later on he's grown up). The narrative is really compelling as you see the dynamics between Michael and Hanna. Their relationship is very dysfunctional, but there definitely is chemistry there.You want to keep reading to find out about Hanna's past as she is very secretive about it. You also keep reading to find out more about Michael as he is greatly affected by Hanna--which you realize just how deep those effects run at the end of the book. You try to imagine how his life would have been had he not met her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading in the dark","review":"The story of Michael Berg and Hanna has great potential but Schlink failed to explore the emotive value of each character.I empathized with Hanna's naivete and illiteracy. Yet, it seems that her character was mystified to the point of a non-entity.When Hanna asks the judge \\"what would you have done?\\", Schlink fails to embrace this theme and give it substance. Throughout the book there is a sense of incongruency and lack of flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quick read","review":"An interesting read- I only wish that the author had delved deeper into the book's characters. We see them all through the eyes of Michael Berg, yet the author stops just shy of letting us fully understand them. This is particularly the case with Hanna. As much as I could comprehend the author's wish to keep her a mysterious object of Berg's affection, I felt that if I knew more about her- her drives and desires- I could relate more to their mutual attraction. Apart from the love story, this book is about guilt and forgiveness. We get a glimpse of what Berg feels, yet we're left hanging with regards to Hanna. How does she feel about the crime(s) that she has committed? This novel is a baby step shy of being great. Entertaining nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"soullful","review":"kudo to the German authur's soul searching masterpiece. has ayone seen a Janpanese being remorese about the horrible crimes that they commited in Asia or tring to do some soul searing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed this book and I'm glad I picked it up. It was entertaining and thought-provoking, but it did have a bit too much \\"telling\\" for my particular taste. Still, it was a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misdirected Emotion","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is not an easy read. No tbecause of length or difficulty, but because of disturbing subject matter and because, quite frankly, it is not very well written. Certainly the sunbject of guilt relating to the Holocaust is not new. How should those who stood by and did nothing atone for their silence; even worse, what about those willingly particpated in the atrocities of this dark period. Readers are faced with these issues, but given little to think about. It seems as though we are supposed to feel sorry for Hanna, but I just cannot. She is a reprehensible person; nothing can excuse her actions. Even her affair with Michael is nothing but a confused, ugly woman using a young man. Michael, too, is conflicted many years later when he discovers the truth about Hannah. He is sickened by what he knows, but his character seems to lose strength--in the end, he seems shallow. While the novel hopes to pose serious questions and raise thought-provoking issues, it does not succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlink Stinks","review":"Well, maybe he's not that bad, but it sort of rhymes. From the title of my review, one knows that I did not enjoy this book. Almost the entire time I was reading the book, I felt grey on the inside. Only when Michael begins recording his readings aloud for Hannah do I ever feel a little warmer to this story. I thought the book was predictable and simple. Hannah's \\"secret\\" was apparent to me after the first few hints.

Several years later, they meet again, in a courtroom where she is sentenced to life emprisonment for the crimes she commited as a guardian in a concentration camp. From there, his destiny will be the one of a whole generation of Germans who have to face the guilt and the shame of the horrors their parents commited."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch grass grow","review":"I started out with good expectations of this book.

Maybe I'm just not getting it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be ANY slower?","review":"I have very little free time to read books of pleasure and I am very disappointed that I chose this one to dive into.

Instead, it took him years to figure out what I knew on the bike ride and the historical context was just there to trigger all of the emotion that each reader brings with themself about the holocaust.

Oprah's Book Club is a wonderful idea, but I think that she missed the mark with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I identified with the \\"kids\\" relationship with Hanna. Great story. Anticipated yet surprise ending. Once I started I didn't put the book down until I finished. Worth reading again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written","review":"Highly unlikely. One could tell from the very beginning that this women could not read. I find it suspect that she kept her job. I know this can happen, but a conductor? Also, how strong she was througout the trial, how strong she was in learning to read and be a responsible leader in prison. And then, having gained a semblance of self-assurance, she killed herself...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opening tale of love and morality","review":"The novel focuses on the events of post-war Germany through the eyes of Michael Berg, who did not experience the holocaust first hand but must deal with the consequences of Hanna's actions. This is a compelling novel that everyone should read to understand what it was like growing up during the time period after WWII and learning how to deal with the knowledge of the atrocities of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I must admit, it took me a few chapters to get into the book. But after I did, I could not put it down. I can only describe the book as simplistic, but I mean that as a compliment in it's highest form.

Worst of all, it goes on and on, and the only bit of interesting history happens about 2/3rds through the movie. Skip this one!Julie"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader","review":"A dark, sad book.

THE REAL MEANING OF THE STORY MUST HAVE GOTTEN LOST IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophomoric","review":"For a book that gets as many positive comments as this one does, I had high hopes, which were quickly dashed. The writing is elementary, the characters poorly drawn. Melodramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped it would get better...","review":"...but it never did. The big secret was a let down, and the characters were void, \\"numb\\" was the word the author used. This book is alright for those who have a good imagination and can fill in the emotions and motives of the characters, but isn't that the writer's job? To be fair, there were a few pages in the book that should be read twice because they are quite profound (and there is also a need to get something for your time), but as a whole, the book may have lost itself in the translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of misses the holocaust, doesn't it?","review":"This book is about a woman who is willing to go to prison rather than own up to the fact she cannot read. I thought that was a little silly, especially when there were holocaust issues to consider. The whole book reminded me of that wonderful scene in \\"Life is Beautiful,\\" in which the German is interested in puns, and the Italian is interested in life and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to read","review":"Touching, very well written. You get very emotionally involved with the characters. I highly recommend it for anyone. Anyone who has anything negative to say about the book missed the point of what the author was trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A provocative treatment of sin and redemption","review":"Schlink's terse, strong writing provides an edgy counterpoint to his almost-parable of the conflicts of love and honor. The reader is dragged rather unwillingly into the discussion of how, and whether or not, one can provide one's own redemptive act to 'pay' society back. Our women's literature group was sharply divided on whether or not we 'liked' this book--but all agreed that it was important and provocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting plot, but disappointing in the end","review":"I was instantly intrigued by a summary I read in the paper of this book. I finally purchased it and immediately began reading. It was slow at first and I only kept reading b/c I thought it would pick up - but it didn't. There really was no climax and the ending was depressing. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great plot, but it did not live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"strong characters, thin beauty","review":"This book has several areas of lovely, gripping description. But neither the verbal beauty of the book nor its plot is powerful enough to hold the reader. The book's strength lies in its characters; both the narrator and Hanna are strong, unique people who shine through the sometimes-oversimplified language used to describe them. I think the readers who will get the most out of this book are the ones who can relate to the characters--to their personalities, their experiences, or their guilt--regardless of the inadequacies of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad story","review":"One gets weary of WW2 novels but this was clever. Young man meets an older lady and has a relationship that becomes part of his life and hers. Fast forward and back and the tale is complete. She is constant through their relationship. He waffles and stays close. His connection keeps him from developing as an adult male. She completes her journey through life. The main concern is that his voice never changes much as he grows older. She stays consistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad selection!!!!","review":"The Reader is one of the worst books I have every read. Part I was simply awful. Even though Anna could not read, she knew better than do such an awful thing. Part II was like reading for a history report. Part III was just as bad as the first. The poor kid was messed up for life.I have read a few of Oprah's selections, and this one is by far, the worst. I finished it ONLY because I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author fails to make you care about characters","review":"The book starts out promising and goes downhill fast. It was predictable. By the end I was just skimming, I didn't want to waste valuable reading time on such a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A needed reminder of how \\"numb\\" a society can become","review":"I have probably been exposed to about the same level of information about the holocaust as other readers of this book, including Elie Wiesel's books, Hollywood's take, Diary of Anne Frank, and a trip to see Dachau. I have heard about the \\"numbness\\" that allows a society to look the other way during the committing of atrocities and also about the \\"numbness\\" that overcomes the participants and allows them to go about their \\"work\\". This book does an excellent job in describing and emoting that numbness of the Germans. I was disappointed in the character development of the book. I did not get a sense of any real personal growth from either of the characters; other than the oft used learning to read in jail motif. I was extremely disappointed in the narrator's lack of development; maybe that is part of the numbness... I enjoyed the read and am thankful for the reiteration of the holocaust experience. This horror should never be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader","review":"I have just finished reading \\"The Reader\\" and must say, that I disagree with the previous reviews. I'm not a particularly well-read reader but found this book slow-paced and I nearly gave up on it several times. I also found \\"the secret\\" very obvious from the start and not a very believable or realistic reason as to why Hanna would take the blame for the wicked event which took place.Michael's behaviour during the trial was at times very frustrating and at the end of the book when he could have made amends he failed her again. I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone but value and appreciate other readers opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking.","review":"This emotional book is worth the read for its ability to make one think about the many issues that were layed out brilliantly: a young man and an older lover, his high social status versus her working class, his education versus her ignorance. Add to that the guilt that the new generation of Germans who had nothing to do with the Nazis are still faced with; the guilt that is the curse of their heritage.Schlink brings all of these points togther for a fascinating and emotional book through the poignant characters of Michael and Hanna.Although the translation creates stilted reading (thus 4 stars and not 5), I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah is a hack.","review":"I haven't read this book yet, but I never will because it's on Oprah's Book club. All these books ride on the success of Oprah's name. They all stink. We need to stop reading these retarded books and giving Oprah all this power. I might have to start my own book club. So there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disturbing book for me.","review":"I found the subject of a young man having an affair with an older woman disturbing. There was too much focus on the affair, and not enough on the real story; the woman's involvement in the Hitler times. This is the first Oprah pick I have not liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just potatoes ---- no meat. Disappointing.","review":"I expected more from an Oprah pick of the month book. There was a beginning and an end, but no middle. I found it boring, but then, I found Bridges of Madison County boring. So if you liked that book, then buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Moving","review":"The Reader captivated me from the outset and never let go. It is one of the most moving books I've ever read. It's also the only book that my book club has unanimously loved in the 2 years that we've been meeting. I can't imagine anyone not feeling as if they've learned something valuable about human nature after reading it. If you only read one book this year, make it The Reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anorectic plot, weak characters, limp writing.","review":"Perhaps it lost something in the translation? This book could have been a decent short story but unfortunately it just dragged on and on. The characters were flat and unpolished. The message was merely whispered, and almost lost entirely in the cliche romance. This book failed to evoke any emotion, and the ideas behind it seemed unfinished and confused. The holocaustic backdrop seems to be more of a commercial hype machine than anything necessary for the progress of the story. This is one of those books you might pick up at the airport and finish only because your flight is long. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and pointless.","review":"Maybe it's the translation, but what was the point of this book? It struck me as entirely superficial. The one interesting point raised is how the generation after the Nazis felt, and how they coped, and it is glossed over and dropped.Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different story line provokes thinking","review":"I bought this book because it is an Oprah book and it was on the bestseller's list. I am glad I did. The story line is like none I have ever read before. It made me think what I would have done in the subject's shoes. It was worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close to reality for fiction","review":"Schlink spoke so movingly, the story so close to his heart, I felt that this read must be more reality than fiction. Ending the only way possible, sustaining the continuum of pain throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid, Seductive","review":"The Reader, by Bernard Schlink, is a powerful tale of love, friendship and secrets. I was amazed on how Schlink was able to evoke imagery and range of depth in such a succinct fashion, while not sacrificing believability and humanity in the characters; I was sad to say good bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed by this book. It might have worked better for me as a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick Holocuast Denial - Antisemitism Not Mentioned","review":"Has nobody noticed that Bernard Schlink gets away with a very smooth trick in these pages - never once mentions antisemitism as a cause of the holocaust? Incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reader","review":"I have to say that I really did not enjoy this book. Thankfully, it was very short. I do think that it has alot of good writing in it, I just never got pulled in to the story and never really connected with the characters. I also thought that it was quite predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tawdry story, poor literature","review":"My son had to read this for an English course, and I read it as well.My verdict: I told the English department to drop it from the syllabus (and they said they would). It's a tawdry story from post-Christian Germany of underage sex of a teenage boy and middle-aged woman (with the kid's parents totally in the dark about their son's life, and how he was being polluted).And what does one get for enduring the depressing tale? There's nothing spectacular from a literary view in the telling of the story, and the conclusion is nothing more than a one-liner punchline.Two thumbs down. I don't recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another book","review":"A different perspective of German life during WWII but not done well at all - Stones from the River was so much better and not as predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"every boys dream/nightmare","review":"a mrs robinson of sorts. a fast and enjoyable read , the fist part bringing back memories of boyhood dreams ,the second half bringing the tragidy of lifes realities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb entertainment -- tears streamed!","review":"Each page there was a turn, and in directions I wasn't expecting to explore.

I was interested in the beginning during the initial meeting of Michael and Hanna, but it went down hill from there. And Hanna would rather rot in prision than reveal her awful secret (illiteracy) but revealed it in the end to the warden? And how would we react if Hanna was 15 and Michael was 36? At least it was a short read."},{"rating":"1","title":"short but long read","review":"Everyone suggested that it was a real quick read-short in length and you can't put it down. Well, I had a hard time picking it UP!!! I despised Hanna even before her past was exposed. The book was hard to get through but I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. I found it very disappointing!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I am from England and grew up with a different view of the Germans and the war(Schooling and peers). I found it very interesting to get a \\"German\\" view, be it fiction or not. I enjoyed the book and I would be interested to read more of Mr. Schlinks work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a predictable read","review":"As one reviewer stated, this is really 4 books. I would give the first 3 1* and the last 3*. Who couldn't figure out early that Hanna couldn't read? Isn't it widely known that when an adolescent has sex with a mature adult, that adolescent will eventually have severe psychological problems? And, I found Hanna's desire to hide her problem at all costs to be unbelievable. And, for someone like Michael who let his life revolve around his affair with Hanna, and then to not \\"rescue\\" her or contact her in prison, well, it just didn't jell. I just didn't care about the book and I certainly didn't have any feeling for Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book did not take me anywhere.","review":"While I was captured by the beginning of The Reader, I soon found myself longing to put it down, and had to force myself to finish. When I did, I realized why. When finished, the reader hasn't learned any lessons, there was nothing to take with you. I wasn't sure what the story's moral was, nor was I sure that I wanted to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had great expectations for this book, as it was an Oprah book selection and dealt with a subject that I find intriguing--the Holocaust and the concentration camps. However, I could not get into this book. I didn't think Hanna's character was developed enough, and I just couldn't get into the main character at all. It was mildly entertaining, but that's the most I can say for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illiteracy is bad","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The early scenes when the young Michael was with Hanna were good; afterward the story just had too much telling, not enough showing. In the end the book just felt like a public service announcement against illiteracy. If you don't learn to read, this is what will happen to you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good points and bad points.","review":"The \\"Reader\\" was the first book i read out of the Oprah Book CLub, and i must say it impressed me enough to read more. However, once i read another from the famed club, i realized this book was only mediocore. It was a very simple read. The kind of book you could put down for a months time (which i did), then come back to it. Now i will say that i couldn't just stop reading the novel, i had to finish it. The first part of the novel was very well written in aspects of storyline. In characterization, it was not all that good. I didn't have any feelings or emotions for the characters, none at all. It was just a simple story to keep me busy when i had nothing to do. Now if you want a REALLY good book for the club, try \\"House Of Sand and Fog\\", by ANdre DubusIII, that book was an amazing read, however the ending left you hanging and you will want to know so much more about the characters. It was still an extrodinary book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very moving story","review":"The Reader, this was an amazing story, not the easiest of reads but if flowed well for me even though. It was a thinker,one you really wanted to think about what you were reading and how it pertained to you or your life experiences. What would you do? Type questions. It was a moving story well written and put together just right for the reader. I was satisfied with the ending for myself and for the characters of the story. I would most diffidently recommend this to everyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Going into this book I had no idea what it was about. I am very happy i read it.

I cant wait to see the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"modern\\" approach to Holocaust","review":"Being in my end 20s and German at the same time I found this book a very valuable and new approach to the Holocaust history. It reflects emotions and feelings of our young German generation that is still struggeling with the history of their parents/grandparents. Schlink is able to look at the history from a different angle with a modern approach, bringing together the young generation that is not to blame with the generation that is to be hold responsible. Presenting those two generations in a couple of lovers and adding an age difference of the \\"other\\" way (the man being much younger than the women) makes this book remarkable, rich in diversity and definetly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in The Reader","review":"I have to admit to reading this book due to the movie hype I have seen recently of it. That said, I'm certain this will be one of the rare instances we find the movie to be better than the book.While the story line had such promise, the principals are obviously wounded but boring. Character development would have made this so much more interesting and a little more tutiludge of the era would have drawn us into the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me old fashioned...","review":"I just finished The Reader and really enjoyed it. BUT could he really have spent his whole life agonizing over a woman twice his age that he lost his virginity to at age 15? He worries that he loved someone who could commit a horrible crime but never realizes that she couldn't have been a very moral person to seduce him in the first place. He never loved her - it was simply schoolboy lust. He didn't even know her and she never called him anything but kid. Obviously he knew the relationship was wrong because he never told anyone about it, yet he allowed it to completely dominate his life. That was sad, but add the Holocaust into the mix and Hannah becomes a complete B----! I found myself wanting to slap some sense into that \\"kid\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unispired storytelling.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

You can't wait to see what will happen next in the character's relationship. Anyone that reads this novel will enjoy it. There are many very powerful themes throughout it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I really disliked this book. This was described as a book which you could read in two nights yet it would haunt you for weeks afterwards. It took me many more than two nights to plod through this book. I thought the style was extremely dull and difficult to get through. The only thing that haunted me about this book was how truly bad it was. The character of Hanna as a war criminal turned child molester who jeopardizes her own trial because she doesn't want to expose her lame secret is supposed to provoke deep thoughts and discussions? Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wished this book were longer.","review":"I read this book in one sitting! It held me captive. The young boys relationship with the older woman at the beginning of the book was written beautifly. It set me up perfectly for the rest of the story. It's been a long time since a story has brought me to tears.... this one did. I especially enjoyed it because it didn't have a \\"Hollywood\\" plot or ending, it spoke more of real life where things don't always go the way we'd like. It touched on alot of moral and ethical issues without deciding the answers for me.....I appreciated that. It made me THINK and that is a wonderful gift to get from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...","review":"The writing was very simple, however it seems like some things might have gotten mixed up in the translation at times. It was interesting in a kind of \\"passing the time\\" kind of way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing, Dismal Tale","review":"I did not enjoy reading The Reader for several reasons. I'm usually attracted to very strong characters, and the boy/law student allowed himself to be a victim throughout the story. He allowed his teenage affair with Hannah to affect his whole life. I couldn't respect his attitudes.I thought that Hannah would be the strong character. She endured prison and overcame her illiteracy, but then killed herself at the very moment her life could have begun.I hate to call a book a waste of time, but this was close to it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is vehicle for important message","review":"The author makes important points about responsibility to other people.

It certainly didn't pull on my heartstrings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Has Changed My Mind About Reading Fiction","review":"I am normally a non-fiction reader. This novel may bring me back to fiction. I basically agree with all the 4-5 star reviews, so I won't repeat. This novel is divided into three books. Book 1 was what I deem a typical novel with alot of sex. Book 2 explored some important moral issues (predominantly Germany during and after WWII). Book 3 completely overwhelmed me, and is the reason I am submitting my comments. Although I would rate the first two books three stars, the third book was a strong 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story abbsolutely captivates the reader!","review":"I enjoyed this book. The ending wasn't the climax I expected, but it was still very thought provoking. The story shows how naive and strong people can be through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"tremendous and disturbing","review":"I could't put this book down. The imagery Michael presents of his memories with Hanna--juxtaposed with the realities of who she really was--allows us to consider our own frailties and our own ideas of both who and what we are. What is real? How do we cope? Michael's discussion with a man who justifies his involvement in WWII continues the underlying dichotomy--what is the manner in which we would have behaved under the same circumstances? What would you have done? The moral dilemmas stay with me. The characters and theme are reminiscent of Camus' The Stranger. I was thankful for the sparse yet powerful language. It allowed me to ruminate on what occurred without telling me how. A disturbing and intriguing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An important and well written book. However, VERY boring.","review":"This book has a very important message and is extremely well written. I loved the author's style which is simple and not overly wordy. However, I did not like a single character that I met in this book. Perhaps that was intentional. The whole time I was reading it I had to ask myself why I didn't just put it down. It's a book that must be finished. It is important. It's just not entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlink's novel perdictable and rarely 'tackles' the isssues","review":"I started reading 'the reader' with great enthusiam. I found that the writing style was clunky and overly simple. I had trubles reading and continuing to read the book because of this. I thought that Schlink asks many interesting and moraly devastating questions to the character's and to the readers but it never eally answers them. The book is very predictable and overly simple. Skip this one it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tale of young lust and an older woman's secret","review":"I thought the book started well, telling the story of the boy and his relationship with this German woman. Once the affair ended, the story was lost in what he experiences in law school and how he finds out what happened to the woman after he last saw her.They never talked again. It took forever to get to the point of the book and her secret.It was a good story that could've been exploited better in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A peculiar, disturbing, psychological study","review":"A thoughtful, philosophical account of a marring, coming-of-age sexual experience. Although the translation is wanting at times, THE READER forgiveness, shame, sexual passion, diminished self-esteem among a few. The illiteracy explanation, however, is weak. Given the time and setting, not being able to read was neither as uncommon nor as embarrassing as it may be today. It is also an unconvincing reason for Hannah's behavior. Nevertheless, it does serve to further weaken Hannah's character making her even less likeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intense Story","review":"I loved this short little book which brings up so many deep questions about life. A 15-year old is not emotionally mature enough to cope with such an intense relationship and will more than likely be affected for the rest of his life. How well do you know the people you become involved with? Is it wrong to love someone who has done bad things in the past? Do we ever really \\"get over\\" anything? And how true, the last chapter is. Whenever I cry for any little thing, I cry for the unhealed emotional wounds of the past. I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"keen on feelings","review":"This is one of the books that just embrace you in the time that story is told, with considerable amount of subtile emotions which probably has erupted only from author's private life. Life of Hannah is itself very interesting, but story of passion between young boy and older women which can be lock only in their private little own world is a sensitive story which last all life. Story explains in melanholic matter how early experiences are very important for adult life, no matter how long are lasting, just to have very strong emotional impact. The book says one impotant thing about our life, that little, tiny moments, matters in our life are important to us, on which we reconcile with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, beautiful read","review":"Having seen the movie first, I did find it hard to make myself continue reading into the last half of the book (knowing what was coming).

I couldn't figure out if it was the translation or the writing. I felt that there was little description, very little dialogue and was simply telling the story - without much passion. That's why I was so surprised by the end of the book. The strength of the story itself touched me and made me think about the narrative and the issues contained therein long after setting the book aside.

We all know why, and we all agree. Of course - great novels can appear in the context of postmodern American Literature, but they don't necessarily make a great read.Schlink does it with his modesty and understatement.And one more thing: THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT HOLOCAUST. The author had chosen the Poles to be the victims in this book - please respect it. 3.000.000 Poles (besides another 3.000.000 Jewish citizens of Poland) died from German atrocities during WWII - and when one uses the word Holocaust it denies them the right to memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"El más premiado de toda su carrera en una versión muy especial!!!","review":"Saludos!

There is even a separate list of books for children (although adults could benefit from reading some of these as well).

There is a reason NBC just bought 66% of Xoom and Yahoo paid $4.7 billion for GeoCities.

Packard gives a country by country view in a concise chronology. Packard is not an appologist for any of these countries and in light of the controversy regarding Switzerland's role during the war it's very timely. Packard provides great insight into how precarious the situation was for all five countries in light of the presure from not only the Axis powers but the Allies. Packard touches on some of the complicity between Sweden, Switzerland and Spain with regard to the Germans but fails to delve in too deeply. It's a shame this was written before the Swiss controversy became more public, but in fairness that's a book in itself. The thumbnail sketches of the principals shows they were truly equals of Machiavelli and learned how to survive in precarious times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic mix of songs from a musical master","review":"Johnny Cash drew inspiration from a wide variey of sources, as the recordings on this CD prove.

The way the earliest women runners dressed (Carol Brady blouses and beehive hairdos) almost merit another star in itself. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Uta Pippig, the German champion featured on the cover, was later stripped of many of her awards when it was discovered that she used performance-enhancing drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bench, lat tower works well","review":"This is a budget bench, with some inexpensive construction, but it seems solid and the lat tower (the main reason I bought it) works very nicely. It was fairly easy to assemble. I'm pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's okay...","review":"It's an okay product. It's cheaply made and you have to be creative to make it work.- Forget about the leg extension attachment, it sits to low to the ground and you will not be able to add any weight to it.- The bench back does not sit flat completely, is permanently tilted down.- You may want to bolt it to the ground, is shaky and if you put too much weight on it it feels sometime the whole thing is going to tip over.Be creative when working out and don't expect the thing to be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good olympic weight bench","review":"It is a good sturdy bench. The instructions to put it together were difficult to follow. Also, make sure that the ceiling clearance for the lat bar is enough. The coustmer service for this product was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BENCH! SCAM","review":"this is a total scam. the only thing that is functional on this is flat bench. even with 10 pounds on the lat pull down it dosnt work. the incline is the biggest joke. once on incline the bar sits about 2 feet behind your head and there is no way to pick it up. in the picture it shows the perches on the highest setting but in real life if its that high you will not be able to reach the bar. this whole bench is a sales gimmick. it looks very appealing but is none functional. do not purcahse this product or you will be very unhappy with the end result. i will be taking it apart and sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Brilliance...Mesmerizing Musical Power","review":"This CD has some great music on it. The songs build and capture the listener right away. Like Opeth, they have the harsh vocals with the non-harsh and it makes for an overall powerful musical experience. The vocalization does not hit the heights of the great Opeth. But, the music surpasses Opeth because it creates more powerful, breathtaking, beautiful atmospheres. This band is worth checking out-high quality musicianship throughout. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This year's best so far by some distance.","review":"Plaintive riffs and passages are seamlessly integrated into the music, much unlike Opeth, which always feels artificial in its acoustic-death dynamic. Dynamic and complete command of melody, vocals take some getting used to.Yes, this is superior to Opeth. Folk death metal with post rock people! Sort of like all you can eat, except with a Michelin chef behind the counter! The first (and hopefully not the last) true masterpiece of 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noticable improvement in brake feel","review":"I installed these after a few weeks with new front rotors and EBC YellowStuff pads on our 2010 Odyssey, and they had a noticable improvement in the bite of the brakes, providing more confident braking. I had intially hoped just replacing the fronts would do the trick, but the addition of the rear pads was well worth it.Install was easy, took maybe a half hour from start to finish. I did not replace the OEM rotors, and have had no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magneatos Nice, but Weak - really cannot use for construction","review":"We bought the set for our grandson for Christmas. We were impressed with quantity and quality of the parts - that met all expectations. But when you go to build something with it, the magnetic force is so weak that it just falls down - a real bummer and a disappointment. So you are limited to single dimension construction, flat on the carpet, and cannot go up even a single layer without real engineering skill to construct trusses to totally reinforce the structure. Even then, a slight touch brings everything down. And it seemed like such a neat idea...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this toy for my 5 and 3 year olds. I thought it was a great educational and fun toy since my kids like building toys but unfortunately the magnetic strength is so weak that the slightest bump and the whole construct collapses. I'm very disappointed. I can't imagine how a company that makes a toy based on magnetic strength fails to make it strong enough to do what it claims. I feel like I've been tricked into giving my money away for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magneatos is an excellent product","review":"It is a nice toy for kids, they love it. Kids play and have fun building things. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wore out first copy; purchasing a new one","review":"As a writer of fiction who bases work on Greek mythology, this is my most frequently consulted reference. Graves focuses on the sources of the myths as well as the myths themselves, puts them into context with contemporary culture and history, and also puts them into context with each other. The index, maps, cross-references, and the organization of the book as a whole are invaluable to me as a writer and a student of Greek and Roman mythology. Graves' writing is precise and evocative, as well. I've underlined, dog-eared, and completely worn out my first copy and will be purchasing a second for more \\"casual\\" reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Second half of Greek mythology reference and stories.A swashbuckling adventure story writer Graves most certainly wasn't, but that didn't stop me reading this many times. Of course, in a more reference oriented version as this there are many, many notes etc. to let you delve into this as deeply as you like. The second part is not quite as interesting as the first.3.5 out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could go either way","review":"This is not a book to read for fun. It is packed with interesting and useful pieces of information but it fails to present itself as an accessable work by its dense, uninteresting narrative style.An essential if Mythology is your 'thing', but this is not for faint of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long and BORING!","review":"This book should be thought of strictly as a reference. It would be beneficial to someone taking a course in mythology, but is a very bland read. It is organized in an unusual fashion. First it presents the myth and follows it with a section that describes the myth paragraph by paragraph. If you are looking for flowing stories that will enrich your Greek mythology trivia knowledge check out Edith Hamilton's, Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul and Underworld","review":"Much good stuff has been said about this book, right here on this page, so I would like to focus on just one important aspect: Graves's treatment of the Underworld. Here, for the first time in history, as far as I know, the author provides a genuine \\"map\\" of that dark realm, complete with Who judges Europeans, Asians and others, along with a superb description of the three roads of Hekate, the real ruler of the Three Realms -- Heaven, Earth, and Underworld -- a magnificent opus not to be intellectualized but felt in the heart, the Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Condition better than described","review":"The condition was listed as some light wear but I didn't see any. I think it's more Like-New... that's a nice problem to have! I bought this so my daughter could keep a copy at home instead of adding to the weight of her already heavy backpack. The only drawback, which was minor, had to do with the communication involved in shipping. The amazon site quoted a longer ship time that did not reflect the rush shipping I paid extra for. The Seller was able to give me a tracking number however, which the amazon site said \\"wasn't available\\". If you have any questions, just ask the Seller for shipping info and they'll provide it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Thomas Perry's usual high standards","review":"Robert Mallon, in his forties and retired in affluence for ten years, is stolling along a beach near his home in Santa Barbara, California. He sees a young woman enter the water and not return. He proceeds to save her from drowning. In the few subsequent hours, they develope a relationship. However, the next day, Mallon hears of the young woman's death. He wonders what drove her to suicide and looks into her past. He hires a friend, PI Lydia Marks, to look into this stranger's death. They soon find themselves up against a network of assasins run by a paramilitary leader named Parrish. He inexplicably begins to hunt Mallon in a game to the death.DEAD AIM is one of the weakest novels written by Thomas Perry in years. The plot lacks any real basis in reality. Mallon is a less than inspirational hero which leads to a lack of reader empathy. Stereotypic characters abound in this predictable and silly tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It seems that I'm always at odds with general population. If everyone likes something its a sure sign that I won't. Contrary to the lukewarm reviews, this is a very suspensful book. The ending was rather unbelivable for my taste but still this was hard to put down.(well, at least for me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Aim, and Spot On ... as usual.","review":"My Holy Trinity is Thomas Perry, Sue Grafton, and Dick Francis. (And for pure charm, the Laurie R. King's Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell books.)Thomas Perry, writing his fast-paced, twisty-turny mystery books, seems never to miss the mark. I always groan when I find another one, as it means I won't get any sleep that night. It's a real problem.Dead Aim keeps driving forward. Thomas Perry is especially interesting in that in some books he goes into the psyche of some truly bad guys. And the scary thing is ... we go right along with him. This is one of those books, and both the good guy and the bad guy are, as usual, fascinating.I personally hope Thomas Perry lives to be 128, and writes until the day he drops. No mercy for Thomas Perry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Aim","review":"See book summary above.An invigorating and tightly written novel that you've come to expect from Thomas Perry, with a couple exceptions.The character of Robert Mallon was indeed shallow. Was his obsession with the suicide victim because of their brief love-making/loneliness or was it because of his sister's suicide years previous. One is never really sure.And where the heck did this guy at the end come from? Sure his name was Mallon but no where did I see his nickname as 'First Blood' Mallon.An overall entertaining novel with a couple flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great audio book!","review":"\\"Spy Killer\\" is a classic L. Ron Hubbard story from 1936. Published prior to the wave of espionage novels inspired by Eric Ambler's \\"A Coffin for Dimitrios\\" in 1939, Hubbard had anticipated the espionage genre's popularity with this startling tale. \\"Spy Killer\\" is a well-written thriller, and readers will encounter the mysterious Russian woman Varinka Savischna. Hubbard's blazing talent is evident in beautiful lines like this: \\"The steam that rose from her cup of tea was not less elusive than the quality of her eyes.\\" The audio book is outstanding. Each audio book features a multicast performance with music and sound effects reminiscent of radio's golden age. Starring the voice talent of Lori Jablons and featuring R. F. Daley, Shane Johnson, Jim Meskimen, and Tait Ruppert, \\"Spy Killer\\" is the perfect audio adventure when your driving long distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy Killer","review":"This is a great story from the days of the pulps.I've never read them before and so far all of thestories I've read are great!

Honestly, after the 1st chapter I was having doubts but from then on I was on the edge of my seat. This is a harrowing spy thriller that can be enjoyed by all. It is also proof that cursing and gratuitous sex is not required for an exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old pulp fiction","review":"Don't expect a lot from this simple linear story. The final twist in the tale is a bit contrived but its overall a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Audio Book","review":"I have several of these audio books. They are not the average dry monotone reading that I hear with many audio books. These books remind me of the radio shows from this same period that these stories were written, complete with sound effects and acting. I listen in my car traveling back and forth to work. Sometimes I have a hard time getting out of the car. These books are a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see the charm","review":"Perhaps I do not understand the charm behind pulp fiction but I found this story predictable and ultimately not very satisfying a read. As far as short stories go perhaps this was exciting for the times but it has not held up very well over the decades. I downloaded this story during one of Kindle's promotional periods when it was free, so I cannot complain; however, I now know not to pay for material written by L. Ron Hubbard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Jason Bourne there was Kurt Reid....","review":"Take the non-stop action of Indiana Jones, the have-to-find-out what happens next intrigue of Clive Cussler, the Bondesque \\"super-spy\\" of Ian Fleming's entire James Bond series, roll it all into one and add a larger-than-life femme-fatal that could only otherwise be found in movies like Angelina Jolie's \\"Salt\\" and you have, rolled together in one rollicking pulp adventure, Spy Killer by L. Ron Hubbard. I only wish they had more clean fun available today instead of the cookie-cutter quote unquote action movies they crank out of today's box offices which oftentimes seem to feature more gratuitous sex and violence than just a good story, and wind up covering up an otherwise poor writing job. Hubbard didn't seem to need any of that to write a darn good yarn which I would recommend to readers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace Oriental Thriller","review":"This Story is one of my favourites of the whole pulp fiction era. It's a truly exciting story of an American sailor getting into all sorts of trouble in pre-WWII China, involving espionage and two beautiful women. This fiction smacks of the same DNA that Spielberg created Indiana Jones from 40 years later. A gripping tale told by a brilliant author who was personally very familiar with the Orient. And a beautifully presented reissue. Check this out and then move on to the whole of the \\"Stories From the Golden Age\\" series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy Killer Hubbard","review":"I purchased the Spy Killer book from L.
