Jose Ramon Fernandez, the commander of the Cuban armed forces at Playa Giron, the scene of the invasion explains step by step how the recently formed militias of Cuban workers and peasants vanquished a 1500 strong mercenary force backed by the U.S. military. He reveals key decisions that were made by the Cuban central command, for example, the decision to send the small Cuban airforce to bomb the U.S. supply ships stranding and demoralizing the landing units. The book contains an inciteful speech by Fidel Castro which helps to explain how the U.S. government not only conceived and gave birth to the invasion but then denied paternity. As with other Pathfinder books, this one has deeply revealing photos, maps, illustrations, glossary and chronology. You'll have a hard time putting the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read til the Sun went down","review":"I first read this book the first day of beach season. Instead of spending time in the water, I just sat there and read this book until it was too dark to read. This account is an activist account of the fight from Cuban and US fighters who see and saw the US invasion and resistance in Cuba and the United States not as history to be deciphered but part of an ongoing struggle against imperialism, against war, and for the power of working people. I never stopped caring; I never stopped seeing what was hidden from me in 1961, I never stopped seeing lessons for the future. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?!","review":"Only those with a masochistic penchant for unadulterated, hyperbolic propaganda will enjoy reading this book.

The title by itself is laughable. Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so? As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess. For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's \\"Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story.\\" Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best","review":"Though many of the songs we rocked to in the 70's and 80's are here, this is a sort of \\" volume II\\". The\\" Best of\\" is out there and contains their more commercially successfull tunes. Personally I prefer \\"The Rest\\"... it's far more consistent. Neverless neither album does any justice to the band. If you can find them start with \\"Lights out\\" and \\"Obcession\\" and go from there. If you have no desire to spend the dollars or try to locate the originals - these albums will do nicely.

As I was reading, I just KNEW who really killed Vincie's father/the hard working farmer. And then I started realizing it wasn't that person but I was then thinking: PLEASE DON'T BE THIS PERSON! And the anguish that pour Vincie was going though wondering why and who could have done this.

I know these kind of colections exist, and I wish I could get my hands on them! This book is nice for the what if possabilities. Most of us will never live out these fantasies, so the next best thing is to live them in a well written Black Lace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing much new here......","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much from behind the scenes with Mr. Reagan. It just wasn't much new in this for me. Very little said about the many interesting events in Mr. Reagan's Presidency. Very little about the encounter with Gorbechev in Reykjevik, nothing about the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, the Berlin speech, nothing about the Challenger disaster. It just didn't do it for me. Somehow I think Mr. Deaver missed a great opportunity here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First, this book doesn't take long to read. You can sit down and read this book in several hours.Which is probably the amount of time Deaver took to write (or dictate) the book.This book has no depth of any kind.Reagan-lovers will find there are no \\"new\\" stories, nor unexpected revelations.Reagan-haters will find the book utterly devoid of any meaningful content.I am quite fond of Reagan, and was disappointed there was not more here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of Fluff","review":"In the interest of disclosure. I was a supporter of Ronald Reagan and had a great deal of respect for the man.One the other hand this book seems like a job of fluff meant to eradicate Michael Deaver's economic misfortunes.I don't blame Mr Deaver for trying but he really doesn't deliver much more than a press secretary would offer about a person he admires. We don't get a good inside look. Just undying admiration.It's simply not worth the cover price"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book- enjoyable without being pure political","review":"I liked how this was a personal story of the Reagans. You got to understand where they were coming from, and why they acted the way they did. Not being a huge political freak, I wanted to know about the man, and this book gave good insight into the Reagans. There were a couple of really good quotes that I will always remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gipper Deserves Better","review":"For the millions of us who admire Ronald Reagan -- the man and the leader -- this book is deeply disappointing. On a macro level, it offers no new insights and dwells only on the conventional, well-trodden wisdom of why Reagan was perceived as aloof and mysterious. It is superficial and self-serving.On a more micro level, the book is nothing more than pedestrian. It has no coherent structure or inner logic. It has no thesis. The writing is lame. Sentence structure is poor. There are even misspelled words -- even in Mrs. Reagan's foreword! -- and punctuation errors. Both the author and his publisher should blush.Clearly, the Gipper deserves better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an unfocused memoir","review":"Deaver's short memoir of his years with Ronald Reagan jumps forward and back in time frequently so if you don't like that narrative style you won't enjoy the book. It's a little too worshipful and is far too sweet and is a good argument for why the best biographies tend to be written years after the subject's death. Deaver is so deep under the Reagan spell that the book reminds me more of an old 1940s MGM biopic. It's glossy, heroic and there are no warts. I found Peggy Noonan's book What I Saw At the Revolution to be much more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It is written by someone who obvisouly adored the President, therefore, he is not objective in his review. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasers and robots would make it better.","review":"If you wanted to make up a story of Ronald Reagon being as close to Jesus as possible, and needed to see an example of how, then I think this might be the book for you. The author, an indicted man himself, writes how he believed One Shot Ronny was incapable of telling even the smallest lie. The author's disclaimer, that the Gipper was a completly self-made man, provided much amusement as I read this deification from his former Media Strategist. But hey there's a sucker born every minute and they do need something to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Drummer","review":"I really liked this book! I am a Ronald Reagan fan and felt a kindred spirit with the man! Several stories in this book show the character of President Reagan. He was a strong and steady leader. Even the author Mr. Deaver found strength in his relationship to President Reagan and his wife Nancy. The things that stood out to me was Reagan's honesty, stability, and leadership (without checking the polls)! God bless this man and his ability to believe in the strength of the American people and to realize that \\"the office was bigger than the man himself\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product for the price","review":"I bought this camera about 3 years ago and have used it with no problems. It does eat the batteries up when you load in a larger smart card (something I suggest you buy). For it to be less than 1mb it still prints pretty good quality shots even on regular paper. The only drawback I've found is the software. It constantly comes up while downloading pics and says that it has an error. If you hit retry it works again until the next pic. Other than that inconvenience it is well worth the price. Granted it is not a high end camera and does not claim to be it is still well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor download instructions- Photomax PDC 640 Plus","review":"I recently purchased a Poloroid PhotoMax PDC 640 Plus digital camera. I was impressed with the features and the pictures looked great on the LCD display. I connected the camera to my PC and the ac adapter, turned on the camera as instructed and nothing happened. An error message came up and said camera wasn't connected so I checked the connections and they were fine so I tried it again, no luck. I then turned off the PC, rechecked all the connections and went back step by step AGAIN and I cannot get the pictures transferred from my camera to PC. I re-read the help in the software and troubleshooting in the users guide and I am back to the beginning. NO HELP from the website from Poloroid, where did they go? Pretty frustrated in Poloroid products and this was a waste of money if it won't transfer pictures to PC.

This is a great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Pleased","review":"I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for a family member. It is well worth the price paid. It is very easy to use and it's also easy to download pictures to a PC (once you install the software and realize you must first turn off your computer before connecting the camera - then turn on the camera, followed by turning on the computer). The TV connection is very helpful in selecting pictures to keep and those to delete. It is also nice to take to family gatherings and take the small TV connector with you to share your pictures with your family. It's a lot of fun to manipulate your pictures with the various options available on the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This","review":"I am so glad that I brought this camera back. It was nothing but trouble. I could not even get it to load the software in order to see the pictures I had taken. I called Polaroid, no help. I emailed, no help. They even suggested that I buy a different camera. That was the only good advice that I got from them. I am still looking for another, but be sure it WILL NOT be a Polaroid.

Nothing helped, the pictures look like [bad]. Anothing thing that [is wrong] with this camera is that it uses a serial cable to connect to your computer. What does this mean to non-techie people? You have to power your computer down, then connect the camera, and then power your computer up each time you want to download the pictures. There's a reason nobody uses serial ports anymore, it's 5 year old technology. Don't get a camera unless it has USB connection and I would strongly advise you not to waste your money on this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Little Camera","review":"This is a great little camera for email pictures and such, it dosn't replace a 35mm. Be sure to get NiMH rechargable AA Batteries, which work much better than regular batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality pictures","review":"If you're looking for a digital camera for beginners this camera might be nice for you but don't expect great quality pictures. Printing and enlarging the photos renders them extremely blurry. Even when printing small prints the quality isn't much better. If you are only interested in using the pictures from this camera on your computer then you might find this camera better suited for you.The batteries drain very quickly. Distance shots are very poor. The camera does have a nice look to it and it feels good in the hand. Operation is fairly simple. It does have a screen in the back to view photos. The software that comes with the camera is actually better than the camera. I would suggest that this camera be given to a young person just starting out in the digital photo game. Adults may find this camera very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better cams for the money","review":"I bought this camera about 5 years back. I'm really surprised they are still selling something this antiquated. With only 0.3 megapixles it is not a good camera if you intend to print out the images. I purchased it for web work and it does a decent job but even with the 72dpi resolution you get from your monitor shows to many flaws in the image. It comes out to grainy and the colors of people are often to orange/red. The software often locks up and tells you it can't complete the action and you have to hit the retry button on every image to get the pictures off the camera. It does that on Win98 and my W2K boxes. All in all I would suggest spending the money on another camera. Polaroid does make some good cameras but this one is really past it's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems multiple replacement cameras issued","review":"At first this camera was great and worked well. but after 2 months of average use, the flash was malfunctioning, I called and received a replacement. then on the replacement the batery door would not stay closed and the camera would keep shutting off.I got that one replaced too. then on the next one they sent me the lcd screen stopped working, It just went black, i got it replaced with another. now my lcd screen is broken again it is all fuzzy and has static so bad you can not see the photos. i am very dissatisfied with this product and suggest you NOT buy this product.

Which leaves us with CD 3. I'll take \\"I Got A Woman\\", \\"Stranger In The Crowd\\", the eerie finale of \\"Farther Along/O Happy Day\\", and the King's intro to \\"Twenty Days\\", where he sums up 75% of his career when he tells the audience that he's about to sing a new song that isn't particularly good or that he even likes, but here it is anyway, ladies and gentlemen.

The opening song is a classic \\"I Just Can't help Believin\\". I has 2 versions of \\"Bridge over Trouble Water\\"; they are great in their own ways. Elvis sounds great through this album. This album is a album for any fans who just are fans. It is so overpowering and so magnificant. It makes you cry, laugh, and just can not fall asleep.

NATALIE PORTMAN IS AWESOME.","review":"Beautiful Girls was an outstanding film. It was the first time I'd ever seen Natalie Portman, and she was extraordinary!

When is this going to be available on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes you have to go back, to move forward.","review":"I remember the first time I saw this film and immediately after thinking about how much it reminded me of friends. There are a few different plot lines but it is about growing up, coming home, old friends, new friends, new life and a funny romantic buddy movie about beautiful girls and hanging out. The cast is one of the best I've ever seen and the acting in fantastic. This is a great movie, do not hesitate to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that everyone can relate to.","review":"You think that your life is different from the others. Then I saw this movie and realized that most of us live similar lives. Its a healthy look into reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better","review":"Don't you hate it when a drama is labeled as a comedy? Anyway, there were only three things this movie had going for it; the script, the theme (What is considered to be a beautiful woman? ), and Micheal Rappaport's very juvenile character as the only comic relief in this bore *sorry Rosie*. \\"Beautiful Girls\\" had the potential to be a nice male soap opera, but it couldn't hold my attention. I considered the part where Matt Dillion's character landed in the hospital the ending and just turned the VCR off. I'm sure that I didn't miss anything beyond that part."},{"rating":"2","title":"All star cast in all star performance","review":"Awesome dialogues between all characters. Dialogues between Hutton and Portman were catchy and captured my attention at first. Dialgoues between Uma Thurman and the male characters were smart and witty. Michael Rappaport's description of beautiful girls and models were saids all about this movie. The title and description of the movie may seem like a 'chick-flick' but by no means it is one. A 20 something to early 30 guy could definitely relate to all the characters. A highly recommended flick for movie lovers who enjoy good acting, nice dialogues and real life drama with a flare of humour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST-SEE!","review":"This movie has every ingredient of a great film! The emotions that you go through just watching it are very sincere and it is worth every moment! The actors' performances are Oscar-worthy (even some actors that you typically can't count on). Call it a chick-flick or what you will, but this movie should be seen by every person between the ages of 18 and 65!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Collectors Item","review":"This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. I came across it by accident on satellite TV about 3 years ago. I decided to tape it and ended up watching it as well, then watched it again the next day and again a couple of days later. I was gripped from the beginning. There are lots of memorable scenes like Rosie O'Donnells' lecture in the convenience store, and Natalie Portmans' discussions with Timothy Hutton about Shakespeare.Just watch it and you'll know what I mean.All the characters were fascinating including Richard Bright who played Willy's (Tim Hutton) father, and David Arquette who played his brother.This is one of 5 films that I have permanently on video. The others being Godfather I,II,III, and Goodfellas.Enough said?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought the characters were well defined","review":"The character played by Timothy Hutton was ambivalent about having a grownup relationship and was more at ease taslking to a precocious adolescent. The women in the movie came across as having to deal with men in their twenties who hadn't quite matured. It's a funny and a very perceptive movie. There was a lot in it I could relate to in my observations of everyday life. It was a real moovie. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Poor] excuse for \\"entertainment\\"","review":"For me this film has the exact same appeal as a TV soap opera (where is exactly where it belongs) -- and I despise TV soap operas. Of course, there are lots of TV soaps and they have been airing for decades, so obviously there are a quite a few people who like this sort of \\"entertainment\\". If, like me, you are not one of them then you are likely to feel the same way about this film that I did. I found it to be boring, depressing, sometimes disgusting, ..., inane garbage. On the other hand if you like the gut-wrenching-downer sort of movie here's your flick -- enjoy.Natalie Portman was a bright spot and her talent was shining through. However, no 13-year old on the planet would talk the way she did in the film.This is the last time I will ever trust a \\"two thumbs up\\" rating from Siskel and Roeper. I give it two thumbs down and will be selling my copy ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood trash","review":"Timothy Hutton. I guess there's a reason that he died off- he can't act his way out of a paper bag. And how many times do we have to see Natalie Portman in a movie before everyone collectively screams enough already?But THE MOST ANNOYING THING about this film is the flippin' Neil Diamond Sweet Caroline scene that has forced us to have to listen to that stupid \\"duh,duh,duh\\" everytime the once great song was played.

I know that for me as a male it brought back many memories and I think it would appeal in a similar way for females."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie","review":"This is a wonderful movie. Mr. Bernabo, in his review was wrong about a few details. Firstly, this movie takes place in upstate New York, not Mass. Secondly, the reunion is in January, not February.

There are too many characters that get little screen time. The story goes way too fast and the editing is very awkward.And another thing. What is so special about Natalie Portman's performance in this film? Her acting was average and any competent teenage actress can do what she did in that film. Big deal.Maybe I just don't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did I Buy This ?","review":"Beautiful Girls is a movie you can easily avoid. I bought it based on the fine list of actresses: Mira Sorvino, Lauren Holly, Natalie Portman (about 13 in this one and the only bright spot in the whole movie), Uma Thurman etc. It takes place in the winter in Minnesota (who thinks up these things?). Uma Thurman (fine looking face) never takes her coat off in the whole movie. After I watched it, I looked at the DVD cover to see why I ever bought it (49 wasted) and it said on the cover that it was a comedy. Always up for a good comedy. I didn't know it was supposed to be funny. I am going to watch it again with new understanding, I hope. I had NO IDEA this was a funny movie. I should have read the cover before I watched it; I could have anticipated the clever nuances of humor so cleverly disguised as boring stupid garbage. Other people should be warned. This movie literally makes The Grass is Greener appear humorous in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie is about a group of low class, small town boys, with big mouths and little brains. The girls have wee bit parts which do not start until well into the movie. It should have been titled Small Town Boys because it has little to do beautiful girls! I suspect that if you are from a small town and do possess a little brain, this movie will be quite appealing to you . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifual Girls? Where?","review":"What is the fascination with this movie, Beautiful Girls? The acting was poor, the plot thin and the action slow. The girls weren't even that 'Beautiful' (Rosie O'Donnell?). As for the guys, their roles were shallow. And the reunion? The old 'buddies' didn't even GO to a reunion!Uma was 'too cool,' Willie was dull as a brick, Marty was a fakely deep (\\"Let's walk this world together\\" -gag). The good actors included Rosie O'Donnell, Matt Dillon and Noah Emmerich, barely.'Beautiful Girls' is a dry flick and characters disappear without and appear without mention (Uma, Rosie). The music was bland and the movie had no depth. Blah, blah, blah, you AREN'T missing out if you have not seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"Let me be honest here, All i wanted is some immediate protection from the sun's rays while i save money to buy myself a rayban one.And this buy turned out to be great !At the beginning, I thought of returning it as I couldn't figure out why it felt so high on the nose.

I was looking forward to have new rear brakes and getting rid of the squeak that had developed. I wanted to use all new components, brake shoes, brake drums and a new set of springs, clips, rubber parts and springs. Upon opening this package of Drum Brake hardware, I instantly realized none of the included parts would fit, not a single piece. I don't know if it was the shippers fault or the manufacturer, either way, the cost of returning it did not make it feasible returning it, so I now have a bunch of springs and stuff I'll probably never use.

Many parents are afraid to take charge of their child and this book not only tells you how to do it, but why it is necessary. Readers gain a deeper understanding of the needs of children at various ages and how to tailor your discipline to your child's intellectual and emotional abilities at his or her age. I have recommended this book repeatedly in my practice and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This sounded interesting, so I paid $2.99 on Amazon to watch it. HUGE mistake! I fell asleep twice, it took me two days to get through it, which I only did because I had paid for it, the acting is some of the worst that I've ever seen and the story plot is overdone and quite predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 bad movies, 1 low price!","review":"This is a good bad movie, I like talking about how bad movies are and this one has plenty to talk about.

They pick up a title called \\"Damnation.\\" I've already seen Damnation so at this point I'm trying to think of any way that I can stop these two from renting the movie. Damnation was bad, like, unwatchable bad. It leaves you confused and angry, you're not confused about a plot twist, you're confused as to why anyone would make this movie.My pleas go unanswered, they rent the movie along with \\"The Pickup\\". So basically, all they do is watch these two movies without adding any real commentary. So if you've already seen one, or both of these movies you don't need to watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not what Vols Fans Are Looking For","review":"I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for my husband who is a die-hard Tennessee fan and has been for 20+ years.

Rocky Top isn't right.\\" It's something to add to a collection, but don't be counting on much use of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAPS!!","review":"This book is thorough and coherent. The use of eyewitness accounts makes it all the more real. However, the lack of maps, there should have been dozens more than there are, makes it a more difficult read than it needs to be. I suppose the margins on military books are such that publishers allocate small budgets for illustrations. I can't imagine that the author considers the maps included in this volume sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid history of a climactic day of battle","review":"Jeffry Wert is no stranger to Civil War history, having already published a number of books in the field. With \\"Gettysburg, Day Three\\" he takes as his subject one of the most famous days of battle during the entire war, the final day of fighting at Gettysburg. Wert has constructed a solid, well-reasoned history, providing a balanced look at both Union and Confederate forces. Inevitably, the great Confederate charge launched against the Union center provides a focus for much of the narrative, but Wert does not neglect the less famous events of that day, including the cavalry actions on either flank of the contending armies. Likewise, his narrative includes the stories of enlisted soldiers as well as generals. This is not a book which attempts to present some new, controversial theories, but it succeeds very well as a comprehensive look at this most famous of American battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Illumination","review":"As surely as those of stone and iron,another monument has come to Gettysburg.Jeffrey Wert has shown a brilliant,superbly researched,and humanized light on day 3.The clear maps and luminous text transported me back to the grim field and its unfolding horrors in a way that rang in the soul.Superbly selected primary source quotations and vignettes like the three-legged dog rooted me to my chair far beyond my alotted reading time.I believe that the test of time will bring this work to its rightfull place, high in the pantheon of Gettysburg literature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The book provides new (to me) insights into often overlooked portions of the battle, specifically the cavalry actions of July 3rd. This concludes the good part of this review...The attention received by Culp's Hill and Pickett's Charge is abbreviated and generally lacking when compared to other available texts on these subjects. A hard-core buff can find more depth and less confusion elsewhere, yet it's a bit much for casual readers.The writing is painfully inconsistent. Some sections are written around first person accounts and are clean, clear and exciting. In contrast, the technical passages that attempt to detail the \\"what where how when\\" of units' movements and activities are muddy and confusing and sometimes inconsistent with the maps that are juxtaposed throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a bit disappointed.","review":"While this book is exhaustive in it's verbal detail, it is too lacking in visual support - maps - to keep it all in mind while wading through it. And, what few maps there are are hard to find, and hard to refer back to because of the rag-edge paper the book is printed on. All in all, I would suggest another source for this battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundantly BAD","review":"So Bad... Bad science, bad video and waste of money.

Lennon has mastered the art of capturing the simplest gesture or word , putting it on paper and evoking complex emotions and situations. In this, his third novel, the author takes us to the 1940s in Montana, a sheep ranch where two brothers, Grant and Max, with a complicated history, cut fleece, paint, build resentment and love the same woman. The use of \\"the dead man\\" in Grant's dreams is eerily effective. There is no clear cut hero or villian, though you do get inside the head of Grant, who allows himself to be seen as the bad guy rather than let his parents, now long gone, take the heat for tragedies in the family. Looking forward to Lennon's newest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid and Heartbreaking","review":"Lennon proves with this new book that he has amazing range. This is a very different book than either of his two previous, but it has at its center what makes all of his work so good: the stories of people who want to be happy while also being good. The combination often fails, and it is this failure that Lennon records with heartbreaking lucidity. Add in his photographer's eye for light and framing, and you'll understand why this is a five-star novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to Nowhere","review":"Lack of quote marks, ultra-emotionally-reserved protagonist, a woman he can't have, the self-destruction of a farm -- is this Lennon's homage to Cormac McCarthy? Perhaps. This is by and large a one-note book, and that's what kills it. The book flatlines from beginning to end, and the supporting cast is no help -- they're either annoying (Sophia) or pretentious (Max). And the ending is just lame lame lame. I didn't expect to read The Funnies again, but this was downright torturous, a slow, muddled book that goes nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Worst book I have ever bought.

I read it the first time as a psychology intern 12 years ago, and again recently. I absolutely loved it the first time, and liked it somewhat less this time around, only because now I find Yalom's own voice to pervade every single character in the book. Notice how often the words \\"heavy stuff\\" is used, by almost every character? And the paragraphs upon paragraphs of heavily-jargoned monologue was annoying even to me as a professional in the same field. BUT, this is a story that every psychiatrist, psychologist, and counselor should read - not just for the page-turning mystery that unfolds, but also for the cautionary tale that Yalom portrays of the ethical \\"slippery slope\\". Just an excuse here, a minor slip there, and it isn't too hard to see how the outcome could have come about. A good one for a professional book discussion group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down once you've started...","review":"I'm a psychiatrist-psychoanalyst too, and probably a contemporary of Yalom's, and I declare the hero could have been me, a psychoanalytic maverick. Therefore I can say that without a doubt, if you have ever been a psychotherapist or a patient, the story will resonate. There are many fascinating sub-plots, and an element of suspense, and a magnificent, ironic ending, but the central theme is the contrast between an older, traditional Freudian, who is 'supervisor' and a younger, maverick eclectic, born-therapist, whose character grows and evolves as he performs a therapeutic miracle on a very unlikely patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, bud good and solid buy.","review":"Nice articulation, great paint job, nice design overall, and very accurate to the anime its from.

This is the no-nonsense manual for making Musical Theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for an actor in Musical-Theatre","review":"Just as Goldman's \\"The Season\\" is the actor's best book on the biz of B'way and Clurman's \\"On Directing\\" one of the greatest acting texts, Spencer's book is the essential book for an actor involved in the process of creating a new musical.Knowing what the writers are looking for helps you shape your work to serve the piece(which will then in turn serve the actor). Smart writers will recognize your creative respect for their work and will listen when your work reveals flaws in their work. Anything that helps an actor to understand where she is in the process is information that frees and empowers them as oppossed to the usual stance of being in the dark and taking orders. In NY musical development is all about readings-and this is the actor's best quide to their place in that process. And it's true-when the writers make a scowl in your direction they're thinking not about what you did wrong but what they did wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have read some books on writing Broadway Musicals which were quite good but this one has a direct clarity that demystify's the process of creating a musical. Good advice is given in every important area from story to page layout and fonts to the politics involved in collaboration. An invaluable tool for a writer that's seasoned or just starting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"I read this book several years ago, and it really opened my eyes to a lot of hidden dynamics in all of our relationships. Several years have passed since then, but thank goodness I bought it, as I plan to read it again soon. I recommend it to absolutely anyone. Read it - you will be glad that you did! I would not hesitate to pick up any of her books, after reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dance of Intimacy","review":"This book is thoroughly informative and sometimes hard to read because for a self-help book it can really stir you up, especially if you have a distant relationship with your family of origin. It was very helpful to read case studies about other women's lives that are parallel to mine. Sometimes, as a topic hit home, I put the book down for a day or two. Thinking about the subject and opening a discussion with my siblings has helped me to gain insight into my current relationship. Good book to read if you are ready to look at yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightbulb Moments","review":"I had always told myself that I would never read a self-help book, but then my therapist recommended that I read \\"The Dance of Intimacy.\\" I had been having trouble in my relationship and this book helped me tremendously in understanding myself and my boyfriend. I connected completely with Lerner's assessments of the people she wrote about and their relationships. Throughout reading this book, I had several significant \\"lightbulb moments.\\" I identified with the situations in the book and although my problems have not been solved overnight, I am gaining a better understanding of what I have to do to be happier with my relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting...","review":"Having heard a lot of positive things about this book, this author, and her series, I had high expectations when I began reading The Dance of Intimacy. What disappointed me was that the book is a series of case studies, with little practical advise. I expected information on the dynamics of intimate relationships; what makes them work, what causes problems in them, and how to know if the only thing left for you to do is terminate that relationship. While there were a few interesting stories in the book, I did not find what I was looking for. Instead, I highly recommend Steven Carter and Julia Sokol's He's Scared She's Scared for a more comprehensive look at people who have difficulty with intimate relationsihps and commitment."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you were seriously abused by your mother, do not read","review":"The author apparently does not have a very wide awareness of life's possibilities. Her main point is that all you have to do is to communicate with your mother, and you will find that she has loved you all along. Personally, I only started to heal when I realised that my mother would never value me in any way, and I found this book very invalidating. See books by Susan Forward and Christina Crawford for recognition of what relationships can really be like, and what to do about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!!","review":"This is a wonderful book. A great read with incredible facts and a lyrical view. Deborah Cramer brings real journalism to the story of the Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Toy","review":"I'm just starting to potty train my 20 month old and I bought this toy to make the process more fun for her. His voice is easily activated by pressing his hand or putting the sippy cup in his mouth. My daughter is sometimes intimidated by toys that are too loud or active, but she has no problem with this toy at all. She does put him on the potty and use the sippy cup, as well as use him for other pretend play. It is a softer, more huggable doll than some of the other more active Elmo dolls. Overall, it's a cute toy for little ones who love Elmo. Whether or not it actually helps with the potty training remains to be seen! Potty Elmo comes with removable \\"big boy\\" underpants, small potty, sippy cup and cloth book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOM's favorite","review":"I love this toy!!! The familiar and fun face of Elmo combined with POTTY TRAINING!!! Perfect! Both my kids are crazy about Elmo and putting a potty with him is a great idea! My son is 2 and a half and has been using the potty randomly for at least six months, but it's nice to have Elmo, to show him that if Elmo can do it, so can he! I can't explain in any other way how cool this toy is. Only problem is that sometimes Elmo loses his potty, so we have to hunt around the house for it, LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potty Elmo","review":"Although the first Elmo we received would not work out of demo mode, we did recieve a replacement of which my daughter truly enjoys. We take him along with us to the potty and it helps her to feel a little bit more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potty Elmo","review":"ADORABLE!!! Love elmo, love the sound effects.

What makes it so fantastic that it would cost any more than 40 bucks, max???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but difficult","review":"The toy itself is a hit for 2 - 2 1/2 year olds; however, the way it works doesn't really make sense. Intuitively, one would believe that if you put Elmo on the potty that he wouldn't give the \\"didn't get to the potty\\" in time comment, but that is not how the toy works. The children seem to love it though! Would be better with volume control :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"my son loves this. he trains Elmo to go potty in the toilet while we train him. IT WORKS......................"},{"rating":"1","title":"least favorite elmo","review":"Potty Elmo is by far the worst of the Elmo's. It is not soft. It is not plush. It doesn't look like the others. It is not as cute or as fun. You can lose the parts and Elmo doesn't set well on the potty. Don't waste your money. Go by your kid a potty chair and sing a potty song. You will save money and not have an ugly Elmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is such a crappy toy...","review":"i dont like it... responses are delayed... i just dont like it ... it doesnt even sound like elmo... my son got this toy yesterday he is 18 mon. and he already figured out that there is a button in elmo's mouth to press and thats how he gets to gulp... there goes the feeding cup... he doesnt use the feeding cup to feed elmo... he is more fascinated with pressing the button himself with his finger...o well thats a loss..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELMO WAS CUTE-BUT DIDN'T IMPRESS MY GIRL MUCH TO USE THE POTTY","review":"THIS GUY WAS CUTE-SHE HAD GREAT FUN PLAYING WITH HIM AND TAKING HIM TO GO POTTY. I HAD BOUGHT THE DVD ALSO, AND TO NO AVAIL IT DIDN'T IMPRESS HER MUCH. SHE HAS BEEN DOODLING IN THE POTTY HOLE SINCE SHE WAS 7 MONTHS-BUT IT HAS BEEN TRICKY TO GET HER TO JUST TINKLE IN THERE. ELMO WAS CUTE FOR HER TO PLAY WITH, AND SHE LIKED HIS SONGS AND ALL......BUT OVERALL SHE LEARNED TO COMMUNICATE ON HER OWN.DOLL IS WORTH THE BUY IF YOUR TODDLER LOVES ELMO. NICE COLLECTORS ITEM.OTHERWISE JUST USE AND RELY ON YOUR OWN MOMMY SKILLS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Elmo","review":"This one doesn't dance or sing, it does talk a bit but is also more of a stuffed animal than the previously released hard robotic types. IMPORTANT TO KNOW: ELMO DOES NOT REALLY GO POTTY AND DOES NOT REALLY DRINK ANYTHING. We bought the doll for our niece hoping it would help her go potty- it didn't. And instead was thrown in the toy box for the more fun dancing and singing Elmo. Also as a side note, the accessories that come with Elmo are cheap made and easily lost. Once again a toy that costs just as much as the other better Elmo dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Training Your Kids to Have Accidents!","review":"Potty Elmo says he has to go. Then he says he didn't get to the potty in time, and he's sorry. Or he says that nothing happened. He never says \\"I did it!\\" or \\"I went to the potty.\\"What this toy is teaching is how NOT to toilet train. Why do I need a toy to do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor introduction to Kerouac","review":"Orpheus Emerged was the first book written by Jack Kerouac that I have read. It was, sadly, a great disappointment. Lacking prior knowledge of Kerouac's life story, I found the book uninteresting; the characters lacked depth, the writing style was spare, and the ending was predictable. Had I known something of the poets and writers whom Kerouac was attempting to portray, as well as his life story, I'm sure the book would have been more interesting. However, with no prior knowledge, reading about a group of stuffy, pretentious college students who take themselves entirely too seriously truly did not hold my interest. I still plan to read On the Road given that it is something of a classic; I can only hope it is better than Orpheus Emerged."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't them","review":"This is not Gjallarhorn.

The only element that confused me was the character of Lesley. I never quite figured out who he was and how he fit into the heavenly situation that brought Tate into the \\"neither heaven nor hell\\" dilemma. This minor confusion didn't matter enough to cause me to dislike the book at all. It's a wonderful read. I despaired that Rachel and Tate would ever get to be together near the end, but I should have known that Kathleen's skillful suspense was destined for a happy resolution. Good going, Kathleen!I particularly love ghost stories, so I hung on every passage, enjoying the ride and the read.Kathleen's characters always become people you'd love to meet-even the dandified Lesley. I have a few questions for him. <G> Lee Emory"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"Though I don't consider this as good as Pocketful of Paradise, this was very good. Containing all of the same wonderful ingredients as the first. I have never cared about characters in a book as much as I have the characters created by Kathleen Kane. She is a wonderful writer and I would highly recommend her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging book with wonderful use of language.","review":"In STEPS AND EXES Laura Kalpakian has written an engaging book filled with insights into the precarious nature of human interactions and the constant balancing required to keep them afloat. But most rewarding is Kalpakian's use of the language to convey those insights. She is funny and original and true as she lets us examine her characters' weaknesses and love them anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book.","review":"The only thing that might have added to my enjoyment of this book would be if I could have read it on some northwestern shore. Not that I could have been any more drawn into this island world, but as I finished the last page I wished that I could look out over the Sound and hold on to the experience. This is a book to savor; it's complex and compassionate. You will find yourself caring deeply about these characters, adoring some, despising others. The story line is creatively unpredictable with moments as rocky as Useless Point, but still I found something familiar. It made me think of some of the people and families that I have known. For those with an extended family either born or created, or for those with their own steps and exes, this book is bound to resonate."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO de mucha ayuda para los novatos","review":"Si bien contiene mucho vocabulario y explica de alguna manera la pronunciaci��n del lenguaje Arabe, ��ste libro en definitiva no es para los que apenas se estan familiarizando con el idioma.

It is now 2012, and I can tell you that impact of her book has not worn off nor has it waned... rather it is has deepened and grown.

I have not read the book but based on other reviews I think this must be an excellent book especially my daughter is very much concerned about preserving nature. Anyway, I was a litle bit disappointed when I received the book.

I upgraded to QB Pro 2007 several months ago. The upgrade went without any problems. I did backup everything before upgrading (I would recommend that you backup the entire QuickBooks folder, just using the QB Backup within the program backups only your company file and not any custom letters, invoices, etc.). I use most of the features in QB Pro. QB Pro 2007 is very user friendly and they have streamlined it quite a bit (i.e. the new interface introduced in 2006) so that you have a fewer number of mouse clicks to access the information you require.

Of course, when I complained the sales person and her manager were more than ready to sell me the right version for twice the price.As for the software, I absolutely hate it. It was designed by myopic accountants who have never run a normal business. It's designed for your accountant not for you. Also be prepared to get inundated with advertisements for additional services that are designed to frighten you into buying one monthly subscription after another. Before you know it, you'll have sunk several thousand dollars with these clowns and have little to show for it.I'm still with them because of my accountant.

The upshot being if you use their payroll service (costs about $189 yearly) you are required to update to the 2007 version of Quick Books Pro. After using the 2007 version for 6 weeks, I can see no benefit. It is cumbersome, full of bugs (I'm not able to do auto updates, a feature that worked very well on the 2004 version) and difficult to learn. To make matters worse their support is the worst. After using Quick Books for 11 years, I'm locked in but franticly looking for a way out . If you have options look at a different products. Talk to an accountant, consider Peach Tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quickbooks 2007","review":"A nice layout without a need to drastically learn new processes for the the functions.

When I talked to their customer service before purchasing the product they said it was set up to do all this and yet it does none of it.

I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work. I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer.I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.

While reading it, it did seem that the author was putting himself in the most positive light, and downplaying the roles of his team. Howver, it was not until reading this fascinating book that I realized how the author of the original Annapurna had manipulated the story to take full credit for the climb.Herzog became a national hero in France, while no one even remembered the name of the climber [Lachenal] who accompanied Herzog to the summit, and who sacrificed his fingers and toes to the ordeal, only to die in obscurity.Roberts' s research sets the record straight, no only on what really occurred during the climbers' ordeal; he also meticulously researched how Herzog, the team's leader, controlled access to the press, so that only his version would be told for over 40 years.This is a must-read for fans of \\"climbing\\" literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but.....","review":"If this book had been edited into a New Yorker Magazine style feature article, it would have been a fascinating re-examination of an adventure classic. A thin book at best, certain axes were honed almost into butter knives. While Herzog's tale inspired a generation of post war readers, the incidents investigated here were no more enlightening than those in Kraukaur(sp?) or Bokorev's verions of 1996's nightmare on Mt Everest. The author might have also toned down his own climbs and summits, but then the book would have been even more woefully brief. It was extremely interesting to read the follow ups on the other Anapurna climbers, and I suspect that their likes are amongst us still, but now enabled a bit with cell phones, topo maps, modern equipment, and helicoptor evacuations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clarifying and illuminating read.","review":"An informative and interesting account of the first 8000 summit. It should be read after reading Maurice Herzog's account of the climb to give perspective to the views of Lachenal, Terray, and the other members of the climbing team. I have read numerous climbing books and found this to be one of the best in terms of insight into how different members of the team percieve same events and conversations. I suppose there has to be a certain amount of friction given the risks of all the climbers, but one finds that element of climbing often obfuscated.

In fact, a big part of Reagan's legacy was doubling the national debt by slashing taxes while increasing defense spending. Bush follows the same lunatic policy. And both men were either lying or extremely stupid when they claimed that the national debt could be reduced by this fiscal policy.The other problem with the book is that Bartlett, having corroborated Bush's incompetence, says he would still vote for him. Truly Bartlett possesses a conservative faith that passeth all understanding, to say nothing of reason and common sense.Useful adjuncts to this book are John Dean, Conservatives Without Conscience, Kevin Phillips, American Theocracy, and Andrew Sullivan, The Conservative Soul: How We Lost It, How to Get It Back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unhappy Economist","review":"Unhappy is an understatement. He's steamed. As if there weren't enough Bush 43 haters already! Here's Bruce Bartlett, major heavyweight economist, a guy with a resume so solid you could blast it with phasers and they'd just bounce off, speaking out in no uncertain terms.The only fault I had with this book is that the author sees things narrowly. When you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you're an economist, everything looks like money.

Burnard allows us to share in their happiness, anger and grief, as well as all those other parts day-to-day existence.The simple writing can seem one-dimensional at first glance, but take a slightly closer look and all the layers of the characters, their lives, and the story open up before you in this beautiful tapestry that we call \\"life.\\"I can honestly say that this book had a strong impact on me, to the point where I think it might actually be a life-changer for me. \\"A Good House\\" is the newest addition to my list of all-time favourite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beguiling House","review":"This novel beguiled me from the back cover intro right through to the superbly satisfying ending with its slow, elegant pace. Readers who want speed and sensation should look elsewhere. This is for readers who want to turn every page slowly and thoughtfully and reflect on the lives of the characters. Bonnie Burnard pierced my heart with her truths several times - particularly the experiences that I shared with the characters. Each of the characters is slowly revealed over the years and spotlit in their own time. I think this is a masterpiece and I am recommending it to my writers group as an example of the honestly we should have the courage to write with. Anyone who enjoys Jane Hamilton and Barbara Kingsolver will be more than happy with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really draws you in","review":"This is a finely crafted novel about everyday people having everyday lives over a period of some 50 years. The author looks at life, death, love, hate, injury and healing, and all in all does so in a simple prose that draws you in and makes you really care about what happens to the characters.However, if I have one small criticism, it is that the book is simply not long enough to give all of the detail of the lives of the characters, and it is this which stops it from being a truly spectacular novel. For instance we know that one of the children born will grow with some sort of physical or mental burden, but it is only hinted at until she is almost fully grown. Perhaps this is what makes the book so tantalising - the prospect that more will be revealed later, but I found that there was often insufficient to whet the appetite.But in the scope of the novel it is a small criticism, and it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"step by sptep","review":"The sound quality of this CD is very poor and flat so i could not enjoy the music no matter whether it is good music or bad music.

He also points out numerous, well-documented examples of what has been put in place of Christianity--teaching about Islam, yoga, New Age beliefs, environmentalism, death education, sex education, homosexuality, etc. His thesis is that liberal organizations such as the NEA and others will tolerate just about anything except biblical Christianity. The First Amendment rights of Christians are being violated in public schools across the nation.

Not a really big deal, though. The real problem is they work great (reception-wise) for a while, then all of a sudden you'll get a constant \\"check antenna\\" message that covers the whole screen and reception is bad.

Unfortunately, there is currently no other antenna / headphone unit on the market, so these are it. I will say, though, that while the unit fails miserably in its intended function (as headphones) because of the extreme discomfort, they do make a serviceable stationary antenna, which I have found useful during travel (though that speaks to the shoddy antenna on the inno itself).All in all, I give the headphone unit one star, with the caveat that the one star is for its use as a travel antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin XM Antenna Headphones","review":"Agree with other posters in that these worked great......for 3 weeks.

I am on my fifth set! I use my Inno while running, so I require an external antenna. I have contacted Belkin and Pinoneer customer support multiple times and neither are interested in correcting the problem or even entertaining the idea that here may be something wrong with the product. I believe the antenna wire in the cord just above the rubber strain-relief next to the connector is breaking. I can manipulate my latest pair by putting pressure by pushing the wire into the strain relief in just the right way and get signal. Of course, this is not acceptable when using on the go. This is a very poor product. Do not buy. I wish there was a competing manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate them","review":"I've never used such a painful set ever.

I don't lose reception on the bus, but the headphones are so quiet I can barely hear it over the loud bus noises. The earbuds that come with the radio are great, and shut out all the bus noise, but since they don't have an antenna built in it loses reception.

I have the same problem that many other people report: they work fine at first, but then the antenna goes bad, and the message \\"Check Antenna\\" appears on the Inno's screen.I bought my first pair on eBay; that pair lasted 3 weeks. I bought another pair from Amazon; that pair lasted 2 months. Belkin replaced the 2nd pair free of charge. The replacement pair lasted 2 1/2 months.

The display on the Pioneer Inno XM receiver shows the message \\"check antenna\\" or \\"no signal.\\"So far Belkin has replaced the defective ones without charge (you have to pay shipping to return defective pair), but bottom line is you almost need to have 2 pair and \\"swap\\" them out one pair at a time in order to keep one working. I do not think it is out in left field to have a product that last more then 2 month at a time.I too have yet to find any alternatives. No one else makes anything similar that I can find.

For a $40 product, I would expect it to last a bit longer than that.Tomorrow I am sending two pairs back to Belkin for replacement. This is the second time for one pair and the first time for the other.Despite the hassle, Belkin seems okay with replacing them. They also pay for the shipping on the replacements.If you have to send them back to Belkin, use the express option. They put a hold on your CC and send you out replacements right away.

In less than1 year, these headphones just died on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine conked out too.","review":"I checked out the reviews here before I bought my antenna headphones. I thought maybe the people that were complaining about the headphones just quitting on them were exaggerating or just unlucky. I had mine for only a couple months. Then, one Saturday I was preparing to listen to football on my XM, and guess what? No signal. Just like the others said, they quit working for no apparent reason. While they worked, they performed reasonably well. I didn't use them as earphones. I wore the antenna around my neck and used separate earphones.

But, she never emerges as a character in her own right, existing here only as a reflection of (and thorn in the sides of) her husbands.

Alas, Tom Lehrer told this story better, with humor, in far fewer words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Grammy-winner!","review":"The title was ideal for Huey Lewis & The News' fourth overall album despite the golf term. This album was preceded by the band's 1980 self-titled debut,1982's PICTURE THIS and the Grammy-winning SPORTS,released in late '83 or early '84. The band garnered more Grammys with the hits JACOB'S LADDER(written or co-written by Bruce Hornsby),STUCK WITH YOU,DOING IT ALL FOR MY BABY,HIP TO BE SQUARE and I KNOW WHAT I LIKE. The success of this album lasted for a year,from its summer 1986 release thru the following summer! In the photo,one of the \\"Newsmen\\" holds a miniature golf club. Unfortunately,the 1988 follow-up SMALL WORLD didn't win any Grammys but spawned two Top 20 hits. The band was then dropped from the Chrysalis label,which was extinct since 1990 and they moved to EMI-Manhattan."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Accidental Purchase","review":"Huey Lewis is a walking talking clich��. His music is basically classic rock light. When you first here it, it sounds familiar, the longer you listen, the less appealing it becomes. Everything he does has done before and better, and will be done better again. Best for all if he just sank back into the mire. Truth be told, I picked this album up completely by accident, I bought a copy of Dire Straits COMMUNIQUE at a second hand shop and this record was inside, thus I am denied the pleasure of selling it back for credit, of course, I did enjoy throwing it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fore!","review":"In eighty seven, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is hip to be square, a song so catchy, most people don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's a personal statement about the band itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good time rock and roll","review":"In today's popular music landscape of raw, hard, heavy music filled with paranoia and complaint, Huey Lewis and the News have retreated to playing casinos and public fairgrounds for the most part. From a trend standpoint, their music didn't travel well through the nineties. It seems that you don't find many Huey Lewis and the News fans anymore, at least many proud ones. However, that doesn't take away from their musicianship; and it shouldn't take away from one's enjoyment of this finely crafted, good time rock and roll. This album wasn't the smash hit like \\"Sports;\\" but it still demonstrates their great vocal and instrumental talents. The harmonies are particularly impressive on this recording, demonstrated on tracks like \\"Whole Lotta Loving\\" and the a-capella \\"Naturally.\\" These days, rock music seems preoccupied with songs that are lyrically profound and nihilistic.

Yet they did- and it works._Of course if you truly understand these oldest of mystical scriptures then you could condense them down still further to:Brahma is true, the world is false,The soul is Brahma and nothing else._Or if that is a bit wordy for you, then you can sum up the Upanishads, and all the Vedas, with: \\"Tat tvam asi\\" (Thou art that.)_Most people need to work up to the true understanding of these statements with a bit more commentary, however...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in total usefullness","review":"If you purchase this book hoping to use the CD to follow the examples; DON'T.

Brandford is a great musician, but he was trying to put his stamp on music history and the only footnote he created here was \\"worst attempt at perpetual fame\\". There are some saving graces on the CD musically but not enough to overcome the attrocities. This CD should be categorized as new age or avante guarde at best.

An aged James Arness convinces as a man still formidable with his fists and his guns despite his years and the supporting cast, including some charismatic bad men, is also very good. There are strong messages in the film about justice, goodness, the love of family, friendship and redemption. The violence is starkly portrayed and at times shocking.

Having served under all four of Iowa's Commanding Officer's, I can tell you that the crew of the IOWA respected and had a great deal of faith in Capt. Moosally. You gather a large number of the former crew today and you will hear nothing of low moral (except maybe under his predecessor's tenure), fear aboard ship, or any of the other illusions that were said to have existed.

There's very little low and high range frequencies. This is a problem with many LCD TV's and monitors with built-in speakers, so watch out in general. It's tempting because the smaller speakers make the TV look so much more compact; but there's a trade-off. We returned it and are now looking at a Magnavox, Sylvania, or Sharp. We have actually been going into some stores to demo them, and have been turning down the sound in all the other TV's in the display so they don't interfere with the sound in the TV we're reviewing.

Although they only made three albums, and seemed to have disbanded for good after 1992, Go West definitely had some catchy tunes. Their self-titled debut from 1985 is a great album of first-rate 80's pop. Great finger-snapping numbers throughout, including such Go West classics as \\"We Close Our Eyes,\\" \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Call Me,\\" and other uptempo winners like \\"S.O.S.\\" and \\"Goodbye Girl.\\" Peter Cox's voice is excellent, and the album's production is energetic (love those keyboards, too!).

The book was predicatble and the end was poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live Fast, Die Jong","review":"Oh, the pain of being young, rich and privileged in Manhattan. Trashy skimpy selfabsorbed \\"fiction\\" from a famous writer's kid. Don't waste your time like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky she has a famous mother...","review":"From the first page I knew I wouldn't like the main character Miranda. Jong-Fast gives us no reason to like her. This book comes off as snotty and pretentious, with characters that I don't care about. Miranda goes into rehab, and comes out a completely changed whats-the-meaning-of-life kind of character. Believable? No. And Jong-Fast doesn't get too much into any situation, jumping from one thing to another. Maybe she should ditch the writing and stick to what she knows best -- being fabulous and taking drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this book about, anyway?","review":"This book is a masterpiece of self-absorption...the lead char- acter does nothing but take copious amounts of drugs and notice appearances. I'm sure it's meant to be a scathing commentary on New York City high society but frankly it's pointless and dull. There is no plot to speak of - it reads mostly like a laundry list of intoxicants and designer labels. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near normal girl","review":"Could people please stop allowing famous children to sign book deals without first checking them for a pulse? This is the single worst book I've read in my young adult life: unrealistic, poorly written, and frankly, tedious. I've never even thought about writing a review before, but this book made me feel compelled to tell the masses: Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so normal, at least for me","review":"This book was just ok. I read it and had no problem getting through it, but there was just no true driving force or plot behind it. Actually, I dont think there were even any substantial characters behind it either. The main character, along with all of the others she encounters along the way, seem extremely flat and I didn't really care about what happened to her in the context of the story. For me it was interesting to read about a life full of drugs and such but I am positive there are other books out there that will give me the same effect but leave a more lasting impression. Another problem, I just couldn't identify with anything the character experienced or was talking about. Maybe it would have been more wrenching if I were a rich, (...)teenager from New York who had a massive drug problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Certainly Read Better","review":"\\"Normal Girl\\" by Molly Jong-Fast isn't what you would call a masterpiece. I found it to be very lacking in many vital areas. For one, I didn't really like the characters. And, when you don't like the characters you certainly are starting behind the eight ball. And, second, I found the storyline to be tired and overused. I don't think that it was as intense as I had been lead to believe and it certainly didn't hold my interest or appeal to love of a good novel. I can't really recommend this one very much. There were a few moments that I lost myself and was interested but, they didn't string together enough to warrant more than 2 stars. Sorry, but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...","review":"This book came highly recommended by several of my friends, but I have to say that I was thoroughly unimpressed with the story. It was funny, but the humor, at times seemed forced. It started out with some really great imagery - good description and development, but as I got about halfway through the novel, I knew that this book would disappoint me. Near the end of the book it seemed that the author just \\"dropped the ball\\" on the plot. The character that we had learned about in such great detail through the beginning of the book was suddenly whisked through rehab in a matter of a few pages. It seemed as if she had been rushed to finish the book or something. I found the whole rehab thing very unrealistic. This book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generation X Angst","review":"This is a book which may go over well with the teenagers, but if you are looking for maturity of thought and artistry of language, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read one book this year this should be the one","review":"Funny/Silly/smart/the best book I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: nepotism","review":"I agree with all the other negative reviews that this book has received. There is no plot. The main character, Miranda, is unlikeable to the point that I didn't understand how she had any friends. Nothing happens for the first 97 pages of this 195 page book, then Miranda goes to rehab, where we still get no insight into anything, then nothing happens for the rest of the book. The cover is the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, okay, whatever.","review":"To give Jong-Fast her due, Normal Girl is a remarkable achievement for a twenty-one year old. Having said that, I don't believe this book would ever have been published if it wasn't for Jong-Fast's literary connections.While she shows moments of great talent and promise, Bret Easton Ellis she ain't. Not yet anyway.Aside from the shallow and cliched story-line though, the worst aspect of the book is the appalling editing. Take the last sentence in the book for example:Because I'm off into the daylight. .'What sort of punctuation is that? There were missing and misspelled words throughout the whole book (and I'm not talking about American spelling standards such as 'center' instead 'centre'). I had to re-read a lot of sentences.By the end of the book, I wondered why I should care about it when it was quite clear that the writer, editor, agent, publisher and anyone else involved in the production of it, didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just plain bad writing.","review":"\\"Normal Girl\\" has an annoying, unlikeable heroine, tons of unfunny \\"humor\\" and cliches, and scads of underdeveloped characters and situations. It's really too irritating for me to even recommend it as a beach read. I realize that, because Molly Jong-Fast is Erica Jong's daughter, publishers were probably lining up to buy this manuscript. They should've held off. Molly Jong-Fast also should've held off on publishing a novel until she'd acquired a little more wisdom and writing skills. This should've remained in her bottom drawer or the pages of her journal, the unpublished novel that led to better work but was never seen by anyone. Too bad she had to go and show it to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO ASK WHO?","review":"The main character of this book is Miranda . . . a shallow, rude, over-indulged, self-absorbed, self-loathing \\"wanna be\\" who should have read GO ASK ALICE.

The characters are completely unlikeable and utterly boring. I found myself hoping the protagonist would die an embarrassing death. Normal Girl makes Less Than Zero seem like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"NORMALLY I wouldn't write bad reviews...","review":"I am meaning no offense to the author of this book, by I am saying this right now. This book definetly sucks in my opinion. I usually only give good reviews about books, but I dragged myself here to tell the world not to read \\"Normal Girl.\\" Basically, this book goes on and on, and I kept telling myself not to stop reading because something interesting has to happen sooner or later, but nothing did..It doesn't only lack character development, it doesn't even have a plot. Don't get me wrong, I am not dissing this author, I am just saying, maybe next time she should think of a plot before she starts writing her next book. Because in my opinion, this book basically is worthless. Save your money for a better interesting book, if you are looking for a good book that somewhat relates to this but is way better...maybe you should try the \\"Alice\\" series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normal Girl isn't Normal at all.","review":"When I first heard about this book I was interested to read this book and thought it would be a quick and intersting book. I was wrong.. well it was a quick read but interesting that it was not.The charactors in this book have no depth or life to them. Well besides there rampate drug usage and partying. Miranda was a whining 19 year old girl.There was no real plot for this book. It just went from one end to the other and back again. The story line could have better if there was more depth to it but I just don't think it would have made the book any better.I had to force myself to finish the book after putting it down. Overall I hope that this author picks another subject to write on and possibly puts some more time into it.I can't really say I would give this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least it was a quick read","review":"this is the book for people who like to read about how to find veins to shoot your herion and how when your friend vomits 2xs on your couch it is time to buy a new one. spoiled rich druggy brat. This is the basic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nepotism anyone?","review":"Molly is the daughter of famed writer Erica Jong, who made news in the 60's with \\"Fear of Flying\\". I think that the only reason this book was published was because of her mother. If this was written by anybody else, I think it would have been dismissed as \\"just-out-of-college new writer angst\\" or something and never seen the light of a bookstore shelf.The story follows the misadventures of a socialite in New York as she descends into the pit of drug addiction. You've read this book before. The plot is forumlaic and predictable. I didn't enjoy the book because I couldn't feel sorry for the protagonist or invest any other emotion in the book beyond general frustration. The price is ridiculous for just over 200 pages of drivel printed in a large typeface. If you must read it, use the library instead of spending your good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Just Average Garbage...\\"","review":"Don't bother with this one- for one thing, the book is way too short. I would call it a novella. But then again, I don't even think it's worthy to have any literary definition attached to it. It's basically obscure pieces of someone's journal from what seems like grammar school. Way too unsophisticated for it's time- we've come way too far as a society for jong-fast to be talking about heroin addiction. And the book moved too fast- very shallow and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, yet provocative.","review":"Normal Girl was very entertaining, but a little dark.

Especially for subject matter that rewards familiarity and repetition, this would be a helpful inclusion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good book!","review":"I used this book for a first course in fluid mechanics at graduate level. Initially, one may feel repelled at the arrangement of topics in the book, but once accustomed to this type of layout in graduate level texts( for e.g \\"Transport Phenomena\\" by Bird et al), it is a pleasure to read and learn therefrom.What makes this book unique is that the author has successfully managed to describe important ideas with minimal description and mathematical jargon. However, for a novice in fluid mechanics(at a graduate level), reading this book without any interaction with a fluid mechanician(research worker/professor) might be a difficult task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Supplement","review":"We used this text in my first graduate course in fluid dynamics.

However (with a boldfaced, 32-point capital \\"H\\"), this album is quite simply fantastic in its own right. It is quite simply the best country-rock album ever made, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot. From the opening strains of Dylan's \\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere,\\" you know you're in for a great treat. No ringing electric 12-string Rickenbackers, just timeless country harmonies sung with great vision and enthusiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original influence.","review":"This is a sure classic.

Not only was this an influential album but a commercially successful album as well. In 1968, the kids and the adults could both enjoy this album. The bonus tracks on this CD reveals that this album might have started out as just another one of their country/rock albums (which might have been very good as well) but that at some point they had decided to go full country, and in doing so, they made history once again. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my gramma loved this album..","review":"I didn't even like country music when I purchased the LP back in the sixties.

However, I disagree with this uneducated opinion even if I am in the minority. This album was a country album from beginning to end. A solid one, at that! In my opinion, country rock is rock music with a touch of country influence. If you want to hear the first country rock album, listen to Music From Big Pink by The Band! Furthermore, If you want hear an even stronger example from that genre, listen to Nashville Skyline by Bob Dylan! The other two artists who have even stronger country rock roots are CCR and The Eagles! Is Sweethearts Of The Rodeo a country rock album? I think not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak....

He has been through more crap than a lot of people can say they have been through in the last 50 years. All of the stuff he has been through such as hustling and getting shot help him to be a better lyricist and a better rapper than, IMHO, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, and yes, even the great one, 50 Cent. I first heard him when the single for Let Me In was released and I enjoyed that so I was anxiously awaiting his album. Shortly after it came out, I picked it up and it is amazing. Every track is a banger with good lyrics and bumping beats. My favorite tracks would have to be Do It Like Me, Bang Bang, Bonafide Hustler, Stomp, and the rest of the cd. This is one of the few cds that I have bought where I have liked every song. I would highly recommend this cd to everybody that is a fan of rap and southern rap, because Buck is the realest to come out of the south since Luda and T.I."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic G-Unit","review":"here they areI'm A Soldier 4.5/5Do It Like Me 5/5Let Me In 5/5Look At Me Now 4.5/5Welcome To The South 4.5/5Prices On My Head 5/5Bonafide Hustler 5/5Shorty Wanna Ride 5/5Bang Bang 4/5Thou Shall 4/5Black Gloves 5/5******STOMP 10000/5Taking Hits 5/5Walk With Me 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Classic","review":"Young Buck is the king of the south and the only other person is either t.i. or ludacris but your boy buck killed it with this album keep doing your thang you and the rest of g-unit.GGGGG-UnitTop Songs1)Bang Bang2)Prices On My Head3)Look At Me Now4)Bonafide HustlerBlack Gloves"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent cd coming from the dirty south!","review":"Young Buck is one of the best rappers in G Unit.

They have a truly unique sound that is difficult to describe, but easy to get into. Lyrically speaking, the music offers an interesting view of the dark side of relationships, challenging the listener to identify first with unsavory yet familiar feelings of self-disgust, then offsetting these feelings with a transcendent desire to see the humor and frailty of human connections. This juxtaposition is backed up by quirky instrumentals characterized by a 'wall of sound' created by Messer's pedal-driven guitar work. It's refreshing to hear something new. This isn't yet another alternative guy band. Check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing New Sound in Rock","review":"Goudie makes music that invokes a serious mix of emotions - it has a strong modern rock base, with an edge of retro-alternative thrown in for X-appeal. It is very difficult to compare them to other bands - they have their own highly unique eclectic sound, with Johnny's androgynous vocals and dirty-mind lyrics melded with quirky guitar and vocal distortion. The blend is one that is as exhilarating as it is stimulating. The music draws you in - it doesn't have to grow on you - you become addicted the first time you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great miniature quilting book","review":"This has some lovely patterns for making quilts for dolls and dollhouses or other miniature uses.

It follows a prisoner in the Confed's most secure prison (called, not surprisingly, the Omega Cage). With the help of the warden's albino sex slave, he escapes the prison and makes his way off planet using some interesting alien technology.The pace of the novel is reasonably fast, but because of the prison setting, much of the action is not as brisk as most of Perry's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an attempt at more money...nothing new here","review":"I am far from a hater, but I feel misled after purchasing this dvd.

You wouldn't know it if you looked at the cover, but once the program begins, you realize that this is material from 2005 and is repeated in his Cincinatti standup and his HBO special. The multiple Footlocker joke was funny the first time. In any event you can save your money if you were looking for new material, but if you were looking forward to listening to his rationale and philosophy on comedic performances, I think it is at least worth a rent.

It is unfortunate that Katt is now in retirement because he definitely went out at his peak. I read that there's also an intimate sit down interview with Katt on this DVD so I'm definitely looking forward to that as a true Katt fan.

Tyson adds to the event, and sparks tons of controversy.Other notable matches are the first ever meeting between Undertaker and his \\"brother\\" Kane, and the dumpster match between Cactus Jack and Terry FUnk and the New Age Outlaws.

It's the details that make you feel a part of the story -- a neighbor listening in on a party line.

What a disappointment. This book was terribly difficult to follow. Ideas or plot lines were introduced but never expanded upon or explained until I'd forgotten what they were in the first place. I never got to know the main characters well enough to care much about them. The choices they made in their lives (and WHY) never made sense to me so I kept feeling annoyed instead of empathetic.

I quickly washed it off them and in fact experienced an asthma attack myself and had to bathe after handling them with it. These are otherwise very healthy and happy 11 and 11 pound plus 1 year olds. The next day the male was scratching at his neck where it had been applied so I washed him again. They are back to their happy selves, no thanks to momma who feels like a heel. I did not dare apply it to the 3rd. I could see random reaction if it had been one of the 2. No third strike here. Use with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, do not buy!","review":"I bought PurrScriptions plus the other day to use on my 5-year-old calico, Betsy. Within an hour of application, she began acting very lethargic (which is not like her at all -- she's a very vivacious cat) so I looked up reviews of other Sentry flea/tick products and read a lot of very unsettling reviews from customers. I felt horrible about giving my cat this \\"treatment\\" that poisoned her.Luckily, I ran across advice to wash the treated area with dish soap... and even though I ended up badly scratched, my cat is doing a lot better.Please don't buy this product. It's cheap, but it doesn't do the job, and may even kill your pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent blend of current science, speculation and story","review":"i loved this book. the story had a good pace but not at the expense of the details necessary for good mental pictures. the characters were well developed with believable alien cultures, mannerisms and philosophies. the underlying questions about god and technology were not new, but were posed in a thought-provoking manner. the ending was interesting but it seemed forced. i have enjoyed several of sawyer's books in the past year. factoring humanity was interesting, but a bit more 'out there' than i like. the terminal experiment was similar to calculating god in its fusion of science, philosophy, thoughtful speculation and story-telling. i am looking forward to more stories by robert sawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought-provoking, but ultimately, too implausible","review":"Aliens land in front of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and say, \\"Take me to a paleontologist.\\" It turns out that mass extictions on three different planets with intelligent life (including Earth) occurred at exactly the same time. The ET's think this proves that an intelligent being created the universe and continues to tinker with it. Thought-provoking, along the lines of Arthur C. Clarke, if ultimately implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculating God - a good read","review":"Robert Sawyer is a wonderful writer. He was able to offer the reader a coherent dialogue regarding the existance of God being a scientific fact through interaction between human and alien characters. All of his characters were built with humor, depth and a feeling of reality. The only part I didn't like was a distracting sub-plot regarding militant creationists. But, the merits of the rest of the book far overpowered this problem. The argument for God was fresh because it did not involve religion. It was a pure question of whether a God existed whose purpose seemed to be keeping order in the universe. The question of morality as a path to immortality was brought up but scientifically disregarded. In summary, I like this book very much and will order another by Robert Sawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner!","review":"How else can you describe it, except as a winner? The science fiction premise is clever, the writing is compelling, the story is fun and the entire book is thought provoking. I laughed out loud, cried real tears and thought long and hard. I'm so happy that I found this book. I bought several other books by the author and if they are half as good as this book then they will still be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worh reading","review":"Did not care for the story, very hard read. Had no idea what the story line would be but had I known I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hating gerunds (in titles)","review":"I enjoyed this book for a number of reasons. I thought it was well-written, had well-paced humor, and a good stroll for the brain. I did find that some of the plot twists (no spoilers now) were a bit too convenient to be appreciated...like the ending. But the story is interesting, and the characters are interesting. I'm not a professional scientist, so I found the science in here intriguing enough to want to learn more about it. I wouldn't consider this a must read, but it's an interesting perspective as an atheist battles his non-faith. I also think this book covers areas that many writers might be afraid to write down. This is a pretty short book too. I've got to give Sawyer props for writing something he knew his readers in the scientific community might bash on...and I think that's the mark of a great fiction writer: Fearless and refreshing honesty, with a fun adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really wanted to like this book","review":"As I read Calculating God I was caught by what I thought was a gradual and slow build up to something grand and thought provoking. Unfortunately, the end of the book left a sour taste in my mouth. The ending fizzled without resolving the question that the author insisted on restating on every page, \\"is there a god.\\" Although the book was well written (even though the last two chapters look like they were missed by the editor) once I finished I found myself not pondering the existance of a God, but why it took so many pages to say nothing.I have to say that the author has an enjoyable writing style and a good sense of humor...but the ending knocked all the stars out of my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Full of What Ifs","review":"You will not enjoy this novel if you looking for a little light entertainment, an amusing bit of sci-fi fluff to pass the time. As you can guess from the title, CALCULATING GOD is filled with weightier matters. An alien lands on Earth and begins a series of investigations with a paleontologist from the Toronto Museum. Their discussions are satisfyingly deep and far ranging: paleontology, cosmology, biology, genetics, theology, evolution, faith, morality, friendship. The human scientist, Tom, is dying of terminal cancer, which lends extra weight to his introspection, and the alien, Hollus, is thoughtful, sensitive, and a lot more three-dimensional than many characters in fiction (expecially science fiction). A very satisfying read, which will have me pondering some of it imponderables for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"aliens not so bright","review":"The book is disappointing. The lengthy beginning rehashes worn-out arguments for the existence of a creator. All are based on confusing a priori probability with a posteriori probability and it is surprising that presumably superior alien races could not come up with anything better nor they ever discovered the fallacy of such thinking. Why Sawyer never consulted any philosophy textbook? He would have found more intriguing ideas. The rest of the book is no better, i.e., spider-like aliens thinking and talking like humans and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring","review":"This is one of the most boring sf books I ever read (and I read many). The main idea in the book boils down to an old theological argument: God must exist since our universe is so well adapted to life. If mosquitos could think, by the same argument they would conclude that God must exist because there are so many humans to bite. The aliens described in the book are sort of spiders which talk and think exactly like humans, the novel is slowly paced and the final is disappointing. In conclusion: boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning novel, absolutely brilliant","review":"This is the best book by the best new SF author to emerge in the 1990s. I think it's his 12th novel, and it is a masterpiece. All of the mind expanding speculation from his previous books is here plus that wonderful laugh-out-loud sense of humor that we haven't seen from Sawyer since \\"End of an Era\\". The novel explores science and religion and does so while prodding both sides to think and without insulting anyone's intelligence. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Science Fiction","review":"The best science fiction isn't necessarily about a whiz-bang future. Rather, it extrapolates recognizably from today's world and leaves you thinking about philosophy. If you want to think about the questions of life, the universe, and everything and want a better answer than \\"42\\", Sawyer is the author for you. His hard science is great without getting all technical and geeky and there is plenty of humor interspersed with the thought-provoking subject matter. I bought 3 more Sawyer books the day I finished this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The aliens are not Atheists after all.","review":"Robert J. Sawyer is one of my favorite authors. His approach to sciencefiction is very positive, and his talent is shown by the many awards he hasone. This is a story of first contact, of aliens coming to Earth, not inconquest, but in friendship. There most surprising question to humanity ishow do we see God. Not as in do we believe, because the aliens havemathematical proof that God exists. Of course when having to deal with allthe nuts and lunatic fringe on Earth, the answer is not so clear cut, andso comes the story. Very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable SciFi","review":"Entertaining, thought provoking SciFi, with some laughs along the way, good ploting, great charactors and accessable to mainstream readers. Sawyer is one of the better SciFi writers and deserves your attention, tho I'd recommend starting with \\"Mindscan\\" which I like a whole lot more. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare treat - sf and religion treated respectfully together","review":"Tom Jericho, a paleontologist, makes first contact with an alien at the science museum where he works. The alien is accompanied by another alien of a different race. Together they are studying the geological records of inhabited planets, after discovering astounding similarities in major planet events. Jericho discovers he is most intrigued by their belief in God, a concept that has eluded him for most of his life. The aliens are very human-like in some regards, and their gradual interactions and friendship with Jericho are wonderfully told. Jericho's views of the universe are shaken amidst his diagnosis of a terminal illness. Does he find religion and/or God? Thankfully it's not that simple or predictable. This novel is full of heavy themes, treated respectfully, and told with heart. It is moving and thoughtful, and oh yeah, there's plenty of science fiction involved as well. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating read","review":"While not necessarily agreeing with every argument presented, if find the book still to be to my liking with its not-too-predictable plot twists, characters I can relate to and the overall captivating flow of the narrative. If I had to compare it to something, I'd say the book has best elements from Samit Basu's Game World trilogy (the unpredictable twists, although not quite THAT much as Samit has managed to come up with) and the popular science material (with some fiction added, of course) of ... well, Robert J Sawjer. :) (Been through his FlashForward just recently as well and liked it almost as much as this one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely fabulous book --- highly recommended!","review":"I really, really, really liked this book. Did I mention that I really liked it? Well, I did. Science fiction sometimes is dismissed as being too cerebral --- too much for the mind, not enough for the heart. I have never seen both aspects so well balanced as in this book. Yes, Sawyer makes you think --- the book is mind-expanding, mind-blowing, and so on. But he also makes you feel. I cried several times (I also laughed out loud, even on the subway, something I rarely do). But I find myself constantly thinking about the book, and talking about it with friends. I don't think I will ever forget Tom Jericho or Hollus. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"While this book provided an interesting concept, and gave some interesting options for the eternal debate on the existence of a god, it simply wasn't well-written enough to hold my interest. It was a struggle to finish reading the book, which is not normally the case for me. The science, in general, seemed relatively accurate. I'd wait for it in paperback if you must read it, or get it from your local library. It's not worth taking up valuable book-shelf space in your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creationist Claptrap Disguised As Real Science Fiction","review":"Unlike true science fiction that is based on actual verifiable science, the only basis here the Creationist/ID fantasies that are passed off as science by the religious church and home-schooled crowd. Don't be fooled into thinking this is any thing more than a Fantasy novel or thinly veiled religious propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I hate to do this since I love this writer but this book was mediocre. Some interesting ideas but not particularly original. Most of the book feels like an aside, a discussion or rumination on some concept or other, with little relation to the story. I live in Toronto, so the location was interesting, although slightly embarrassing (typical Canadian response). Going back to re-read Starplex or Flashforward..."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"it made me cry at multiple points....it was the most powerful science fiction i've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Book","review":"The premise is interesting, but the narrative is poor, most of the characters are weakly drawn, and the dialog is forced. Overall, not a book I would recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"big let-down","review":"The concept for this book is fantastic - a wonderful idea, with several neat twists. However, I found the actual plot enormously disappointing. Without giving too much away, suffice to say that the concept largely recedes as the author spends most of the book using the science-fiction \\"hook\\" as a veneer for discussing his thoughts on Issues Of the Day (\\"what would the inhabitants of Omicron Beta III think about abortion?\\"). Furthermore the book requires that you feel that Canadians are so utterly phlegmatic that the daily presence of an Alien in their midst, after a few days, is treated largely with a shrug - no extra security for the alien, no extra recording/monitoring/vetting of the conversations with the alien, etc.I don't want to sound like too much of a fussbudget, but those two were just too much for me to swallow - more emphasis on the essential concept and a lot less on the gassing about public policy would have made this a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but muddled thinking","review":"I have to respectfully disagree with some other reviewers regarding this book. The author attempts to achieve balance, but simply ends up presenting many differing points of view, some of which are obviously flawed, logically or theologically inconsistent, and simply not worthy of our attention. (No, I'm not talking about the actions of the fundamentalists.) For example, one of the first dialogues with Hallus is a clear example of applying the anthropic (hmm, probably not the best term in this case) principle to science in an inappropriate manner: [Human]life has a purpose, life entails certain antecedent conditions, those conditions must have existed by design, \\"design\\" entails a designer, and therefore there is a designer who has a purpose for life. A bit tautological and unworthy of an \\"advanced\\" race.The book is well-written, however, and the characters are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science is bang-on accurate; philosophically stimulating","review":"One (anonymous) reviewer below tries to take Sawyer to task for discussing flagella (the whipping apendages on cells) in two different contexts, acknowledging not only Michael Behe's concerns about irreducible complexity, but also Lynn Marguilis idea that complex cells formed from various simpler life forms working in concert (an idea Sawyer himself explored in a very different way in his wonderful STARPLEX [Ace, 1996]). But looking at both sides like this is the WHOLE POINT of CALCULATING GOD. Sawyer's goal is clearly to promote dialog, and to show the strenghts and weaknesses both of intelligent design (not creationism, as the other reviewer wrongly stated) and neo-Darwinism. That he can engage in such a dialoge while still telling a literate, captivating story is very much to Sawyer' credit. This book is Hugo Award calibre, and I'd be surprised not to see it on next year's ballot."},{"rating":"2","title":"God the Scientist","review":"Calculating God is an extremely stimulating book on both a scientific and spiritual level. I would recommend it to anyone with a scientific mind who is disappointed with organized religion, but still believes in God (although perhaps not a perfect one). If this is you, then you will have no problem in relating to this great novel.The drawback to this book would have to be the editorial and story line errors, but these are easy to forgive.All in all, this is a great book, a must read for anyone with a scientific and philosophical mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sawyer delivers with Big Ideas","review":"Very well thought out book. Sawyer is very convincing, and his main character, Tom Jericho, is nicely done. All the characters in this book were well done, with the exceptions of Hollus, who didn't strike me as alien enough, and the two creation extremists, who seemed extraneous.This book is well paced and nicely plotted. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophical and humorous","review":"Even though it's philosophical, it's not overly serious, but that makes it a fast and enjoyable read.

I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"If ever there was a book that made me want to ask for my money back, this was it.The story is just an excuse to promote Intelligent Design. It will throw at you the standard, pre-packaged arguments, and hope you are not knowledgeable or sophisticated enough to see that either they have already been debunked or they are plain wrong.If you want an original, entertaining sci-fi story, this is not it, and if you want to educate yourself on the I.D. vs evolution controversy, pick up something more serious than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is such a fine line between clever and stupid...","review":"It just that little twist.

Does to biology and evolution what space opera usually does to physics.It's not quite dinosaurs with saddles stupid, but not much better. If you still think there is any reason to give credence to ID this is the book for you. You'll want to keep it on the night stand right next to your copy of The Secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"Other reviewers have done a fine job in discussing the problems with the logic in this book - although I would add that the book does make what I presume is an unintentional argument against creationism/intelligent design, i.e., the only way either hypothesis could be proven would be by demonstrating facts which are simply not extant.The story itself reads like bad young-adult fiction - the premise is good, but the world inside the book feels like a school play on a mostly-empty stage.This book will almost certainly be embraced and bought in massive quantaties by the religious book-club crowd, and indeed, my version has a set of book-club discussion questions in the back. Publishing it was probably a pretty savvy move. Writing it will probably prove lucrative for the author.

As a singer he's more than capable of holding his own with any of the Blues great out there. As a songwriter, Dufresne's songs are definitely okay. Not neccassarily masterpieces, but very good.

I have recommended this book to the parents of my patients and to my teenage patients who have been very pleased with the increased knowledge and comfort level achieved in managing asthma. This book is a \\"must have\\" for anyone with asthma as it addresses asthma in children and adults. Thus it is a useful knowledge source for the parent as they are often learning more about their own asthma as well as their child's asthma.

I have not finished the rant, er book, yet. And I probably won't. It seems to play on every worst fear anyone ever had about a criminal. But there seems to be little or no scientific backup for the author's many right-wing, tough-on-crime-sounding conclusions. I can see why this book is so popular among corrections people, and why the author enjoyed some notoriety during the Reagan years.

Like a combination lock, a series of causes(the number sequence) can open ornot the lock of criminal behavior. Poverty is a seriesof experiences that can come at one differently.

Betrayed by the establishment, yet armed with the truth, Ralph Nader exposes a series of evident, and many not-so-evident, facts wrong with America all the while rekindling hope for a country that has misplaced its soul.Crashing the Party... reads well on several levels. It is a tome of what ails America. It is a book of political candidacy and procedural maneuvering. It is a travelogue and a diary from the road. It is also a book chock-full of celebrities, intellectuals, comrades and false friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC -- GO, RALPH, GO!!!","review":"Ralph Nader has written another book that should be required reading in school! When you've done the research and read the facts, you know he's telling the truth: America is becoming more and more controlled by corporatations and other special interests -- and that control oozes right into the election process.I attended some of the super rallies in 2000 -- thousands and thousands of people there cheering him on, listening with rapt attention to his \\"politics of joy and justice!\\" The media barely covered these rallies! Can you believe it? When Bush and Gore were getting a couple thousand people at their gatherings? Isn't that big news? But the news is strongly corporate-controlled, and those mega-corporations don't want a third party in there messing with their master plan...It's not hype -- it's not paranoia -- it's the truth.

His conceit, evident throughout this obvious piece of self-promotion, has resulted in the most undemocratic, anti-environmental, anti-middle class and poor, anti-woman administration in recent history. I hope, that as the Bush administration continues to raze forests, cut environmental regulations and commit other atrocities in the name of big business and oil, Mr. Nader sees how much damage his ego has caused."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book if you can handle the large vocabulary","review":"Nader's story of the '00 election is fascinating reading. You follow him from state to state, as doors are shut in his face, former friends betray him, and the national media ignores him. His explanation of the ills of today's political duopoly is dead-on. Mr. Nader has a very large vocabulary, so this is not a book that can be easily digested. After reading this book, one has to wonder if either Bush or Gore have even half as much knowledge of the issues ailing this country as Mr. Nader does. I can't think of anybody better qualified to be President than Ralph Nader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important story, but bumpy read","review":"The take-home message of the book is essential for anyone interested in the current - and more importantly - the future of of American politics. Crashing the Party provides a wonderful opportunity to revisit Nader's position on countless items and juxtapose it with that of other liberals and the so-called democrats. The book reads as a cross between a diary, diatribe, and lessons learned report on how to run a campaign. While reading Nader's account of life on the road campaigning for the Green Party has mainly historical anecdotal value the book's real strength is the repeated illustration of the deplorable shortcomings of the current electoral system and the consequences for all of us. Nader's style is surprisingly lively, but increased editorial care and attention would have made the book an ever better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"Nader offers a treasure of valuable information on current U.S. politics. His voice is authentic, engaging, and inspiring throughout. He tracks the details of what brought about his candidacy, how the Democrats were defeated, and how they have tried to punish him.

To listen to him is always to learn something.BUT. But somewhere along the line, Nader came to admire himself as much as I've admired him. This book is a name-dropping ego trip. He seems to have impressed himself that he ran for President. He reminds me of a kid showing off his diving skills with \\"Hey, look at me.\\" Ralph, the campaign was a belly flop.

When he ran for President, many of the people who he thought were his friends not only turned their backs to him but tried to stomp him out.

They aren't machined well, sometimes they will overlap or just flick sideways when you shoot em instead of flipping. The instructions were very small and confusing. Ended up figuring it out on my own.Overall, I like being able to see when I hit it, if it doesn't go up, it at least swings back amd forth. It definitely doesn't work as well as described.

Second of all the bolsters are very soft and nice for children but they do roll and if your toddler is as active as mine you will find it can roll very easily and kids could fall off of the bed if they play too hard. It is a great idea but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bed bolster","review":"It seemed like a good idea, however I have yet to get the thing inflated. I'm not giving up but I'm not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great on vacation!","review":"We purchased this for our 2 year old son to use while on vacation. He had never slept in a big bed before, so we were worried about how well he would sleep in a hotel. This worked perfect! He was comfortable and we were not concerned about him falling out of bed. The added bonus was that we were able to pack this in a suitcase and travel with it on board an airplane. It was simple to use and light weight. We are now looking into buying him his own big bed so he can continue to use this at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great- with adjustment","review":"We took this product on a trip and it was good to have especially when staying in multiple destinations. This is a great product in that it's very portable but it worked best if anchorred under the fitted sheet. Depending on the firmness of the mattress i.e. on a thin mattress like a fold away couch or cot it may not hold a child from rolling out of the bed. On a regular mattress it was better but even then we tried to put it under the bottom sheet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for us.","review":"We moved our daughter onto a full size bed when she was around 8 months old (makes for easier nursing during the night). We put her bed against the wall and used this on the open side. We put it on fairly tightly and put the elastic strap through the slats on the headboard and footboard of her bed (about 2 or 3 slats in from the edge). The elastic is fairly stretchy, but because we didn't put it right on the edge of the bed, but a few inches in, we never had a problem with it at all. Our daughter did figure out how to get around it eventually, but we had her bed very close to the floor and by the time she figured out how to get around it, she had absolutely no problem getting in and out of her bed...and much higher things for that matter. We really just wanted something to make sure she wouldn't accidentally fall out of bed and it worked well for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for us","review":"We have platform beds for our girls that won't work with a regular bed rail. These work great for both our full and twin beds. It could possibly hurt mattress by cinching it but we don't really have a good alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea!","review":"We took this on vacation with us and it was perfect for my 2 year old. I used it on a Queen size bed and it fit just fine. You don't need it to cover the full length of the bed, just the length of the child. I never had a problem with it coming loose. It was great to just take it out of the bag, blow it up and then deflate it at the end of the week to put back in the suitcase. I felt very sure that she would not fall out of the bed while I was in another room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work, isn't safe","review":"Slipped off the mattress no matter how tight I cinched it.

However, we bought a latex mattress for our daughter and when you tighten the elastic strap on this product it does not get tight enough to keep them from rolling out of bed without distorting the mattress where the elastic wraps around the mattress and/or box springs. It did not work for us but may for you. May be OK with a traditional mattress and box spring. We do not have a box spring for addl height reasons, as she is a toddler and want her to be able to get in and out of bed herself without worry of falling out and breaking arm or worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for restless sleepers!!!!","review":"I am very disappointed in the product. It did not help keep my two year old stay in the bed because the elastic that holds it to the bed easily slides off. He fell out of bed during the night and got tangeled up in the whole thing.In fact,when checking on him frequently after he fell out, he kept getting tangled up in it! I suppose if your child does not move when he's sleeping, this might work, but for the money....don't waste it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not snug as a BedBugz","review":"My toddler removed this in less than a minute. Yes, the strap was a tight as I could make it. I am hoping to use it up against the wall to train her to stay in the middle of the bed. That may be the only way we end up using this. It's made well and , in theory, would seem to work but it's not for every toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase for my 2 year old","review":"This rail gives me the flexibility of putting it on my queen size bed when my son is sleeping in my bed or on his twin size bed. So easy to put on and take off! I've now made it a bit more permanent by putting it under the sheets. It shifts less and making the bed is now easier. My son also loves it and sometimes hugs it at night like a teddy bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected--a disappointment","review":"The author's command of language, and her writing skills are excellent, but the story was far from what I expected.It does give a good description of English life in the countryside in the 1800's. The characters are well drawn and seem very real, as does the atmosphere surrounding them.The problem is--nothing much happens in the way of plot.I had thought the book was going to be about this maid, Annie Phelan, and her employers, Eldon and Isabelle Dashell (a husband & wife)both becoming romantically interested in her to the point where her position in the household changes and she gains power over both of them. But this situation never fully develops. One kiss is exchanged between Isabelle and Annie and that is the extent of any romantic relationship between them.The book bogs down with dwelling on Isabelle's interest in photography and Eldon's interest in expeditions and map making."},{"rating":"2","title":"very long, but haven't washed yet","review":"my son is 6'6 and NEVER can find undershirts that are long enough these seem good ,after washing we will really see if they are.

After you wash them once or twice they are short and essentially useless. So, I did a little experiment recently and bought tall t's under the assumption that if i washed them a few times then they would be regular length. I am 5'10 170lbs, and after i washed these tall t's about 4 times, they now are forever shrunk to the perfect size t-shirt, which is in fact the same size as a regular unwashed out the bag. Although your friends might make fun of you when the tall t package comes in the mail, the harassment is worth the perfect size t-shirt that wont shrink on you. Buying more now.

I know it would seem crazy to be so excited about undershirts, but I have had horrible luck getting them to a.) fit and b.) be softer than sandpaper. I had given up on softness and decided it was more important to not have my undershirts riding up all the time. The comfort of these shirts seemed like a bonus! I have tried regular large and XL and they were just baggier, but not longer. If you are under 6' 4\\", these shirts will consistently (even after being in the dryer) stay below your belt line. Also, I have washed and worn them about ten times and they are still comfortable and still fit well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"This is a good T shirt, better than most any other I've had but it's not as good as the Classics shirt I bought a few years ago.

After just one wash in a warm/cold cycle and dried on low they shrank and are now unwearable (for a tall man). The new shirts shrank to about 3 inches shorter than his other Hanes undershirts that are a bit worn out and have been through several washes.

These shirts help. They are Hanes, so you are obviously not getting some thick shirt. Great for an undershirt. Very generous length, but not so much that it looks like a dress!I would say the sleeves are shorter then I prefer. Probably standard for Hanes though. The \\"wiggle room\\" around the arm holes remind me of Jordan brand shirts. A little tight. Not horrible (like Jordan) but smaller then I prefer.Oh, and I have yet to wear one since I've washed them, but the neck was very comfortable, not too tight, but not too loose either. I'm 6 foot 1 and 205 lbs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrinkage!","review":"Hanes' tees are comfortable. But since I paid more for the tall tees, and they shrank in length significantly after a couple washes, I have to give Hanes' tall tees a terrible review. I also noted that the lay-flat collar seems to not lay so flat after a few washes. I take the tees right out of the washer as soon as they are done and put them in the dryer, and when I remove them, the collars are wrinkled. When I put one on, they don't lay flat, they are rumpled.Edit 18 MAR 2012Be absolutely sure that you check the package you receive. Make certain that it says these are Tall tees on the front.

However, such a work cannot be reviewed, only admired. This album ranks first among equals with Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, Rust In Peace, Divine Intervention, Aenima and (of course) Art of Rebellion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Really Enjoyed This Book!","review":"Superstition Mountain: A Ride Through Time was exactly what I was looking for to learn the history and folk lore behind the Lost Dutchman Gold Mine. The stories of the real people that lived on or near the Superstitions were extremely interesting. The book was well written and an easy read. Very informative and entertaining...After reading the critics negative reviews on this book, I had to conclude that they are bashing this work in order to sell their own versions. Honestly, any independent or objective reader could only give this book a double thumbs up.I'm hoping to locate and purchase the next book (Part 2) in the very near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausibility abounds","review":"I am quite willing to suspend disbelief when reading mysteries/thrillers -- to a point. However, as I read through this book, I found myself saying \\"oh come ON\\" just too often. The silly ending was bad enough (is there *anything* lazier/lamer than deux ex machina?), but what really bothered me were the attempts at character development. The characters' behavior and reactions were consistently stilted and inauthentic. Worst of all, by the end of the novel I didn't give two hoots about any one of them. I am an avid mystery reader and am especially fond of medical thrillers and series, but I feel no desire to read anything else about Joanna Blalock and her pals. Definitely, a tale of intruigue that was less than intruiguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaay out there","review":"*spoilers*The bizarre plot is that incredibly rich men screen their prospective wives for genetic compatibility, and then use surrogate mothers to birth children which will be close genetic matches, available to be killed to provide organ transplants for the father, if needed at a future date. The children are raised \\"like animals\\" under lock and key in a mountain-top compound in Los Angeles County. Meanwhile, the doctor in charge of this compound -- which is owned by organized crime, no less -- maintains his job as a respected surgeon at Joanna Blalock's hospital.The book opens with an attempted sniping by a man with a Ruger Mini-14 shooting .50 caliber bullets. However, the Ruger Mini-14 shoots .223 caliber bullets.There are almost as many murders in this book as there are references to how beautiful Joanna is.This book has few redeeming qualities; it's a definite pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"so many problems with this book","review":"Ok there are a few things I noticed wrong with this book. First, the quantities seem to be off, probably b/c the author is british, and the UK cups are different than the cups here. Second, the book is poorly organized - one would have to flip through most of it to find a recipe, since there are only four divisions - which I believe are appetizers, salads and light meals, main entrees, and deserts. And third, the recipes are just not practical to make - I like to try new things, but this book takes the exotic really too far. Plus she uses a lot of specialty ingredients that one would have to go hunting for. I found the whole book disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy Blondie compilation","review":"Blonde & Beyond was ment to recapulate to what Blondie stood for: punk and new wave. But it isn't !! Too many great Blondie songs are lacking and you hardly get anything in return.The only reason why I bought this album was for the spanish version of Call me and Underground girl. The rest of the album tracks is easy to get nowadays on their originally remastered albums. And if your not such a big Blondie fan to buy all their albums. You can buy their latest Greatest Hits remastered and contain 19 of their biggest hits. And if you want more Blondie try the excellent Platinum Blonde double collection, it gives you a lot more pleasure for your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, even better live","review":"I've seen Dope Smoothie live several times and their shows ROCK! This CD is great, too, but I feel that their sound keeps evolving into something greater.

On initial install the Carb diameter hole was a bit to small so the flame arrestor would not fit onto the Carb flange. This was corrected with a Dremel tool, after a small bit of grinding it slid right into place. The next step was finding a threaded rod log enough so the arrestor could be secured to the carb, after a trip to NAPA (local auto supply store) that issue was also corrected. Finally fired the boat up yesterday on muffs and she purred like a kitten and looks good too. Cant give details on performance yet but I am hoping K&N claims are as accurate as they say. One suggestion I have is, I would like to see an all inclusive kit with everything needed to do the job for your application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than one year,Poor Co. response, Not good for the earth..","review":"I bought a set of 5 surface mount sunspot lights. They looked great under my cabinets however after about 5 months the bulbs started to burn out. They where very expensive to replace about $5.00 each.Now 8 months later the entire set stopped working. I determined the transformer burned out.The transformer says it has a 5A fuse.There must be one somewhere in the molded plastic goop inside the transformer, but forget it you will not find it. The transformer can not be replaced or purchased seperate.These lights are not made to last.Good Earth Company totally ignored my emails. I am forced to purchase a whole new set. Total Junk!. Old one will be in the landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Strong Broadside by the Broadside Band","review":"The Broadside Band is featured on one of my most favorite albums of all time, a compilation of English tunes from the 17th Century, and they work their magic equally well here, focusing on Italian dances of the same period. One previous reviewer derided, without explanation, the musicianship displayed, a comment I couldn't disagree with more. The music itself varies from spritely to measured, and it comes in a variety of arrangements, displaying a reasonable spectrum of different instruments. It's a fine disc in its entirety, but the best of all for me is the eleven-minute Canario near the end of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"And Now for Something Different","review":"I often find myself with recordings by unfamiliar artists and expecting something quite different than what I get. Sometimes it's a disappointment and sometimes it's a pleasant surprise. This was neither. I was expecting a different style and did not care overmuch for the style I heard but I did recognize skill in vocals, instrumentation and arranging. This band is good at what they do; I just don't care overmuch for what it is that they do.The lead singer does have a beautiful voice. Every so often, just as I was beginning to enjoy her voice, another one would superimpose itself. I can't describe the second voice as much more than a berserk roar. It reminded me of old drill sergeants excepts that it was less intelligible. From the context, it seemed to be planed that way but I did not care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another singer with an angels voice","review":"As a major fan of Nightwish, Lacuna Coil and Edenbridge I thank Liv Kristine for adding her own magical talents to the world of music. From the first note of Lovelorn I was hooked, no run of the mill chords or lyrics here. Liv Kristine brings a magical quality to her voice ala Kate Bush. I recommend this album to anyone just getting into this type of music you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gang Starr - Daily Operation","review":"This album gets a 4.5 star from me. Falls shortly from bein 5. Guru is known for droppin ill rhymes on ill production. And he comes with it good on this album. Came out in 1992, so fairly old, but the replay value is high. All the songs on the album, I like them, all the lyrics you know of course, Guru is always keeping it real. Hell speak on girls, but in a more talented way, not a bubblegum way, which I repsect. Hell also speak on REAL topics, which gets all of my respect to emcees who do this. If you want a real hiphop album by a good emcee, then check this album out. And yes Guru has been known for having a lazy and non-enthusiastic flow, but hes on point with the lyrics and sh**, so just check it out.

Step into the arena is slightly better due to certain singles that appear on that album. Daily operation is dope from the album cover with the picture of Malcolm in the background, to the dope production by Premo, on down to Guru's lyrics. What really makes this album dope is the perfect marriage between the lyrics and the beats. Not that they are in union on other albums, but they appear to be a nearly flawless union on this album. My favorites on this album are.......THE WHOLE ALBUM, front to back. The lyrics and beats married on this album and gave birth to some DOPE HIP HOP. One star reviewers go eat a warm plate of cow dung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"A lot of these young people who never experienced rap before Kris Kross may not appreciate the artists who influenced the industry in the early days. I haven't forgotten the days when I used to jam to \\"Ex to the Next.\\" I love the fusion of jazz and rap. Premier has to be one of the greatest 3 djs in rap history. Genius doesn't come that often in the music industry. The greatest shame is when those who ARE are not well appreciated.

Ed Asner and Maureen Stapleton head a cast that includes Lawrence Pressman, Veronica Hamel, Gregory Harrison, Stephanie Zimbalist, Gail Strickland, Edward Winter, and more. Yes, the \\"dying man making amends\\" plot seems a little weepy, but this family interacts in a way that reminds us how real families are: lots of ruffled feathers that are ignored when the chips are down. My husband and I have a rare VHS copy of this gem, and watch it every holiday season with a fresh box of tissues nearby.With all the trash available on DVD these days, it's a shame that this film isn't similarly formatted for all to enjoy. In a nation supposedly concerned with \\"moral values,\\" people are snapping up far lesser efforts.

Had the movie not featured an actor that became a real life nihilistic Grinch, the movie had the potential to become a holiday classic that I'd play for our family each year. Instead, the movie gathers dust and my children have never seen it.The village scenes were filmed in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and the Asner's home in nearby Hudson. Chagrin Falls is where I grew up, so one might think sentimentality would lead me to plug the movie regardless of who acted in it. But such is not the case.Asner in real life turned out to be a far more unpleasant character than is portrayed in this movie. His politics disgrace the idea of a family reconciliation. His real life divorces overwhelm what passes for acting in this movie. Ed Asner is no Jimmy Stewart! Asner's acting in this movie would be more fondly remembered had he died when the character in this movie did. Sad what an ugly, angry man he actually became."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Great holiday movie. So glad to be able to purchase it and at a great price.

I know, he was my brother. Very few of them were two-fisted, beer-guzzling, ear- and nose-biting hoodlums. They were classy, nice guys who stole for a living. I grew up around these guys.

So after about 50 rds of 9mm we had broke two different welds, cracked a tube, and broke off a petal. 9mm @ 25 yds wouldn't even consistently spin the petals at the lowest spring setting so I'm not sure how this is expected to hold up to the advertised caliber sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I made the mistake of thinking \\"I'm just going to shoot a .22lr at it... even if all the reviews are true, it should hold up to that!\\". False. Even when I was puting it together right out of the box, I snapped two of the bolts in half while tightening them. Everything (the feet, the bolts, the spring and cam mechanism that makes the targets swing properly) is made of the cheapest metal Do-All could find to build something like this. I'm pretty sure my pellet gun would destroy this target. Do not buy anything from Do-All if this is any indication!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Not worth it at all. Took it out once, shot it with the approved lead semiwad cutter .45s and .357s and it sheared almost every pattle on the back. The little bolts came out and have sheared as well.

But if you appreciate the unadulterated fun ride that can be obtained from the pulps, and also like to know more about the heroes & villains, you need to read a few books. These include: \\"Encyclopedia of Fantastic Victoriana\\" by Jesse Nevins, and the twin volumes of \\"Shadowmen\\" written by Jean-Marc Lofficier. \\"Shadowmen\\" also include brief description of the original French pulp works which had hosted these personalities, tempting you to search for more.

They remind me a lot of The Wake, another mid-eighties group from Glasgow, but they have more homespun charm and weaker vocals. Unfortunately, their strongest, purest record \\"Sittin' Pretty\\" is long out of print, but their hipster cult is widespread and slavish enough to almost guarantee a reissue. On longer, more cacophonous tracks like \\"Baby Honey\\", they remind me a bit of The Jesus and Mary Chain and Spacemen 3. But for the most part, they sound like The Stone Roses, Ride and other Brit-pop bands you can't resist singing along with.

It seems more like a steamy romance novel, not the witty humor we've all come to know and love. Besides the fact the plot was incredibly repetitious, the characters acted out of the personality that was established in All-American Girl. Luckily I didn't buy the book, just borrowed it from a friend, so I didn't have to waste sixteen dollars on that lamentable piece of work.JUST A NOTE: If you really like Meg Cabot and are thinking about getting Reday or Not, don't waste your money just check it out from the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disgusting book!","review":"I'm glad i skimmed this before buying for my niece.

THE ENTIRE BOOK is spent with Samantha freaking out over whether she and her boyfriend are going to have sex or not. First of all, why doesn't she just ASK HIM??!?! Second of all, is it really all that appropriate for Meg Cabot to keep making insecure, teenage girl characters who seem to be completely and obsessively consumed with boyfriends, pop culture, and sex, even though she paradoxically makes them say things that would make them seem to be pretty politically/gender-relations conscious?I think it's totally ridiculous.Meg Cabot is slipping into cheap, money-making plots, and if it continues, her once-fabulous books will become pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready or Not?

However after reading it I can't help but feel let down and disappointed. The books main focus was on Sam wondering weather she should have sex with her boyfriend or not. Needless to say it became very old, very quickly. I think the entire book was a bit of a clich��. I do disagree a bit with some of the other reviewers; in that I think there is nothing wrong in handling the topic of sex (even with teens), but in this book it wasn't handled as well I thought it would be (Meg Cabot being the author).

I loved All American Girl, and was eager to read the sequel. However, this book had several huge problems that ruined it for me.First of all, Sam, who was a clever, funny and thoughtful character in All American Girl, has morphed into an annoying judgemental, and whiny character in this book.Second, the plot of this book is extremely weak, which explains why it is much shorter than the first one. Here's the plot summary: girl agonizes over whether or not to have sex, girl makes impulsive decision, and nothing happens as a result.Third, what little humor there was in this book was flat. It just wasn't funny.The only good thing I can say about this book was I was able to return it and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?: All-American Girl Series, Book 2","review":"1.5 out of 5 stars.

I was dissapointed to find out that the whole book whether or not Samantha Madison is ready for sex. The book jacket does NOT make it sound like that was what the book was about. Some things said were on the jacket was \\"hilarious\\", \\"spunky\\", \\"witty\\", and \\"great fun.\\" I don't think that's the case. As the book progreses, you think that Sam will make the right decision and say \\"no\\" to sex. But in the end, she agrees to sex. The author also made it seem like having sex, as a sixteen year old, is okay because Sam used birth control. As a preteen and a lover of previous Meg Cabot books I was extremely disapointed with the out-come of this book. I think it gave the wrong impression to teens. I found it disgusting, dissapointing, a let down, and a HUGE waste of time.

I didnt bother finishing it!Thankfully i went to the store and got my money back.Don't get me wrong here, Meg Cabot is one of my favorite authors, but this book is targeted at a much more mature audience. It says ages 12 and up in the book. However i would definetly not recommend this to any 12 year old.

I found her exciting refreshing and full of life. I'm not sure what happened to that character but she has completely disappeared in this book. This entire story is about one and only one thing sex. Sam doesn't know if she wants to have sex with David. That's all this book talks about. Not how school is, not her best friend, or her family, or college. Nope just sex.

It had classic, corny scenes (that are consistently in tween books), like that awful \\"i'm a slut\\" thing....but then it has the masturbating in the bath tub stuff and it was all horribly misplaced. WHAT WAS SHE THINKING!I would have LOVED this book if it was written right and ended with them having sex, but for the entire book, sam is constently talking about how she isn't ready for sex, but after seeing David without his shirt on.........well suddenly SHAZAM-they are in bed and de-virginized before you can say, \\"Wait, what?\\"This book was awful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme letdown.","review":"I love all of Meg Cabots books, and am always thrilled to hear when a new one is coming out. As I was with this one. After reading it I was totally appalled. ALL-AMERICAN GIRL was awesome, a sweet clean story. Sadly it seems Meg is turning toward the realm of society and accepting teen sex. Being a teen, I am sick of this immoral stuff being pushed constantly in my face. Ready or Not demonstrates this, making girls feel that if they are in a relationship it is EXPECTED to being having sex. If you are considering wasting $10 to buy this, save it for a better book. This is Megs worst book. For girls that read this, it totally sends the wrong image of what a relationship should be.

How anyone could call this innocent fun is beyond me. It's not even a good story! What ever happened to Ann of Green Gables? Why must we have this trash foisted on our children and YES teenagers are CHILDREN. Does anyone notice that STDs are climbing even with all this safe sex baloney?

All American Girl is my favorite book, so I have been awaiting the sequel for a while now. I wouldn't say I was disapointed... more of SURPRISED. I wish that instead of focusing so much on whether or not Sam is going to have sex, I think they should have elaborated on the messages in the book. Meg Cabot is a famous author. Girls read these books. She should at least encourage good ideas! Its fine that she put in premarital sex, but she should of said something about waiting until marriage. Still, I loved this book.

I'm not giving anything away, but literally the entire book just revolves around sex. And after a while, frankly, it gets quite boring. The characters, Lucy especially, are inconsistent, and overall I'd have to say this book could've stood a few more rounds through the editing process.It's still got a few good plot points and the main struggle of the story was a well-thought out idea, even if drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"To perm or not to perm","review":"This seems to be the question, only insead of perming her hair, Samantha is worried about having sex. That's it. Books about teenagers questioning about whether to have sex or not are important, but to have it in a forum where it is so lightly treated, and seemingly written for a 9-year-old instead of a teenager, well shame on the author. The reading level of the book juxtaposed with the content do not match. Sam ponders during the entire novel if she should take her relationship with the presiden't son to The Next Level, and in the end, nothing is a big deal, but it should be. This is a poorly written book with little substance of narrative value. I enjoyed the first book and will pretend the series ended there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Arrived incorrectly assembled and with no obvious way to correct it.

The box cautions the user to be careful during installation and states that the coating will not hold up to certain pick materials like metal picks (cymbal brass, finger picks, and the like.) I was very careful to install my strings as my guitar has a \\"string through body\\" design. I inspected the strings after they passed through the body, and again after they passed through the tuning pegs. After verifying the strings were undamaged, I tuned and played (Using a nylon pick of strong/hard resilience. After 2 sessions of around an hour an a half each, very obvious wear had taken place on almost all of the strings in the area of my picking.

She has the ability to create characters who live in your mind long after the last page is read. Jake is a tortured hero with a haunted past and Stephanie is a determined woman who comes to New Orleans to look for her younger sister. The storyline that weaves around these characters is breathtaking. The added bonus to the story with the addition of Shondra, a teenage runaway, was great. Also, the detailed description of New Orleans as well as Jake's Cajun accent made this book an awesome late summer read.

I'll burn the mp3 myself though, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 CD's Gordon's great early work","review":"This compilation consists of Gordon's first four albums over 150 minutes, 49 songs which is a great deal and great listening. As noted in other reviews of this compilation, this includes the work that he recorded in 1966-1968. The singing and songwriting on this is classic and artists ranging from Marty Robbins, Peter, Paul & Mary, Bob Dylan, Elvis, Barbra Streisand, Sarah MacLachlan, George Hamilton IV, Glen Campbell, Kingston Trio and many artists have covered much of this work over the years. \\"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\\" is arguably one of the greatest songs Gordon ever wrote. He did re-record some highlights from this set on Gord's Gold but these versions remain the best versions of these songs. You can get this music on import CD's but you'll only be spending more money and also \\"Black Day In July\\" is a must hear protest song and is one of my favorite early Lightfoot songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best work ever recorded by Gordon Lightfoot","review":"This is a terrific collection of Gordon Lightfoot.

Although these are his early works, these cuts show all the aspects of Lightfoot's talents that we have come to expect in his most popular albums (and there are some real surprises here as well). The albums that these two disks take their tracks from are \\"Lightfoot\\" from 1966, \\"The way I feel\\" from 1967, \\"Did she mention my name\\" from 1968, \\"Back here on earth\\" from 1968, \\"Sunday Concert\\" from 1969, plus many non-album singles from those years.

Reminiscent of The Ice Storm and other such dramas exploring regret and poor decisions in life, the film does not uplift or even attempt to lie to the viewer. That is not to say that Lantana is not without morality; honesty maybe the film's most admirable quality.Some may find Lantana uncomfortable and too attuned to the dregs of human relationships, but it's the constant reminder of the complexity of tragedy that keeps audiences aware of others' feelings and perspectives. As with The Ice Storm, the film allows characters to do what they will, for good or evil or something in between--the something that most people experience. In the depths of dark characters doing dark things, something good--even if it's only a lesson--must bloom."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Good 6 Degrees of Seperation type of film!","review":"this Film was truly 6 Degrees of it's Characters.interesting Vibe within all the folks involved.the only thing that Hurt it was the fact that there wasn't much Mystery&everything gonna is predictable.Anthony Lapaglia was Alright.He is a Good Actor but something always keeps Him from given that KnockOut Performance to me.the pacing of the film moves along alright.I'd say this film was between a 3&Half to a 4.it's a Good watch but Missing a Stronger Mystery Element from being a Must see.still worth a Strong Watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it is not!","review":"To me, this movie is more of a character study on marital relationships than a thriller.

I expected to enjoy the movie but I was bored with it from beginning to end. So there's a chance that other people will be bored by it as well.The good news is that the acting is excellent throughout, especially from Anthony LaPaglia. The actors do everything that they can to bring each scene to life. Yet very few scenes in this film ever do spring to life. All the numerous characters ever do is mope around and look forlorn and writhe in existential pain. The movie unfolds in an unyielding monotone of glumness.I stayed with this film until the end, sighing in exasperation throughout. Then I put the dvd back in its case and placed it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful in what humanity can do....","review":"WOW is that i can say about this movie.

His performance alone is worth going to see this film. And the supporting cast, from the always great Geoffrey Rush and Barbara Hershey on down the line is pitch perfect. A moody thriller who draws it's greatest level of suspense not from bloody violence, but from occurances in everybody's daily life. A unique filmgoing experience that deserved a far bigger audience.

In his book, Tough Questions Jews Ask, he responds to questions that have been asked by his students in the hope that his book will be a guide to young adults in building a Jewish life.Rabbi Feinstein suceeds beautifully by answering some of the toughest questions anyone--regardless of age--can ask, and providing his deep, wise and often unpredictable responses in a way that both young and old can appreciate and understand. Such questions as: What are we here for? Why do terrible things befall us? Why pray and what do we pray for? are explored.The book contains insightful questions and the Rabbi gives meaningful answers. Ultimately one lession of the book is that we grow by learning to ask the right questions, listening to the responses and then asking even deeper questions.This book is great for anyone interested in growing, learing and asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product...a little smaller than expected","review":"Over-all this is a nice griddle with a need for another couple inches of cooking area.I read other reviews and came to the conclusion that people aren't always realistic in their expectations. This griddle is well made and came pre-seasoned. It is a little smaller than I had hoped due to a fat drain on one end of the griddle so there is barely room to make 4 pancakes and flipping the cakes often ends up in overlapping. If you are cooking items that need to have the fat run off, it works well and is a nice feature. But just 2 more inches would make a big difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small signs - if you can find them","review":"I've used these decals to create small artwork for the sides of my truck.

I've been reading Maron's Deborah Knott books since the beginning of the series and this is one of the better ones. I don't like the ending, though. It seemed too easy. One of the charms of this series how Maron talks about Knott's large family. You're actually able to tell her 12 brothers apart! And there are a few poignant passages about Knott's mother, who died when she was a teenager. In fact, the only book in the series that I really didn't enjoy was one that didn't discuss her family. It is called Killer Market and it is about the North Carolina furniture market. Anyway, this is a good book. It's not high literature, but it's not trying to be. It was entertaining and it gave me something to do during a boring plane ride (and it's nice that we have boring plane rides, isn't it?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Denouement","review":"I found this book abandoned in the departure area of an airport and picked it up. I have never read any of Maron's book and had a few hours to kill, so I gave it a whirl.

I was eventually sucked into the plot, and I soon found myself rushing to find out who done it. The denouement left me totally unfulfilled, which is a great shame. Far too many questions are left unanswered. How did the killer know she would be registered at that hotel under that name? Was the crime premeditated? Who was she going to meet that evening? Without giving away the ending, I don't want to ask more questions in this forum. Suffice it say there are many more unanswered questions.

If Gardiner and the Monteverdi Choir have performed a Bach Cantata, snatch it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight","review":"J. S. Bach lavished his inventive genius on the cantatas he wrote for weekly church services, and they are altogether too little known. This recording features three cantatas for the First Sunday in Advent (the only Sunday in Advent at which concerted music was sung). All three are built around the great German Advent hymn \\"Nun komm der Heiden Heiland,\\" written by Martin Luther. Despite their common reliance on this hymn, there is no tedium here; each cantata has its own distinctive voice and message.Gardiner conducts vital performances. Outstanding among the soloists is the silvery-voiced Nancy Argenta. Those who claim that historically informed performance practice and early instruments give anemic results have not heard performances like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item...","review":"I appreciate the prompt delivery of this headdress, I grant you that.

The radio is also only so-so, static, medium volume. Using the solar energy means keeping the thing under full daylight for hours.

These should be packaged together.

I have had it for years and read it back and forth but it doesn't teach that much. And I see too much of the non-native editor behind some of the work. I don't understand why the female voice on the CD (most likely that of the editor) is a non-native speaker with strong English accent. And I was never able to pronounce words written in the orthography, I think it is too complicated.

It feels good to be buoyed along on those one-of-kind Mercer/Feelies rhythms and Mercer's soothing voice. I'd put it right up near \\"The Good Earth,\\" yet it is no re-hash. The songs on this feel warmer, offer more space, and the tempo is easygoing compared with the urgency felt in most tracks on \\"The Good Earth.\\" Ironically, the only song I don't care for (hey, just me) is the title track, \\"Wheels in Motion.\\" Sounds like some unmemorable 80s Brit-pop song, not much of a melody, droning, and saccharine (musically).

I never get tired of it.

Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it.

The plot was original, and the Creeper was freaky. The two lead actors (Pillips and Long)were great portraying brother and sister, you could almost believe they were ciblins. The Creeper's truck was scary in itself, and was a nice little touch to the movie. The song \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" in the movie added the errie effect, and I get the shivers whenever i hear it. Trish(Gina Phillips)looked beautiful in the movie so it wasn't to hard to keep my head tuned to the screen. I liked the overall look of the Creeper.

The writing--Most of the audience wasn't sure if they should be laughing or if they were supposed to be screaming. There was nothing scary about this film.

It created a mood very similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sadly, from there, it sank like a rock. A particularly heavy rock. Like so many other horror films it quickly degraded into an accidental comedy. I like a good monster movie, but this wasn't one of them.

Let's face it, the acting all over this film was appalling. The main problem with the film is the villain. The film loses total credibility when you see what he is - a bat-like figure with wings who hungers for human flesh, that tries to dress like a man. I mean, come on!

The main characters are Darry, who is at least 18, and his older sister Trish, who i guess is about 20 or 21 years old. while coming home from school, they run into the creeper who is thought to be human, but turns out not be. terror and chaos ensues. The ending says \\"we're going to make a sequel\\" all over it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not show that your scared!","review":"This movie is very good and original. The Creeper only goes after you when he smells something that he wants from you and this happens when show your scared. Now he does not kill everyone, but the ones he likes watch out!!! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. I would recommend to any horror movie fan! Plus the blu-ray has a clear picture with good sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm, Okay?!","review":"I had to watch the second one to fully understand the whole concept of this creature. My advice - just watch Jeepers Creepers 2. It is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeepers Creepers Just Can't Creep Enough","review":"I just saw Jeepers Creepers for the first time and what started out as a pretty suspense filled road movie ended up as typical schlock. I liked how this movie started with a brother and sister riding home and wind up being terrorized by a nut in a truck. This movie really had my attention through the first 45 minutes or so.The best scenes involved the discovery in the drainpipe and the scene with the police car. But once the movie came to the police station, it started irritating me. For one thing, I could not stand the pyschic woman actually announcing when the scare scenes would actually happen. Then there is the issue involving that ridiculous song. How cliche is that now? But what ticked me off was the movie's ending.(Or non-ending as it were). Obviously, it was to set up the inevitable sequel. It got off to a good start, but Jeepers Creepers ultimatly crashes into a wall of cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much wasted potential......","review":"The first, say, 90% of this movie was a chilling return to form for the horror genre, focusing on character development, and straying from the Scream formula as much as possible.So you've got a truly scary monster, very talented actors, and some great scenes. So why the two star rating? Plot. I found myself watching this movie, waiting to find out what this thing is, where it came from, and how it came to live in some hole in the ground in the middle of nowhere. The movie never cares to explain any of those things!These plot problems really shot my enjoyment of this movie. The worst part is the potential displayed in the first part of the movie, is completely shattered in under two minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"From thrilling to ...","review":"Why is everyone rating this 5 stars?The film started out brilliantly, and though I'm usually jaded with movies like this I was truly SCARED during the first half hour. Just from the abandoned church scene and \\"psycho truck\\" scene I felt like I got my money's worth (maybe) and the overall rating would then be 3 stars if it DIDN'T DETERIORATE INTO MINDLESS ... and an ending that was so ridiculous and insulting to the audience that no one even groaned--everyone had sort of a confused look, not wanting to believe the movie treated them as it, unfortunately, did. Pretty good acting and a a suspenseful intro aren't capable of redeeming this slop."},{"rating":"2","title":"jeepers creepers","review":"this movie has such an unusual plot and it doesn't flow or end like a typical horror movie. this makes this film a must have for all horror film fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeepers Creepers......","review":"I finally saw Jeepers Creepers today, and it was pretty bad. It was really good until the Darry kid went into the basement of the church and they showed close ups of the bodies. They were really fake and basically looked plastic. But the first 45 minutes of the movie was really good. But then it got kind of stupid and then continued down that road until it finally ended. Most movies end with some feeling of closure, but I would say that this was the worst ending of a scary movie that I have ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you don't want to be scared and just want a semi-suspenseful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy If Cheap","review":"Although I would rate Jeepers Creepers as an excellent horror flick, I was very disappointed in its video quality on Blu-ray. There are a few scenes where the blu treatment shines; but alas, they are few and far between. Audio is very good, however. If you have the DVD version and a decent up-converting player, I suggest you skip this one unless you can find it at a basement bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Scary As Hell\\"","review":"\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is about two teenagers who come in contact with an evil enitity known as The Creeper. This creature goes on a killing rampage inflicting terror on those who come in contact with him. \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" went on to be a huge boxoffice smash making nearly $60,000,000 and spawning a sequel called \\"Jeppers Creepers 2\\" that was just as good as the original. Producers have stated that a Part 3 and Part 4 will be made in the very near future with Victor Salva coming aboard again as the writer and director. This 2 disc DVD set features a slew of bonuses including deleted and extended scenes, an alternate opening, director's audio commentary, a featurette called \\"A Collection Of Mini-Featurettes on the Making of The Film\\", original trailer, and more.

I have seen Jeepers Creepers and it's not creepy. It's not scary, gory or suspenseful as promised either. The plot centers around two college students who witness a man disposing of two bodies, discover his underground \\"house of pain\\" and subsequently become wrapped up in his rampant little feeding frenzy. I have to hand it to the actors in this film (although I do question their judgment). They have done well with a poorly-written script and a shallow, unoriginal storyline. The majority of the film is slow. There are no clinchers, few plot twists and thanks to the brick-to-the-head subtlety of the foreshadowing, you know how it's going to end long before it actually does. Definitely not the edge-of-your-seat, you'll-have-nightmares quality film. In short: don't waste your money. Or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking when they made this movie!!!?","review":"This is just an awful movie. The only sequence that \\"scares\\" is at the police station. Don't waste your time and money watching this C-R-A-P with terrible actors!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Horror Flick","review":"OMG this movie was not scary at all, this movie must have been made with a budget of 1,000 dollars. I can't believe Clive Barker actully said this was a scary movie, The special effects were cheesy, i bought the movie for 7.00 at Block Busters, it's so bad, i almost went to get a refund for the money. Trust me if you don't want a Big Disappointment, then don't buy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm.....","review":"That is the worst - least scary - film I have ever seen.

None...."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would've given it zero if i could've","review":"This movie was horrible. I have never written a review before and probably never will again but, this movie was so bad i thought it was only fair that i warn any potential viewers.The first half hour of the movie gets you interested but its all down hill from there. They ask all kinds of questions about the killer but don't answer any of them. The whole point of the movie seemed to be lets sell as many tickets as we can for this movie and hope they come back for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aspect Ratio","review":"My only complaint has nothing to do with purchasing it, that is always good.

Still love the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I continue to be amazed how many disgusting ways in which the movie industry can find to kill or mutilate and all of the creatures that they can find to do it in the name of entertainment. This one is right up there with Last House on the Left. That was the last movie I saw where I wanted to walk out. I made myself sit there but this time, I walked out after 25 minutes. I walked out hearing people laugh as a creature was doing something totally disgusting. I wonder about our future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for cable","review":"I went and saw this movie based on recommendations from other people that raved about it. What a complete waste of money. Yes, the two main characters were great, but the predictability of this movie left me wondering where the so-called writer was going with it. Too many plot holes and it seemed as if they ended it because they ran out of money. Another disappointing horror flick. Wait for cable, cause I don't even think it is worth renting or pay-per-viewing. Another overhyped piece of trash movie! Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the comedy of the year","review":"A friend summed it up best- \\"oh, you mean the comedy Jeepers Creepers\\". For the 1st 40-50 minutes it seems to be heading somewhere, but it turns into the most ridiculous, unappealing waste of film I have ever seen in a horror movie- It makes the later \\"nightmare on elm street\\" movies look like film noir. I couldn't decide which was worse- watching this or hitting myself with a claw hammer. Pretty similar feeling. I think I'd prefer the hammer- just to prove what fools we the movie going public are, they have now made a sequel. Again, I recommend the hammer"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great...","review":"Jeepers creepers is basically a ripoff of many other horror movies from the 70's-80's era, mainly stealing ideas from the texas chainsaw massacre.The movie did have some good gore and makeup, along with a few good scenes, but the main problem with this movie is that it's nothing we haven't seen before. Also, the movie can become slow and boring at times. If you want to see a much better horror movie in the same vein as jeepers creepers, check out wrong turn instead.Rated R for Strong violence/gore, Language, and brief nudity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeepers!!

I heard many good things about it, and was very excited to see it myself, and then I actually saw it, and... I can't believe how BAD it was. I don't even begin to comprehend what people saw it in. The script was just INANE, it just did not make any sense at all- some of their ridiculous actions led one to question whether the characters were on drugs or something. There were plotholes (as can be expected from any horror movie), but they were just so glaring that they were unforgivable. There was one suspenseful scene in the whole movie- the one with the cats. I would not recommend this trash even for a late-night party. It was HORRIBLE- do not see. (And I do not give things one star lightly)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my Sweet Gawd!","review":"Im always up for a new scary movie. Now I just need someone to tell me why I wasted my time watching this one. It would have been a great movie had one understood what was going on for the first 98% on the movie. Even when it ended, I had to sit there and think to understand it. I have NEVER had to do that before. Creepers did have its scary \\"monster\\" and it did have a huge body count and it did make me bounce in my seat a few times. If thats what you are looking for, go for it.

Oh, I hope they don't make a sequel......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and engaging- shines above usual garbage...","review":"With very low expectations I rented this film recently, and was pleasantly surprised by its maturity and suspense. Granted, 'Jeepers Creepers' shouldn't be considered a 'classic'- but its genuine inspirations come from wonderfully subversive and eclectic sources, such as \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", \\"Duel\\" and \\"The Hitcher\\". Effective camerawork, scoring, editing and pacing escalate this thriller above the usual garbage- and it was so refreshing to see a film NOT rely on sanitary CGI effects for its shocks.Overall a good Saturday matinee film, the kind of which we haven't seen since the early 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ran out of gas","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer. This movie started out great but just fizzled in the end. Actually, it ran out of gas about the same time that Darry and Trish's car ran out of gas less than halfway through he film. That is where we get the diner scene that is a ripoff of Duel, and the introduction of the psychic character who dragged the story down. Shortly thereafter we get a glimpse of the sci fi (not horror) looking beast and we're ready for the credits to roll to save us from wasting any more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes","review":"from the horrifying beginning to the horrifying end, this movie is purely a adrenaline pumping ride, fueled with a believeable creature and a good cast, but that crazy lady who sees visions seems a little miscast and annoying some times. favorite part has got to be the ending. followed by a sequel 2 years later"},{"rating":"2","title":"you gotta love em'","review":"You have to love a bad guy who does his own thing. This movie keeps moving, without getting bogged down. The bad guy is bad, with blade (the movie) type moves. It's closer to a comic book than a horror film. Many will dislike the ending, but bad guys do bad things. The acting was well done, and although nothing really different happens in this movie, it did avoid the predictable idiot moves that most characters and action seems to make in horror films.The bad news is that the director forced a goofy song into the plot that we hear too often. Also there was not enough action. Still this one goes on the shelf at my home. Rent before buying, but I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just jeepers","review":"Well, sorry to disagree with everyone else, but this movie just lacked a certain something. I gave this movie two stars because it started out really good-nice and creepy, but kind of lost its momentum as the movie went on. I became bored and was just hoping it would hurry up and end. There was little detail on the origin of the creeper and not enough character development to make one care what happened to the characters. My advice to eager movie goers: go see Ghosts of Mars and The Others in the theatre and wait until Jeepers Creepers comes out on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"With your brains off...","review":"This is sheer enjoyment if you watch it with your brains in the \\"off\\" position. Even for the horror genre, there are actual plot holes as big as the hole where the Demon beast hide the bodies of its victims!!!!Other than this, there's no way for you not like the first half of the movie, where we are introduced to the brothers, the beast and a few of its preys. THen things get a little bit out of the hand with the history, bnut the overall result is a very satisfactory horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost made it","review":"I must admit the first hour of this movie scared me to death. After that it seems as though the writers and producers became uninterested and just wanted to get it over with. It became too Sci-Fi channel and not enough good old horror. A horror movie should stay true and not switch gears which this movie did absolutely terribly. It's almost as if they had 2 separate ideas for 2 separate movies but only enough money for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie with a lame ending","review":"This movie is good. In fact it is very good. It is definately one of the more original Horror Movies that I've seen lately. The first first half-hour is great and suspenseful (I'm a jaded 13 year old and it actually scared me once). The second act is pretty good as we finally see the Creeper. The third act in the police station is still pretty good. To bad they had to ruin it all with the final frame. I mean it's pretty cool. (I won't reveal it to those of you who haven't seen it) The problem is that the ending's to abrupt and unsatisfying. It also has one huge plot hole. One you see it you'll probably figure it out. Not to say it's bad, I mean when you look back on it, it's pretty cool, but in the moment it's really, really lame.Horror fans should see it, but beware of the final frame. It isn't pretty. Oh yeah, the song that represents the Creeper is great!Jeepers Creepers, where did you get those peepers? Jeepers Creepers, how did you get those eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling, original horror","review":"I've been a fan of horror films for over 30 years and this is one of the best I've seen in recent years. I found it to be extremely unsettling and the movie stayed with me some time after watching it, which is a good sign that the film succeeded in creeping me out! The only other films I've seen in recent years that affected me the same way were The Blair Witch Project and the original Japanese version of The Ring. I'm heartily sick of derivative slasher flicks cast with teens/20somethings that are boringly predictable, like Valentine, Urban Legends and the latest Halloween and Friday The 13th sequels, so this one was like a breath of fresh air to a jaded horror fan.The DVD is great. The special features are well selected and informative which is why I imported this one from the US. The Region 4 version contains no special features at all, so this version is definitely the one to own if you're interested in behind-the-scenes stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"Finally, a horror movie made for horror movie fans. All the B.S. is cut out of this interesting, suspensful, at-times-witty movie. It got straight to the thrills and chills with enough gore and surprises for all horror movie lovers. The plot is simple enough, a brother and sister are coming home from college (a realistic scenario for those of us in the younger generation) when they see a suspicious individual disposing of what looks like dead bodies. Natural curiosity ensues and the two are violently tossed into the mits of this killer. The relatively unknown actors add to the realism of the movie (no teen-idols added for the TRL fans). The fact that we we're seeing siblings removed all romatic elements that too often ham up newer \\"horror\\" movies. We are just given a straight \\"monster\\" movie. Is this movie an indication of the revival of the horror genre? Only time will tell. But \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a good start and a must-see for horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"Hollywood releases a good horror flick, i was actually surprised that this was good, all these other so called 'horror' movies hollywood have released in the past have been nothing but pre-fabricated teeny bopper krap (er, scream, urban l, valentine, the list goes on forever) Anyway, this is NOT your average teeny slasher flick (it's not even a slasher flick, really). Nope, this is very different, dark and filled w/ great visuals. Gore hounds would be advised to search elsewhere, as there is no gore at all.

I can get angry at each character by their actions. I don't khow why when they (Darry and his sister) were getting scared, but stood still to look at what the monster doing, and asking himself \\"what is this?\\".

However the show had practically no plot. There is a demon out killing people. The cops never get into his cellar and explore anything there where he ate people. They never tell why the demon is after the main character. I mean he wants the main character because otherwise there wouldn't be a movie at all but in the story they said the main character, Darry (Justin Long) had something the demon needed. Everytime I thought the movie was just about to get good, I was let down again. People show up in this movie for a short period of time that seem to know everything about this demon but the movie never explains their connection and how they know the stuff they know.

Of course, horror movies these days aren't meant to be scary anyways, so that was no surprise. But I'm quite disappointed in the fact that I really wanted to like this movie! I saw the previews for it and it looked good, so we rented it as soon as it came out. It's lucky that I had a crossword puzzle that needed to be finished, because otherwise I would have fallen asleep. I don't recommend this movie by any stretch of the imagination. If you want a good creepy movie, get The Ring. That one was good. This is NOT good. Not good at all. I'm still baffled as to why they bothered with a sequel, I certainly won't waste my money on it, and I can only hope that this doesn't turn into a franchise a'la Jason.

The first half of Jeepers Creepers is stylish and smart, despite the indulgent self-referencing \\"this is the part in scary movies when...\\" Once the \\"monster\\" or whatever it is enters the picture as such, though, all terror vanishes as the makers of this film seem to have hit a wall with the story. Granted, the gruesome end is disturbing, but that is partially because it is so arbitrary. As the credits began to roll my friend and I looked at each other as if to say \\"What?\\" We weren't alone.

Trish(Gina Philips) and Darry(Justin Long) are on their way home for Spring Break. When an old brown truck(BEATNGU) nearly runs them off the deserted country road. Later, they find \\"BEATNGU\\" dumping something in a sheet down a pipe. Of course, Darry, being the younger brother, doesn't listen to Trish. The pare end up on the scariest adventure of their lives.Justin Long and Gina Philips both give outstanding performances and Jonathan Breck is wonderful as \\"The Creeper\\". Victor Salva(writer and director) had a good plot and he really went with it. This was on of the best movies I've seen in years. I can't wait for Like a Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers 2 comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its alright.","review":"The movie starts off great, but in my opinion goes downhillafter the first 40 minutes. As for the bodies looking fake and all that.. they're supposed to be preserved!, they're not gonna look too alive and recent if the bodies have been dried out and preserved for 20~ years (a couple were 20 years old, who knows the age of the others!). When Trish ran out of the police station after her brother at the end, the doors at the bottom of some stairs in a back room were locked, and they say that they'll have to use the front door to get out, and Trish did use the front door, so that wasnt a mishap. There were many , MANY parts they could have gone for classic cliche's but they didnt. Even though some parts they did. The only thing I dont like, is the quality that goes downhill, and the monster part, if they made him a man and ended it differently, it would have been great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JEEPERS CREEPERS","review":"I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THIS CREATURE IN PERSON.THIS CREATURE HAS TO EAT FOR THREE WEEKS THEN GO TO SLEEP FOR 23 YEARS.THIS MOVIE IS OUTSTANDING.IT WAS DONE VERY WELL, THE ACTING WAS GOOD ,& LOCATION WAS PERFECT.I LOVED THE VEHICLE THE CREATURE WAS DRIVING, IN THE SEQUEL THE, THE DIDN'T USE IT.

I'll just give you a quick opinion of this movie... it's was weird as H-E-double-hockey-sticks, and freaky!The acting was excellent... unusual for a horror movie. This is a teen flick, but anyone that likes horror movies will like this one. Tons of totally gross parts throughout this movie will keep you freaked and grossed out!Sure this is full of holes and totally unbelievable... but a strange film that hasn't been done before.... but then, who could think this stuff up!! Like others that reviewed this film, I hated the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea!!! - Weak Ending!!!","review":"This movie started out great. It was edge of your seat scary with this nameless, faceless person terroizing these kids and no one is around to help them. It even keeps up the fear level when they confront this person.... And then it falls apart! The end, when this person is revealed, is such a let down that you just kind of say,\\"Well that was stupid\\". Even my ten year old who was experiencing her first scary movie thought it was dumb. If they could have thought of a more original ending instead of the cookie cutter it was, it would have been worthy of 5 stars. So rent it don't buy it and enjoy the first two thirds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film, but don't get attached","review":"I was excited to sit down, and finally have the time to see a movie. I love horror films, so this one I thought would be a good one. Through out the whole movie, I was entertained. Good acting, and good suspense, I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. I was really impressed with the movie until a couple minutes before the film was going to end, I realized the story was not being wrapped up. I was astonished to find out that the movie left us with no good ending at all -- evil prevails over good.

In the end I decided 2 but I could see if someone wanted to give 3.The good:1) First half of the movie.2) The creature before you actually see him.3) The truck he drives.4) The old school horror movie feel they try to give.5) The attractive sister.The bad:1) The second half the movie.2) The creature after you see fully see it.3) The physic.4) The stupid song.5) the fairly weak story.In short if they would have kept the creature a mystery a bite longer, took the physic out, and came up with a slightly better premise for the creature this movie would have been great. As it is, it's still fun, not great but fun. If you like horror movies and do not require it to have a deep plot or to wow you. This movie will entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this movie","review":"In a world where horror movies are nothing but stupid films about some psycho running around killing half-naked ... girls and dumb pretty-boy jocks for no real reason, this movie takes a different direction. this is a monster movie. i think it was done really well. if you haven't seen it, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better ending PLEASE","review":"Come on. The movie was great and the plot was excellent but the ending (...) blew. There was no ending.

( Whoever made that claim seriously needs their head checked ).It starts off very well, but after the scene in which we see the man put two bodies down a large pipe, it goes drastically downhill. The main pitfall of this movie, as in most horror movies, is that there are also too many unrealistic moments - namely who would be stupid enough to climb down the large pipe?The story seems to get more and more ridiculous as the film goes on, and by the end of it I had really lost my patience.If this is the best horror movie of the last ten years, then God help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I have to admit, I loved the first 15-20 minutes.

The killers truck has to be one of the scariest images i have ever seen!The rest of the movie is transformed into a very bad c-class tv movie with unbelievably bad acting, the dummest dialogues in the world and an ending that really makes you glad it has finished...It had great potential but was a disaster.

Superbly done. The rest of the movie...eh. Once we see the creature, it kinda falls apart.

I realize characters in scary movies are supposed to do stupid things but these people just did way too many stupid things especially the character Trish. For the majority of the movie I was just wishing that the monster would just off her because she was just a tad bit too annoying. The monster is going after Trish and Darry because it wants one of them yet numerous times throughout the movie when it had ample opportunity to get them it for some unknown reason decides instead to kill other people.

But on the whole, though it sticks to the rural formula, the movie is very good. The script is believable, they spare us the usual teenage sex subplot, and the director is smart enough to keep the monster hidden until the very end of the movie. (Turns out that's not quite long enough, but we can forgive him). Shades of both Texas Chainsaw and Spielberg's Duel, and some very original gross-out stuff that's pretty tastefully done. For every hundred terrible horror movies, you get one good one, and I'd put this one in that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to good horror movis?","review":"I bought this movie thinking that it might be good. Boy was I wrong. I was amazed that every turn the characters would do exactly what I thought they would and in such a stupid fashion it wasn't even funny. That is the problem with new horror movies. They have absolutely no plot and no fun or spunk to them. What happened to the good ole classic 80's horror movie that was cheesy and dumb but smart? And you knew that it was going to be cheesy and dumb, but it was cool and smart anyway. I think that the movie industry needs to rethink their whole attitude toward these new movies that they are making. NO ONE LIKES THE FORMAT!!

The Creeper is actually scarier when you don't see him or know what he looks like. The opening truck sequence is effective (even though it borrows from Spielberg's DUEL). The movie gets insanely dumb and unbelievable at the halfway point. The ending is not very creative and just does not go indepth about who or what the Creeper is. The Creeper's design was also a little dissappointing It looked like a guy wearing a latex halloween mask. Also, the stupidity of the teenagers was pretty annoying.

The scariest thing about this movie was that it brought in a single penny at the box office.Watching the characters do the dumbest possible things scene after scene was annoying, and if I hadn't seen it in a theater with a lot of people making funny comments, I would have walked out. Aside from some grotesque imagery at various points in the movie, there was nothing scary in it.

I mean it felt so abrupt u almost forget how good the rest of it is. But as I saw last night at the movies seeing 28 Days Later(great movie with a good ending) they are making a sequel so thats cool. The first half hour as many have said was GREAT and the rest was really cool so definitly see this if u like horror movies and the only bad thing about it is the ending. Hope U Like it,Later"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stunk!","review":"Hi, ...This movie just stunk. I wasn't scared, I thought this movie was pretty funny!! I can't believe they even made a movie like this!... YES it was that bad! Please if you plan to watch this movie, take my advice and forget about this ...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Director's commentary","review":"I won't write too much about the film itself, other critics have done that for me. In short, being a big fan of horror films, I would say that this movie adds a new dimension to the horror genre, and you should enjoy it if you have enjoyed other films in the same field. One extra comment I would add is that the director's commentary on the DVD is well worth listening in to. I learned so much more about what he was trying to achieve with certain scenes. Unlike many other commentaries, I was happy to listen to this throughout thew entire film."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Jeepers' will give you the 'Creepers'.","review":"This movie was great! I loved it a lot. The beginning was extreamly frightening and bloody. Gina Philips who plays the sister Trisha is HOT as hell! The Creeper is more scarier when you don't see his face. He could have been more scarier, but who cares, Jeepers Creeper is scary as hell and is so kick-[behind]! I was on the edge of my seat and totally horrified. Yes, I am asking the same question everyone else is asking, \\"Why did they go back?\\". I agree that they should have just drove off. I still don't care because this movie was scary and awesome! The ending was good and takes place at a police station like the 'Resident Evil' video games. ..., the movie was a spin-chilling movie with lots of chills and thrills! So what's eating you? Go see this movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I would like to know cookieman exactly where you purchased your edition of Jeepers Creepers from. On your say-so, I purchased the edition available here since the one out here in Australia only has a director's commentary and being a big fan of this film, I wanted as much extra material as I could get. Guess what? It's the same edition....Where did you get it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Movie.","review":"I have to say that I am one of few people that have watched this movie that liked it. I think it is worth a watch especially if it is under $5 like when I purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna Get Just Plain Scared? See JC!","review":"If you want to get just plain scared, go see \\"Jeepers Creepers\\". However, take someone with you to hold on to. It has the ingredients of classic horror flicks of the past and the sounds, scenes and expressions are a script for terror. I felt my skin crawl for the first hour and jumped out of it (my skin, that is) five times. It's been a long time since a film has had that effect on me...and I'm an avid horror flick fan. It has bits and pieces of \\"Cujo\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\", \\"Poltergeist\\" and a little-known low-budget classic \\"The Funhouse\\". I give the first hour FIVE stars. It drops to an overall rating of 4 as the horror dwindles and dwindles and dwindles. But you are so frightened from the outset, it keeps you on your seat till the end. Only two nagging points --- the sound of the failing transmission in Trish's Chevy...and Darryl's overused facial expressions of terror. Other than that...GO SEE IT! It'll give you the creeps...jeepers creepers, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been......","review":"I'm going to have to agree with the reviewer from Greece below - this film HAD potential. The first half, with 'Duel'-like cat-and-mouse game as well as the menacing figure of the Creeper dumping bodies into the sewer worked very well. The church added a nice, gothic touch and the rural setting pumped up the atmosphere very nicely....then....well.....things started getting really stupid.The Creeper, once revealed, looked really unconvincing - looked like a guy in a mask. The plot got pretty convuluted and silly, offering answers with no explinations/back story other than to move the plot along. It became, just like past reviewers said, a C-Grade horror flick at best. Dumb dialouge, dumb effects, dumb all around, Jeepers Creepers became a poor man's Nightmare on Elm St, barely rising above that franchises tired sequels, and it really failed to live up to it's first half hour of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made!","review":"I have never seen a more inconsistant, worthless movie as this...it's not even slightly scarry.

But this pile of garbage was crap from beginning to end. The first time you heard that song you knew what was coming there were no surprises whatsoever. with an abrupt and rather horrendous and predictable ending the film had little pay off for all its hype. Oh and for more joy why not check out the alternate ending on the DVD. which isn't any better then the original (in fact for those people that don't like the bad guy winning type endings may find it even more depressing. Is that both bro and sis in that scene on the wall?).

When I started watching it, I was reminded of Neve Cambell in \\"Scream\\" when she says people in horror movies always do the exact opposite of what they should. The two actors in this film did a pretty good job with the pathetic characters they were playing. When the creature comes after them, they stand and watch. When they should be going to the police, they go back to investigate themselves or sit in the car and again, watch the creature come after them. The whole way through the movie, I was screaming, \\"What are you doing idiot?\\" I should have asked myself that for watching this stupid film to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This is the kind of horror film I love. The characters are well-rounded, with real dialogue and (usually) logical actions. The pace is swiftly moving, and the \\"monster\\" is interesting and legitimately scary. This movie was way better than I thought it would be, and I thought Justin Long put in a great performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"In the first minutes of the film, these two kids drive by a house where they see a spooky looking guy dumping a body down a rusty drainpipe. Do they go tell the authorities? No! They actually turn around and one of them goes DOWN THE PIPE HIMSELF! The best part of this movie was the ending, since what happens to this same character will keep him from passing on his truly defective genes. Unfortunately, the same thing won't happen to the cheese vendors who produced this [awful] movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeepers, this movie is the pits","review":"Every once in a while a movie comes along that, despite the fact that it has kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, is totally ruined by the ending. I'm sorry, but I hate endings where the villain wins. This movie was terrifying . . . sure. But the thrill, at least to me, is to see how the heroes will finally overcome the villain. And that doesn't happen in this movie. If it had a better ending, it might have gotten four stars. One is as far as I'd go now, and this is only because I can't give it zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great start but a pitiful finish.","review":"All the reviews I read about this movie talked about the \\"incredible beginning\\" and the \\"fresh take on the genre.\\" Sadly, this movie was a major disappointment. Yes, the movie seemed from the start to be worth the time. Fifteen minutes into it, though, the whole room of us watching started our catcalls to the screen. \\"What the heck?\\" \\"Oh, that is SO stupid.\\" \\"Oh man, that is pathetic.\\" And it only got worse from there.Despite some truly startling moments, the movie itself descends into silly and laugh out loud scenes. By the end - yes, we forced ourselves to watch it all - we were all checking the bottom of the screen to see if the guys from Mystery Science Theater were watching with us. After an hour and a half of silly, you won't care what happens to anyone in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeepers Creepers - Where do I get a refund?","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I hope Dorothy Kliewer will read this because she needs a NEW EDITOR! The editing on this very good story is unacceptable. As I said, the story is good; however, sometimes the language usage is stilted or unnatural for the character. In fact, I got so mixed up on who was who that I had to write down names & look back in the book to see who they were. Sometimes, characters appeared like I should have known who they were or I should have read the previous books! I strongly suggest she contact the editor for Laurie King, Nancy Atherton or John Grisham. At least, their editors know how to put the story together in a better & more readable way."},{"rating":"1","title":"rollers?","review":"I hadn't bought this brand of rollers in almost 40 years, but didn't think they would have changed.

It does make the water feel \\"softer\\" but also very cloudy and does not seem to have enough chlorine to maintain adequate levels in the water as I was never able to get my chlorine levels to register above .5 no mater how many I put in my skimmer. It also leaves a residue on your skin and pool. Maybe they were intended to be a supplement to a straight chlorine, but the instructions are so vague it's hard to tell.

If you are looking to buy a book on GSM and are happy learning very little about any of the details of that wireless network, then by all means, this is for you. I've seen free tutorials that you can download off the internet that explain more about GSM and GPRS than this book does. For that matter, you can can learn more about the GSM network in some books that don't even have GSM mentioned in their title. What is this author thinking?

The son of a grocer, Cook also was responsible for devising a prevention for scurvy, a terribly debilitating scourge of sailors, and for accurately measuring latitude so that discoveries would not be lost to future navigators.

But others don't-these are the real gems. Even the predictable ones make good reading- Wellman uses folklore, history and setting to enrich even the slightest tale. He has great skill in recreating the settings and people of the mostly rural areas in which he sets his stories.All of these stories are very short, perfect for picking up and reading a couple at bedtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted Less than one year,Poor Co service,Not good for the earth","review":"I bought a set of 5 surface mount sunspot lights.

A good knife should last for decades! I would think that a loose handle (there are other reports of similar) is a recall-worthy flaw!Beyond this, the supposed antimicrobial properties of the rubber grip have not prevented a black discoloration that looks like mold from occurring UNDER the rubber at each end of the handle on both knives. No amount of washing seems to remove this ugly blackness.The scalloped steel blade does hold a good edge and I wanted to like these knives and use them for a long time.

I am not sure who is to blame here, because this is the second book that I have had to buy from this publisher. Both books really stink, but \\"Calculus With Analytic Geometry\\" makes road kill smell like the perfume section at Macy's. First of all the book is not laid out in a way that it clearly explains the topics. Second of all, and this probably should be first, there are very few examples, and the examples that are given use arbitrary variables, so the examples are hardly different than the definitions...so why have examples at all! I would strongly recommend \\"Calculus\\" Seventh Edition Larson-Hostetler-Edwards. While it costs nearly twice as much, it is more than worth the extra money if you want to pass your classes.

However, in this case, Norton has taken the many reports written by the regimental commanders and presented them as is, some with his own added comments. This presents a less biased view.

The Upper Peninsula Bissells are not, however, related to the Lower Michigan Bissells of vacuum cleaner fame. Little Tommy Bissell (what we call him here) has written a lot that we in the U.P. have not always been happy with, but we're proud of him. This is a really good book--especially for a U.P. kid who I watched almost flunk out of high school! I guess Tommy has always been good at making enemies, the \\"brainy little know it all\\" that he is!! He came and spoke in his home town and we went out to see him. He gave a moving talk and read from Chasing the (Aral) Sea. I'd never heard of it. But now I have. That's a service. I feel smarter. Everyone should leave Tommy alone now and let him write another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I was a bit daunted by the prospect of reading a book about an environmental disaster in an area of the world I knew little about, but I couldn't have asked for a better guide than Tom Bissell.

Our daughter Carolyn was a Peace Corps worker in Kyrgystan from 1999-2001 and loved the experience, and my husband and I spent 4 months in Tashkent in 2001 with IESC. We counted it as a great experience and visited Samarkand and Bukhara. Tom described things so well and especially explained the Aral Sea disaster so that anyone can understand it. His use of words and similies are excellent. He has a wide vocabulary. This book is a must for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authorial response","review":"Yo, Bobby Sherman, from Tashkent.

No? That's what I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"The McWeeniazation of Central Asia","review":"I lived in Central Asia, both as a student and a soldier.Judging by this book, Tom Bissell lived in the United States and wrote this book based on his experiences reading Travel Planet guides in Starbucks.The book is written in a condescending tone, and when it is not merely condescending, it is dehumanizing towards the native population.How many people did Tom actually befriend? How many women did he date? How many Central Asians did he share a laugh or a smoke with? From the tenor, tone, and content of this book, apparently none.[...]Life is not a creative writing workshop assignment.

Khidoiatova was pregnant, and under Uzbek law was therefore supposed to have been released on bond. The Uzbek authorities sidestepped this nicety by forcibly aborting her fetus. The former ambassador, for his part, now lived under protection in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"This is the worst travel book I've ever read! It is totally ignorant! Tom Bissell should have stayed out in the sticks of Escanaba, Michigan. What's the point of travelling if it only makes you a more strident white supremacist? The book contains loads of very racist remarks about Uzbeks and Central Asians. He frequently strays away from his intended subject matter, which was supposed to be the Aral Sea, to share his air-head sensibilities. This book is a total waste of time and no one who truly values being informed would enjoy a book about Central Asia written by an Archie Bunker wannabe! This book really makes Americans look like stupid fools."},{"rating":"2","title":"A distant journey, an inward quest","review":"The author writes from a fund of historic knowledge about a place little known to most Americans, Uzbekistan. He had served there briefly in the Peace Corps and went back as a journalist conducting a study of the demise of the Aral Sea. It takes most of the book to get there but the journey is rich with people, experiences and personal discovery. I found him a man worth knowing, a gifted writer honestly engaging the reader as he recounts a modern day Asiatic trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have All The Editors Gone?","review":"I read the Harper's piece that Bissell wrote about the Aral Sea and it was great - it certainly fired up my interest. Then I read the book and I found myself wishing that he'd let the editors at Harpers take a pass at it.Overlong, and filled with details that were neither illuminating nor interesting. Particularly irritating is Bissell's diatribe against writer Robert Kaplan. Whether Bissell is right or wrong, the spleen has no place in a book about HIS impressions of Uzbekistan. Ultimately, who cares if another writer got it wrong, it's completely immaterial.This would have been a very interesting book if it remembered to get to the point and stay focussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I have read various passages in this book, and while the basic intent seems up to snuff, the heart and soul are lacking, and thus the execution falls short. One of the passages which first alerted me to the shortcomings was Bissell's experience riding in a train car, and relating it to the death trains of WWII. Not only is such a comment out of context, but it also seems as irreverent as it is irrelevant.Even though it seems Mr. Bissell traveled to Central Asia, it doesn't seem he ever leaves Manhattan. All of Central Asia is centered about him throughout the book, which would be fine if it were a work of fiction.The book seems warped by a strange field: a sense of insiderism--from beginning to end. Much of it seems overwritten.Alas, it is a first book from a seemingly inexperienced author. Let's hope for more content and less hype next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Fine Book","review":"This is a powerful and moving exploration of a country and people written by a young writer who fully admits to his own limitations and then, surprisingly, triumphs over them. I don't really understand the spleen vented over this book in these reviews--until I learned that Bissell wrote a magazine article about a bunch of foul-tempered literary anarchists and got on their bad side. That might explain some of the hysterics about this deeply concerned and humane book, which is filled with humor and life. (Bissell uses way too many arcane words, though--and not always correctly. He also insults Canadians.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great-But What About Jimmy Van Heusen?","review":"Sammy Cahn wrote many of Frank Sinatra's biggest hits, most of which were co-written with Jimmy Van Heusen who deserves a collection of his own.

They don't sound anything like the Strokes, the White Stripes, Moron 5, Mother Mary, Santa Claus or the easter bunny.Why do \\"music critics\\" try so hard to box up bands they review and slap a comparision on them. I guess it's just a cynically charged way of saying they've been there and done that. Like anyone really cares what they think anyway. Yuck...The Cold War Kids mix a bit of Soul (their vocals) with a bit of Indie and some old New York Punk feeling. I would say their are similar to the Walkmen or Spoon, but you can decide for yourself.This album is worth buying if you are interested in hearing something different, yet pleasing to the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid but not Great","review":"Hang Me Out to Dry is the single and probably what steered you the Cold War Kids. If you like Hang Me Out to Dry than you will like the album because it does not stray too far from what it does best. My favorite song is Tell Me in the Morning, which is song #3 but by song #5 the album sort of bleeds together and you are ready to start hitting the skip button. You can not blame a band for sticking to the same sound thru an entire album, but it does get somewhat old fast. Once again if you like Hang Me Out to Dry than you most likely will like the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half of cd is awsome, the rest is ok.","review":"As a prog rocker, I'm used to a little more change up in songs on an album.

Makes me want to hear thier next cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock'n Roll meets Blues!","review":"Robbers & Cowards is for those who are seriously bothered of listening to the same music under different names. Starting with three upbeat top tune (We Used To Vacation, Hang Me Up To Dry, Tell Me In The Morning) you already find yourself cave in to the positive energy of Cold War Kids. And then Passing The Hat comes along which will lead you stay restless all the way. You finally hit the climax by Hospital Beds rears up. True satisfaction!Such young band with such rich content of feelings to spread around. From enthusiasm to sadness this album moves you between shapes; God Make Up Your Mind puts you in Soul mood where you feel Blues all around in Saint John, Rubidoux weeps into your heart peacefully where Sermons vs. The Gospel (hidden track) knocks you off unexpectedly.Handing thought provoking lyrics and stimulating tunes, I can honestly tell Robbers & Cowards is the best album released in 2006.Thank you Kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These Kids Grew On Me","review":"I was introduced to this album by my cousin, whose brother and the band members are friends.Initially to me, they sounded like Franz Ferdinand, but with a more interesting sound to their music. At the same time, there were elements of Maroon 5's soul rock, but Cold War Kids created their own alternative (indie) rock music, completely unique and completely different from all the groups out there now. Most impressive.The lyrics in most of their songs sound like a twisted reflection of life, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. I found their music very refreshing as compared to all the groups out there now. Out of all the tracks, I enjoyed Robber, Red Wine, Success, We Use To Vacation and Hang Me Up To Dry.This album really grew on me to the point that I'm asking myself to look-out for the dates they're dropping by for a concert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful","review":"I owned over 5000 records and have a wide ranging taste.

The tale of Japan's initial fear of and rapid adaptation of Western technology , its first conflicts with European powers, its conquests, its efforts to take all of Asia under its control, its conflict with America, its being managed by Gen. MacArthur after the Second War, its prosperity, the threat its growth seemed to represent to the American community, its world- power status economically, the tensions of seventies and eighties economically.Rose speaks to Ambassador to Japan Howard Baker, and to Japanese minister here Kato.

This album captures 18 wonderful songs done as only Peggy Lee could do them. An added plus on this album, is the inclusion of a previously unreleased song \\"Deep Purple\\", recorded in 1961 with orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones. This is not a 'Greatest Hits' album...this is more of a 'Showcase' album. Yes, there are some hits here, like \\"Fever\\", but also a lot that were not hits. The booklet contains an informative 6 page essay about Peggy. As much a jazz singer as she was a pop singer, this album should belong in any music lovers collection. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this on CD and treasure it!","review":"If you're a fan of jazz, pop, swing, Peggy Lee, or music in general, buy this album. From the first track, \\"I've Got the World on a String\\" to the wistful \\"The Folks Who Live on the Hill\\" this album showcases one of the best collections of standards and one of the best voices ever to sing them. The original take of \\"Fever\\" from 1958 is included in this album and still sounds hot 40 years after the studio session.Peggy Lee's voice is in its prime on these cuts, featuring her versatility in mood (up-beat, cheated-on, in love, dreamy) and rhythm and wonderful orchestration. A number of tracks are directed by Frank Sinatra-- who can resist? Looking for sultry? Yep, that's here too in \\"Deep Purple\\" under the direction of Quincy Jones.A must-have for long-time Peggy fans, it's also a great introduction into her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"If you want and ending.......well don't watch this one!

The premise of telling the same story as both comedy and tragedy is poorly executed. The dramatic story works only slightly better because it is graced by superb performances by Radha Mitchell and Chloe Sevigny. The comic story features a turn by Will Ferrell as an Allen surrogate that is almost painful to watch. My jaw drops at how talented actors, probably working for scale, would involve themselves in such dross just so they can get on their resumee that they were in a Woody Allen film. I'm also amazed that the studios continue to bankroll Allen's self-indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea, Not Great Execution, 2.5 Stars","review":"Typical Woody Allen characters: pseudo intellectual New Yorkers pondering over the tragic or comic life path of a woman, Melinda, played reasonably well in a duel role by Radha Mitchell. The story unfolds quickly to reveal the simultaneous paths of Melinda as a tragic alcoholic basket case and as an insouciant romantic. Sounds like the makings for a classic Woody Allen flick. Unfortunately nothing really works. Melinda is a very unlikable character in either situation as are all of the people in either story line. Furthermore, Will Ferrell is not convincing as the bumbling, neurotic character normally played by Woody Allen (Allen is just too old to pull it off anymore). Allen was too good at it and Farrell is not. In the end it is just not well represented among the body of Woody Allen's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weak; not worth your time.","review":"Watching Will Farrell try to throw off weak nebbish Woody Allen lines was painful to watch -- both stunk. The film takes a twist on \\"Rashomon\\" -- presenting how different people might think a scenario plays out (tragic vs. comedic). Were it not for Woody Allen's name, this film would drop into well-deserved oblivion. Unless you're a die-hard Woody fan, this one is not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"not one of his all-time best, BUT...","review":"Still easily one of the best he's made in the last 10-15 years, and still easily a hell of a lot better than 90% of what gets made these days! Probably the best Allen film since \\"Sweet and Lowdown.\\"Radha Mitchell pulls off an excellent performance as the title character(s), William Ferrel is ok but I did miss having Allen play himself instead of sticking Ferrel with his lines, delivery and mannerisms, and overall a very strong cast and mostly flawless script.The double story/interpretation device works for the most part, though I had difficulty really separating the comedy from the tragedy towards the end---perhaps that was Allen's intent?It's too bad that Allen's films are too often judged by how they measure up to his towering home runs (\\"Annie Hall,\\" \\"Manhattan,\\" etc.) from ages past. I'd call this one at least a line drive double in that context...which is practically a home run when compared to other present-day films in this category."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comedy?","review":"This film isnt funny. It goes to prove that a Woody Allen movie without Woody Allen isnt great. Instead you have Farrell trying to act like a neurotic Allen. He's ok, but isnt really fun.

This film is a poor imitation of a truly delightful and joyous film titled \\"Holiday for Henrietta\\" (La Fete a Henriette), which is difficult to obtain.

It was impossible to generate any compassion for either Melinda, both of whom are self-absorbed to the extreme. Both of the stories were tragic, involving infidelity, divorce, with the main men painted as losers. Worst of all was Ferrel, who was trying to come across as a Woddy Allen clone. He wasn't, and more than that he was so miscast as to be an embarrassment to watch. The beauty of Manhattan was there, as in most of Woody Allen's films, but that was certainly not enough to add anything to this downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"8mm tapes","review":"well i got this for my camera but was the wrong size so i could return it could i opened them"},{"rating":"2","title":"8mm tapes for camcorders","review":"This is a very good value for the money.

In effect, the Big Book and the religion which sprang from it recreates the Christian model (though somewhat camouflaged and customized for alcoholics). Sin, confession, prayer, redemption... in many ways, the Big Book leads alcoholics back to church, but through the \\"back door\\", and with \\"blind folds\\" on. The stories of personal recovery are great, albeit dated, but the steps and the religosity have started quite a bit of controversy.

But in this game, all he does is shoot. And he shoots very well indeed, but that's pretty much all he does, the vast majority of them jumpers.

Despite his soft seductive vocal quality Seal songs are often mostly sorrow, sorrow, sadness and longing. It's simply hard to listen to when you don't already want to cry. This album has dynamics. There are songs to dance to, some Reggae beats and yes more sorrow. Seal sings that \\"it sounds like another one of my sad songs\\" but I don't mind.

Out of eleven tracks (I don't count the Get It Together Reprise), I'd say eight or nine are solid, can't-skip songs.

Get It Together and Let Me Roll both get me dancing in my seat at work or in the car. My favorites, though, have to be Love's Divine and Don't Make Me Wait - such emotive, sweetly and simply expressed love songs. Overall, there's a bit of an eighties pop vibe, but the soul still comes through.

It may have been a long wait for us to see his new cd come out, but by just listening to the first song, it was worth the wait! If it takes this long to make this kind of cd, I don't mind waiting this long again for the next one!

I love the slow soulful tuns and the upbeat dance tuns. If you are a Seal fan, like me, don't hesitate to buy this wonderful new C.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Work Since His Debut","review":"Seal delivers a thorough, solid collection of ballads and pop song craft perfection on his fourth album. Producer Trevor Horn is a master at integrating classical arrangements to enhance Seal's vocals. This album is only slightly below Seal's remarkable debut album that remains one of the greatest R&B/Soul albums of the last 2 decades. Highlight tracks include the beautiful ballad \\"Love's Divine,\\" the energy of \\"Let Me Roll,\\" and the disco-radio-electronica sound of \\"Get It Together.\\" A fine collection of songs to add to your CD collection for listening to for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"I too am a long time Seal fan. Since the first album. I rarely buy CD's. Maybe one a year. Saturday I brought Seal IV. I picked the right CD for 2003.Seal makes music that just touches you. All of the songs are special. My favorite however is \\"Touch\\". This is a great song. It's one of those songs that give you chills the first time you hear it.You have to admire Seals dedication to his craft. You sense from his music that this is more than a business for him... he loves music. His passion for his art comes through effortlessly.For a truly unique and ejoyable musical experience, Seal IV delivers. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely infectious!","review":"I absoutely loved this album...i was really young when his last album come out...at least i wasn't old enough to appreciate that type of music...but since i heard that his new album was to be released i counted down the days to its release... finally i have it and i can't stop playing it! Song songs are so infectious that you can't hear them just once....as soon as the cd stops i hit play again! My favorite song is My Vision...the melody is methodic and intrancing....all the songs seem so passionate and you can tell that he put his heart and soul into each and every song...well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been too long.","review":"I've been waiting for this CD for awhile now and I had many expectations. I expected the Seal of old, but he has definitly brought his music to a new level. I've heard people call it popish but it definitly is not. It has a little disco influence as well as some ragae. I definitly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful, musically and lyrically...a classic!","review":"Warm, sweet and textured...Don't miss Seal on tour. His Boston show was incredible. What a charismatic and unique artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Seal CD","review":"This is a great CD and even though I don't love every single song in it (I don't think this is possible, no matter what CD) there is at least 4 songs that I really love and I have been playing over and over for 2 weeks now.I am not a big fan of \\"Get it Together\\" (the first single), but \\"Waiting For You\\" and \\"My Vision\\" are, in my opinion, incredibly good and very danceable (I can't wait for the remixes).I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with the one of kind voice of Seal!!!!!","review":"Every since his self titled CD released in 1994. I have been a huge unwavering fan of Seal's and this CD definately stood up to my high expectations. I love it and like it just as much as when I first brougt it a few years ago. Just added everything of his that I have to my new ipod touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"grew on me","review":"Got this album when it first came out. Feel it's a pretty good mix of the \\"old school\\" stuff from the first two records. Not as dance-oriented as the first, but not as pop as the second. It's somewhere in the middle.This production isn't too much, so his amazing vocals really stand out. Writing it pretty strong. Not his best, but not bad. I'm holding him to a pretty high level, by the way. This would be a 5-star record for most people.This is one of the better Seal records. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"In rating this album, I was between 3 - 4 stars. It isn't a 3 star album because it does have some great songs on it, yet it barely (for me at least) scores a perfect 4 star rating. This album is a good album, though it isn't the strongest I've ever heard. The first half is stronger than the second half with hits I love such as \\"Get It Together\\", \\"Waiting for you\\", \\"Don't Make Me Wait\\", and \\"Let Me Roll\\". \\"Love's Divine\\" is OK, 3 stars but I think the above mentioned selections overshadow it. The rest of the songs are OK, not what I consider huge hits, but OK. I admire the fact that Seal, like Prince, Lenny Kravitz, and Alicia Keys does help/writes his own songs. Personally, I recommend this album. 3 1/2 stars I think is appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Listening","review":"After listening to one or two of Seal's songs, I decided to check out more of his music ... I've just been listening to this cd online, but I know that I'll buy it asap. I just can't seem to hear it enough!!! The chill groove is great, Seal's voice is smooth and warm, and every song has its own magic, making me want to listen to this cd over and over again. When trying to pick some of the best songs on this cd, I found myself having so much difficulty, bcuz they're all great. A few that do jump out at me though are Waiting For You, Love's Divine and Don't Make Me Wait ... Check out this cd as soon as you can, it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five years is a long wait...","review":"Five years is a long wait for a new Seal album. TOO long. I've been listening to this over VH1's website for the last week and now, finally, have my copy. He has done it again. Beautifully produced ballads that highlight the essence of Seal's vocal expressions. All I have to say is - buy it - enjoy it - and let's hope we don't have to wait another five years for the next one.Anxiously awaiting the tour....Andrew Sandberg"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what music is about!","review":"If you think you haven't heard of any good music for a while then you should listen to this great album. Seal's incredible voice and music will blow your mind away. The unique voice and the fusion of different types of music completely carried me away. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a refreshing and soulful misc experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Packaging","review":"I ordered a bunch of cds and when I took this one out I could not believe what I was looking at.... the packaging was very flimsly and not fair to Seal fans who would like to preserve his music in a nice cd case for years to come.I love Seal...no doubt about that. There would have been five stars but the packaging is a serious eye sore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love every Track...","review":"If you choose any cd...this is the one. not a light track on this one...not a big fan of Seal.....but this changed my mind. \\"Closer\\"...my favorite track.RDC/KC"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite albums","review":"I listen to pretty much everything but country. My main reason for liking this cd are the lyrics. Seal's voice and the lyrics are outstanding. I bought this CD years ago and still listen to it from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I have been waiting for you\\"....................","review":"Okay, just bought this CD - and I have had this song stuck in my head all day - how lucky! His voice is so great - and the tracks on this CD seem to have a bit more funk to them. But, it is still classic Seal - beautiful voice, soaring music, low-key relaxed style................... I really like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long wait for a great Seal CD","review":"I've been a fan of Seal since his first CD and had wondered in the past couple of years if he'd decided to hang it up (which would have been our loss). Fortunately, he's back with a wonderful set of songs that evoke his first excellent CD. I will admit that on first listen, I wasn't sure that it measured up to his previous efforts but fortunately, I don't give up after one listen and it has since grown on me big time. Best cut is 'Waiting for You' which, I believe, was used by one of the networks as background tease music for their Fall lineup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seal Is Back","review":"Seal has a great voice and for a while I missed him. However hes back, and so is the wonderful music I listened to years ago. I hope that seal will continue to produce albums in the future. And as for youBUY IT NOW!~Jesse"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back","review":"Let's be honest: Seal could sing the phonebook and we'd all still listen. His voice is soulful, distinctive, and a welcome breath on the radio from the usual vocal gymnastics and overblown production. True, Seal IV isn't as complete as his first two CDs or as moody yet atmospheric as Human Beings. But this is still great Seal. The Motown sound suits his smoky vocals well. The 1-2-3 punch of Get It Together, Love's Divine, and Waiting For You is a promising beginning. The CD does seem to lag toward the middle, while remaining enjoyable. Luckily, Heavenly is reminiscient of Violet (one of my favorite Seal tracks) and Tinsel Town ends the CD on a smooth note. Not innovative Seal. But well worth the wait, like an old friend coming home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't you buy this instead of..","review":"..any of that Brittany/Christina/Clay nonsense. I mean, really, why is'nt this guy more popular in the states? A good MUSICIAN and singer who does'nt need to lip-sync his way through a performance and has a GREAT voice, can't make it big in the US any more? Wow, that mass-produced pablum cannot hold a candle to a CD like this. Seal's stuff sounds like it should - music created by an adult with a brain and taste.Buy this CD, its good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This man is one of the greatest artists of all time","review":"I admit, I have not always been a SEAL fan, meaning that I have not really took a big interest in his music (but had nothing against it). In fact, I had only heard one song by SEAL (Kiss from a rose). Many years later I was in a grocery store in NC and the song \\"waiting for you\\" began to play. I was captivated. I started hearing snippets of the song in random places around town. I was DETERMINED to find out who was the singer of the song, but since i had only heard parts of the song, people had no idea who I was talking about. One day, I listened very closely to the song and even though it had been YEARS since I had heard that ONE song by SEAL I was able to match his voice....the rest is history. I got the cd, and was flabbergasted! This has got to be one of the greatest artists of all time PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still wonderful","review":"This album does have a flare similar to Seal's original '91 album, while containing the surrealism of Human Beings and a Rythm and Blues kick unique to IV. There is precious little ballad material here, so don't expect a repeat of his '94 self-titled. But if you like danceable blues with a Euro-dance flare, excellent vocals, surreal lyrics and powerful beats, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an inspiration!","review":"There's something about this album that makes you want to get up and face the world. It touches that part of you that will never be jaded, that you may have forgotten existed. For me the mark of a good album is that it can be listened to as a whole, be distinct from song to song, yet feel as though it's one work of art. Seal IV is one of those rare albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"A clear disappoint for me. I don't know what I am missing. I have been listening to this CD for over 2 weeks and I am about to file it in the back of my CD collection. To me, it is right down there with Human Being and maybe worse. What a shame. Seal II was a fantastic CD, one of the best from start to finish from anyone over the past 10 years. It is looking more and more like that was the exception and not the rule. Seal still has a good voice and always will but that is about it. On Seal IV, the lyrics, the melodies, the passion, and the complexity of the music just don't compare to Seal II. I seem to be in the minority here so maybe I will give it a few more tries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart hammer and screwdriver in one","review":"The hammer is basic but what is really neat are the screw drivers which covers all basic needs that a household has. One drawback is that one has to choose between flat top or philips heads for the screwdrivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent print quality","review":"I got this printer from Walmart at a cheap price. I am happy with the print quality and don't mind the loud noise and shake pretty good.The disappointment I have is that this damn printer eat up ink way to fast for my liking. Eat up a set of cartrige with probably less than 100 pages. I print mostly black color. But where the hack is my color ink go? It is dry up about the same time as black ink. Like other reviewer says, sell us the cheap printer but rape us with the inks.Update, I can't take it any more. This printer sucks the ink dry with less than 50 pages and yes mostly printed in black color. But the color ink is dried up as well. The Cl40/41 are to expensive for 50 pages of prints. I will dump this piece of crap into the trash can soon and replace it with a color laser printer for cost effective in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, cheap, cheap - you get what you pay for","review":"This printer is a mess. Yes, it's inexpensive (mine was free with rebate). But it's your classic loss leader, \\"razor and blade\\" model - give the printer (razor) away, stick it to the customer on cartridges (blades). Canon software for this printer is programmed to reject refilled cartridges, even good ones. The printer routinely breaks in some fashion or another. Streaky, substandard printing, even with Canon carts. In short, the hassle factor of owning this printer FAR exceeds the savings you might get. In simple terms, STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for a disposable printer","review":"The printed output is not really all that good. But it works for me. Have had it for 6 months or so but only print a couple of pages a month. When the ink goes out I will buy another printer as the ink refill costs are just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"The only reason I purchased this item was because I had just bought new ink cartridges for the old printer that died. Why does ink cost more than a whole new printer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time & money","review":"Don't buy it even though it's gotten some decent reviews and only cost $49. I've owned nothing but Canon's for the past 6 years--S450, S600, & S750 and they were very good printers while they lasted. The print head eventually seems to go bad on all of them and they stop printing correctly. But this ip1800 is in a different league altogether. It's noisey, it doesn't feed paper straight, it burns through ink incredibly fast, and the print quality is not as good as the aformentioned. Don't waste your money. I just took mine out to the trash and it still worked. I didn't even want to give it to somebody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent output; outrages maintenance cost.","review":"This printer produces decent output for this price range. Real-world Speed is quite good and appropriate for any occasional printing. A bit on the wide side but does not occupy too much desk space. My main complaint however, is that Canon (like most other printer manufacturers for low-end printers) sells the black dye and color ink cartridges at a very steep price. The black cartridge only comes with 11 ml of ink and the color cartrige comes with only 3 ml for cyan, magenta or yellow. So be ready for high costs per printout. At first, I thought this printer would be appropriate for the occasional printout but each (full) cartridge replacement costs of the printer's initial cost. Therefore, I cannot recommend this printer. Get a higher end model even if you do not expect to print that much as long-term costs will be lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small foot print but very loud","review":"Seems to print fine, the PC and printer disconnected a couple of times in the middle of printing, not sure if this will continue. I loaded this on my laptop using XP OS.The paper feed sounds like a trap door opening, its very loud.The size is small, this will make a great companion to my laptop for travel.No page catcher. seems this would be and easy item to include.I like the fact that all the color ink is in 1 cartridge.I would not use the unit as my main every day printer, I think you need to spend a little more money and get a better unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"My worst Canon purchase...","review":"I'vealways had good luck with Canon products, but I wish I hadn't bought this printer. It prints OK, but it's very loud and actually wobbles my (fairly sturdy) desk when printing - this has never happened before.I also object to the steep ink prices, and the fact that they run out so fast (and I mean FAST!)I have a Canon video camera, Canon digital camera, Canon scanner, and I've always had Canon printers, but I'll be shopping around for printers when I finally get irritated enough with this to buy another one - really a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and slow like a 1980s printer","review":"Only an old 1980s \\"dot matrix\\" printer is louder than this little unit, and the printer is constantly shuffling its print head and rollers around noisily when I'm not even printing.The prints are acceptable on glossy photo paper, but photos are just a muddy mess when using matte photo paper (even Canon's own, and when specifying paper type to the printer drivers).I only got this printer because it was cheaper than the refills alone, and needed something for a few weeks of lightweight papercrafts printing. If you have $10 more to spend, buy a better printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor service from Barry Farms","review":"I ordered some cherries from Barry Farms ovr 2 weeks ago and they still have not shipped the product to me.

The rest of the album is over-produced garbage. It reminds me of the 80's synth-pop that was so popular (and boring) in my childhood.Do yourself a favor and track down the single of Keep What You've Got, and maybe download the first track off iTunes - but don't waste your time or money on this pathetic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good general reference but does not shine in any one area.","review":"I confess to not being a fan of books that lead you through a scenario based on a ficticious network design and this book does just that.

Save your money - stick to the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after \\"Pat the Bunny\\"","review":"I bought this because my one-year-old daughter loves Pat the Bunny and several similar books. Unfortunately this book is not nearly as fun for her and several pages are torn up after two uses, even though she's not all that destructive.Several pages are more like a pop-up book, and the items pull right off. Other pages are just too hard for her to do. The content is not as interesting either. The only thing she actually likes are the shoes with Velcro you can work.

It is layered with densly melodic tunes that put a hook into you quickly. The production is outstanding and intriguing with backward tracks and bizarre noises supplementing, not distracting, strong tunes. The problem with the CD is that it sinks into unlistenable art-rock noise after about the 10th track. Before that, however, it is a total gem. I recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is oh so perfect.","review":"I can't really remember when was the last time I listened to a CD and said, \\"man, this is perfect\\".

At first I thought this is what the beatles might sound like if they were still around, but that's really impossible to say. Anyhow, this is a very catchy record, that will remind you of the beatles, but is really wierded out too. It is quite a trip of an album, and plus its like 70 minutes long. You're getting a lot for your money here folks. If you like these guys, try the other Elephant Six stuff, then you can have fun figuring out who is in what band and who helped out on each record. See the Apples in Stereo or Neutral Milk Hotel for more...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious pop music.","review":"This is a great, gorgeous album. Yes, it's very Beatlesque. But it tips its hat to Pink Floyd and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds as well. Some of the hooks (like Jumping Fences, Marking Time, No Growing) show flashes of perfect pop music. It's mostly good stuff, and I think these guys will only get better with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a trip without leaving the farm","review":"Whatever is in the water that the Elephant Sixers have been drinking, spoon me out a dollop! Dusk at Cubist Castle is great on many levels. A song can remind you of an old sixties pop tune and Galaxie 500 in the same moment, then take you through a transistor radio into an alternate universe during the bridge. I had to let this record grow on me for months--you really do miss a lot on the first auditions. I agree that tracks 11-21 are overwrought \\"avant-garde\\" noise and that they could have cut some, but at the same time, the tracks are in keeping with the peak of a psychedelic experience, or the crisis points in any journey. So, structurally, the placement works. The noise really works perfectly for the beginning of the title track, for example. O.T.C. is very very good at crafting pop tunes that you feel you've heard before in a dream. Brilliant record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can music expand your mind?","review":"Music in itself can not expand your mind. However, music can certainly prompt your psyche in the right direction. That's what I found with 'Dusk at Cubist Castle.' Before I listened to this CD, I didn't think anything recent could come close to Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. I now know I was wrong, hence, my expanded mind. Hold on, I just compared two artists. But, a major defining characteristic of art is it's inexplicable knack to be incomparable. Also, an expanded mind would never compare artists with artists. Has my mind deflated? What does this mean? I'd better listen to 'Dusk at Cubist Castle'...again.

I have relied on the teachings of this book and a few others and have grown into a successful trial attorney.This is not a step by step guidebook on how to be an excellent trial lawyer.

Mr. Miller comes up with a few new maxims, but for the most part, this is just a re-hash of every trial technique book that has ever been published. Mr. Miller's style of referring to lawyers as Mr. Barrister, or Mr. Blunder was refreshing at first, but became distracting as the book went on. One of the positives of the book however, was the chapter on defeat. Mr. Miller writes that while contract lawyers never win or lose, trial lawyers lose all the time, and living with defeat is what separates true trial lawyers from the other timid souls. Overall, a good introduction to trial techniques, but for those who are more experienced, this book may seem repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading","review":"I have read four other trial books from the Maut and Nita Series. At times this text is hard to understand and follow. The author emphasizes how lawyers should not speak or act like lawyers in the court room.

In learning about the liberty struggles which helped Americans grow up, the pages of this evergreen book calls our contemporary moral standings to question. It is compelling.W.E.B. DuBois is a perpetual icon: not just because he was a Blackman, who bagged a Harvard Ph.D at the tender age of 27, (during the days of stark racism). But, because his works speak for him.His popular saying: \\"My leadership was a leadership of ideas, I never was, nor ever will be personally popular\\", goes deeper in thoughts.This book depicts his style and consistency. It is a very welcomed masterpiece: a phantom of delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, prescient, and anti-Semitic","review":"I'd give this book four stars if not for some very troubling anti-Jewish passages in the text. To be fair, they are scattered, and anti-Semitism isn't DuBois' main point in the work -- which, as others have said, is astonishingly accurate in its predictions of the problems facing citizens of the 20th Century.All the same, it unsettled me to read DuBois make eloquent pleas for black equality while almost cavalierly dropping Jewish stereotypes into the narrative.Good book, but be warned.

Never for Ever is an album that will be with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal favorite","review":"Every song on this album works.

Kick Inside is known as the singers debut LP. Lionheart which is often reffered as one of her weakest work seems though always on the shelfs when you look for a kate bush cd in a record store, the dreaming which has often had mixed reviews but some say her masterpiece. Hounds Of Love which is her of course her best known LP. but this album is often overlooked and i don't know why cause it his beautiful. The fist note on Babooskha and you are some place far far away. This LP has beautiful sound to it and is easy going. it is my 2nd favourite Kate Bush Album (hounds of love my favourite) and deserves notice everywhere. Kate Bush is a genius and this LP is brilliant. She was only 22 ( take that Britney 's and christina's)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate develops","review":"Kate could write a great song, that we knew. On Never Forever she reinvents herself; Breathing and Delius show a more experimental Kate without losing the feel of earlier great work.Babooska and Army Dreamers show another example of her emphasis for feelings. For some too sweet, but they are for real and that you can hear. The forementioned songs are great but not all are of that same level. So not a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and riveting","review":"This intense, sometimes brutal novel of the internment of Gypsies in concentration camps during Hitler's ethnic cleaning crusade is riveting. The beginning of the book portrays the Roma gypsy's customs, kinship, travel and home life in a very enlightening manner. In a reversal of how gypsies are commonly portrayed, we learn that they are indeed a prideful, skilled and religious people who,in fact, feel that the gadje (anyone who is not Roma) are unclean, slovenly and disgusting. From the time of their imprisonment, we follow Josef's family, Anna his wife, Emil his oldest son and two younger children as they battle to survive.I think that this is fascinating historical fiction. My only complaint is that the middle section of the book drags a bit too long but the ending is great. Masterful writing and pitch perfect historical detail should draw many readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and profound ...","review":"I knew gypsies were ill-treated and that they were also a culture scooped up for elimination as part of Hitler's solution(s), but this wonderful novel gives background detail to a culture that except for Dracula movies and an occasional mention in a WWII documentary is utterly ignored. Fires in the Dark is a wonderfully told story about the plight of a family reduced to a single member and his (their) determination to survive a world gone mad.This is one to READ, amici ... we should all READ and this one is a MUST READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and educational.","review":"Besides the educational value of the story of the Gypsies in WW II, this is a great read! Most novels are based on fact and have something to teach. So little is know about the Gypsies during the War, this adds a new dimension to WW II literature.

A great book to add to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the white house works","review":"This book gives a detailed but still readable account of the mechanics of White House (as opposed the the entire executive branch) operations. The author presents an organization chart (not produced by the WH) and what he claims to be the first WH budget. The text is nicely peppered with insider anecdotes.The text starts with the meaty, policy offices and goes all the down to the residence staff.I skipped the seemingly extensive information on the offices of first lady, the VP and the VP's Spouse (the 2nd lady?

The band's backbone - Charly Garcia and Pedro Aznar - studied for nearly a decade in conservatories and does know how to produce breathtaking and straightforward melodies and harmonies.

The techniques are based on punishment, not building a positive relationship with your dog.

Check out books by Pat Miller, Patricia McConnell and Jean Donaldson, for a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"can be too harsch for some breeds and temperaments","review":"The methods in this book will work on many dogs but be dead wrong for certain temperaments and breeds. It is WAY to harsch for my soft goldens."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trouble with dominance...","review":"Although they have a lot of good things to say, their whole idea of absolute dominance over your dog is unnecessary and potentially incredibly dangerous. The shakedown and alpha roll-over should pretty much never be done, to any dog. These techniques can emotionally and physically damage a submissive dog, not to mention break down your trust relationship. Done to an aggressive dog, it's just asking for trouble. I would much more recommend Patricia McConnell's \\"The Other End of the Leash.\\" The obsession with dominance (usually meaning aggression) is not good for anyone involved in dog training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book brought much insight into many different dog related topics.

I wouldn't even give it away--I am recycling it. Don't want anyone to read it and be misled about how to train your dog. Sadly the monks take a disciplinarian approach to dog training based on a disproven idea that you need to dominate your dog and be the alpha dog. Instead of this book get \\"Culture Clash\\" which is a positive approach to dog training-NO CRUELTY involved and my dog behaves beautifully!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to beat your dog???","review":"This book is a disgrace! Our dogs are a part of our family. This book suggests beating your dog and instilling fear into him or her. Pass on this one if you can.The best way to train your dog is through positive reinforcement. I have a labrador who was very diffcult as a young puppy. We called her \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" However, after a few weeks at a local dog obiedience school she is now a changed pup. And it only took a few weeks to see a drastic change. Now she is our angel.If you are looking for advice on how to train your dog, then find a local dog obeidence school. Two things will happen that you can not get from a book. One your dog will become socialized with other people and dogs and two you will learn from professionals and others in your class who are going through the same thing you are.As for the monks, \\"Do onto others as you would want done on to you\\" If you ever write a book about beating each other into submission, please e-mail me. That one I will buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Animals deserve only love and tenderness","review":"Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this book zero stars.","review":"If you hit your dog, you are abusing your dog.

How very un-PC it may seem in today's world to discuss physical discipline as frankly as the monks do. I read the reviews of people who are against some of the techniques in this book and can sense their fear and ignorance. I have raised a boxer, lab, and a great dane with these techniques and I am truly happy with how they have developed. Rarely did I use a physical correction, but when the rare situation arose, I knew what to do and how to do it because of this book. It has given both the dogs and myself further confidence and freedom on our constant adventures. I apologize for not discussing too much content, just wanted to put forth my appreciation of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"With friends like them, who needs enemies?","review":"Just so neigh to New Skete!I am ashamed to admit that 8 years ago I used to recommend this book. With all of the new positive dog training knowledge and techniques, I am astonished that it still sits in Amazon's best seller list. DO NOT buy this book! The monks' techniques are primitive and crude. The scruff shakes and alpha rolls are among the many things that are just not necessary for daily training and are not building blocks for a healthy relationship with your dog.

Not even one violent outburst needed. I have a very stubborn, adopted at 8 months, many issues here, 150 pound Rottie. He has an attitude of, I can't even think of a good comparison...but, the methods of the Dog Whisperer, and yoga has turned this dog around. He went from breaking 8 windows in my house to sitting calmly beside me while doing yoga. I swear to God! It was very easy too!

The Monks have proven through the years that quiet confidence on the part of the owner wins both the heart and trust of man's best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Essential!","review":"My own dog's trainer does not approve of the Monks, but in my world there is plenty of room for difference of opinion!The Monks' book is valuable no matter what method you eventually settle on as a good fit for your temperament and your dog's needs, because the Monks' advice is about so much more than training methods: it is about a lifestyle and outlook, and dedication to your dog as a member of the family, with needs very different from those of the human members. It is that sense of confidence and kind authority, without being stern or strict, that makes training work- not the style of training itself. This book helps you achieve that state, which gives your dog the restful assurance that Master or Mistress is in charge, so he can relax and do his best at being your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rational makes sense","review":"I have had dogs for about 15 years now and still consider myself a newbie.

They can have a lot of legs, usually eight, they can eat flies with the help of their string, and can make webs with them and can be big or small.

For example, when a sheep asks if it wants to go the meadow, or when a dog asks it if itwants to chase a cat, or when a cat wants to take a nap, the spider simply refuses it and continues to work on her web.It's definitely short, but it's still a Eric Carle orginal.

In the end you can't help but wonder what lies ahead for these three people in the future .I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a true western movie lover . I had been looking for this movie for a long time and finally found it on amazon . I truly thank them ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great western!!","review":"Wonderful suspenseful story. Very stoic actors with no wasted motion. Shows the feriosity and determination of an indian warrior wanting his son back. I highly recommend this movie to true western lovers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have all the westerns gone?","review":"\\"The Stalking Moon\\" is one of the finest westerns I have ever seen. In fact it is just a great film. The suspense is magnetic as the plot unfolds. Gregory Peck plays a retiring army scout who tries to help a woman and her Indian son. The woman, played stoically and well by Eva Marie Saint, has just been rescued from years of enforced captivity and life with her kidnappers. As she and Peck leave they are stalked by the Indian father of her son.The ending could be considered a bit predictable but you are captivated anyway incident after incident. Who will hear who?Who will live? Who will die? We do care.I don't think any western since \\"The Searchers\\" havs pleased me this much. I ordered my used video just recently. Sure it's an older film when Peck and St. Marie were then less than young, but, indeed, a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gregory Peck is always good but in this one he is great!","review":"This is an excellent western. Gregory Peck is always good but in this one he is great! I like the way the suspense builds up for the final scene.

Would like to see other western movies played by him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once is enough","review":"I don't regret watching this movie but will not watch it again, and definitely will not buy a copy. Simply put, it is very slow and seems much longer than its 110 minutes. It could easily have been edited down to 90 minutes. The first hour is particularly slow. Yet, I must admit the climactic ending was exciting and very tense. Gregory Peck's performance was good. He was his normal solid self. No other actor was interesting. Eva Marie Saint seemed a shadow of the woman we saw in North By Northwest or the Oscar winning On The Waterfront. I am glad I got this from the library and did not pay money to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD The Stalking Moon","review":"Recieved the DVD, THe Stalking Moon, as it was expected and the Packaging was very effective and easy to open, Thank you for the Prompt Delivey."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you make a flat fullscreen DVD?","review":"This is not really a review, since I'm not buying it. I already bought a Spanish DVD more than a year ago of \\"The Stalking Moon\\", but the ratio was 1.33, not 2.35 as it should, since this is a movie filmed in Panavision. So I'm not paying to have a third of the film. Which seems to be what is being offered now in the US. And it quite a pity, since it is a very good, underrated movie, by a great underrated American filmmaker, Robert Mulligan.Miguel Mar��as"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ratio","review":"I have been waiting for \\"The Stalking Moon\\" to come out on DVD for a long, long time -- and now it is here: in 1:33 ratio???!!!! What is going on?! This is not a living-room set, a city location. Why in the world lose most of the film, the grandeur, the beauty of the cinematography? It reminds me of the time I mistakenly bought the \\"Standard\\" version, \\"reformated for your TV,\\" version of \\"The Music Man,\\" and ended up with myriad scenes featuring a barbershop duet, instead of a quartet. No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL WESTERN","review":"As a real western movies fan , this film is perfect to me. The characters , the subject and the places where the movie took place are very realistic(thanks to Gregory Peck) . In this film one can not see show-downs or gun fights or unnecessary killings in every scene . There is a fight to death between two powerfull man. One of them is doing his job and the other is seeking for his family (we got to accept his way of doing this search in the light of indians way of life and phylosophy at that time.)I am not an expert of American history but I believe this film is not out of facts ,this is not a spagetti western it is a real suspence.

I know this from some really weird guys who believe just everything, but this book they know as fake. And seriously, if you look at the photos... They don't look even near convincing. But they look very similar to soooo many other pictures, just demonstrating that there are simply no alien spacecrafts on earth. But one good thing has the book: You can have a look what is possible with Photoshop, Corel Draw and all the other techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is not real","review":"I looked at every photo in this booklet and it was a total disappointment. This book seems to be aimed at the gullible 'cause almost every photo looks phony. There isn't one qualifying bit of data aside from the author's. The photos look as if the \\"UFOs\\" were inserted, possibly digitally, and do not look harmonious to the rest of the photo. There is one photo of people at the beach and this giant \\"craft\\" right in front of them. Not a far-away object but right in your face. Yet, there is not a single individual looking at this marvel. The quality of the photos is pretty poor and you could not for one moment swear that the UFOs are really there. A real poor effort. I could be wrong. But the photos don't cut it with me, who has been a UFO-enthusiast, ex-field investigator, UFO Magazine editor, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I was disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to my worst enemy. It drags on foever and the characters, especially the male lead, are unlikeable enough to make you want to slam the book shut and never open it again. This was my first Moore book, and thankfully, my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was almost an interesting book, before the author lost his mind","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that it is short.Yeah, its going to be that kind of review.The first third or so of this book is typical Moore. It is moderately funny (not as good as most of his other stuff, but not bad mind you), populated with somewhat quirky characters that are pleasant to watch and everything is looking good at this point. Moore's innate writing ability almost distracts you from the rather feeble plot, but that is ok because you just know that at any moment now the plot is going to take off and things are going to get good.And then Moore looses his mind.The rest of the book is just stupid. No, let me clarify that. The rest of the book is astoundingly, painfully unbelievable. It hurts to read this tripe.In short, everything just falls apart. The plot fizzles out, the tension is resolved in an obvious and crude manner, way too many thing just conveniently occur and the result is rather bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"I liked Tom Robbins stuff so I tried Coyote Blue which was a decent book and figured I'd try another Christopher Moore book. That was Fluke. I know it is supposed to be absurdest humor but you can't pull it off without enough intrigue. There was intrigue but it built up too slow and it wasn't that humorous. I found it to be little bit of a chore to read because I was just loosing interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"F-luke warm","review":"Short and simple, as many reviewers here, I've read a number of Moore's other stuff and enjoyed them immensely. This one just didn't work for me but it does have its moments. Nate is a whale biologist trying to figure out why whales sing and to what purpose. Clay is his photographic partner in the research. Amy is the self-proclaimed luscious assistant, and Kona is the transplanted New Jersey boy that thinks he's Rastafaran and provides the comic relief. Slow moving book and then there's a giant step of open-mindedness in the last third of the book regarding the Goo. My wife loved the story finding it highly humorous, I didn't. There's better Moore books out there already."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"I am a huge fan of Christopher Moore. I bought this book went it came out and was saving it for a gray day. I have been looking forward to reading it for month. I finally picked it up last weekend. What a huge disappointment it was!This story drags along, there's no action, it's not very funny...it's the exact opposite of all of Moore's other books: It's boring..Christopher Moore is a really wonderful author, if you have never read a book by him, please! pick any of the others and I guarantee you will enjoy yourself immensely.I am, none the less, looking forward to his next book! I hope Mister Moore will have found his voice back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the--?","review":"I agree with C. Grove's review. This book started out great. In fact, all through the first half I heartily recommended this book to a whale- and Hawaii-loving friend at work. I loved Moore's humor, his language, and his descriptions of the characters, especially Kona. I enjoyed the science and the mysterious elements. Then, the book took a 180 degree turn and dove past quirky into \\"what are you smokin', mon?\\", with \\"whaley boys\\", \\"Goo\\", and a strange preoccupation with whale \\"willies\\". By the time I forced myself to finish the book, I was hoping it was all some pot-induced dream Kona was having, and nothing in the second half ever happened. This was my first Moore book, and it's left me in doubt about whether to even try the other one I bought at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Moore crazy or what?","review":"I enjoy C. Moore quite a bit. His books are fun and silly and completely zany. This one is no exception. I am not sure where he gets his ideas or his insights, but even though his books are absolute comic fantasy, the stories and characters still have some specter of reality to them. It is almost like he takes hyperbole to another level with his characters. Fun book with some crafty humor. If you are into zany and irreverent comedy then you will enjoy this book, but if you are buttoned up and stodgy, then this will not appeal to you at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst so far","review":"I really like Chris Moore's stuff, so I eargly awaited this book. I was so disappointed. As a scientist, I have some familiarity with the circumstances he set up in the beginning of the book which had the makings of a good book about the realities of the competition that can occur in research fields (despite his disclaimer at the end)! I'm used to the magical realism Moore likes to through in his books and I enjoy it for the most part. But half-way through he lost the plot, any credibility he had built up and my attention. I struggled through this middle section and, as I really like his writing style, I was able to enjoy the last 1/4 of the book but I was just so bummed by how bad it was compared to his other books! Hopefully Moore will get his stride back soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluke dives","review":"I had heard good things about Moore and specifically about this book. I started it eagerly. However, as the story unfolded, I found that the book had two fatal flaws: first, I didn't care about Moore's characters; second, his dialogue left me shaking my head in disgust. This is an author who tries too hard to be cute; unfortunately, it doesn't work. Earnestly, I felt as though I were reading a script for a Hollywood film rather than a novel. For true Moore fans, this may be just what you're looking for, but for those who heard all the good things I did and who are ready now to bite: spit the bait out and wait for the inevitable summer movie release in 2005. It may make an entertaining 90-minute movie, but a novel of worth, this one aint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird is good!","review":"After reading Practical Demonkeeping, I've been itching to read another Christopher Moore book! I got this one for my birthday this year, and couldn't put it down. Some say it's too weird.. but weird and intriguing storylines seem to be his forte! I LOVED the book! The characters are colorful and fun to read about, the plot is just hilarious. It's a great book - I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whale Envy","review":"So you just picked up a copy of a Christopher Moore's \\"Fluke\\"? I can only envy you. You are about to step into one of the most brilliantly warped imaginations on this side of the twenty-first century. Moore has pioneered the literary figure of the \\"Action Geek.\\" You'll see what he means by that after your first few pages - by then, you will be hooked. It's a nice addiction really. You'll like it. So sit back, relax and enjoy; after all you are about to learn the secret as to why the winged whale sings. What could be better than that on such a lovely evening?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A whale of a tale!","review":"I enjoy Christopher Moore's works; they are so strange and funny! The reason I gave this latest one only four stars is that he has set such a high standard of humor in his previous works, that I found that this one was not as funny, at least not of the laugh out loud type I had been expecting. None the less, it is a very good book, with some intersting lessons about saving the whales, and the usual odd assortment of characters that usually populate his novels. It's a fun read of a book, and I think most readers will really enjoy it, as I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it him or me?","review":"I sought out Christopher Moore's books for years. Practical Demonkeeping, Coyote Blue, the Island book----wonderful, wonderful books, that I recommended and passed around to others. I was very excited to see this book out---but after getting about three-fourths of the way through, I have to say it is unreadable. \\"Over the top\\" and \\"jump the shark\\" are inadequate for this book. It's just silly, and not in a fun way. It's almost insulting to the reader. It's very rare that I don't finish a book, and I may make myself finish this, but it will be a struggle. Maybe it's worse because I was so much looking forward to it. I think I will just re-read his first two...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total hoot","review":"This book is a total hoot--puckering sphinctral wash basins and whaley boys with wildly waving willies beggar the mind.

In this, it's a bit like Lamb, imagination gone wild with a few weak spots."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"Christopher Moore's books always grab me and never let go.

His other books were page turners and laughs until the end. This book was definitely disappointing. Too much on the whales and not enough of a good story.

This one was just not one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, original and worthy book!","review":"This is the third Christopher Moore book I've read (the other two are: Lamb, which was wonderful!, and Fool, a remake of King Lear by Shakespeare, that I liked very much).This book was such an original story...but still based on an important theme, protection of marine life and conservation of our oceans. At the end of the novel, he includes wonderful and very pertinent notes on the importance of conservation. I respect him so much for writing this novel.Thanks Christopher Moore! I will soon be reading another book of yours. You are a wonderful wordsmith and creative storyteller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best efforts","review":"Fluke is not what you call your typical christopher Moore book. It misses a lot of those little twists you expect from him. Lot of technical background goes in it to fully understand and the plot is not really a plot. Go for other titles - like Coyote Blue you will have more fun out of your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cetacean biology has never looked like this!","review":"There are lots of humor writers out there who base their work -- sometimes all of their work -- on a single gimmick. Christopher Moore has the gift for writing outstanding novels that are distinct, clever, intelligent and thoughtful -- and also happen to stimulate your internal laugh track without pause. (It boggles the mind to consider just how much actual science, as well as seamanship, Moore learned before writing this book!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff","review":"This book is a quick, fun read that will leave you laughing out loud at times. Also, after reading this book, you will never think the same way about whale penises."},{"rating":"2","title":"great return to his original style","review":"I'll first assume the reader is a longtime Chris Moore fan. If so, you will recognize immediately that Fluke is a return to his pre-Lamb format. The book it most closely resembled was Coyote Blue. It starts as a academic_science comedy/mystery, then suddenly shifts to being a science_fiction comedy/action_thriller. (Lots of slashes when trying to characterize a Moore book.)As usual, the plot takes second fiddle to the comedy, and tends to have some rough edges. The characterization and comedy is first rate, some of Moore's best.I rate it higher than most of his other novels, but perhaps not as good as Coyote Blue or especially Bloodsucking Fiends (still his best). There are some great laugh-out-loud lines in here, and even when the plot falls apart at the end, the humor stays as strong as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"This was my first Christopher Moore book and I must say the first half of the book was great and I was really enjoying the story then....well everything changed so far beyond reality it was just too much! I may or may not try another of his books. I will need some time to regroup after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I had not read any of Christpoher Moore's other books but based on reviews picked up \\"Fluke\\". I was very disappointed. The first third of the book was somewhat interesting (hence two stars instead of one), if not funny, but the second two thirds degenerated into implausible and nearly unreadable silliness that would only be worth reading if it were in someway humorous. Clearly, my sense of humor differs from most of the reviewers here, but I suppose either you get Moore's rather unique sense of humor or you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Disappointed","review":"Love Christopher Moore. Said it again.Fluke was great. Moore makes the fanciful story seem nothing more than the backdrop for his unique and hysterical sense of humor. This book was no exception. I laughed until I cried. Must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and disappointing","review":"To reiterate the other reviews would be redundant. I listened to Bill Irwin in the audio book and thought he did an excellent job despite what seemed to be a Canadian accent throughout (is he Canadian? I don't know.) The minute we met the whaley boys I was angry at the author for driving these interesting and compelling characters into a Stephen King world. Whaley Boys? The Goo? Amelia Earhardt getting down with the Goo? Really, this was just stupid. And I just couldn't stop thinking about all the beached whales that are never mentioned - what happened there, drunk driving? I would not recommend this book to anybody who values their precious time with books. I give it 2 stars because the first half was excellent and deserves recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"intelligent and funny","review":"This is the kind of book that gets you into trouble on the New York City subway. You suddenly laugh out loud and make everyone stare in your direction. Much like Moore's other books (I count Lamb as one of my favorites of all time, and the Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cover as excellent), this is intelligent and funny. The setting here is competing whale researchers in Hawaii, with a variety of science fiction elements. If you like Douglas Adams or Kurt Vonnegut, it's impossible not to like Christopher Moore. The dialogue is among the funniest Moore has ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newcomers, don't lose faith, but \\"What the....?\\"","review":"I have been a huge fan of Christopher Moore since Practical Demonkeeping, and have read almost everything he's ever written. I don't know what happened with this book, but it was definitely not demonstrative of his other work. The books starts out interestingly and intriguingly, but takes a nose dive into \\"absurd, even beyond the point of entertaining\\".Christopher? Do you have a boat you're trying to pay for?For those of you who have not read any of Moore's other books, I STRONGLY encourage you to try some of his other works like Practical Demonkeeping, Island of the Sequined Love Nun, or Coyote Blue (Classic Trickster tale...very cool!)If you're not afraid of pushing the envelope of convention in thinking, I HIGHLY recommend Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. This is not only Moore's BEST work, but one of my favorite books ever!!! And I don't have many favorite books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"In my opinion, this book is even funnier than \\"Lamb.\\" You'll especially like it if you know any researchers/academic types. When you read the book you really feel like you know the characters and you'll learn some nifty facts about whales. Like how they can turn women into lesbians.... Now you just have to read it, don't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I Have Ever Read","review":"This is the first Christopher Moore book I have read and it was amazing. I am the type of person who reads 30 to 40 pages a month of a book. I read fluke in a weekend. I have NEVER done that before. I was totally captured in the book. Fluke is pretty out there, but that is what made it so great. I am going to go by another Moore book today, any suggestions?- an instant Moore fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moore's back where he belongs","review":"In Fluke, Moore returns to ground that is no less rich in mythology than religion--the sea and its creatures. Moore excels when he brings supernatural beings down to Earth (in this case, a whale who orders pastrami on rye) without the fear of offending anyone other than newage whale-song devotees. The characters in this book are simultaneously hilarious and sympathetic, and just when you think Moore has settled into a comfortable storytelling track, he switches gears and takes you on an unexpected journey that is both hilarious and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flukey","review":"A publisher friend passed this book on to me and when I started reading it,I didn't want to put it down.The sarcastic humour that Moore writes with is priceless.I found myself laughing out loud,and re-reading sections just to laugh again.Other books claim to be \\"page turners\\",but Moore delivers and then some!!He has captured the thoughts of us all when we find ourselves contemplating the existence of our marine friends.Not only has he spun the thoughts of the characters in his book,but he has left us all wondering if \\"something\\" is being relayed by our deep sea friends.Keep up the good work Moore...I look forward to your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but subpar work from Moore!","review":"Christopher Moore is without a doubt my favorite author. After reading Bloodsucking Fiends I have done everything in my power to read all his other novels. I have now almost read them all and loved them until Fluke. While the typical Moore humor is in place this story is maybe too weird for me to get into. The quirky characters that are always present in his work are still in here but not as memorable as other books. Overall, the story is funny but not enough for me to enjoy, sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Suspension Required","review":"I must admit, Fluke was my 4th Christopher Moore book. Sometimes I feel sorry for people who pick up a C Moore book having NO idea what they are in for. The books aren't \\"normal.\\" What I love about Moore's books are they are wacky, fun, and always a great vacation read. Fluke delivers there. I LOVED Kona. Actually think he stole the show a bit. And well, I love happy endings. If you are offended by drugs, swearing, or a requirement to suspend reality... try a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too weird to be funny or entertaining.","review":"This was my first Christopher Moore book, and may be my last. This book started off good enough, I liked the people, their situation, and the interactions between each one. It started off as a good, somewhat humorous tale about whaling research. Funny, amusing - pretty much what I hoped for.Then all of sudden, the plot went out there. The second half of the book was a giant, \\"what the heck is this?\\". From whaling research in Hawaii, it switches to a story about whale boy hybrids, giant Goos controlling the seas, and Amelia Earhart. It just was too out there to be interesting or funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the first book by Christopher Moore that I have read, and most likely the last. It was probably not the best one to start with. After reading Fluke, I cannot imagine reading another of Mr. Moore's books unless I am totally desperate for reading material. It was mildly entertaining, but honestly? I have had more enjoyment reading cereal boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"listen to this album again... and again","review":"I absolutely love this CD!.. it ranks right up there with Singin' the Blues (Jimmy Witherspoon).

It will take you right to the doorstep in style. Good clear directions on a large, bright screen make it easy to see. The suction mount is just a notch short of super glue. It won't let go. I live in an area with many new subdivisions springing up. Much of the city's residential areas and accompanying road construction are not yet in the system. I'm new to the area, so it will be great when these areas are added to software. Some of them are 4 - 5 years old and are still not yet in the unit. Other than that, this is a straight forward, easy to operate, effective unit that does what it says it will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Annoying Voice","review":"I purchased this and must say that it is definitely a worth-while purchase and the price is competitive. Would recommend it over several others I researched and tried. (Tom Tom, Magellan etc.) One really annoying feature!!!!!The voice that calls out the turns etc is an Engliush Lady with a British accent. Her pronunciation is most annoying. For example, Dr. as in Drive becomes Doctor to her. St. as in Street is Saint to her. Pensacola Drive became Pen-soc-a-law Doctor. There are new thrills daily. I usually run with the voice turned off. And, perhaps the annoyance is a tradeoff for the overall high quality of performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I had a tomtom go 700 and I sold it. This Item is great. Better maps than the tomtom and better satellite accuracy. The option that it has where it actually tells you the name of the street you have to turn on. The tomtom has a smoother operation. But overall the Garmin is a better product in my mind. It doesnt have all the options as the tomtom, but if your looking for a great Navigation system for an affordable price, i would suggest to stick with Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for cheap","review":"This is ok if you are looking for a cheap gps. First off it is outdated, but for the price I expected for it not to be current. It drops satellites way worse than my previous two gps's, which is disturbing. I have a great sense of direction, so no problem, but my wife has a really hard time with directions, so is terrifying for her. The real problem with it, is the holder, it doesn't stick at all. I had another Garmin and had the portable sand bag that worked great. It doesn't work with this one because the mount is an inverse of the way most of these work. My mount has the ball as does my motorcycle, but the unit has the ball so it is backwards. We lay it in my truck's console, but no place to set it in my accord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Streetpilot","review":"Garmin StreetPilot c340 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator is good and worked but the charger I think not original, It's fine and accepted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"update maps","review":"The gps works good, But I am upset that I paid much more than they are now,and now you get free map updates.

I did not need a map at all. my wife is not usually impressed by my toys, but she even loved this GPS. I was lost in part of california and I ask this unit to find me a way out and it worked great. I was most impressed by the fact that no matter how small a town i was in it had the maps for it and told me where to go. i am very impressed and highly pleased with this product.Con: when you leave your route to go to the bathroom or get gas or eat..it keeps recalculating a new route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Receiption","review":"The C340 is very wide so it is not handy when traveling on planes, you would have to bring a seperate case for it.

It helped bypass problem areas and find great places to eat/stay as well as points of interest along the way. Signal was always strong, as far as I could tell.

Such as text-to-speech, easy to use user interface, POIs, it searches addresses as you enter the characters..reducing the need to have to fully spell out the street. However, the GPS receiver is not a Srf III. I traveled to Boston, the oldest city and it could not find one of the oldest streets in history [Beacon or Beacon Hill]. In the city, it kept loosing the signal and it was somewhat useless as it could not direct you to a location without endless re-calculation due to signal losses. I'm glad I did purchase it in time for my trip. Now, I know how important it is to have a GPS with a more responsive receiver, such as SRF III. Again, feature wise it is awesome. But, if it can't guide you or provide you with somewhat accurate directions, it isn't much good. Even in Georgia, it kept dropping signals.

The recalculating feature is great; it allows you to make a mistake without concern! The screen is easy to read and the voice is clear. I find the locations are extensive. I have typed in several attractions that were off the beaten path and the Garmin found them and got me there. My only suggestin is to buy a model where the streets name are said aloud. It makes a world of difference.I have noticed that there are some glitches. There are two areas near me where it gives an incorrect turn. Overall, it is WELL WORTH the money.

I did loan it to my daughter and grandson for a trip east. She expressed it was a life saver to travel from JFK into New Jersey, then to Connecticut and eventually to Boston. My concerns are the lack of a comprehensive operating manual. The provided instructions are very rudimentary. For instance, it indicates there is battery. I have yet determined where it is. Is it rechargable? How do you access the battery?Another question is, can the GPS be used internationally? Could it be used in Europe? If so, how do you program the intelligence and how is it made available?Being a resident of California. I am not allowed to use the windshield mount. I wish I had known that upon purchase so that I would know to order the dashboard mount.The last comment is relative to their apparent lack of attention to customer inquiries.

Then, I swear moments after the one year warranty ran out, the gps went wacko. I would hit the button for a common destination and get the screen for all the gas stations in the area.

Good idea to review your route before.The instructions that come with the unit are not comprehensive enough to discuss all features of the product, but over a little time, you find little features that are a happy surprise.This is our first GPS. Although a good tool, I am now starting to question its use by new drivers. It can be more distracting than helpful. Even for experienced drivers there seems to be a competition between the GPs and the radio, especially if the upcoming route consists of quick changes.. Again, this is related more the the GPS than this particulate product."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding streetpilot","review":"Outstanding GPS device.

The only problem I had was with the mount staying in position. It worked fine stuck to the windshield, once I got to CA and had to (illegal to drive with anything suction mounted to windshield) switch to the dash mount, any bump in the road would cause the unit to tilt down so that it was no longer easily readible.

It is so intuitive that I haven't once had to check the manual; that's saying something because some GPS units seems to require lots of time studying the manual. I only have a few quibbles here and there regarding some of its features (would be nice if for example you could edit someone's address in your address book instead of deleting and starting over),but overall it's a very good unit that is easy to use with an excellent display.

Also, it occasionally says something is on the right when it is on the left and vice-versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"I know there are over 600 previous reviews but I have to tell you this thing is great.

I did have an issue with the C550 freezing the 2nd day I had it, but a quick download remedied this forever, according to Garmin. I found Garmin's tech support very helpful and friendly.The downside of a GPS unit is that there's not a \\"Take the shortest distance\\" or \\"Take the fastest route\\" choice. In other words, in some cases it will lead you on roads that may be shorter distance-wise, but ultimately longer because of traffic lights, rural traffic/speed limits etc..

Then when it did work, it would tell me to turn right or left at a street, just as or after I passed it! It also wouldn't let me drive the route I want to drive. If I'm on side streets, it tries to get me on the freeway -- when I went on the freeway, it wanted me to exit at every exit! There is an option for Fastest or Shortest route, so that wasn't the problem. Same thing with Detour. I'm sure it's just a buggy one, there seems to be a lot of them out there -- otherwise Garmin would be out of business and there would be a lot of unhappy drivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Experience with this Garmin C340","review":"After did a lot of research, I bought a Garmin Streetpilot C340 from here at amazon. but when I was downloading the updates from Garmin website, the c340 was dead, it said that \\"system software missing\\", I have to return it back to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk after 10 minutes!","review":"I bought this product.

She is also a tad techno challenged as well. The C340 addressed both these issues exceedingly well.Out of the box she was able to program her favorites (like HOME) and use immediately. She has since used it on two simple trips and found it easy to follow.The ability to use the touch screen helps her, as does the options on the screen.If there was only one challenge it is that this unit doesn't give you the option of the fastest trip. Everything is the shortest distance. Sometimes that means driving through a downtown instead of taking a Freeway (which may be a few miles longer, but quicker). I know that is available in nicer models though.The only other comment is the voice. It tends to put the emphasis on the wrong word in a sentence, which isn't a problem but is pretty funny.Overall, for the price, I am extremely pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin C340","review":"I'm a consumer report type shopper and after extensive research, I purchased this unit.

If all you want to do is put in an address and go, that's fine. It's been a great GPSr for me and has taken me places I didn't even know exist. Just remember that you may not be able to see the water features on the map, depending on your location. And you may not be able to pinpoint your favorite fishing hole because it won't show up - all all.

But.........We got lost in downtown Minneapolis several times and were redirected by the GPS and arrived at the destination we wanted. We love having it when we are traveling in new places.

The unit is very easy to use, it has a very sharp and clear screen, it's inexpensive and best of all portable so I can use it from car to car.I was amazed at the accuracy of my first address input, \\"as other reviewers are\\" and the quick response of the system. I like the way it announces the name of the street before the turn and if you miss the turn, the unit will reconfigure to provide updated information and directions to get back on track.

I liked the features and the reviews were generally very good. So I ordered this unit and thought that was the end of it. Well, I stumbled upon a website (gpsmagazine.com) and they mentioned units to avoid. The units to avoid included many Garmin units (such as this one) because these units are not being sold with the latest GPS receiver (the SIRF Star III) which is supposed to provide dramatically better results in traditional problem areas (tall buildings, urban areas, tunnels, etc). I confirmed this information with other websites and then decided to order the Garmin Nuvi 350, which has both the new GPS receiver and the other features I wanted. What is really ridiculous is that the Garmin website, even when you compare the units using the compare feature on their website, does not actually show which GPS receiver is being used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satellite Signal Issue","review":"After reading all the reviews and owning this product for 2 months , I feel that I didn't do a good buy. The unit overall is satisfying, but the problem starts coming after you come out of a underground garage or once you lost signal.

I have had to override its recommendations very rarely. It recomputes new, accurate routes the moment you have passed a recommended turn. Its database of eateries is pretty good, too! Only groan I could probably come up with is that you can't dim the display for night driving. It switches to a night background at sunset, but I find myself placing my ball cap over the unit when I don't want the glare of it interfering with my night driving.

The directions are accurate and simple to understand. The voice prompting is nice and it even states the names of the roads instead of \\"turn left in 400 yds\\".I previously used Microsoft Streets and trips 2004 and 2006 with GPS.

Avoidance and preference settings should have helped with this.

It has a few drawbacks. It takes a long time to locate satellites. It does not give you options like fastest route versus shortest or most use of highways or avoid tolls.

So, I would suggest people to buy any GPS from a place which has liberal return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No frills, convenient and effective","review":"Is a little bulkier that the nuvis but then I wan't really planning on carrying it in my pocket.I frankly like this better than the nuvis (bulkiness apart) since the volume control is independent of the screen and I find myself adjusting the volume often and don't like to navigate the screen menu everytime for it.The usual options for navigating are pretty user-friendly for the most part. No complicated screen navigation, pretty intuitive menu options.My only crib is that I have on occassion found it to be slow in picking up satellite reception - mostly under bridges or in the woods. This problem also occurs when there's a huge change in location since the last time it was turned on (e.g. you turn it off and then back on in a different city altogether)But all in all very good value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gadget..","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.

The first time I used it was for a trip to Nashville. It was great for navigating in a city where we had no paper maps. We used it to find a shopping center, a particular restaurant where we only had the name and no address (it's locating of various points of interest--restaurants, malls, gas stations, etc.--is super), and to get around the city in general. I didn't use it on the main highway since I knew where I was going and it had me turning on roads other than what I intended. You need to use common sense with the system as it tried to take me on a street that no longer was a through street. But making a turn caused the Garmin to reprogram and it got me to my destination by another route.

Without a map I would have been lost. When I typed in Broadmoor Ave. it would override this and go to Broad St. The 340 would shut itself off after a few minutes so it was useless. The 340 doesn't give the option of shortest route vs most interstate. At times it would give directions that were 60/70 miles out of the way. It doesn't recognize major highways in some areas and takes a lot of time to recalculate. At one point we were actually parked in the driveway of our destination and because we had taken a shorter route it was still trying to direct us onto a different route. The next morning it did recognize that we had in fact reached our destination. I used a Magellan unit in a rental car, it had many features that the Garmin lacks.

The Garmin C340 can never differentiate between the right lane of a highway and service road. Even after driving few miles after merging in highway, the Garmin says to enter highway as it thinks I'm still on the service road.When traveling to Oklahoma, some of the maps were messed up.

It was very easy to start using - just turn it on. The display is very eay to use. Despite some of the complaints I saw in other reviews about the advance warning before turns, we have found it to be ample. The unit tells you how many miles before the next turn and then a warning when to make the turn. The display also shows the distance to the next turn. This is our first GPS and we are very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the stone age to the star wars era","review":"Just bought this product in less than a month and I'm very happy that did it.

Oh well, my husband should be used to that...We live in a town of 1100 people and the Garmin insists in sending us home via residential streets rather than a straight shot through town - like it wants us to miss all the traffic congestion.

If you buy from them, you will most likely have to deal with their Customer Sevice Dept. Good luck! They act like they are too big to worry about a consumer. They sell out-dated maps(over 1 1/2 years old) in their units, and expect the customer to spend $70 more to update the map in a brand new unit!

I live in Jacksonville Florida. The GPS unit does not know of streets that are up to two years older than the Sept 2006 release date of the internal loaded MapSource software.No updates are available from Garmin.Gets lost and provides bad directions most of the time.Wish I could return it. Works most of the time, but is wrong enough to be annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but clear screen, excellent routing","review":"There are lots of helpful remarks in the previous reviews. I'll just add that the \\"3-d\\" view provided by this and other Garmin units seems much easier to use with a quick glance than the top-down views on other units. Other than the size of the screen, this unit is superior to the nav system that came in my '03 Toyota Prius in every regard. It's very easy to use. I should mention that my unit arrived about two weeks ago with system 2.1 on it. During our first trip using it, the unit froze while we were heading down Route 1 in central NJ. Power cycling it got us back on track, and we've no other problems since. However, I just looked on the Garmin website and found that the current system for this unit is 3.2, as of December 6. Updating the system software on my PC in the office was quite simple, and I'm glad that the unit will be (presumably) more stable than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit, Lousy Mount","review":"Functionally, this does a great job. Size-wise this isn't the sexyest body in the world, but it's not huge either. I would buy this again. BUT, throw away the standard, included windshield mount. It's a pain to use, blocks my vision, and the suction cup material glues itself right to the glass, leaving behind an ugly black ring. Even after scraping and Windex on the glass, I can still see where the suction cup was. Trash the included mount and buy the mount that sits on the dash; it's GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"First of all the good: the device works fairly well.Only fairly well, because it is routinely confused and tells me to bear right when it should say left. (there's a three spots going down into Tacoma and another by Bellevue which I always have to watch close)The bad part? Updating the software and/or the maps is confusing, if it's even possible at all. An hour was as long as I was willing to devote to the task before I gave up and just accepted that whatever maps it came with, that's what it'll have until I throw it away. What should have been simple ended up require 2 different registrations and 2 different codes on their website before they would release current maps. (Who do they think is going to take their maps, that doesn't have their device? The map data is useless without one...) When I finally recieved the data, it didn't work.Typical corporate philosophy: the shorter it's lifespan, the sooner you'll have to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent value, some limitations","review":"I recently rented a car that had a different brand of GPS. It had a few superior features:1. Gave more frequent warnings before having to turn. This unit pronounced the street namesbetter than the Garmin 340.2. Just before you need to turn, a tone sounded. This is easier than judging how far is 200 ft.3. larger fonts made text easier to read.4. Manual over-ride to seek alternate (e.g freeways only, fastest) routes5. Displays how many satalites it has acquired.The C340 had a good built-in database, making it easy to find airports and other public locationsdirectly without knowing the address. It also installs easily. The touch screed works well too.Occationally, the unit gets confused and freezes up. This usually happens in the city. I have seen a few otherbrands with similar features selling for $100 - $150 less, but I have not tried them."},{"rating":"2","title":"satalite connections","review":"This product is amazing when it locates and is able to make a satalite connection. I had trouble making a satalite connection while traveling on Interstate 95 from Florida to South Carolina."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good but sometimes wrong","review":"The Garmin C340 Portable GPS is an amazing little device. It is easy to install and easy to use. It is probably accurate 98% of the time but it has a few glitches in it as far as naming roads. I would have a map handy just in case. If you leave it on all the time the voice can get somewhat annoying. We are going on a long trip in September and I will re-review this device after we get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"instruction relatively clear, but takes too long time to locate satelite","review":"I bought this item during thanksgiving period, so it is a deal. just tried several times, shows instruction fine, but took too long time to locate satellite, usually five mins or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Garmin c340 is great","review":"On a recent trip to Sanibel Is.in Florida to attend a wedding we decided to rent a GPS when we rented a car in Fort Meyers. My first question to the gal at Alamo was is it easy to use, her comment was if she could anybody could. She was right, we were able to use it right away with out any directions at all. In as much as we did not have a clue where we were going this was well worth the rental fee. If you have ever driven from Fort Meyers to Sanibel one cannot believe the amount of lefts and rights we made before getting to the hotel. It got us there right to the front door. On returning home I immediatly ordered one from Amazon. I opted for the c340 because of the voice on street names although the c330 worked just fine for us. I would highly recommend this item,and it's also a great mans toy. We all need toys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous, would recommend it to anyone!!","review":"My parents got a Garmin last year and loved it so my husband and I bought this with some of our wedding money and we LOVE LOVE LOVE it!! It adjusts your time of arrival when you take gas stops and lots of other fabulous features and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a navigation system!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"The Garmin C340 GPS unit was easy to use right out of the box. We've had no troubles with satellite acquisition, and we like the fact that the unit will re-calculate a route based on deviations we make from the original route, in fact, we get a kick out of the \\"tone\\" of the unit when it advises that its \\"Re-calculating\\". We especially like the fact that in addition to advising us to turn right for example, it tells us what the street name is, so we can concentrate on driving and not on the unit.The unit has been reliable, and we feel that we can venture off to places we probably wouldn't have before because we have this unit to tell us where were going and how to get home. I would buy this unit again if given a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"C340: Excellent buy","review":"I have used my C340 for a couple of trips and have found it to be excellent.

Won't leave home without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get there with ease!","review":"First of all, the order and delivery process was the easiest possible.I had tried another GPS trip device and was quite displeased so I was hesitant to try again. After my son told me about his Street Pilot C340, I braved a try. The Garmin Street Pilot C340 is as fine a piece of equipment as I could ever hope for. I have tried to confuse it by going far off the recommended path. It patiently announces, \\"Re-calculating\\" and gives me instructions back to my route. Thus far, I have not been able to confuse it. I am a retired physicist and appreciate good instruments like this one!.Gordon E. Gross"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin StreetPilot","review":"Great gadget. I purchased it for my daughter because she was moving out of town to Rochester, NY from Richmond, VA. We drove up there together and used the Garmin. It led us every step of the way. We wouldn't have been able to find our way if we had only depended on a mapquest printout. When we ran into detours, the Garmin guided us right through. Now I need to purchase one for myself. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and gets the job done.","review":"I have been using the c340 for a few weeks now and it is a cool little device. The POI's are cool and it has just about everything. The maps are easy to read and the voice features are a necessity for me when I cannot look at the GPS. My only 2 complaints are just some minor niggles. It kind of has a funky shape that makes it a little harder to take with you. Also, the voice feature works well but sometimes tells you what to do a little too late (i.e. \\"take ramp on left to I-680 South\\" - about 20 feet before the turn which can result in you missing the turn if you cannot get over). To remedy this, just look at the next turn and you should be good. Like I said minor complaint.All in all an awesome little device. When I upgrade to a thinner model with Bluetooth it will DEFINITELY be a Garmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Driving Fun","review":"We bought our Streetpilot right before a driving trip to Florida, 1100 miles each way. This is super easy to use. It tells us every turn to make along the way, and tells us in advance which way we need to turn so we will know which lane to be in. As we were looking for a hotel or a grocery store, we just pressed in our request and in seconds, we had a list, including distance, and then if we chose one, their address and phone number, and then if you press \\"Go,\\" it will take you there. It gives you all kinds of other information, too, such as miles traveled, miles to your destination, moving averages of your speed, approximate time of arrival, etc. It really did make our trip less stressful and more fun. It is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS navigation system","review":"I have had this system for about two months now, and couldn't be more pleased. It appears to have every address and street in the U.S. that existed at the time the unit was made. The voice directions are excellent and work even if the \\"View Map\\" feature is not turned on. I was especially impressed with the unit when I found that it even had the gravel Forest Service roads in North Georgia in its data base. The unit calculates new routes very fast, so that if you miss a turn, it tells you and puts you on a new route immediately. This is very helpfull in cities with traffic congestion. I would recommend this unit to anyone seeking a relatively inexpensive GPS for their car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as warm as my wife, but nags just as well.","review":"I got one of these things with an Enterprise Rental Car on a recent trip to new England. THe interface is very easy to work with and entering text has an intuitive feature that pops up a list of streets or cities when you've entered enough letters.I really enjoyed the female voice commands. This helped me with the loneliness of not having my wife along. Although, the Garmin said \\"in .3 miles turn left on main street\\" rather than saying \\"we just passed main street and I bet you were supposed to turn there\\".This unit took me everywhere I wanted to go in Vermont, Massachussets and Connecticut without fail. When we got into down town Hartford in the rain it was a little slow at a couple of intersections, but that just reminded me of my wife, especially the way it kept saying \\"recalculating\\" after we missed a turn.But seriously, certainly worth the 8 bucks a day for the rental upgrade. Well worth the $200 on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I bought this for my fianc�� and he loves it. The window is big enough to see clearly while driving.

This wasn't bad for me since I'm an engineer, but I have to admit it was not easy to use when you were kind-of in a hurry to figure out how to get somewhere.The c340 is a breeze to use. It has a large screen and gives voice instructions. Best of all, the entire US maps are preloaded. No more having to load specific maps before going on a trip.Only complaint is that it sometimes takes a long time to fix on the satellites. Oh, also there is no AC charging adapter included.

This book is doing wonders to calm our nerves and abate our fears. Education is a powerful tool.Glink's book is well-organized and about as thorough as it gets. I haven't yet found a question I had that she didn't answer in the book. The book is so jam-packed, though, that I found it's best to just look up my specific questions (once I got the \\"basics\\" covered).

I am a huge horror fan, big time, I am a fan of Asian Cinema - big time and this movie had nothing positive about it what-so-ever. Even a fan of this type of torture cinema, I say STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"I'm not one to shy away from gore. I actually don't mind it at all. But I am truely and honestly ashamed of myself for watching this. Really dissapointed. I kept hoping for something different to happen but before I knew it the \\"film\\" was over and I was left feeling like I needed a shower. A disgusting movie. I'd rather have a Saw marathon with my Grandma and neices than watch this crap again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising depth","review":"This group and their fans have high expectations for theirdebut album ...; One might expect cookie cutter music given theirtitle of a \\"boy band.\\" However, the cd was well made and hasa little bit of everything for everyone. \\"Liquid Dreams,\\"the first single, established the fact that the album was not going tobe filled with saccharine sweet ballads that have typified many boybands. \\"Every 6 Seconds\\" is very catchy uptempo song, withedge and bite. \\"Love Should Be A Crime\\" is more of a 80'seasy listening type of song. It might be something you might hearon...; with its lyrics. \\"All or Nothing\\" might be the cd'srequisite ballad, which isn't too saccharine when compared to ...songs. Overall, this album is surprising balanced and has depth thatis not found in other boy band's debut album. O-town has potential tobecome more than a generic boy band with the depth they have shownthus far. This album will surprise most cynic listeners, but willplease fans.

I wasted my money just to enjoy three songs..and they want to be as big as *NSYNC?..it's going to take more than three hit songs to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"O-Town-- Not Your Typical \\"Boy Band\\"","review":"For anyone who is skeptical about giving O-Town a chance, don't be. This CD has a little something for everyone. There's R&B, Ballads, Rock, and a little bit of a mixture of everything in between, from the Rock/R&B Liquid Dreams to the more Latin sounding \\"We Fit Together\\". The most amazing thing about the album is that every one of these guys sings with such heart and soul-- they are not your typical \\"boy band\\". You'll also hear different lead vocals on just about every track-- yet it still sounds good. There aren't just two guys carrying the show here. All five are capable of solos-- unlike certain other pop sensations. This first album from the real-life stars of \\"Making The Band\\"-- Jacob, Ashley, Trevor, Dan, and Erik will leave you anxious for their next CD, which will include more of their own original music. Yet, you won't get tired of this one while you wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointmet!!!!","review":"I really love boyband music so i thought i would give them a shot. i liked the song i heard on the radio \\"All or Nothing\\" but what a suprise, their music was so dumb, it was way too predictable and some of it was gross { listen to the song, Every 6 Seconds\\" and you'll see what i mean!} i was so disgusted, i actaually took it back that day and asked if i could exchange it b/c of it's crudeness and got an Nsync CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Pop Fans Hate These Guys...","review":"In all actuality, I have to say I don't like O-Town. At all. I think they're annoying and completely WITHOUT talent. There are boy bands who can sing live 98 is best live, but BSB and *Nsync do very well, also. O-Town, on the other hand can barely carry through with all the synthetics in the world. On top of the fact that they can't sing, their songs are boring and clich��d. Nearly every one is about girl-chasing. There's nothing fresh or inventive.I didn't care for the single \\"Liquid Dreams,\\" I thought it was annoying. I hate \\"All or Nothing\\" because #1 They ripped off the title from Cher and #2 It has no Ooomf, nothing to make you say \\"Gee, I wanna hear that again!\\" They get one star for their excellent song \\"Love Should be a Crime.\\" This throw-back to the eighties is fresh and fun, quirky yet sweet, sassy. It has everything a song should have, and the vocals are very good in this one.Just download that one. There's no reason to waste money on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"They CAN sing, but...","review":"I have very little respect for this \\"band\\"...what did they do to work for their success other than show up at one audition?

Yeah they can sing, and I love the song \\"All\\" but...I don't have respect for a bunch of cocky guys showing off on some tv show."},{"rating":"1","title":"'NSYNC Lite (as if that were possible)","review":"About as saccharine (and as fun) as an Ameretto hangover. This fey ensemble's sole pitiful attempt to assert some 'edge' can be found in the lyrics of the lead-off track, \\"Liquid Dreams,\\" which appears to be about nocturnal emissions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the 0 star option when need it?","review":"This album is so horrible it shouldnt have even been put out. I mean to torment people with this music NOW that should be a crime!! With its hideous lyrics and horrible musicality its a miracle this was even released. This is further confirmation that the mainsream public would eat up anything with a image. Let me just save myself from this mess and go listen to my Bob Marley and Nirvana albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got lucky","review":"I must admitt that I did enjoy watching making the band so I decided to buy the cd, but honestly the music just isn't good. I fully regret buying it. The voices of O-town just don't blend well together. The majority of the time I don't know what key they are singing in. To tell you the truth, I feel that if somehow this group of guys had ended up together and tried to get a record deal, they never would have been able to. They got lucky and because they won a contest everything came so easy for them when they didn't deserve it. If you like this type of music I suggest buying Nsync, Backstreet Boys, or 98 degrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"O-Town? Please.","review":"Let me tell you, I took a break out of studying for my finals to write a review for this group. I am an avid N'Sync fan - I am a 19 year old white guy so that seems like a great life. I would have loved to get into a group like O-Town. But... I don't think that this album is really that great. With all the effort Pearlman put into making a group, etc. you would think the album would be better. But this just comes off as sounding way overproduced digitally, with fixes coming in on their vocals. I don't fault the guys, but I think Pearlman was more interested in getting a show on TV than making a group. They are doing OK, but maybe we can hear something better in album 2. I give them 2 stars for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"O-Town CD Review!","review":"i would like everyone out there to buy O-Town's new CD. You are probably wondering why you should buy this cd, oh they're probably just another boyband or something! BUT I AM HERE TO PROVE YOU WRONG! O-Town is a cd must buy!!!! This cd is not just your typical other boyband, these guys have got lots of talent!! they have moved up from singing pop songs on their tv show Making The Band to singing more urban-like beats! that totally get you singing and dancing on your feet. This isn't just another BSB or LFO! they are O-Town, the newest addition to urban music. This cd comes with 12 songs packed with r&b, a little bit of pop and some slow songs and of course \\"All For Love\\" and \\"Baby I Would\\" from the TV show Making The Band. And to top it off their #1 SONG! LIQUID DREAMS! (which has made the guiness book of records).

It swept me off my feet, Their music just can't be beat.

Ashley Erik Jacob Trevor Dan, If anyone can do it these guys can. Go out and buy their CD today, I promise that you'll be blown away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD!","review":"Amazingly, this is a nice party CD and I thouroughly reccomend it for fans of the show!

Buy it and have some fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is wrong with you people?!","review":"What are you all drones?! not only are they full of rat excrements you know for a FACT that they're a put together band. I mean alot of boy bands and rock groups are mad because other famous people call them \\"put together crap\\" be these hoes actually ARE put together crap. And thier single Liquid Dreams?!?!?!?! are they scared that if they actually say that they Jack off to African American women (and they're all African American wich the fact that maybe one is African American is kinda racist)while they're sleeping someone will get mad at them? And so they make a song about it?!?!?! i dont know about you guys who bought this CD, let aloneliked this CD disgust me and you should all be ashamed.

GO BUY THE CD TODAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is Da Bomb!","review":"When I put this cd in my cd player I was so happy. But ones I heard it I fell in LOVE with it. Now all I do is listen to this cd all day long. I can't put it down for a second. And when I get more money I'm gonna buy a another one for my mom's car so I can listen to it there.

Too bad, so sad . . . In my opinion these guys don't even come close, couldn't hold a candle to BSB --The lyrics sound the same with virtually every song (who wrote this anyway???) -- the tunes are interchangeable and boring.I listened once -- that was enough for me. O-Town is no more, Backstreet's Back (oh yeah)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure, off the assembly line pop....","review":"Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning. Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums. They rock and they'll blow you away musically. They have guys who play their own instruments in it, and play that very well. Please don't let music like this reign the charts anymore. It is a scam by the record companies for them to make s**tloads of money. They give you this sleek \\"appealing\\" commercial trash used to fool you and get YOUR MONEY!!! Please listen to real music. Their are starving musicians everywhere around the world who deserve to get paid before these little droids do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for a Debut","review":"After seeing the video and hearing the first single off this CD, I went ahead and got it when it was released. I liked the single, \\"Liquid Dreams\\", as well as the two songs that were highlighted on the show \\"Making the Band\\", which were \\"All for Love\\" and \\"Baby I Would\\". I was very pleased when I listened to the whole album and discovered that Steve Kipner (of previous Christina Aguilera, and 98 Degrees fame) had written alot of the songs for their debut album. Although a few seemed to be added as \\"fillers\\", the strength of the ballads really shocked me. Every one of the ballads could easily stand on it's own as a single, and the crooning voices fit them to a T. The guys seem to have pulled it off and I think in a few months their name will be as much a household word as the rest of the bands. A well deserved 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making of a Super Band","review":"O-Town was alot more than I expected. I did catch a few of the episodes and I was rather impressed. The 5 guys based in Orlando are among the best I have heard. Most of the songs have a kickin sound. Ashley, Jacob, Trevor, Dan & Erik have great harmony together. The only downfall to the album, and its no biggy is that they don't write any of the tracks or play any of the instruments. Guess they are saving that for the next one! The album is inspired by some of the great influences of music today. (You can just tell from the sound). Most of the tracks are of a \\"let's have fun spirit\\", though the cd does slow down for a couple R&B style songs. I loved listening to ALL OR NOTHING, that song just grabs you by the heart, and doesn't let go. The album also has some great strings. I was happy to hear that. Most of the album was recorded at \\"Boyband Central\\" Trans-Continental. With Lou as Exec Prod. They know how to do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"The manufactured boy band O-town release their debut and to be fair it's not bad but it lacks a lot. First, they have a long way to go vocally, the songs are very standard pop/r&b, the lyrics are way too cheezy (espically on \\"girl\\", \\"sexiest woman alive\\", and \\"take me under\\"). And some songs are just plain horrible! Such as \\"all for love\\" and the total cheeze of \\"baby, i would.\\" Let's see what they have to offer in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again...","review":"Lou Pearlman has done it again, and this time he's flaunting his latest creation in our faces with a TV series documenting the creation of yet another boy band.Someone should tell O-Town that they should be writing songs about having love for a girl no matter what she looks like, instead of stuff like \\"Liquid Dreams\\". Oh, that's right, they didn't even write it. Heck, they were practicing the songs on this album before the groups members were even finalized.To me, that tells me this album was made for the singular purpose of making money. There's nothing wrong with making money in general, but this wasn't meant to be anything else than another cash cow for Mr. Pearlman."},{"rating":"1","title":"-_-","review":"From reading the reviews, I had expected better of what I ended up listening to. Don't get me wrong: despite being a guy, I do listen to other 'boybands' such as the Backstreet Boys, Westlife, N'Sync, etc. They're actually good at singing, and their lyrics (for the most part) have some meaning. Failing that, they're usually plain fun to listen to!O-town on the other hand.. maybe it's because they're new, but still, from the hype.. I expected more. The lyrics are cheesy, the vocals strained, and there is no originality.O-town may have given some serious effort to this, but they've got a long way to go, and need alot of improvement before they'll ever make a name for themselves. It could be done.. but not just yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"O-Town, stealing the spotlight","review":"These days many a girls have lined up for miles and waited for hours to see the popular faces of boy bands such as Backstreet Boys, 'N SYNC, and 98 degress but a new face has invaded the pop world. Newly created group O-Town (named after their site of origin Orldando, Florida) has finally hit the scene with their seft titled debut album which released on January 23, 2001. Weather it's the sultry lyrics of 'Sexiest Woman Alive', the hip-hop beats of 'Every Six Seconds', or even the soft ballad's of 'Love Should Be A Crime' this musical phenomnon is sure to captive you. They have some how mananged to meet all expactations of teenage fans all over the country but dared to venture into their own sound, differeing from other groups. The next step for these five daring young men is racing the charts. With a start like this, they are bound to accomplich all goals set from the start. We wish them well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"This album was horrible. I brought because I felt like giving O-Town (more like O-terrible) a chance. It wasn't worth the money! These guys suck - all the songs sound the same. Does anyone else have a problem with the fact that they're somewhat of a manufactured band? I do, and the music proves that they're just trying to be like Nsync and Backstreet...too bad it's not working"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too generic to be taken seriously!","review":"I'm a pop music lover and I dig other boybands like BSB and NSYNC, but O-Town's capricious arrangment of songs does little to satisfy my expectations for a debut. I was initially drawn in by \\"Liquid Dreams\\" (despite the RIDICULOUS lyrics commercializing body parts of supermodels... uggghh) but the rest of the album was a real flop. You can't really expect much from a group put together by a blimp enterprenaur, but STILL.. they could have done a lot better for themselves (I think). This new contender is simply trying to emulate a style already cultivated by sprouting young boy bands. Bottom line: save your $$ & go buy something better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Ok, when I first heard that Otown was putting out a CD, I was pretty skeptical. But I bought the CD anyway because I had watched the tv show. There are a lot of old songs on the cd like \\"Baby I Would\\" and \\"All For Love\\", but there were enough new songs to keep me listening. The cd isn't as bad as I thought that it was going to be. I mean, it's not the greatest out there, but it isn't as bad as most of the reviewers here say it is. Some of my favorite songs on the cd are \\"Love Should Be a Crime\\", \\"Take Me Under\\", and \\"The Painter\\". So if you don't want to buy the cd that's fine, cuz it's not worth spending your money on if you're one of those boy band-hating people, but these guys offer a variety of songs that include hip-hop, pop, soul, and rock for those of you that care."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE All or Nothing","review":"I think this CD is great - I absolutely LOVE Dan Miller - not only do I think he is very cute, but I think his voice is also, especially in All or Nothing, very... whoa - I love his voice. I mean, yes, the rest of the guys can definitely sing also, but something about Dan's voice surprises me that he was the 6th choice and not the 1st."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"They are a fairly new group but I think they came out very strong and they are still growing the popularity.

I despise Lou Pearlman, and anything he is affiliated with, but when I watched an episode of the show, I realized those guys had talent, and potential to go far. I picked up the single, and thought it was pretty cute, and planned on buying the cd when it hit stores. I purchased it, and was not dissapointed. I think the best songs on the album are, \\"All Or Nothing\\" , \\"Baby I Would\\" , and \\"Take Me Under\\". If you like *NSync, or Backstreet Boys, I advise you to pick up this cd today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shy Girl","review":"I'm a \\"Shy Girl\\" from PA and i think this cd is the best. \\"Baby, I Would\\" buy this cd right away. \\"Every Six Seconds\\" I find myself humming one of the tunes. The guys of O-Town are the \\"Sexiest Men Alive\\". This cd has everything -- from ballads to rock. If you're a \\"Girl\\" or guy,a \\"Painter\\" or a doctor, you would like this cd. If \\"Love's a Crime\\", i'm in trouble because i love this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I brought because the cover looked good but after playing it I knew why I never hear of them, not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I ordered this product, and when I finally got it, it was not even the real CD. You could tell that it was a burned CD that they passed off as the real thing. The songs weren't even in the right order!!!!! They dont even match the order of the songs on the back of the CD case, which is also a copy of something and not the original, so you get to guess which song you are listening to. this was a horrible purchase and I will never purchase anything from them EVER again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Album R'Us","review":"But that's not bad if you like pop a lot. I like this album, cause I like that boy band pop. Just don't tell anyone at school. But actually to tell you the truth, O Town and LFO are the only boy bands that I like (currently). I don't like the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync. Even though this album does sound like it. So if you like N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys this album is all for you. It incluides the three singles \\"Liquid Dreams\\" , \\"All Or Nothing\\" , and \\"We Fit Together\\". There's a lot of tracks on here, and the boys of O-Town wrote most of their songs. Which is really refreshing since most bands and artists these days don't and just have some pop writer write them a lot of \\"single songs\\".Oh yeah, did I mention that this band was put together by MTV? A little while ago, they had this show called \\"Making the Band\\". You know the original version of Making the Band. Not the P.Diddy had, where he made that hip-hop group. By the way it hasn't had a hit yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cd and my favorite song","review":"the cd is great, I am not sure I would let my little sister listen to the hot topics of the songs but I loved it, I think \\"The painter\\" is as good or better than some of NSYNc songs, simply the best, the lirics are great, I love the guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the \\"boy bands\\" as far as music is concerned","review":"As a mom and aunt of several young girls, I can sing along with every song on every BackStreet Boys or *Nsync album. O-Town's album is by far the best I've heard. Usually, you need to listen a few times to really appreciate a song or album. I have found that after just a first listen, I loved so many songs on the album and having now listened to the entire album several times, I love all the songs. A favorite -- track 5- Love Should be a Crime -- a great rock song that reminds me of the Beatles. I think these guys are just great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"O-Town, Nice Try","review":"OMG, This CD has just about everything, just all in the same tune! There is no variety of words and all it talks about is how sexy women are!!! If you ask me, This CD is no good. The only good songs are Baby I Would and Liquid Dreams, even that one is pushing it. Besides which, there are only twelve songs. I really liked the t.v show so i said what the heck, i'll get it! Stupids me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O-Town review : will i like it?","review":"The Album O-Town, if u liked *N Sync's 'No Strings Attached', Birtney Spears' 'Britney' & 'Oops I did it again', BBmak, Bardot's 2nd albumm u might like this one. WARNING: if u do NOT like bands that have been put together (PT), u will hate this just as much as any other boyband that has been PT. although, lead singer Jacob, has cridet for writting a song on the album. The Soul songs r my faves, but dancing away to 'sick lyics' is still fun. y sick words? r warned: O-town like to refer to sex alot. all the song on the album r about girls. Every 6 seconds & Liquid Dreams r good but the songs r about sex - well thinking about it anyway.i give this ****/***** stars: it's a very good album, but not a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the place","review":"I honestly wanted to believe this album was going to be good. I mean here we have five guys who worked to make it. We got to see every little step they took on TV and of course you wanted to root for them. But as much as I wanted to believe I had to face reality. They are an extreme wannabe clone of N'Sync. The album goes from super sappy pop to look at me I can be down with hip-hop/r*b. The music lacks production and the music lacks a concept. The mediocre single Liquid Dreams (have you heard the lyrics!?) and the song Girl are the best songs other than that you're looking at one of the most dissapointing albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop Groovin' to the pop tunes of O-town!","review":"I was an O-Town fan from the start when i first saw them on Making the Band. So, of course when the CD came out i couldn't wait to buy it! The songs are so fun and they make me smile whenever i listen to them. Track 6, Shy Girl is the BEST!! Put it on repeat, you'll love it! If you like NSYNC or BSB you'll love O-Town. The pictures on the inside of the CD booklet are SO HOT!!! So, what are you waiting for?! Buy it online today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"For reasons my own, I went out and bought this album. I didn't really think it would do much more than collect dust, but I was wrong. It's really not all that bad (and this is coming from a Country fan LoL)! If you don't like those popular boy-band styles, don't get this CD. But, if you don't mind them or do like them, it's worth getting. They have a nice style that is easy on the ears and doesn't get too annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"OTown is great! They have real talent. They are cute too!","review":"Hey! So, okay. let's get down to it. This cd is great. I love all the guys in this band. They all have great voices. I have watched their show, 'Making the Band' since the second episode and have not missed one episode since then. The guys in OTown are all sweet, sensitive, caring guys. Ashley and Jacob in particular. But, back to the review. The cd has a great mix of songs. From the fast, 'Every Six Seconds' to the slow 'Shy Girl'. This cd has your usual pop songs (Sorry guys, but it's true) 'Liquid Dreams', and 'Baby I Would'. But it also has your songs that are totaly OTown. Such as 'Take Me Under' written by the fab Jacob Underwood. Definitly a must buy. Give the show a chance too. I know it's sounds corny but it really gives you a look into who they really are and how they live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The O-Town CD Review by juliag_angel","review":"Omg! Omg! Omg! I dont know what to say im so breathless! The CD was so great! I bought it January 23 and i hurried home to listen to it. The lyrics are so nice and touching. They all have such great voices although it is confusing to understand who sings what. The lyrics are just soo great. They're totally real and relate to real experiences! All the songs are so good! You can listen to the cd when ur down because it has songs that have an upbeat and are more happy and then there's songs u can really relate to and listen carefully. I prefer the songs Love Should Be A Crime and Every 6 seconds they have a nice beat. I recommend all of you make some time to go out and get the CD i doubt there's any way u'll be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O town","review":"Went out this morning and bought this CD before class. I was kinda sad because it didn't have all of the songs on it that were in the TV show. But it is still really good anyway.

My favorite on the album is \\"Every Six Seconds\\", which is a rockin' song, mixing a little rock with the familiar pop sound. \\"All or Nothing\\" is definitely single material. \\"The Painter\\" and \\"Baby I Would\\" are beautiful ballads. \\"Liquid Dreams\\"(their first single) is a very catchy song, as well as \\"Take Me Under\\" and \\"All For Love.\\" In my opinion, they are the only group out there able to give Backstreet Boys and Nsync a run for thier money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations","review":"I was amazed by this cd. Usually there is one or two songs on an album that I usually skip over - not the case. I like all the songs. The quality of these talented young men's voices come through loud and clear.

It's a 4 dvd set and contains all the 16 episodes that were filmed and finished. They have been remastered and have a good quality to them. If you've been used to watching these episodes on a grainy youtube video you will be pleasantly surprised on the quality. No, it's not like today's sci fi quality but for the early 70's it's fantastic. There are scenes I have watched on youtube but on dvd it's much clearer and you see everything. It's funny, this is the first time I have seen a clear picture of the show in color. In 1973 I was a kid and we didn't own a color tv then. If you are a fan it's a must have. Bless you VCI.

Another cult classic filnally comes to DVD!!!","review":"At long last this forgotten cult scifi classic comes to dvd! Many who remember this show have panned it for being stiff, with wooden acting and cheap sfx. Most of the sfx was done with the croma key effect. You have to remember that this show was made in the early 70s, on a very tight budget. The show was also abandoned by it's creator. While the show has it's flaws, as most shows do, it also has a charm the can only be found in an early low budget tv production. Fans of Doctor Who will appreciate the low budget effects and storylines.All in all, this dvd release has been a long time coming and I cannot wait for my set.Have an open mind, and give the show a chance before bowing to the critics who will pan the show, you may be pleasantly surprised!My rating is on the content which hopefully will be matched by a superb quality dvd release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great to watch a show from my childhood but","review":"Hey this was a sctv production no not the skit you see on late night comedy with John candy but the real sctv network.

The brain child of Harlan Ellison, who left the production while it was still getting started, it is literally a hot mess of crummy acting, bad scripts and awful special effects.

The story may be interesting but I didn't watch it long enough to find out.

I jumped to the last episode and the same music was there, too, so I gave up on the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlan Ellison","review":"I'm surprised to see there is no mention yet of creator Harlan Ellison. I've never seen an episode of the show but I read the paperback novelization of the pilot that was issued back in the 70's.I remember very little about the book itself except that there was a very long and entertaining introduction by Ellison about the creative struggles in making the series. Not surprisingly, Ellison hated what became of his creation but praised the person who molded the novelization from his earlier drafts of the pilot script.The story had a lot to recommend and I shall try to finally see what they made from Ellison's original ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is...Dr Who fans will enjoy it.","review":"OK, this series has gotten such a bad rap that many sci-fi fans think it was the worst show ever made, but it isn't. Ok, so it wasn't Harlan Ellison's Star Trek as it should have been and it was on a very low budget, but that has not stopped anyone from enjoying cult classics like Land of the Lost, Dr Who, Red Dwarf, etc. This is watchable and creative. Perfect? No...far from, but it is not the worst show ever made. It stars Keir Dullea from 2001 and guest stars Walter Koenig (Star Trek) and Barry Morse(Space 1999). It is a fun series. Don't waste effort imaging what could have been and just enjoy it if you like lower budget sci-fi done well. Ellison is that good that the industry could not completely ruin this. The Starlost!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought this series!","review":"I saw this on the tube in 73, I was surprised to find it on Amazon. This shows that you do not need a big budget to tell a good story. There are some unexpected guest stars, Barry Morse, Walter koenig (Same sorta russian accent) This is way better than anything that the SciFi Channel has done in long time except for Eureka."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Trying to Stay Awake....","review":"Hello!I too remember this show from the first run, and although it was never one of my favorites, I don't remember it being this bad. I am ashamed to say I am a Canadian. Basically what we have here is a very good set of ideas for 15 minute shows. Unfortunately each episode lasts 50 minutes. They seem to compensate for this by playing long stretches of cheezy electronic music, talking rather slowly and repeating the same actions over and over. After the first five minutes of each show you can predict exactly where the show is going. I am about half way through the episodes, and truly are having a very hard time staying awake. I am going to watch the rest of the episodes on my other DVD player in the next room. It has a feature which allows you to watch at 1.4x normal speed with sound. It will be the only way I can get through the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starlost potential","review":"I remember this show appearing then disappearing when I was in my teens. I thought the premise was great but the actual shows were cheesy. I recently found it again and rewatched most the episodes. The idea is promising but it's compromised by inane writing and soulless acting, poor pacing and ridiculous special effects. I did like the few scenes with the surly computer. You'll probably be unhappy if you buy the CD Set so I suggest renting it from NetFlix first."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T FORGET THE USS LIBERTY","review":"The USS Liberty incident was an attack on a United States Navy technical research ship, USS Liberty, by Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft and Israeli Navy motor torpedo boats, on June 8, 1967, during the Six-Day War.

I thought that it would be neat for the bus to go around the roadway and set off the roadway sounds as she played with the trains. This is the first battery-powered vehicle/engine I've purchased so I opened it up to try it out. I found that Bertie didn't have the power to go up hills and didn't have the traction to come down without racing along and falling off of the side of the track. Bertie didn't work well going around the 3 1/2 inch curved track either; she kept veering off of the track and I had to put her back on. My advice is, if your track includes hills and small curves this purchase may only frustrate your child to the point of them not even using it. I am not going to pay twice as much for this Bertie when my daughter will have to guide her around the track manually anyway. I will be taking this back to the store and getting her the original Bertie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch that hurt!","review":"This also pinched my children's hands and fingers.

The montessori teachers at her school would be proud of how we've organized her things with this dollhouse \\"bookcase\\". I highly recommend this product. It beats a toy box hands down.

I asked the teenage clerk what it was and he replied he didn't know. Evidently, it was a sample sent to the store and the kid just put in on to see what it was. It was the best blues CD I have ever heard in my life. This is a gritty, soul-searching performance by Ward. His guitar is not tuned perfectly, his voice breaks when he tries to hit the high notes, but the result is the most haunting set of tunes I have ever heard.I break this out of my collection of over a thousand CD's at least one a month. Also, I have probably given at least 10 of these CD's to friends who heard it at my house or in my car. (These are copies that I bought -- not made, since I want to support this great artist). If you like Blues then buy this CD. After you listen to it you'll love the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme but fascinating","review":"Trpceski generally takes these pieces at breakneck speed, and with quite a bit of force in the louder passages. He manages to avoid banging in spite of the power here. This is how I was taught not to play Chopin...but it works, in my opinion. Poetry is rarely (but occasionally) sacrificed in service of pyrotechnics. There are lovely moments, but most of the time you are just amazed at the technical prowess on display. Not a good choice for an only recording of these works, but an excellent alternative if you are looking for a fresh take on these oft-recorded pieces. No buyer's regret here."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but where is Chopin, where is artistry?","review":"While this is a respectable and mostly competent recording, it is light years behind such artistic achievements as Ivo Pogorelich (DG) and Mikhail Pletnev (Virgin), just to name a few.There is nothing new in these readings, which makes the CD redundant. The Finale of the great b-flat minor Sonata reminds a Czerny Etude rather than a dry sand storm over the graves. And the Scherzi, while technically assured, bring no musical revelation or innovation. Most of it is simply too loud and fast, and the passage work sounds more like Liszt rather than Chopin. There is little elegance and grace in these performances. Just hear the best recordings of the Sonata and Scherzi and compare. Unfortunately, this EMI release does not stand much of a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging and motivating","review":"Bob does a great job of helping the average reader understand their role in ministry - usher, music, etc. All are important in the body of Christ.

The first half of this movie is very very slow and I had to struggle to get through it. It picked up somewhat, and actually parts of it are really good, but it is very drawn out. The ending has a neat twist to it, but it's a struggle to get there. The second half made up a little for the beginning, but this is not what I expected.

The narrative is unrelieved by any positive lessons learned. Motivation for any action seems to be the immediate gratification of any need or the avoidance of pain caused by others or the rigid conformation to a social structure that demands subjugation of the weak. \\"Gal's\\" observations about herself and others show little empathy, insight or learning. To be fair, none of it is glorified, but told instead in a very matter-of-fact tone devoid of analysis or judgement. As an oral history detailing the multi-generational consequences of poverty and ignorance, this book succeeds.

It seemed there was no editor involved. Yet, if the sentences and grammer were more refined, then the reader wouldn't get the proper impact that develops as the story unfolds.No one could make up this story. It is told with as much sincerity as one could give which adds to its interest and belief of reality. The events are of a dysfunctional family for sure that practices terror by the adults and eventually gross disappointment by the siblings.This life story is certainly interesting where one could say, \\"and there, but for the grace of God, could go I\\" because it probably happened to many uneducated families as to the treatment of their children and the selfish attitudes of most involved.I started reading this to my wife and both of us enjoyed the book thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but flimsy","review":"I bought this for a Halloween party and it's definitely a cute costume...but it's a little on the flimsy side.

Although I probably have one standard calligraphy style, I like to dabble with ways to letter differently.Besides offering a good number of lettering techniques, this book also shows some examples of some really beautiful calligraphy works.

It displays information that is covered up and lied about at schools nationwide. It is enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting brain candy","review":"This is a hard book to put down. It's filled with fascinating little tidbits about the seamier side of human existence and all its accompanying malodorous history. There aren't many books that I prop in my lap while driving to catch paragraphs while waiting in traffic, but this was one of them. It's filled with fascinating topics and exposes, all the stuff you really want to hear about but undoubtedly were never taught. I'm giving it four stars for those avid readers who will probably not learn a plethora of completely new things (Zaks has done a great job of expanding on many facts you may have read about before elsewhere). But there will be plenty of stuff you haven't as well. Enough to make it very hard to tear this book from your side until you've read the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"more praise for a deserving book","review":"I got this book as a college graduation present and absolutely could not put it down. It is a wonderful look at some obscure and misinterpreted historical information and for the most part, Zacks is careful not to state anything as absolute fact without well-documented proof. I am currently reading \\"History Laid Bare,\\" also by Zacks and also a fantastic read, but I prefer \\"An Underground Education\\" because of the writing style (History Laid Bare is mostly quotes) and wider variety of topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, mindless fun","review":"This is book is just entertaining, mindless fun.

Scandal, that is what Underground Education really is all about, but how fascinating a read it is, scandal and all.I literally read it through with in a day. I have went back to it many times since. Some accounts, I'll give, seem a little Hokey, if you will, but the book is well worth the price. I highly recommend it. You will likely not find a book with more non standard information. I used many excerpts from the book for a college class lecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great information, but terrible layout","review":"I am in the 2nd section of this book (Business), and thoroughly enjoyed the first (Arts and Literature). Great 'useless' information and trivia, which will come in handy at a cocktail reception. The problem is that in the 2nd section, for about 20 pages, every other page is shuffled with the one behind it (making it essential that you flip back and forth a couple pages to read each chapter - all around pages 60-70, and beyond). This is incredibly annoying, and I've never seen it in 30+ Years of Reading. From Random House, no less, how did this happen?I can't tell if I don't enjoy the Business section because of content or layout, so I'll give the book 4 Stars, and deduct 2 for a terrible layout (giving me a headache, it is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner","review":"This book has kept me up for three nights because I can't put it down. It has something for everyone. I wasn't totally interested in the business section, (not my thing) but there's so much more to the book it didn't matter.

Wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Pornographic","review":"I enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I put this book down in disgust. Almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. As I was flipping through the book, I found x-rated pictures and drawings that I would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. I never would have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore, and I regret throwing it in the trash before I could see if I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"It was my fault; I did not heed the warnings of some of the other evaluations of this book on-line. I thought that An Underground Education would be something akin to An Incomplete Education (4th ed), or at least Reader's Digest's Strange Stories and Amazing Facts (1976). An Incomplete Education is a terrific book full of tid bits of history, science, art, etc. which I thoroughly enjoyed. Strange Stories and Amazing Facts was also full of information ranging from Super Novas to the Loch Ness Monster, and I loved reading this book with my grandfather and still flip through today. Unlike An Incomplete Education or Strange Facts, An Underground Education was neither inciteful nor educational. It was basically a \\"history\\" of the sexual preferences and perversions of people throughout history, with some titillating pictures of hermaphrodites.This is a book I would have enjoyed at age 14, but not as an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"It's okay....but the author certainly only see the dark side.

He's a humiliated washed up physically ruined knight at the end. After all he did for the others in previous books it was a sad end to his story. I don't mean that because he is deformed either. He was a just a such a good character I didn't want to have anything bad happen to him.

Mr. Aamodt takes no interest in such piddling matters as relevance, consistency, point-of-view, or tone. There are long passages that do nothing to advance what little story there is; the main character has a \\"sixth sense\\" that follows no rules other than the author's whim; and the style is so riddled with cute cliches and tired expressions it makes one long for the fresh witticisms of a high school detention hall. There's a cover blurb from Craig Shaw Gardner, but Mr. Gardner seems to have taken the Stephen King route: supply the blurb, cash the check, and thank God he didn't actually have to read the thing.

I did not have high expectations, as the previous reviews were so mixed. But I was still disappointed. Horrible acting and editing aside (I understood that this was filmed during the reinactment and these were not professional actors) the film was impossible to follow. The timeline and details of the battle were unclear as was the layout of the ground. The narrative was often difficult to understand and there were endless scenes of men moving across smoky fields without any explanation. Try another film if you are trying to understand more about what happened at Gettysburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Movie","review":"This DVD is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost. The film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes. The acting is hopeless...really, really bad!

In all honesty, as much as I enjoy movies of the Civil War, I'd like to return this for a refund. Alas, that's a prospect that has,indeed, gone with the wind. Thumbs down to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gettysburg 3 days of destiny","review":"This video is a real sleeper. A painfully complete amateur video. The reenactors are trying very hard to reeanact the movie Gettysburg more so than the real event. They try harder to be the actors that were in the movie instead of focusing on the historic personages that really lived it. This video is a complete waste of time and money. The best part about it was the real belly laugh when one of the soldiers actually burst into a musical number without Monty Python to save the scene.

However, don't expect alot of passion from the \\"actors\\" because most of the acting is so very poor, that it is barely watchable.More shocking than the cold and dull lines were the appearance of some of the \\"actors\\". I am not a fan of the \\"Lost Cause\\", but I was stunned and disappointed to see General James Longstreet and General Robert E. Lee as paunchy and portly. Both men were physically fit and the \\"actors\\" that protrayed them certainly were NOT!The movie is okay for its cheap price, but anything over $10.00 will be a rip off.

Both Love is and He'll Never sound like they could be heard in Atlanta and in Morgan County, Georgia than the New York studios that the songs were recorded.

I commend the author for some of his encounters and descriptions, but I had the constant feeling when he talked about situations without involving himself.

Probably because he was a journalist instead of an historian. However, as with his book Silent Victory, he can't help injecting his personal biases in the narrative. Blairs interest in U boats came about when his boat the USS Guardfish was docked next to Erich Topp's U 2513. That was later used as a target by the U.S. Navy. The U 2513 was a type XXI boat that was ahead of its time technologically. The torpedo tubes were designed to operate like a revolver shooting bullets!

A fact Mr. Blair conviently omits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for WW2 history buffs","review":"Blair's attention to detail and his ability to relate to the trails of Uboat crews puts him in a class with Ambrose and Foote.

I was also intriqued at mr. Blair's blatant hypocracy when talking about previous German works as being heavily biased. Mr. Blair's work is in it's own, extremelly biased. The U-boat war did come close to sucess, and no, the U-boats greatest suferings were not from their own incompetence. Some of the statements in this book make me seriously question his proffesional abilities in dealing fairly with all sides of a conflict. Although, I suppose that his days as a U.S.N. submariner probaly contribute to his outrageous biases opinions. Please levae them out of historical works.Sincerely,David LongBelmont, NCI"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good researches, biased narrative","review":"If we are to believe Blair, an ex USN submariner, that the KM was not what it was said to be, that it never came close to strangling trans Atlantic trade, that its sinklings were vastly inflated, that the U boats made hardly an impact in the waters off America and the Carribean, that its officers and sailors were mostly cowardly incompetents,then the question must be asked, why were so much resources put into defeating them? And why was he writing 2 massive books on them? Could he be jealous of the fact that the public is fascinated and mesmerized by the U boats, while the USN submarine service has been accorded much less attention, not to mention adulation, despite its proven successes against Jap shipping?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty Atom-Great Reading","review":"I have the original edition and the second printing with some different photos from the first edition.A great book which I have read many times.I gave my son Jay a copy and like myself and everyone else who reads it loved it.A very inspirational book for all ages.I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn about the potential of the Human Mind","review":"This book will make you rethink everything that you know about human potential. It is one of those book that you will read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closer to the stage play than the original version","review":"I enjoyed this 1995 version better than the original version. I bought it because our community theatre is performing it this summer. It is much closer to the stage play than the Dick Van Dyke version. Vanessa Williams is amazing but I thought Chynna Phillips was sorely miscast. She was boring and too old for the part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye, Bye, Birdie","review":"I thought this new rendition was great! The pairing of vocals(Jason Alexander and Vanessa Williams) was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Entertaining","review":"This 1995 made for TV movie is millions of miles away from the tacky propaganda-filled 1963 film. This version follows the real story and doesn't leave out any key parts or songs. The casting was done well, especially Tyne Daly as Mae Peterson (hilarious) and the actor who plays Conrad Birdie--an amazing voice! George Wendt plays the role of Mr. MacAfee and not only can he sing but is a riot in the Ed Sullivan scene. However, Chynna Phillips is not a great choice for Kim--she looks too old, her singing voice is only so-so (Kim's songs have all been lowered an octave) and the way she interpreted the role made Kim seem snotty. One of the best scenes is when Ursula and co. are doing \\"Bye Bye Birdie\\" at the malt shop--their voices and enthusiasm are unbelievable. All in all, it's a great show, excellent viewing for anyone wanting to produce or direct the musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Movie Since Sliced Bread!","review":"This movie was so funny! Jason Alexander was hilarious, so was Vanessa Williams. The mother was soooo dramatic! I love the part when she tells her son that she'll walk to her own grave!

The cast tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pits","review":"A travesty of tacky talent and too-little imagination.How anyone thought they could improve on Ann Margaret is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Better Than The Original","review":"I don't see what people didn't like about this movie. Jason Alexander was a lot funnier than Dick Van Dyke in the role of Albert Peterson. I didn't think that this version was really long at all it never dragged and kept you interested throughout the whole show. I liked the extra songs they added like Bye Bye Birdie and A Mother Doesn't Matter Anymore. The whole cast was awesome even though the girl that played Kim wasn't very believable as a teenager but Vannessa WIllams was great and Tyne Daly was perfect for the role of Albert's dominating mother. I love this version and think it an upgrade from the 1963 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lost opportunity","review":"For everyone waiting for a \\"restored\\" Bye, Bye Birdie, this TV version came as a real let-down. Jason Alexander is simply out of his league when taking on the role created and brilliantly performed by Dick Van Dyke. And Chynna Phillips as Kim? What a mistake. The rest of the cast is okay, but all suffer in comparison to the 1963 film (which sadly left out some wonderful songs and pressed Janet Leigh into a singing role for which she was not equipped).I'm afraid that those looking to capture the fun and vitality of this great musical will have to be content with the wonderful, if abridged, original film. This show is so much a part of its time that any revival is difficult, but this one fails on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible1","review":"What were they thinking? This is so dark and gloomy looking. It looks like The Godfather. This should be candy colored fun! The Hollywood version is so much better, the tone is exactly right. Who in the world came up with this concept. The creative team were certainly asleep at the wheel on this one. I feel sorry for the cast caught in this mess. Avoid this at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyne Daily-marvelous at Mama","review":"This included an amazing performance by Tyne Daily although Melissa Metzger would have been a better pick for the part in my opinion!

Well, the 1995 remake of \\"Bye Bye Birdie\\" is no exception.The 1963 original touched my heart and made me feel good; when I first saw it I cried at the end. This 1995 version is just plain stupid. It didn't make me happy and/or feel special as the 1963 version did.If you love the original, do yourself a favor and DON'T see this. It's REALLY bad. The only reason why it didn't get no stars is because the scene with Rosie at the club is funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puke!","review":"Get a life! This is the worst version of Bye Bye Birdie ever! I almost threw up when I first watched it. The story line is stupid, the actors can't act for beans, and the \\"fun & new\\" songs that are added are just terrible!And may I add that that Wilson Phillips hussy can NEVER out-do Ann-Margret! Oh, and in case no one noticed, the actors look embarrassed half the time.This is NO family movie! It's full of bad jokes and scenes.I'll NEVER understand how ANYONE could even remotely LIKE this movie, let alone love it! It's horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the book, but constellation for the author","review":"As Hemingway the Zen master said, \\"Some are hunters, some are not.\\" Several Hemingway scholars have treid to explain EH's lifelong affinity for blood sports (notably Bredahl and Drake's 1990 exegesis of Green Hills Of Africa) -- this \\"package of Papa\\" is content to just push whole chunks and raw excerpts of Hemingway onto a marketing skewer without any comment. Using \\"hunting\\" as a marketing criterion forces together the most flaccid posthumous Hemingway and some of his purest fiction and livliest reportage. It's obvious Hemingway wrote about hunting (and fishing) in the same sense the Homer wrote about Mediterranean tourism. Lazy readers may like the way this editor rearranged Hemingway's cabin furniture, but most of the writing actually seem the duller for being re-packaged to a less spontaneous purpose. Sad to see a great prose turned as a license for 'designer books,' and by his own kin. Some are artists, others are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice based on actual science","review":"I absolutely love this book. I read or skim through easily over 50 books a year and this book is one of my top 10 favorites of all time. I'll tell you why. Most books on interactions such as 'How to Instantly Connect with Anyone, 92 Little Tricks...' or even Dale Carnegie's 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' only deal with the author's personal experiences. This book however, is a level above that. The author doesn't share personal anecdotes as much as he shares scientific research on things that have been proven to work. This book has, among other things, helped me understand women better better and the male author was, in my humble opinion, very brave for being so clear about what they are actually thinking and how they interact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"Very interesting information can be found in this book about differences in how the sexes approach relationships.The writing style is a little different, conversational; definitely not your traditional textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling Parody = Champagne for the Brain","review":"-Capricorn-Aquarious 10th House Artemis Enneagram the Artist Seeks Taurus 6th House Apollo Enneagram unrepresented-The funniest, most brilliant haute spoof I've read since Busch and Silver's stellar Why Cats Paint: A theory of feline aesthetics. From the title to the final unlikely couple (Hugh Hefner and Sylvia Plath), author Thomas David Kehoe's mostly poker-faced parody gleams with generous good-humor. If you enjoy good writing and good-hearted send-up, this book leaves no set of facile, ethnocentric, scientific-sounding, globally encompassing yet stereotypic standard theoretical relationship rocks unturned. (Hopefully he'll work the Tarot into the second edition.) All this and the author conveys some perfectly practical and practicable bits of advice, with even a warning or two. For example, that one should not date the author of relationship books."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter garbage","review":"This book is not a parody. It is a waste of space. I'm glad this was printed on recycled paper. I was offended - as were most of the people in the counseling center where I work. We didn't even want to donate it because someone else might read it.

I had purchased the spray to begin with and was not impressed with it but my thought was maybe it just didn't do a good job because it was a spray.

I tried it one more time and two days later I found a few fleas on him again this time we caught it in enough time that he wasn't completely infested.

Will never buy again. Not worth the money. If it doesnt work why sell it?

Naturally I was pleased to see the price as it's gets expensive with four dogs, however, when they say \\"it's too good to be true\\" it usually is..by the time they were ready for their next application, one month later I found fleas on them. Ironically before I found the fleas I couldn't find the paperwork for my purchase on Amazon or I would have purchased more Frontiline Plus from Fatman's Doghouse..thank goodness I had misplaced it..later I went on-line and saw that buying outside the U.S. is not the way to go which I had no idea I was doing when I purchased this...I learned my lesson..my dogs health and well being is one of the most important things to me. I'll never use Amazon again for such a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for my large or small dog","review":"I purchased it at my vet's office. My large 90 pound Golden had flees a little over 2 weeks later and the fleas on my Scotty never went away. Since I live in the south the fleas and tick problem are insane. Both my dogs are inside dogs unless they go out for an hour to play and potty. My Scotty had a tick on her and my Golden began getting hot spots all over from the fleas. Fed up I went back to the vet office and this time purchased Revolution which apparently covers fleas, ticks AND prevents heartworm all for the same price. Frontline doesn't cover against heartworm. My vet mentioned that Frontline is losing its effectiveness.

I've had good success with Revolution - start there and you'll be a lot happier with your results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I was so disappointed in this product. So many people recommended this product to me so I got it for my dog. It did not get rid of the fleas at all.

Not only did I not get my items in two days like my Prime membership gives me, but one had not shipped at all three days later and the other one charged me shipping, which is still slow. AT NO TIME did I do anything different than I have a billion times when placing this order so I don't understand how this happened. I understand how to buy from other merchants and I did NOT do that in this case.

We put it on her and after about a week, still no difference in the amount of ticks attached to her. Everyday, we were picking ticks off of her that were attached and feeding. What a waste of money.

I noted that the price is VERY CHEAP and so I eagerly bought it. After the first three months applications, and my animals were still scratching viciously, as well as I began to have a flea infestation in my carpets, I smelled the contents of one of the vials. It smelled very vaguely of a perfumed scent. The Frontline from my vet smells strongly like that of a pesticide. Thus, having said that, I feel like this is a BOGUS PRODUCT.

I have read on the web of other people's dogs having this response, and counter-arguments that there is absolutely no reason this should happen. However, I've seen this response in my dog, and I worry that it may be an allergic response that could get worse over time, so I've stopped using this product. I'm going to try the spray-on Frontline next, as that stays on the surface of the hairs, rather than being absorbed through the skin and entering the dog's bloodstream as a systemic pesticide (the way Frontline plus is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparison of Reviews","review":"I've used both, and to me the one that is least harmful to the animal is best. From the reviews, I see MANY more 'sick dog reviews' from Advantix, around 30%.

I put it on my dog to rid her of the few fleas she had. Well let me tell you, it did nothing. Someone from my local pet rescue told me it works for about 4 days. I even bought the plus which is supposed to work well beyond 30 days. Maybe it's a new formula, or maybe the fleas have found an immunity, but I can tell you the product did nothing for my dog and her itching.

I notified them, they asked me what happened, I told them, they refused to accept responsibility as the woman told me 'their' tests did not indicte this problem. If you love your dogs, your puppies, your smaller animals, do not trust this product or these people. The doctors also thought it was safe to use the anti nausea medicine in women 40 years ago that caused birth defects by the thousands! This company LIES! It is VERY dangerous to the life of your pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last or doesn't work","review":"I have a 2 year old whippet, about 25 pounds and I've tried using Frontline instead of a competitors product that would require a prescription. Anyway, I normally bathe the dog before application (to get most of the fleas off) and at best Frontline will work on fleas for 2 weeks. Though Frontline boasts being waterproof, it seems the dosage weakens if I bathe the dog again at some point after application of the medicine (days later).Suffice it to say, spending money on doses that are advertised supposed to last a month at a time and hardly cover a couple of weeks does not seem worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PERFORMING ON THE MARKET.","review":"Someone please try to tell me that you never get one or two ticks a year regardless of using this product as instructed. I've been using it for years on my dogs. Then one of them got a tick disease despite using Frontline religously. I want only the best for my dogs, that's why I went with the most expensive, thinking it was the best. I was always taking off fully gorged ticks from my dogs. I decided to try other brands. I've ended up using a brand called Freedom, sold at Tractor Supply. Since using it, NOT A SINGLE TICK has gotten through. It's been over a year now and not a one. Plus it's less expensive. Give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised.I've told this to my Vet and they've since starting using it as well, even though they still sell Frontline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than a month later, dog is scratching again.","review":"I bought this because my dog had some fleas.

Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS.

I only started recently searching about the relationship between Frontline and seizures, and there are SO MANY people whose pets have had seizures from Frontline--just do a tiny bit of research. Your vet will deny it but there are too many people who have reported it. Sure enough, I realized my dogs were having seizures 1-2 days after each application of Frontline, like clockwork. (and all other causes have been eliminated--they have a healthy diet, etc etc)This product may work well on some dogs, but for mine, the evidence is clear and the Frontline has been causing seizures in my dogs. Many people have reported that their dog stopped having immediately after stopping using Frontline.I'm switching to a gentler, natural brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product, but the Top Spot worked as intended, I guess.","review":"I ordered this alongside another dose of Frontline Plus for my 8-year old and 3-month old beagle, respectively. It was not until after I had applied the treatment that I noticed how different the boxes were. Upon further inspection, I realized that the larger-dog dose was in fact Frontline Top Spot, and not Frontline Plus. Now, normally, I wouldn't quibble about that. But as the boxes state, Top Spot does not kill flea eggs. Two weeks have passed, and now both my dogs have fleas again.

It was between his shoulders, exactly in the spot we had applied the Frontline. I have subsequently read other online reports of this happening but hoped it wouldn't with our dog. We have notified the FDA and Merial but don't expect a reply from either.

When a flea dip, fogging my entire apartment (including the requisite washing, vacuuming and cleaning), failed to keep him flea free after using the fourth dose, I took him to his vet.

This one star review is based on my most recent experience. I ordered this product through Amazon and received an illegal product via a third party seller. I got Frontline Combo, which is not approved by the EPA for sale in the US, in a Frontline Plus box. The lot numbers on the box and product did not match either, so clearly someone had deliberately tampered with the product. I experienced the illegal sale of a pesticide, product tampering, and mail fraud all in one transaction. A representative at Merial, the manufacturer, told me that this problem is widespread on the Internet and advised me to buy Frontline products only from my vet. I just took a look at the seller reviews and there are a number of us who have had the same experience with this seller, so I don't think Amazon is paying attention.

It is less effective on ticks after three weeks so you should check your dog carefully if ticks are active in your area.

She was flea free for about 2 weeks. It seems that the fleas can get immune to some of the meds used to get rid of them. She was previously on Advantage Multi but it seemed to stop working for her last October when the pit bull moved in next door. Honestly, you really have to treat your lawn and house to get the best results because just treating the pet isn't enough. I wish the Frontline was all I needed, but I launched an all out attack on the fleas inside and out as well as on the pets and now they are doing great. My advice is to treat your yard and house at the same time in order to get maximum flea protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"six months and still find fleas","review":"i don't know if they have changed formulas or one flea treatment works better on one kind of dog and not the other, but for my dog frontline plus doesn't work. i still find fleas on my dog. he is not covered with fleas, but he still has at least 5 or so on him. my vet said it was because it takes 3 months to break the cycle. my dog has been on frontline for 6 months and i see no difference. i have bought the frontline off the internet and the latest batch was from the vet office. neither seem to work. plus the box says kills for one month so it shouldn't take three months to work anyway. this stuff is alot of money and it is wasted when it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working this year","review":"i put the full container on the shoulder of my dog. the next day she was covered with fleas again. all over her face, and running all over her. it was if she had not been treated at all. she is a small dog, less than 5 lbs. i could not let the fleas stay, i have had to bathe her twice more, it is not keeping the fleas off her. i purchased another product and am applying it once a week. it is a spray to put all over her and it keeps them off better. we have treated the yard but the fleas are really bad this year due to our mild winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleas have developed a tolerance","review":"It appears that the fleas have developed a tolerance for this product in our area.

It's easy to apply, and does not appear to have any adverse affects on the dogs (unlike Biospot, which I tried before switching to Frontline - Biospot made my dog violently sick).

I called my vet's office and they told me they have found that the Frontline is not working in Maine and that Frontline has acknowledged it, but they aren't doing anything for those of us who have bought it. I now have 2 more weeks before I can apply something new and in the meantime my animals are in agony with biting fleas and I am trying everything I can think of to rid them from my house.

The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus.

It has always worked wonderfully. The price was so much less online that I decided to try buying it here.

After three applications with only 18 days apart, my dog keeps getting a flea or two here and there. She is allergic to fleas, and even one would torture her. My vet has mentioned that he stopped carrying FrontPlus because dogs keep getting fleas while on medication. He sees it more and more now. Are fleas getting immuned to it???? I guess now I have to go and leave more money, buy Capstar to solve the problem. I wished Frontline would do something about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work anymore","review":"We've always used Frontline on our dog but this Summer it doesn't seem to be working at all.

I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin, but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :,( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work so well for us","review":"I expected more from this product. We tried this natural spray at Kaymart that worked even worse. Maybe the Frontline needs several months to work, but based on the results we had with the first application, we are unsatisfied. Our vet told us this was the only product that would absolutely get rid of fleas, but it did not work. About a week after we applied it to our dog, we noticed that she still had fleas. It says that it will continue to work for up to three months, but it did not for us. I will try it once more after a month has past but so far, not working too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves My Dogs","review":"My older dog is severely allergic to fleas. This product works wonders with getting rid of those pests. When I ordered this she was ripping out her hair because of fleas. (I know, I am such a bad mommy) Within a day she was more comfortable and I couldn't find a single flea on her. If you follow the directions it even lasts after a bath during the effective time. I couldn't say enough good things about Frontline. It quite literally saves my dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"timely and great price","review":"Seems to be working for my dog, much cheaper than if I bought it at the vet or a local pet store. My dog is a longer haired breed (kind of a spaniel mix, from the pound) and we are active, dog park, walking trails (not quite hiking, Mommy's not that fit lol) etc and she sleeps in my bed and so far, no fleas. I highly recommend this product.Apparently it doesn't work with ticks as much? We walk in forests but she's on-leash, on the trail and not in the brush so I can't say whether we've had tick encounters or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing wrong with Frontline, of course.","review":"These folks are selling a 3-month supply at 6-month prices.Nothing illegal. And there's nothing wrong with the product itself.The item listing (Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Drops for Dogs & Puppies Up to 22lbs) doesn't mention how many pills are available; in the description of the item, it does say, toward the bottom, that you are getting 3 pills. Just over $18 each, and that's before tax and shipping.You get 3 pills, not 6. If you are aware of that, go on and buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pain but worth the savings","review":"It's definetly more work to have to take a 6 month supply and put it in a vile and then properly measure out the correct amount of frontline into a mini saringe than just opening a 1 month packet, applying it, and then tossing the packet out. You then have to wash out the saringe without washing off the numbers on the saringe when you would ordinarily be done. That said, the extra time and hassle are probably worth the reduced price, especially when you're trying to save money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frontline Product","review":"I love the fact that I can get Frontline at a lower cost.

This year, the Frontline doesn't seem to be as effective against the fleas. When i asked my vet, they told me that a lot of people had been having problems with the fleas while using Frontline. The fleas seem to becoming resistant to some of the flea products like K9 Advantix, Advantage and Frontline. The vet suggested Vectra 3D as an alternative that seems to still be effective.

I will never waste money on this company again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff doesn't work!","review":"I have been using Frontline Plus monthly, from March through August, 2012, and have documented the doses to be positive I gave it as noted. Last week, a friend took my standard poodle in for several days while I was out of town. The first evening, she called to say the dog was going to the kennel, as he was covered with fleas! When I discussed with my vet, he said the manufacturer was investigating for lack of effectiveness.... that there may be an immunity that has developed in the flea population.Be careful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your $$ Buy K-9 Advantix II","review":"I wouldn't normally write a bad review for a product, however, I really believe this is not worth the money. It essentially did little to nothing to kill or prevent fleas on our pets. I can safely say that most of the fleas on our pets did not die or even leave the animal. We tried this for a three month period and it was absolutely useless.In a comparison, we switched to K-9 Advantix II and the difference was night and day!Same animals, location, weather, etc...The Frontline Plus honestly did not work. I may have well administered tap water instead of Frontline Plus.The K-9 Advantix II worked almost immediately.PLEASESave your money! DO NOT WASTE IT on this product.

I received an envelope with 2 large dosages not labeled, no safety or product disclosures, a syringe, a broken glass vial and a half sheet of paper titled \\"idiot\\" instruction. May be counterfeit as my dogs had a very different reaction than when I use the actual Frontline in the proper dosage package. I find the advertisement misleading & the manner of distribution unethical and potentially unsafe. Research online reports regarding this potentially harmful method of dispensing, differences in dosage packages, and changes to product once opened and stored. The Seller replied to me with repeated horrible emails of insults, attacks and demands. If you take the risk, pray you never have to deal with the Seller. Not worth the savings or the risk for our four legged friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"I have used this product successfully for years. I don't know why, but this year it does not keep the fleas away. I have never had a problem with fleas on my dogs before because I apply Frontlne monthly.

I am soon going to try a different product and see if that helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!","review":"I don't know if the fleas have become resistant to the ingredients or the product just doesn't work anymore, but I applied Frontline to my dog and he had fleas crawling on him a week after application.

She recommended Advantix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective anymore!","review":"I have been using Frontline for a long time with my animals. Unfortunately, the fleas have become immune to Frontline. I started finding fleas on my dog this summer. I supplemented with flea shampoos AND giving Frontline more frequently (every 3 weeks instead of every 4). I also fogged and sprayed the house. (More $$$) This didn't help- my poor dog still had fleas. He scratched and scratched and gave himself a swollen ear. After $500 of surgery and meds for the ear- I am switching to Revolution Flea Control (and that seems to be working!!).Several vets I have talked to, and several dog owners, tell me that the fleas seem to have become immune to whatever Frontline uses. One vet tells me that he is sending back all his unused Frontline supply and will not carry it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"zeb","review":"I have used Frontline on my Golden for the last seven years with great results until this year.

It doesn't work like it used to!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Frontline Plus.","review":"Product is not working. Had to reapply after 21 days. My dogs are going crazy with ticks galore. Will never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ineffective against fleas in my area.","review":"Always check with your vet, even if buying online. They will have a better understanding if the fleas around you have developed an immunity to a particular flea treatment. Had I known that my vet no longer even carries Frontline due to its uselessness here, I would not have wasted time and money on this product. I am glad to know there are alternatives. Hopefully Merial is in the process of reformulation; too bad they do not stand by their product. Nevertheless I have informed them of the lot number and the complete ineffectiveness of this item at my location."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"Seller shipped promptly so no complaint there. It didn't do any good though. I have a mini schnauzer who picked up a nasty flea problem. I started with multiple flea baths, didn't help. Then I got the Hartz topical medicine. Didn't work. I then spent the bigger bucks for Frontline. Didn't work. I finally got a prescription for Comfortis pills. I could not get it locally and had to order it from 1 800 petmeds with a prescription from my vet. The dog had seen the vet within a few months so they didn't require another exam, I just called and got the prescription. They shipped super fast and the Comfortis did the trick. I wish I'd never bothered with the topical stuff and gone straight for the prescription pills. The Comfortis pills worked super well and super fast, and I wasted a bunch of time and money getting to the real solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always the best price on Amazon","review":"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must. I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks. Free shipping, packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO, no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus. Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective. I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too. Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What it Says.","review":"I use Frontline Plus every month on my 25 pound mutt and so far it has worked perfectly. She has had no flea, tick, or lice infestations whatsoever. In fact, I've witnessed ticks jumping on to her and then jumping or falling off soon after without attempting to burrow beneath her fur. The chemicals in Frontline Plus are absorbed into the dog's skin and are very effective. I don't like to think about how they might be harming the dog....she seems not to notice the monthly application or the slight chemical smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"works beautifully!","review":"This product is a great idea. The 3pack of frontline only lasted about 3 months and cost 35 dollars. With this product I'm able to have my dog protected for about 6 months for alot less. There is no reason that this won't work it's the original front line products and it's applied the same way except instead with a plastic syringe (no needle) instead of using the edge of the frontline applicator. I will buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: this seller is not clear that these are bulk doses","review":"I purchased this product in the six-dose size and expected to receive six individually-packaged tubes of medication. Instead I received two jumbo-sized tubes, a dosing sheet, one single-use 1 ml syringe, and an empty vial. Apparently they are selling bulk doses, but they do not make this clear in the product description. So the expectation is that you dispense the bulk dose into the small vial, read the dosing sheet, measure the proper dose, and store the extra. And by the way, the single-use 1 ml syringe is not enough to administer a single dose for my 40 lb dog (at least according to the enclosed dosing sheet), so I had to administer it in two goes. Some people might be comfortable with this: I find it a huge hassle and with a lot of opportunities to spil the medication or provide too much or too little. Do yourself a favor and find someone who sells individual doses if you don't want to deal with all this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't kill ticks or repel mosquitoes","review":"If you live in a wooded area (particularly in the northeast US), you might want to use Advantix instead. Advantix repels mosquitoes (and Frontline doesn't), and it also does a better job than Frontline in killing ticks. My dog was on Frontline, but ticks were still crawling all over him. The switch to Advantix has helped a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work for Me","review":"After countless recommendations by friends, family, and vets I decided to give it a shot. It really didn't do much. I have 2 Dachshunds and a Miniature Pincher that stay inside the majority of the time. They only go outside to potty. I can't say it didn't work cause they did have \\"less\\" fleas but, it wasn't worth the money at all. Just last night I picked 10 fleas off my min pin. I live out in the country so perhaps that has something to do with it but I have read many reviews that said it works in the country as well. Perhaps I have a hybrid breed of fleas that are immune to FrontLine?"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"Not quite sure about the 1 star review, but i have never had a problem with this product on my dogs, one being a 100lb lab. it has been a great product for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the stuff that really works.","review":"My dogs got infested with fleas about 2 years ago.

We visit dog parks and friends with big yards and other dogs. I have been using this product once every 3 months for years.

She had a couple fleas on her, so I checked the next day. She seemed to have a few more fleas so I figured the product had not taken effect yet. I checked the next day and still found fleas on her. Same thing the next day and the day after that. I looked for an expiration date on the package which I thought there had to be, but there was no expiration date.

One day after Frontline Plus was applied she suffered a seizure. After the seizure happened, I tried to think what she may have come in contact with that could have caused the seizure. After doing a Google search of \\"Frontline Plus\\" +seizure\\" I found numerous pet owners who believed this pesticide caused seizures in their pets.

This is the second time I bought this particular product from Amazon. I think this frontline product is not as effective as it could be. My dog is near the weight limit for this product, but even so ,I expected a greater deal of effectiveness in terms of flea and tick control than the frontline presented. It is supposed to be good as a flea and tick deterrent for one month, but he had a tick bite within 3 days. I don't know if it is because the product has been in the wharehouse at Amazon for awhile, or what it is, but I won't be buying frontline through Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complications and issues of the medicine","review":"First of all, my cats and dog still have fleas. We have a golden retriever and 2 small cats. Used 2 vials for the dog, and 1/2 each for the cats, as directed on the box. The fleas did reduce, but they are still there. So either the product didn't work like it was supposed to or we have a different strain of fleas than the cat and dog fleas.Second, I don't know if it is because of the medicine or just coincidence, but 3 days after the dose, one of our cats died! He had diabetes, and ended up dying of kedoacidosis. The medicine may have assisted in the complications of his diabetes which caused the kedoacidosis. SO DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR CATS HAVE DIABETES!!!Third, our other cat has lost a lot of hair where we put the medicine on the back of his neck.. Hopefully this will grow back, but right now it's highly unattractive.I will never buy this product again, and I suggest you be very cautious with your purchase as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooperative but poor shipping quality assurance","review":"It took two extra phone calls to get the complete order correct.

Guess thats why it is so cheap, I have not used it - just in case it is not what it claims to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE or OLD medicine","review":"I have been applying the frontline purchased from this company on my dog for the past 3 months. Lately, she has had a rash. I didn't even think it could be fleas because she has been treated with Frontline purchased from this company for the past three months. I took my dog to the vet today because she has been itching and scratching and has a skin infection. All the hair at the base of her tail has fallen off. I thought she might have allergies or even mange. It Turns out SHE HAS FLEAS and an allergic reaction (dermatitis) to the fleas. So, the vet told me that most online sellers of frontline either sell old or fake frontline because frontline is only guaranteed when bought at a vet. So $265 dollars later, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory shots and having to purchase REAL FRONTLINE from the vet, HERE I AM.... A VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.

We are in an area every summer that has a lot of deer ticks. We do occasionally find one of the critters on to our dog. Sometimes just crawling around the fur, but once in a while, imbedded. So we remove the tick manually. Our sense is that the product prevents more ticks from latching on, given how many there are in the area. Also, we believe (or hope) there is a cumulative effect, meaning that using it for several months consecutively builds up the effect of the stuff -- but that may be wishful thinking on our part. Equally important, we have seen no adverse reaction on our dog, which is at least as important to us as preventing ticks.

I have an indoor cocker spaniel (mix) that barely weighs 22 lbs, so this product for medium dogs from 23-44 lbs SHOULD OF WORKED rather well on my dog. I bought the 3 pack and applied one packet per month until all 3 were used. At the end of 3 months my dog still had the flea problem. I telephoned Merial to complain, and was told by them that you had to apply a 6 months supply to effectively rid the pet of fleas.

The woman said that this was perfectly normal, and that frontline is not a preventative tick medicine. Frontline works by killing ticks within 24-48 hours of biting into the dog!!! Doing a little research online I found that 36hrs is the average time that a Tick could potentially begin to transmit Lyme disease. Some ticks begin transmitting the disease immediately.Dog owners need to know that frontline is better than nothing, and will kill ticks, but not necessarily before they are able to transmit disease to your dog....

Anyway, I applied a second dose and those fleas are still alive and kicking... and multiplying like crazy... And all this time I'm also using the flea comb on the dog trying to give the dog some relief. The fleas I caught in the flea comb were just happy campers, not even woozy from the Frontline! So, it doesn't work at all. I want my $60 back! Maybe it's counterfit or something, I don't know. But it does not work.

Now, I may find one or 2 baby ones on them, but get them before they can really bite the dogs, because something in this product repels them, so I really am a believer in this.

I thought the eggs must have hatched that were in the house and they too will be gone after they bite the dog... nope. The fleas seem to be worse now than before. (not that frontline made them WORSE) But the effectiveness seemed to wear off after about 10 days! That is a huge cost for just a few days coverage. :( I groom, raise dogs and do rescue work....

I have also had to continue to use flea spray when I see fleas, to try to control them. I checked the Frontline website for suggestions on what to do. The little questionnaire indicated the problem was probably the dog's environment. If the environment did not have fleas to start with, I wouldn't need Frontline. Therefore, I find this product a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same product!","review":"I ordered Frontline Plus for my mini schnauzer and it arrived this afternoon.

The second dose didn't work for more than a week!! Maybe that was only due to bathing the dog and spraying (plus doing a good vacuuming)Anyway didn't bother with the third dose, very disappointed, unfortunately I've been so busy that it has been two or three weeks since the second dose also didn't work and way to long to get a refund.

Run!","review":"I put Frontline on my bichons in September, and noticed that they still were getting flea dirt. I applied again in October before I left for a two week vacation. When I returned home, the dogs, who were being cared for in my home by my neighbor, were so infested with fleas, they had begun having a horrible allergic reaction to them. They completely ripped the hair off their tails and left a bloody, scabbing mess. Their hind ends were also a bloody matted mess. After a prescription flea treatment, antibiotics, steroids, and the \\"cone of shame\\", they are finally on the road to recovery. But no thanks to Frontline. It is useless. You might as well treat your dogs with water. And I just purchased a brand new, unopened package of Frontline from Amazon.

I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work (based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with).We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation. When we got back, he had fleas galore. We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days. I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline, and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog. I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that aren't phased by frontline.

When we put this on him, we notice a significant decrease in fleas by 2 days. It helps keep them off pretty well too. We usually apply each month. The only downside is that it is very oily. You have to put it between your dog's shoulder blades and he's got a patch of oil on his back for at least a week. It looks like we was hanging out under a car and is messy to the touch.

Again she became lethargic and this time more quickly and severely than before. So after keeping an eye on her for about 10 minutes, I decided to wash it off of her. She immediately perked up and seemed better, although not normal. The following day, she had diarrhea and a decreased appetite.

I have used Frontline plus for years.I think people forget that fleas will still pop up on the dog but they don't last. It take 24 hours for the fleas to die.

Also if you don't use a mild doggie shampoo the product will not last as long. A more harsher not made for dogs shampoo will strip the product off the dog.It is important to remember it only works for 30 days.

I gave Frontline its last chance a year ago, then switched to Comfortis and haven't looked back.

I think the 18th century composers like Vanhal, Dittersdorf and Stamitz, wrote beautiful entertaining compositions. These were the original innovators building on what Sammartini had started and set the stage for the more familiar and famous Mozart and Haydn. You can find out everything you'd like to know about Vanhal and the others on Wikipedia so there's no need repeat it here. These symphonies were most often written for the composer's sponsor - a baron, duke or the like, meant to be played once or twice and then they were expected to come up with something new for the next performance. For that reason they tend to be light, lively, and original which is why I appreciate and enjoy them.

That was years ago\\" that so many abuse victims get from well-meaning friends and relatives. If you haven't been abused, you just don't get it and never will. Also exposes the many too-simplistic forms of \\"therapy\\" that survivors are often confronted with: religion as a cure-all, forgiveness....

It was first mentioned to me by a therapist four years ago and I found it to be one of the few books out there that is informative without being \\"cheesy\\". If you are looking for a book that is straight talk about different types of abuse--the author even paraphrases from clients which I found helped with personal identification--this is one worth your money. You will be amazed by how many times you will find yourself thinking \\"that is so true!\\" and the author does a tremendous job of weaving the reader through the healing process in a very subtle way (you won't find loads of psychological analysis talk here!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"How ugly it is that in the co-author photography above, he is disguised in devil. When in other books covering the same topic it is not uncommon to read about paranormal problems, and satanism (like in \\"The Narcissistic Family: Diagnosis and Treatment\\" by Stephanie Donaldson-Pressman or \\"MPD form inside out\\").The book was very useful, but now I doubt. I have found other misleading books. It may be something broken in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Book","review":"Enjoyed reading the book and took some ideas from it.

Then one day during one of these moods I decided to try reading something yet again to get my mind off the out of the blue sadness- after reading only the first couple of chapters, something finally clicked in me, and I really knew for the first time what these episodes were about. For the first time ever I actually felt the healing process begin within me and could start taking charge of how I felt. I can't say enough about the excersises in this book! The last few chapters are especially helpful. When you feel up to it, you may want to take out your highlighter because there are some real gems in this text that you'll want to read and re-read for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Great book, this book breaks down abuse in small sections so its easy to understand. Also she uses examples of sessions so its easier to identify with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toxic Parents","review":"This book was extremely helpful to understand and recover from family stress. It explains vividly and in easily understood terms that any reader can understand. It is compassionate and practical and helps give readers direction for moving forward. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is amazingly helpful","review":"I just finished reading, and working through the exercises in, this book. I still have a long road ahead of me, but I have a solid foundation to build on in my healing.About the review entitled : Blame mommy and daddy-- Guess what? Abusive and neglectful parents do have a huge impact on their children that lasts; it changes who the child is at a deep level, and, without help, taints everything in the child's life, right up through adulthood. Parent's ARE responsible for the abuse/neglect of their children, and the impact it has on their children's lives. These children were innocent. The adult child has the responsibility to have the courage to see the truth, do what it takes to heal, and make sure they don't reenact the same patterns with their own children, partners, and other loved ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Either Or....","review":"This book will either confirm for you that your parent(s) are toxic and harmed you deeply because of their own selfishness or it will make you realize that your parent(s) and childhood were not really that bad. The author is not trying to make every parent out to be toxic but rather is tryng to open the eyes of those of us who suffered at the hands of a toxic parent to the fact that it is (was) not our fault and that we can and should re-discover our own worth. It is very hard for anyone to accept that the parents who claimed to want the best for you while giving you nothing but the worst were wrong but they were. And this book will help anyone who has been there get through it and move on to much better mental health. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has had a profound impact on my life.","review":"Sometimes your choices in life are between good and better, good and bad, and sadly, bad and worse than bad. Having toxic parents is a bad vs. worse than bad situation. However, this book has gone a long way in helping me to understand my situation and choices. I feel the most important lesson is to not judge success or failure by what your parents say and do but by what you say and do. Finally, I hate to think about what the long term consequences to myself and my family would have been had I not gained the insight provided by Dr. Forward's years of practical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of healing, for those who survived a painful past","review":"Dr. Forward helps us define our present by looking into our past. She helps us to realize that the person we are now is deeply seeded in the child who was not nurtured. She helps us define exactly what form of neglect or abuse was suffered and then deal with our feelings in a systematic way. I found this book to be both eye opening and healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Most helpful book I have ever read. I've tried positive thinking, meditation, yoga, herbs and many more.... you could say, I've tried almost everything, but this is the only source of self-help that made a difference, that made the first steps to healing.

Author provides good insight into how parents influence our development."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read for all people","review":"No family is perfect, and this book offers insight to dysfunction. Easy read with clear examples of parental behavior and how to overcome the damage. This book gives the first step to understanding frustrations that are underlying in family hierarchy. Toxic parents help me understand my relationships with others and my role as a child of alcoholism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Excellent book","review":"This book is beyond any price I could have paid for it. It is only through reading this book, did I realize not all parents have the best interests of their children at heart. As an adult, I believe we want to think of our parents as perfect, but later on realize they are human and do make mistakes. Some of these mistakes, and the toxic effects it can have on us carry on with us as we become adults. We need to make peace with who we are and reclaim our life. It is life affirming and will change your life for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Out for the MP3 format","review":"The content was great. I also liked how it was broken down nicely.Watch Amazons titling. (I've been caught on this before). Purchased the book and the cd set believing I would get the Audio cd's to play in the car etc. The title states Mp3 then (CD). Like some products bought you get both. It wasn't clear and all I received was one mp3 cd. (At the price of a CD set). If you have the abilities to play only on your computer, fine. However, like most people CD's are played in car radios, personal stereos normally and it was difficult to find time to listen to the set without a great deal of trouble. Loved the content disappointed in the format delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic book","review":"Parental blunders are a problem, but this book does not give good guidance about getting past the issues. It discourages forgiveness and encourages blame. This book advocates a very self-centered focus without reconciliation of the issues in a wounded adult-child's heart. Definitely on the bottom of my list of 'healing' books to recommend to people to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and obvious","review":"This book did not tell me anything new, did not help out at all, contained a lot of obvious statements, and I cannot believe it was written by a Ph. D. I had already understood all those things by myself during my life years, without having to get a Ph.D. I am very disappointed and wish I could have spent my money in a better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Identifies what is and how to deal with it just as well","review":"This book explains many types of emotional abuse IN DETAIL and with vivid examples and sometimes dialogue. I could totally see myself in the dialogues and even predict the next line. The greatest attribute of the book is the fact that Susan dedicated the first half to identifying the problem (toxic parents make you think you are crazy when thinking \\"this is wrong,\\" hence leading the child into confusion and distortion of reality) and assuring the reader that specific behavors indeed ARE dysfunctional. The second half of the book takes the reader into the process of dealing with this phenomenon now. The book's best \\"feature\\" is the fact that she tells you realistically what not to expect from them upon confrontation. Expect denial and NOTHING GOOD! and helps you deal with that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Simplistic but Good Tips","review":"As someone who has a toxic mother, you know how everyday feels like an eternity when you feel so much pain inside. Half of the book is about other people's experiences with her in therapy and the other half is about how we can change our situation ourselves. I gave her 1 star because of this very important point that she misses: If you have a truly toxic parent, confrontation is not the answer (as she says). I agree with the other reviewer who gave one star because it doesn't seem like she has truly been in this kind of a situation. The REALITY of LIVING WITH TOXIC PARENTS is that THEY DO NOT CHANGE. I am a grounded and fair minded person, but I think her advice is baloney. And she spent chapters on bits of advice that you could outline on one page. I felt so bad after reading it. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts with all of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opener","review":"This book along with a couple of others on the subject have helped me to have peace with my hurtful childhood. I had pretty much adopted the attitude that I received the hand that I was dealt in life. Now I'm beginning to see that things could have been much better had I had parents who bothered to take an interest in me other than what I could do for them. The good news is I feel empowered to break the cycle and provide loving feedback for my children at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"How a book can change your life","review":"I am a professional who never realized that the family chaos I endured was not an isolated incident. I thought I was alone, and the only one who suffered at the hands of my parents. After all, there were no physical scars to show for it. This book changed my life, and saved it. It changed my husband, and has influenced my siblings and helped me prevent sending the same damaging messages to my children. I am a true skeptic that any armchair psychologist could know anything about someone they have never seen or examined. This book was like reading about myself! Frightening, but eventually very emancipating. This has never happened to me. If you feel you suffered as a child, read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL EXPERT SPILLS THE BEANS!","review":"It is obvious from the beginning of this book that the author is not only truly experienced but is revealing some REAL INSIDER INFO!

I of course thought, \\"Come on, Master, what about Eric C. and SRV\\", but once I saw him play, I knew what she was talking about. He really combines the 50's sound with a classic blues sound. And he is only half of it. Lead singer Sam Myers is a huge black guy with Coke bottle lenses for glasses. He looks like he is in his 80's and moves real slow, but it all makes a good show. When Sam puts an old fashioned microphone up to his mouth with his harmonica, he defines the word feel when it comes to blowing the harp. I myself am a Bass Player, and pull this CD out every time I need to practice my up-right Double Bass. I know I am in for a good work. It is a great CD to play at parties too.

Rarely will you find odd time grooves that groove this hard. They don't feel like odd time. You may also find yourself humming the melodies to these songs. I found other Bruford albums to be a little uneven (mostly in the vocals department). But in leaving this album completely instrumental - save a little narration - it appears to have let loose some serious inspiration. All of the parts are so well put together it makes for true composition. For bass players to be unaware of Berlin's work on this album is unforgivable - this is without a doubt some of his finest work. The level of performance of Holdsworth, Bruford, and Stewart are likewise at career level highs. This is a little known album that really deserves more attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prog Fusion At It's Best","review":"I normally don't listen to groups that are mostly instrumental, but this is one of the greatest bands in the history of this genre, an extention of the brilliance of Bruford and Holdsworth with UK. After all, they made that band what it was. Docked one star because Wetton's vocals were the icing on the cake with UK, but Berlin is a better bassist though, especially if you're more jazz oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something here?","review":"The reviews for this CD were so great that I ordered the CD from Amazon without hearing it.

Holdsworth has never played with more heart & beauty. The compositions are never merely vehicles for instrumental blowing like MOST fusion, but moving musical stories. The tricky meters never sound forced.For me, this is the record that really put Holdsworth on the \\"one of the most important guitarists on earth\\" list. And Bruford's playing is truly inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fusion masterpiece","review":"After listening to lots of fusion records for more than thirty years, this is the one I play the most, and is, in my opinion, one of the finest fusion records ever recorded. Brilliant songwriting with melody, great solos, vibrant... a disc you wish would never end. Between 1977 and 1980, Bruford focused on solo material. This disc was the second of four releases. Every song is innovative, this still sounds modern, and the engineering is amazing. Check out the crisp sparkle of the cymbals and the perfect overall balance between players. There are some spoken passages on this disc but they don't detract from the music like the vocals on his first disc did. Some of my favorite musicians play on this - Dave Stewart, keyboard/composer extraordinaire; Allan Holdsworth, guitar whiz; Jeff Berlin, bass guitar monster; and Bill Bruford, whose drum style is unrivaled and totally original. A must have for any fusion collection and truly warrants a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"COBHAM GIVES HIS ANSWER TO ALL THE DRUMMERS WORLDWIDE","review":"Drum n voice 1 and 2 are billy cobham s masterpieces in the modern jazz fusion field and among the best releases worldwide so far .If you can obtain both you are privileged .A superb cast of great musicians accompany COBHAM in both of his albums with excellent results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Study of Administrative Theory and Practice","review":"Beach and Reinhartz provide realistic and applicable information that shows how the administrative leader in a school setting can facilitate growth of teachers, lead effectively, and develop personally.

This movie rips off alot of horror movies such as Scream 3. This is John Ottman's debut and in my opinion he ruined his career with this peice of junk. I liked the original, I thought it was awesome, but this movie talks about making a horror movie instead of Urban Legends. Oh yeah, I don't mean to spoil it for you guys who are gonna watch it, but this is a movie in a movie which is so stupid. Oh yeah, and Jennifer Morrison sucks in her role, but there is good acting. But either way the movie is not good.OVERALL: I warn you, if your still gonna watch it.

There's not much to say about this movie all I know is that it's a good movie but the only thing that's not good about this movie is that it doesn't have very good acting. That's all I have to say.

A filmmaker wants to win an award, but unfortunately her crew is disappearing one-by-one. What an enigma! Not! \\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\\" does have one good scene that makes Hannibal Lecter look like a preschooler though. You'll know it when you see the girl in a bathtub full of ice and then she discovers that she's missing something... This movie has Joey Lawrence (TV's \\"Blossom\\") and Anthony Anderson (noisy guy from \\"Romeo Must Die\\" and \\"Exit Wounds\\"). Yes! No! Who is the main star? Nobody cares or should care. Poor film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unnecessary Sequel","review":"Urban Legends: Final Cut was a waste of effort. UL2 cuts away from the original film, which warrants more effort than this installment, with Loretta Devine as the only returning cast member.This film focuses around a different group of college students at a different university. All of them are vying for the prestigious Hitchcock award, but one of them will stop at NOTHING to get it. Soon, people start dropping off like flies. I didn't even feel much emotion or sympathy towards any of the victims. It lacked strong character development and most of the acting was tedious at best. However, some credit is due. The kidney scene is by far the best scene in the movie, and if more of the film was as suspenseful and scary as this, then the film would have been a LOT better. I really do hope that this is the FINAL cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not in a scary way","review":"This movie was awful. One of my friends called me up and asked me to pick up a movie. I thought she said pick up a funny or scary movie. So I picked Urban Legends thinking that this would be a good horror flick. She actually said pick a funny movie like \\"scary movie,\\" the hilarious spinoff of scary movies. Well turns out she got what we wanted because Urban legends-Final Cut was a pretty funny movie to watch. We spent most of the time laughing at the stupid characters and weak plot then hiding our faces behind pillows. Probably not worth watching if you want to see a good horror flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"URBAN LEGEND? YEAH RIGHT!","review":"I SAW THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I LIKED THE FIRST AND THE CAST WAS WELL KNOWN. THE SEQUEL HAS A CAST OF UNKNOWNS WHICH SHOULD STAY THAT WAY CONSIDERING THE ACTING WAS JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE IN THE MOVIE. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH URBAN LEGENDS. THE FIRST DEATH HAD PROMISE AND SLOWLY AS THE MOVIE PROGRESSED IT GOT DUMBER AND DUMBER AND THE ENDING WAS JUST AWFUL. THE MOTIVE WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS THOUGHT UP AT THE LAST MINUTE, TO SAVE MONEY MAKING THE FILM. IT WAS DEFINETLY ONE OF THE WORST OF 2000, AND ANYONE WHO PUTS THEIR HARD EARN MONEY TO RENT IT OR BUY IT ON DVD WILL REGRET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Special Features and Good Movie","review":"This sequel is really good. I think it's even better than the first one. Jennifer Morrinson did a good job, and John Ottman directed it well. If you like this kind of movie, just buy it. And the Special Features included on the DVD of \\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\\" are very good. Take a look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"URBAN CRAP","review":"99 mins of suck..good thing i don't have a life..some nudity (eva mendes' fun bags?) definitely would have raised this movie another star..couldn't wait to look at the talent files(he he)after the movie was over..can't wait for the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"legends gone WRONG!","review":"this 1 was nowhere close to being as good and original than the original. it barely even uses any legends what so ever to kill someone. not scary not even funny. not a good example of a slasher film. hell i wouldnt even call it that. its more of a pathedic mystery rather than horror. the only thing thats good about this is the killers costume is cool and hot eva mendez is a lesbian in this. to bad she dies. hell shes not the only one. this whole movie looks as if it was picked up as road kill and then got some cheap thrills added into it. in my opinion it made it even worse. completely flat and dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The first urban legend was pretty good decent horror film but this sequal just sucks. The begining of the film is ok and you think it might be good but then as it gets further into the film it just gets worse and the ending is stupid. It leaves you saying is that it? It revolves around university students who are trying to get an acting award and all these deaths start occuring. It does keep you guessing until the end about who the killer is but the killer isnt even scary and wears a fencing mask and the story is lame/not well acted.I watched this 2 or 3 times and it dosent get better as you watch it gets worse every time. I wouldnt recomend this to anyone. Go watch the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT DVD!","review":"This DVD rules! It has great deleted scenes, commentary by director, a making of featurette and other great special features. About the movie, I thought the movie was cool. I love sequels. I liked SCREAM 2 and 3, BOOK OF SHADOWS: BW2, I STILL KNOW, and URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT. I hope this one is not the \\"final cut\\". I hope, for 2003 or a little later, that they come with an \\"URBAN LEGEND 3\\". Until there, buy URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD AWFUL FILM","review":"I WENT AND SAW THE FIRST A FEW YEARS BACK AND IT WAS GOOD, WITH A WELL KNOWN CAST, BUT THIS ONE HAD A AWFUL CAST OF UNKNOWNS LETS PRAY IT STAYS THIS WAY WITH ACTING THEY DID IN THE FILM. THE WHOLE TIME UNLIKE THE FIRST WHERE EACH WAS A URBAN LEGEND THIS ONE HAS TWO. AND THE ENDING WAS SO BAD IT WAS LIKE THEY COULDN'T THINK OF SOMETHING MORE ORIGINAL.

ITS NOT WORTH YOUR 2 HOURS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Cut??","review":"Being the sequel to Urban Legends, we expect alot from this movie. I actually give it 2 1/2 stars for I have seen sequels that were much worse than this one. This version takes place at a film school university. With the best film award at stake, and a murder taking place ( the person who was most likely to win ), everyone becomes a suspect. But now no one is safe. There is some gore which adds to the movie and some suspense. Overall, not a boring movie like many other movies I've seen. It's worth watching if you are a fan of the original Urban Legends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From a Legendary Movie","review":"Do we really need another teen-slasher flick after dozens of \\"Scream\\" copycapts produced in the mid-to-late-nineties?? If we do, they better be more interesting than this tepid and predictable cinematic experience. Apart from the mildly engaging beginning and a somewhat decent ending (the scene with the multiple guns in particular), \\"Urban Legends - Final Cut\\" is nothing more than a sequence of tired and unengaging cliches. The acting is wooden and souless (the lead actress is competent, though), the direction lacks punch and the plot offers few surprises. This movie is disposable, unconvincing and tries to seem smarter than it really is (with all those pseudo-intellectual cinematic references to make it clever and hip).A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Fun As Original","review":"Urban Legends 2 is not a good movie. It makes the first film, which was fun and entertaining, look like Oscar material. This film, about a bunch of film students at a cold looking college campus working on student films who are stalked by a killer in a fencing outfit, is nowhere near as fun as the original. Jennifer Morrison as the heroine is cute and everything, but she's kinda boring. Former teen heartthrob, Joey Lawrence, is okay as a pompous rich kid. Loretta Devine, returning from the original, is, like in the first, the real standout. The killer's outfit is pushing it a little bit. I think filmmakers are running out of ideas for the killers. The ending isn't as well done as the original either. What are you going to do?. Urban Legends 2 is decent as a mindless horror sequel, but if you've seen the original, then there is no reason to see this. It's not as good or memorable or intelligent as any of the Scream sequels. A typical horror sequel. Nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dumbest Movie Of All Time! Doesn't Deserve One Star!","review":"No good acting, terrible direction, no thrills, not one supsense scene, and was the most absolutely easiest horror film to figure out the killer. It was too obvious filled with no good stars and no good performances. Jennifer Morrison is not even that hot! And that guy she bangs looks like a NSYNC back up dancer wannabe that came out of the gutter. This is the most stupidest movie in the entire world! There should a hall for stupid movies and this would be number one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than the reviews make it out to be!","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out, and got the DVD as soon as that came out. The movie is very suspensful and cleverly thought out, and I just love the characters. Amy was excellent, and the security guard is really funny. Their scenes together are my favorite. This mixture of characters, the suspense, horror and story line are what make it a great movie. I enjoyed it much more than the origional \\"Urban Legends\\". (Not to mention my heart was racing for most of the duration of the movie!)I think it is much better than the critcs make it out to be, and the added features on the DVD are cool too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sequel.","review":"The first Urban legends is pretty good. Not as good as Scream series but I like it better than \\"I know what you did last summer\\" series. But this one is a miss. Set in a film department of a University where film students got murdered. The actual killer is not surprising, most of you who watch this type of movie should be able to guess who it was. The DVD is OK. Bright and clear picture and solid sound. Not recommended though."},{"rating":"2","title":"must own for any avid python fan","review":"The only complaint I got for this set is that the documentary is still too short with even 5 hours 20 minutes' epic length!!!@@What a pleasure to finally watch the whole 6 episode instead of the BBC lawyer's cut!@@Since the format is so close to the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY,this should really really expand to 8 episode as well. Flying circus still has lots of stuff to explore (the revolutionary free structure is just touched upon in the doc); Meaning of life deserve a single episode as well, at least mentioning Jonsey's fun ride in CANNES...and so on and so on...@@The special feature disc is also a nice complement for this already so amazing documentary, I got to know John Peel is school mate of Michael Palin!Anyway, I'm extremely satisfied with this set, and it truly truly is must own for any avid python fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Differences between US and UK???","review":"Amazon lists this on both US and UK websites as pre-release.

If you follow Python at all, don't even waste your time with the \\"theatrical\\" 90-minute release. The 90-minute release was a bit like trying to cram the history of Rock and Roll into an hour.

I was terribly disappointed. This book is full of opinions, medical and nutritional misinformation, and personal anecdotes. Its main message is that it is OK to follow a vegetarian diet during pregnancy. I knew that before I read the book.I found \\"What to Eat When You're Expecting\\" to be much more helpful. \\"What to Eat\\" has plenty of guidelines for putting together a diet that contains the nutrients you need, whether or not you make a vegetarian choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUSLY INACCURATE","review":"I agree that this book is poorly organized -- but on top of that, the information in it isn't even true! For example, she claims that tofu has 20 grams of protein for four ounces-- not on this planet. In reality it's about half of that, about 9-13 grams. Same deal with beans-- she says 22 grams of protein in 1/2 cup of black beans--truth is more like about 7g! She also says that \\"iron anemia during pregnancy is normal.\\" Yikes!! It's terirbly dangerous and can make you hemorrage during birth!

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a very tedious read that does not match the book's hype","review":"After hearing this book hyped for months on Imus in the Morning, I bought it. What a mistake. One would think that, given the dramatic subject matter, this book ought to have read like a novel. Not even close. It was poorly structured, and none of the subject matter was put in any kind of context. I constantly had to go back and laboriously re-read every tortured sentence just to make some sense of what the author was talking about. None of the electricity or significance of the times came through. I found this to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. And it's not like I didn't give this book a chance. I was stuck on a flight from Chicago to Boston with nothing else to read, so I plowed through about 150 pages before I threw in the towel. I left the book on the plane for some unsuspecting fool to read. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough and fascnating historical review","review":"This book not only covers the height of King's work, but also the events surrounding the assassination of Malcolm X with great detail.

Not horrible, cuz Canon doesn't make horrible lenses. But considering the other offerings available for the same, less or slightly more money, buying this lens should only become an option if its price point drops to twenty or thirty dollars and then only as a backup. It just isn't worth more money than that.At 3.5-5.6 it is veeeeeery slow. If you are taking photos indoors, it is unusably slow. Buy the IS version if you need a wide angle zoom. Or for a hundred fifty bucks more than the IS version of this, buy the tamron or sigma f/2.8 wide angle zooms. Much better build qualities than this lens and faster as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a point-n-shoot camera lens","review":"I've had the Rebel XT and this \\"kit\\" lens for over a year, and the lens seems to be mediocre at best. I stuck with Canon when buying my first DSLR based on loving the optics of my old Canon Powershot S20. Sometimes I think the old S20 had better optics than this kit lens (although the many other limitations of that camera pushed me to the DSLR market).I also have the 50mm f1.8 lens and the 75-300mm 4-5.6 lenses. The 50mm lens is better WHEN it focuses right, and the 75-300mm is amazing (except for when my hands are too shaky...I definitely need an Image Stabilization lens).For anyone looking to buy a Rebel, buy the body only and spend a little extra on a better lens than this one. I will soon be getting the EF-S 17-85 f4-5.6 lens as my replacement for this lens.If I were to make a suggestion to someone looking for their first DSLR from Canon, I would actually suggest starting with the 40D with it's \\"kit\\" 28-135 IS lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, 70's audio quality leaves room for improvement.","review":"A nostalgic blast from the past!

This disc is an exception! It turns out that The Normals, who hailed from Louisiana, released only one single during their existence. However, the CD includes several demos, live recordings and other odds and ends that show them to be a well above average combo. The band penned almost all of the songs on the disc and played with more skill than the average punk band. Several songs even favor 60's bands, like the early Who and include interesting chord changes. The sound quality is also pretty good considering some of the source material.

Thomson-Delmar has a really bad reputation not only for lack of proofreading books they publish, but for being slow to revise books that are found by customers to have a lot of errors. They seem to have little regard for their customers. They just want to sell books. They don't care if customers are left confused by poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not prepare well","review":"i bought this book to study for the national cpht exam ... i studied it well for over 2 months only to be shocked on test day. i was prepared mathematically (something this book does well) but the pharmacology questions (ie: what is the generic name for drug x?) were NOT sufficiently covered - they are simply listed in a read-it-if-you-can 10 page chunk. seeing as how those were the basis of the test, i was very upset with this book. if it had an extra chapter or two dealing solely with drugs themselves, it would be a good buy. for now, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typos don't help","review":"This book is a must for all future technicians. It has a few noticable typos that don't help but can be overloooked for the quantity of information and excellent outline of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone that's looking to get in a career as a pharmacy technician, just pay attention to the questions and their answers since this publisher could not afford to proof-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So MANY errors!","review":"This would have been a great tech review if it weren't for the NUMEROUS typographical errors present! In one chapter alone I found 5 math typos!! Its pretty bad when you can't trust your answer page to be correct! The information learned from this text book would have been so much more helpful if I hadn't had to spend so much time decifering their errors! I wish someone would have proof read this before it went to print! Luckily I have a great pharmacist willing to quiz me so hopefully I can still pass! If I'd had to depend only on this book I would be in some serious trouble! And for as much as this darn thing costs, you'd think they could at least have gotten the \\"solutions for problems\\" right!! Look into getting a different review book--not this one! Its not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for math, but not much else","review":"I ran into a lot of problems using this book. Numerous answers are wrong, questions often involve information that hasn't been taught yet, the drug list is incomplete and vague, and when I actually took the test there were a number of subjects that the book never even mentioned (such as proper DEA form numbers). If you are having problems with the algebra or conversions involved in pharmacy, this book might help, but I would advise looking elsewhere for technical information. I'm probably going to have to take the test again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors","review":"Personally, I don't trust books with errors in them, whether they be grammatical or technical or any other sort. That's why that upon finding that this book failed to spell PTCB correctly on the first page of the introduction, I returned the book immediately. For a book from the same publishing company that produced the Comprehensive Exam Review for the Pharmacy Technician, I'm sufficiently surprised. I would highly recommend only two books to study for the PharmTech Exam: The Comprehensive Exam Review for the Pharmacy Technician written by Jahangir Moini and a supplemental calculation book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"I found this book very helpful in studying for the PTCB exam.

The inner holder is rigid molded plastic, and the outer case is nylon with thin foam padding. It is not intended to protect against earthquakes, etc. However, it is perfectly fine for keeping in the back seat or trunk of the car, and will be OK with normal, everyday handling.When I purchased it, there were 4 sellers on Amazon that had it in stock.

Some other buyers remarked about this being hard to find, but it was readily available on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nylon 60-CD Case","review":"The inner plastic box holding the CD slots is durable. It holds the full jewel cases, not just the slim cases. It also has eight slots for the chubby CD cases in which companies put box sets. The nylon outer fabric is durable. The zippers seem sturdy. My only complaint--and this seems to be the case with most CD carrying cases--is that the lid flap opens and closes from side to side instead of opening at the bottom and being able to lift the flap toward the top. I also wasn't able to squeeze the plastic clamp mechanism hard enough to get the longer strap on the case, but there is also a short nylon handle on it, so that is not an important thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic, Fair price, Does the job.","review":"The title of my review says it all, and not every product meets those simple goals.

It was hard to hold back tears as the wonder-filled story touches on the universal, relating to many cycles in our own lives.The delicate watercolor drawings are beautiful in their own right, yet support and enhance the story in seemingly perfect harmony.I heartily recommend this book to hummingbird lovers and children of all ages, who, caught up in the flow of the story, will absorb many hummingbird facts before they even know it.Beth Kingsley HawkinsCo-Editor, The Hummingbird Connectionwww.hummingbird.org"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful in all ways!","review":"Kristine O'Connell George's poetry is beautiful as these poems lead her observations of a mother hummingbird making a nest, laying her eggs, then the eggs hatching and the young moving out. The illustrations are lovely realistic sketches that capture each stage of the hummingbirds' development. This makes a nice Mother's Day gift. I also bought a copy for a special aunt who loves nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant but not tier 1 concerto","review":"The whole Hyperion romantic concerto set is worth having and listening to. Motta like other composers in this library produce very competent and melodic concertos. In the scheme of things unless you are a trained musician few of these I would call a gem or hidden treasure. They are pleasant to listen but few will leave a lasting memory. They simply are not at a calibre as Beethoven, Grieg, Tchikovsky or Rachmaninoff. So when you tire of the dozen or so key concertos on the concert circuit, listen to one of these, any one randomly.

It compressed fast and I let it stand without connecting any hoses to check for leaks, as I could hear sound between the pump and the tanks. Sure enough, within minutes the pump came on. Called Ingersoll, they gave me a number and address for a local local repair shop, yet to take it there. Disconnected from the power source and let it stand over night. By early next morning, it dropped from 125 psi to under 20. Disappointed by IR?? Yes!!!! Home Depot would have been better.Update, June 22. Took it to the repair shop on Monday, June 15. It took them until Friday 4:00 p.m. to call me that they tightened some connectors and sealed other joints. Picked it up before 5 p.m. Compressed it to 125 psi.

When I went to go stop it, the top of the compressor blew off right near my hand.

I called IR and they said that for this product 100% meant there was air in the tank 100% of the time.

Can they ever put out a bad album? I don't think so. My main objective in this review is to let everyone know about a gem: I WANT YOU SO BAD. Heart has tons of great tunes, but this one is my favorite. Too bad the single flopped in the USA. Not too many people know it was actually released as a single.Of course, how could I leave out such classics such as \\"Who Will You Run To,\\" \\"Alone,\\" and \\"There's The Girl\\"?

One can say so many good things about and adjectives by their very nature do not seem to give it full justice as it transcends what other composers write for this splendid instrument. If I am force, then I will say that Bach is astounding, stuopendous and a genius beyond that of others when it comes to the \\"queen of instruments\\" as Mozart called it.

Blighted the lives of most of the Christian women I knew in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"For the love of God, save your money. I read this book, and had a feeling of being manipulated as I read it. This book isn't bad if you're an impressionable youth who wants all the answers handed to you on a silver plate. If you do get this book, realize that this author is but one point of view among the many offered. I am a Chirstian and sacredly hold its values. However, instead of reading a sentimental recollection of her memories, I suggest that you write the book of your own life, and understand your life within the context of the on-going history of the Christian Tradition. If you want to be a true Christian, you must read and understand the TRADITION of the Church in all its facets. Don't get caught up in some one who claims to be God's mouthpiece when that mouthpiece obviously does not offer more than one possible interpretation of such an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look on keeping Purity in your love life!","review":"Passion and Purity is a great book about Elisabeth Elliot's own love story. It showed how to maintain purity in relationships. She gives reasons why purity must be maintained and why it should be our highest goal. Her book combines her love story with letters and conversations with her readers and the advice she gives them. Overall it is an excellent book that challenges you to strive for purity in dating relationships and to bring God glory in your love life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed","review":"I am relived to see a book that is willing to encourage those of us who the Lord has called to singelness for a season. It embraces more then just a set of relational do's and don'ts. We are shown though the life od Jim and Elisabeth how tow young people, although not perfect, could dedicate their lives and wills to that of God's. She encourages the reader to dig deeper and find the way God desiers you to apply the concepts layed forth in this book applies to their lifes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"This book is biblically based and excellent. Before I read it, I had already made up my mind to stay pure until marriage. Elisabeth Elliot's book re-enforced the importance of that decision and challenged me to live selflessly each day. I'm sad that several people have written negative reviews--if you're a Christian and believe the Bible is truth, you will love this book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enlightening book","review":"This is not another \\"don't have sex until you get married\\" book. During all the pages, Elisabeth Elliot explains God's point of view concerning love life through her own love story with Jim Elliot, her first husband. It has some concepts, but they are deeply explained in a very simple and beautiful way, and of course it makes the reader to think about when he/she has done it right and when not.It's very helpful to get inside your heart, your intentions with one person or another, to see and maybe even judge your past and encourage you to take what God has to offer -no matter at what cost. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"E. Elliott gives guidelines how to live her life, not yours","review":"Elisabeth Elliott's book is about how SHE decided to follow God in the area of relationships in her life. She does not offer much advice in finding your own path in relationships and automatically assumes her way is the only way in dating, finding potential mates and being engaged. This book is not a book of the Bible and should not be treated as such. If you want to authentically live out Elisabeth's life, rather than your own, follow the advice of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was excited when I got this book as a recommendation from Joshua Harris' \\"I kissed Dating Goodbye\\". After the first 15mins I grew restless and disappointed. I tried in keeping an open mind and heart as I flipped through rest of the pages, time after time, I found myself falling asleep to it. I concur with some of the other comments, Elliot's advice on courtship is impractical for the amass of this generation. Maybe tis' not the season for me to read this book, perhaps God did anoited Elliot with the gift of testimony and relationship wisdom, but I just didn't benefit from it.Different generations have different styles of courtship and marriage. In the old testaments, girls usually get married around the age of 15-17, and most of those marriages were arranged. Would this apply to us today?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A flat out BORING book-not very edifying.","review":"I read this book not too long ago and it was simply boring! Ms. Elliot attempts to proove her points by basically giving us her life story. To make matters worse her style of writing is a dry as the Sahara Desert.Bottom line: DO NOT waste your $$$ on this book.If you're intent on reading an Elliot book, then I would have to reccommend Quest For Love. That book is far superior to PP and has some great tips in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old fashioned","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this one. The information in this book is too impractical, old fashioned and at times too offensive and gender baised to be applied in today's society. Better choices would be: True Love in a World of False Hope, The Ten Commandments of Dating, Knight in Shining Armor and What To Do Until Love Finds You. A Good Man is Hard To Find and A Jewel in His Crown are better choices for age 20+ female readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an embarrassment to Christian women everywhere","review":"This book is one of the most misogynistic pieces of literature I have ever read. Although I grew up in a conservative Southern Baptist family, I was angered and repulsed by this book. Elliot argues that women are to be \\"passive\\" and men \\"active,\\" that God does not want a women to call a man on the phone or to go out on a date alone. Is this the kind of God you want to believe in? Elliot's sexist point-of-view will teach your daughters to be quiet and submissive instead of proud and self-confident. Learn to think for yourselves, American women. Elliot's book is pure rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dated by now. Need something fresher.","review":"I suppose Ms. Elliot's book was good for young people from thirty years ago, but the other reviewers are right - it's pretty dated, and most of us would prefer something newer that understands the modern world and doesn't seem stuck in the 50s. True Love in a World of False Hope is better than this or Kissed Dating Goodbye, and Singles at the Crossroads is pretty good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it zero stars","review":"I was looking for books for pre-teenaged girls. I had never heard of Elisabeth Elliot before. If I had I wouldn't have wasted my money on this piece of garbage. I have since learned that her politics are beyond conservative. Supporting the ERA=supporting lesbianism?? Gimme a break! I am a Christian woman and found this book to be outdated and incredibly offensive to both women and men. I don't even know where to start...

It is a 'must' for every girl and guy. It is practical in that it relates to what every guy and girl goes through in a lifetime. Love is not portrayed in a 'whirlwind romance' style, but a controlled, Christ-honouringway.Elisabeth Elliot's writing style is so down-to-earth and realistic.I am so glad I found out about this book when I did. It has encouraged my spiritualwalk immensely, and it's been great to refer to it among friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The principles laid in this book are what I go back to everytime","review":"Definitely recommend this book to anyone learning about relationship between a man and a woman. The story is a godly example lacked in today's age. I always go back to the principles laid in this book when I'm confused by the noise of the world and when I need comfort in God's promises. This book helps us center on Christ in our relationships and seek beyond relationships- what matters at the end is the glory of God, not the problems or desires we face. And those who seek to glorify Christ in their lives will gladly accept the challenges of embracing the 'sufferings' coming along in a godly relationship between a man and a woman. I admire Elisabeth Elliot's perseverance and faith in God in her relationship with Jim. I hope to see mine honors and pleases God as well. Also, from this book, you can see just how a godly relationship can bear fruits that benefit not only between the two people in the relationship, but also others around."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!!!","review":"This book is truly a God-send.

I am re-reading it now to give my own daughter. This book outlined for me a vision of what a Christian romance could look like.

A true love story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend this book for those sincerely seeking God's will in relationships","review":"Elisabeth is my favoriate female Christian writer.

Stay pure as a whole in front of God and seek His best plan for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a must for every Christian!","review":"Passion and Purity is a well-needed book written on love and dating from a Christian perspective. Its contents, such as love, dating, service, and sacrifice, are crucial to the Christian life. Passion and Purity is based on sound Christian principles. When I first read this book, I did not agree with most if Elliot's views. But after rereading it a couple of times and contemplating on its contents, I found this book became a ray of light in my darkness. This is also an excellent book to study in Bible studies, youth groups, and personal Bible studies. Passion and Purity makes excellent gift. Every preteen and teenager should read this book. I wish someone told me of this book earlier. It would have saved me from a lot of heartache!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is by far the best book I have ever read...","review":"This book has opened my heart and helped me to look inside and examine what I am really thinking to see if I am following God or following my own desires. Elisabeth Elliot tells it like it is and that will offend some people. Most people don't like to actually look at what is in the darkness of their hearts - but I highly recommend this book for those who are brave enough to do so! This book has inspired me to pour out my true feelings into my journal and has helped me see what the will of God is my love life. It has honestly helped me through a very tough time when I could have acted like a little brat, demanding that my needs be fulfilled. Instead, because of this book, I have a peaceful heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purity, a forgotten virtue in our world","review":"This is a wonderful book for young women and men who want to live a Christian life and keep themselves pure for their future mate.I would recommend this book to young people before they begin dating. This book will help them to realize what they are doing when they sell their purity cheaply without the commitment of marriage.This book deals, very frankly, with the feeling that a young couple can have for each other, but also deals frankly with the idea of keeping oneself for marriage and a life of true purity and passion within the marriage bed. A commitment that is promised and given to only one person, not passion for a one night fling, but passion for life.A beautiful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my all-time favorite Elisabeth Elliot Book","review":"I love this book.

He offers helpful ideas about how others can get their self-published books noticed and sold online. These ideas earn two stars; however......their presentation does not. The writing is often painful to read. I found myself urgently wishing the author had taken his own advice and hired a real editor. (I also wish he had brought in a real designer before offering design advice, and a real proofreader before offering proofreading advice.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Activate spam filter!","review":"The title of this book wouldn't get past any email spam filter. Unfortunately, the title contains enough keywords to turn up in webdesign-related book search results.

Unfortunately, the book needs edited badly, basics like \\"periods\\" were missing, making it difficult to follow. It does have good basic advice if you want to publish your own book and do everything he did to do it, as he specifically touts some PODs and other resources. If technical books on book promotion overwhelm you, and you can see past the editing errors, this may be a decent book to read. After reading many books on book promotion, this book left me with marking one page as actual useful information for my own needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge is power!","review":"As far as I am concerned, writers truly looking to learn, grow, and get published cannot read too many \\"how-to\\" books, so add this one to your collection.

It combines 'to demons bound', 'a yoke of magic' and 'blood fountain'.The adventures of thieves Davin Anane and Goran one-eye (who is actually a demon, but hey, we all have our little flaws).Do not expect a book with deep psychology or story-lines. (it's not TOLKIEN). No, this is light reading for those who like fantasy, role-playing and a good laugh... e.g. Goran keeps dishing out stories on how his lost his eye...For those who play RPG's, it has a bit of an AD&D feel to...Only set-back.

The cover alone captivated me, and the story, told in the first person from Hamtaro's point of view, won me over immediately. All the little side drawings with Hamtaro's noises and expressions are delightful. A wonderful story, wonderfully told. I'm now a Hamtaro fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"New is not new","review":"I ordered this item as new but what came was a library edition complete with glued on checkout envelope and card and glued on Dewey decimal tag on the spine.

My fault.","review":"I got this book to update my old Maltin for my small reference library. Due to my own carelessness, I failed to consider that this volume does not include movies that are not on video, i.e., most TV productions and many older films. Another aggravation is the presentation of the indices of cast and director credits. While the number of individuals listed is impressive, their credits do not seem to be complete and worst of all, there are no dates. These lists should be chronological. The reviews are so-so.I'll keep this one in my library, but I guess I need to get another Matlin also."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Internet Movie Database Rules!","review":"The one-line summary I have provided makes the point of what I'm going to quickly say very clear. In my opinion I believe the Internet Movie Database is the best, most concise, witty, and LARGEST (over 80,000 titles!) movie and video guide. What Martin is missing is that it's all just his opinion. Like most critics (Ebert, Leonard Maltin) he tends to believe that he's right and every one else should believe he's right. To accomplish this he uses big and intimidating words to get the less educated readers to believe that he's right and everyone else is wrong. To me he is no different from Halliwell, Leonard Maltin, and Roger Ebert. Go to the IMDB or read VideoHound instead, they're a helluva lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST MOVIE REVIEW BOOK ON THE MARKET.","review":"This is an excellent book that is far better than Maltin's.

I'm just not that tolerant or substance affected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted journalism.","review":"After reading Christopher Wayne Brown's book, \\"Media Tried, Justice Denied\\", I am convinced that Darlie Routier is guilty and is receiving her earthly just rewards. Her constantly shifting accounts of the \\"attack\\" and the enormous amount of evidence that the authorities found against her should leave only the most gullible believing her story. This is a classic case of someone who has manipulated her entire way through life, finally being tripped up, and having to pay the consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible misleading information","review":"This book (if you can call it that is horrible). After, reading this book, I'm more convinced than ever that Darlie slaughtered her two children and staged the crime scene. This author goes so far as to name 2 people that have gotten abortions. The author uses sarcasm to make it points, it's extremely irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book for several reasons. To begin, grammar mistakes are frequent, detracting from the author's message. Second, much of what the author refutes is information from newspaper articles, which should not necessarily reflect badly on the police. Third, the author uses much personal opinion, such as commenting on inappropriate behavior of the coroner when taking crime scene photos. Unless the author is clairvoyant, I cannot see how he is able to ascertain what the coroner's intent is or was; furthermore, it doesn't prove Darlie's innocence. Fourth, the author takes great pride in pointing out such errors or discrepancies by the police department, such as the incorrect ages of the boys. While such information should be correct, this does not prove Darlie is innocent. If you simply want to find a reason to sympathize with Darlie, perhaps this book will do However, if you are looking for a well-written book, you'd probably be happier going elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures say it along with additional evidence","review":"Great book from Mr. Brown. Anyone reading this book should have no doubt of Darlie Routier's innocence. MINIMALLY... her trial was justly unfair. SOMEONE should be punished for this crime but it is NOT Darlie."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Innocent","review":"This is the third book on the case that I've read, and I don't know how anyone who's read it can still believe she's guilty. The pictures are disturbing, but the murders happened and an innocent woman is on death row. How about the fact that she has another son who is denied a mother? No person could inflict these wounds on herself in the time frame, it's ludicrous. This woman cannot have done this. I hope to God she is saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a book?","review":"How can someone copy newspaper articles, throw their two cents (which in my opinion is way too much money for this opinion) and add a bunch of gross photos and call it a book? What a waste of time, energy and money on my part for even bothering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book So Far .....Next?","review":"Recently I saw the author of another \\"Darlie\\" book had written a harsh review of Mr Brown's book, MEDIA TRIED, JUSTICE DENIED. It causes one to wonder how could she rate this book badly when it contains so many actual facts. I was amazed at the graphics in MTJD. I find it hard to believe any true lover of Crime Stories wouldn't find this book very interesting. I have read all the books I can find on this story and anxiously await the next release. This book definitely deserves four stars. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Brown is the Media","review":"Chris Brown is not a good writer, but he is a writer. The title of his book blames Darlie's incarceration on the media. The media, he said, swayed public opinion against Darlie. But readers need to remember that Chris Brown and his book are the media. He is trying to sway public opinion in Darlie's favor. If he expects readers not to believe other media reports, why should readers believe his? He's molding the facts to fit his theory, just as he's accused other media of doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One use only ..","review":"You can pretty much just rip out the entire text portion of this book, it's useless and laughable. The photo section is the eye opening part of this book. By reading the transcript and viewing the photos used in the trial, you can come to your own conclusion regarding this case. Less the childish sarcasm of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!","review":"This book is the ultimate example that ANYONE can achieve the American Dream, even an idiot or someone with less than a 3rd grade education. I agree with another rater in that it's too bad you can't take stars away for pathetic journalism. If this author does have a valid point to make, it quickly becomes lost amid his sarcasm, pettiness, and horrific abuse of the English language. He provides NO additional evidence, other than some very tasteless photographs, which still give you no insight into who the killer is. The only thing he proved to me, BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, is that he is a total moron who seems to be obsessed with Darlie Routier. A more interesting read, from a REAL author, who presents both sides in a non judgmental format is Hush Little Babies. I'm not convinced that Darlie is the killer, but I'm certainly not convinced she isn't, either (and this book sure didn't answer any of my questions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Lacks Credibility","review":"This book actually gave the reader some good food for thought concerning Darlie Routier's innocence. However, it is difficult to get past the blatant and NUMEROUS spelling, grammatical and syntax errors. And while Mr. Brown complains of inconsistencies and/or contradictions made by the Rowlett Police Department, there are many of his own in the book, some only paragraphs apart. Also, even if the Rowlett Police are as inept as Mr. Brown claims (which is hard to believe), his complete lack of respect for them is disturbing. Again, while Mr. Brown raises valid points that are worth considering, the book seems loaded with his own emotions and/or feelings toward Darlie. Another note: the pictures are very disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No doubt of guilt......","review":"I believed after reading all the books written about the case that she was guilty. This 'book', (I use the term losely) did nothing to convince me otherwise. I mean lets face it; a mother who has been 'attacked' and has had two of her babies brutally stabbed to death, DO NOT say 8 days later.......\\"Well, we had some good times with them...\\" This is on top of a complete lack of intruder evidence and let's face it...these cops KNOW....when they first start investigating and interviewing....they KNOW deep down if something is inherently wrong with the situation. Anyone who believes otherwise (including Brown) is a shirt-tailer and probably believes O.J. too! Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valuable Pictures; \\"Lousy Book!\\"","review":"The state's evidence photos used in this book are valuable for studying this case. That's the only good thing I can say about this book. It's so full of typos, misspelled words, unfinished sentences and sarcasm, I recommend buying it only if you want to look at the pictures and pay for an over-priced book.Christopher W. Brown is just another one of those \\"SLOBS\\" who comes along and takes advantage of a family-in-crisis. At a recent fund-raiser banquet, he spoke of the donations from this book that will go to Ms. Routier's Defense/Appeals Fund. It would be interesting to know how much he has donated -- if anything. He's a \\"USER\\" and a \\"LOSER.\\" Too bad the family got taken in by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures Worth It","review":"Albeit there are grammatical errors in this book, and there is a definite 'GottaLoveDarlieLynn' theme throughout, if you are a serious amateur sleuth/true crime buff, the crime scene and autopsy photos are well worth the price of the book. You can wade through the news articles and endure the author's sometimes irritating comments if the desire is present, but the true meat of this publication is without a doubt the photos.That being said, let me add there should be NO doubt these are horrific photos of the wounds inflicted on these 2 young boys, so take that with you when you see them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I can't believe that I waited so long for this book. I have comic books that are better than this is. First of all, I agree with the reader about the cut and paste of the newspaper articles. I am also amazed, and angered at some of the comments the author makes about certain individuals. Has he never heard of being sued for slander and libel? He may not like the people, but it does not give him the right to call them names and flame their family. As for Darlie's innocence-how on earth (particularly after the last few years) can someone her age have NOT been read her Miranda rights and NOT realize it until our illustrious author asks her. Please. Darlie didn't get away with it, because she obviously wasn't smart enough to. It's just a good thing she was in Rowlett, where the PD made mistakes almost as foolish as hers. Brian Pardo needs to close his wallet and find someone else to champion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never seen anything like it!!!!","review":"I love TRUE CRIME. This is the first book I have ever seen or read that is in a catagory by itself. I always thought there was a reason why all the photos were in black and white. This book breaks the mold of TRUE CRIME books. Texas should be ashamed of what they have done to this innocent mother on deathrow. I hope Texas will correct this mistake and make good on what they have done to Darlie Routier. I'm glad I don't live there."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"THE SPELLING IS AWFUL IN THIS. THE PHOTOS ARE THE SAME ONES OUT THERE ON THE WEB, SO THAT WAS NOTHING NEW AND THEY IN MY OPINION DAMAGE DARLIES CASE. BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE A CHANCE THAT SHE WAS INNOCENT UNTIL I SAW THESE PHOTOS. SHE IS COMPLETELY GUILTY AND DESERVES THE DEATH PENALTY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"The book is one of the best things to have come out of this case. I know the family and I know enough about Christopher Brown. He has donated over five figures ($,$$$$) to Darlie's cause and gave $500.00 for a table at the recent Darlie Benefit. A table he didn't get to sit down at, because no one reserved seating. People from Texas need to learn some manners and get their facts straight before they go shooting off their mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put Yourself In Darlie's Shoes","review":"Chris Brown took (and is still taking) a personal interest in the Routier case. It's hard to believe that a regular \\"Joe\\" could prove Darlie's innocence when lawyers and law enforcement did not bother. Evidence in grocery bags--for God's sake! Anyone who can vote for George W. Bush with this type of shoddy investigation going on in his state is committing a crime. Darlie is innocent and this book, though not well written, proves it without a doubt! Poor Darlie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky","review":"Poorly written, full of errors,hypercritical of anyone who believes Darlie is guilty as sin. The pictures(very gruesome and gory) are the saving grace of this peice of work (if you want to call it that)apparently self published, unedited. I did not read CWB version of events, it was too much to swallow with his constant interjections, opinions and obvious goo goo eyes for Darlie. It is no longer in print so the cost was more than it is actually worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Justice ????","review":"After reading this book, you will never see the American Justice (ha!) System in the same light. The author presents a very unpopular, yet factual, view of what can and does go wrong with the justice system in the good, ole US of A. The reader will be forced to rethink their views on juries, lawyers, detectives, DA's, the media, and the death penalty.The pictures are incredible and speak for themselves. However, I would have been just as convinced of innocence WITHOUT including the crime scene photos and autopsy photos of those children!!!!!! I felt that this was in very poor taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, however too much sarcasm used!","review":"I have read all the Darlie books and have found this one to be compelling; however, the author uses too much sarcasm trying to prove his point, and comes across as immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARLIE ROUTIER IS AS GUILTY AS SIN ITSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"WHY WOULD SOMEONE WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS,GOD, DO SOMETHING WORTH WHILE AND PROFIT FROM THE TRUTH AND NOT COLD BLOODED MURDER.

AND SHE IS GUILTY AS SIN!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nat Cole's very first stereo recording","review":"I remember hearing this soothing music from one of the most profound balladeers of all time next to Sinatra, Nat Cole in a dental office. I was fortunate to hear him at the Sacramento State Fair in 1958 and he was the only one of his era that I would hear live (not Sinatra, or Ella unfortunately, though Sarah, yes). Gordon Jenkins seems to be a perfect partner for Cole on ballads and every track on this CD is near perfect. The sound remastering on my Gold CD is impeccable and if you're fortunate to afford it, by all means go for it. An qualified classic for Cole fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"I have just received the CD, I was leary because of import, well I was blown away. I had found the original LP in my Dads, things I played it to death the summer I was 14. What can you say Nat King Cole first of all is timeless. And of course with all music from a certain period of time it will take you back in your memory bank. What a joy to have this in the car, I made duplicates to have in the kitchen, upstairs. Just a faboulous find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of complicated to use while running","review":"I like the watch and I use it on all my runs, but I never use all the features because the directions were so complicated that it's hard to remember what button should be pushed when running on top of the fact that the reset button is poorly places, so once you get everything going as you want you stand a good chance of erasing your progress.

All 8 songs are good, with \\"Lessons In My Life\\" and \\"In My Song\\" being as good as any Tosh song before them. \\"No Nuclear War\\" is a fitting opener and has Tosh pulling no punches with a smattering of bombs, horns, drums and guitar combining to lead the charge. \\"Vampire\\" is the obvious inspiration to Lucky Dube's, \\"Dracula\\", and possibly to Dube's entire trademark sound at that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Head for a fallout shelter","review":"..and bring a few Tosh CDs with you, like \\"Legalize It\\", \\"Equal Rights\\" or \\"Wanted Dread or Alive\\".

We use this on our recliner keep pet hair off and still have our living room look half way decent. We have a leather recliner and it doesn't really stay on at all (we don't use it when it's in the recline position - only as a chair.) It is basically an oversize rectangular table cloth that you tuck into the creases of your chair but it doesn't look as sharp as the image leads you to believe it would and it does slip off really easily. It doesn't cover the back of your chair and doesn't drop all the way to the floor in the front either (they admit to this in the instructions as well so even if your chair matches the measurements, it's not meant to cover anything but the sitting area) so if your chair isn't against a wall, keep this in mind.The color is darker than the image. It's actually a deep gold with shimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking sofa transformer !!","review":"We are using 2 Love seat throws for an old L-shaped sectional sofa. It really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color. The material quality is great for the price.The only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping, say about once a day. The throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in-built mechanisms to hold in place (e.g. a velcro system, straps, etc).

This chain cleaner cleans only slightly better than using a rag to grip your chain only because the brushes would occasionally scrub off some grime so I cannot recommend this to anyone who has to clean their chain regularly. Stick to quick daily rag wipes/lube or take the chain off and use a cheap stiff brush after some soaking in your cleaning solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Machine","review":"Ran it through a dirty chain...works wonders...Well built.

Easy to use. Very robust."},{"rating":"2","title":"like it... but","review":"This thing works really well.The only two grips I have are:a) the little magnet that holds on to any chain particles at the bottom of the \\"reservoir\\" came off.

They do a real nice job of cleaning the chain. The biggest problem I had with all three of the units is that they start to fall apart after only a few uses. Two of the units either the hinge point or latch point or both for the two metal clips break away leaving you unable to lock the top to the body. I only use the Park brand of chain cleaner. The third cleaner the actual cleaning brushes fell apart.I've ordered the Finish Line chain cleaner. I'll post a review of that product after I have used it for a period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Made Product","review":"Are those 5 star reviews are real? I made a decision to buy this product based on the reviews. This is a piece of junk. This is so poorly made. Both side of hinge points for the two metal clips broke making me unable to lock after 1st use. This means i cannot use this any more. Yes I used this only once for less than 5 minutes.

It is a tool and tools get dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adds bristles to your chain","review":"I don't know, maybe having nylon bristles sticking out of your chain will help with traction on gnarly inclines... personally, I don't need it.Yes, this thing cleans chains nicely--it leaves them nice and bristling, rather than glistening.After enough uses, I wonder whether there will be enough bristles left on the cleaning wheels to do the job.Caveat emptor, big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleanest Chain In Years","review":"I used a waxed base lube for years, and found that after a while, it the chain will not come clean because wax simply won't clean off with most bio-cleaners. I never cleaned the chain except with a rag because wax cleaners were supposed to \\"shed dirt.\\"That was then, before I knew how clean a chain could be. This unit is well made, holds the chain steady with a stout handle, and has little mess compared to using a brush and rag.See my photos and you can see that the chain is shiny clean after running the chain through.

I think that the singer goes a little over the top at times and should stay away from doing this on the next recording, meaning oversinging when he doesn't need to. Bass and drums are steady, stay in the pocket and don't really veer off course, which is how they should be. The songs - Alien Love Song is probably the best as it has a groove to it and the singer stays in a lower key which is his natural style. Velvatine is good instrumentally, but singer does a little over the top singing here which takes away from the subtlety of the songs........I am writing too much here...Overall - a good first effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good start","review":"Not groundbreaking, but interesting irregardless. \\"Pleasure Friend\\" has a catchy chorus.

All I can say is it needs work. Very indie indeed. The disc is an admirable attempt at bringing bad 80's music up to date. Stimulant suffers from a howling vocalist and some out of tune guitar playing. My advice? Get a good producer, one who will notice these things and fix them. Also, get someone who can help your songwriting. No hits here. Keep working guys, you may have something in there if you dig far enough and sweat hard enough.

At any rate, my ceramic part has a hairline crack in it and now just a tiny amount of food is leaking through the bottom. So annoying.

I decided to be safe and not put the lid in, but rather cover it with foil until I find out for sure.

To say the least I was disappointed since I expect the machine to last more than 48 uses. The next day I call Krups customer service to explain the situation, and despite the circumstance they state the unit is out of warranty and I would have to pay out of pocket for its repair.

Also, the plastic base of the jar does not lock properly. The weak assembly between the two parts led to accidental separation and spilled contents on my countertop twice, before the engine burned up. REALLY, KRUPS? The 'German' designer must have been either out of his mind or on a mission to trap customers with shiny esthetics and otherwise nonsensical build. Have a look at the sticker at the bottom of the engine: this think is made in Mexico! (hum, what's that German label, really? Another way to scam customers?) Do yourself a favor: DO NOT BUY!

A current theme running through the book: guilt by association. Hillary Clinton was given the bad attributes of everyone she came into contact with; on the other hand, good qualities or actions (such as those of Marian Wright Edelman) did not translate.

The author claims it was Hillary's idea to trash the White House offices as the Clinton administration left and the Bush's moved in, including the famous \\"removal of the letter 'w'\\" from the computer keyboards. The problem with this tale is a GAO investigation found it wasn't true, just another right wing attempt to tarnish the Clintons.There is certainly plenty to say about Bill and Hillary, but I'd rather read something factual rather than rummage through a National Enquirer style trash dump. Hillary haters will love it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the right so afraid of Hillary?","review":"I bought this book at the local B&N and finished it last night.Sheesh.
