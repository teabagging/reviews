You won't find any information on the artists themselves, but this is nevertheless an excellent resource for record collectors, discographers, and chart fanatics.

What can I say, truly one of the worse movies that I have seen. A real pity as the film cost 30 million or so and had a decent cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting + Boring plot = Waste of money and time","review":"The box cover looks beautiful and elegant. It made me think I was renting an epic movie. I was completely wrong. The picture is beautiful but the plot is boring. The acting is bad. The movie moves at very slow pace. There's no action at all. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle of the Brave","review":"Can you say false advertising? The cover of the DVD shows epic battles being fought in the background and the description talks about a resistance movement that must take place in the novel version of this movie because you won't see it on the DVD. This is basically a love story, cut and dried! Is it a bad movie, don't buy it, just rent it if you like love stories but if you are expecting something in the way of the Last of the Mohichans, you will want your money back and some. This is the worst case of false advertising I have seen in a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepe Le Pew!!!!","review":"The only two good things about this movie were the costumes and sets. Everything else--the acting, the direction, the plot line (which wandered all over), were stinkers. You'd think if someone went to all the trouble of making a movie with such nice sets etc, that they'd try and get the essentials right too. Not so! I stuck through the whole movie, but it wasn't worth it. Unfortunately, I bought it without reading a review. Pew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such wasted potential","review":"This movie is confused about whether it wants to be a love story or a historical tale. The premise is great: set a tale in 18th century Quebec at the moment of the British take-over, weave in a romantic encounter between unusual characters. But it tries to do too much at once, jumping in geography and situation with little motivation. You get the feeling that cohesion was sacrificed on the alter of ambition. What could have been a great story is destroyed by an unwillingness of the filmmakers to make the necessary sacrifices of footage to make the drama come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear-jerker","review":"This historic romance is a heart wrenching tear-jerker, so grab a big box of Kleenex. We travel back through a journey of two lovers during the time that Quebec is about to fall into British hands. When a priest who is secretly obsessed with Marie-Loup misleads her into thinking that her beloved Francois must leave her behind, he sets the stage for a downward spiral in the lovers' lives. As if things are not bad enough, Francois' friend betrays him and their lives are further unraveled. The story is great and the music chosen is devine and enhances the events, especially the ending.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the Brave can sit thru the entire DVD","review":"This is clearly an example of a movie that doesn't know what it is: a romance? an historical epic? a courtroom drama? a witch hunt? a story of starcrossed lovers? I managed to somehow endure every interminable minute of it wondering when it was going to pick up its lethargic pace and get to some sort of coherent plot. As with other reviewers here, I was simply amazed at the number of very good actors going to waste. Too, I was fooled by the DVD jacket into thinking this was really about the epic Battle of Quebec in which both commanding Generals, Montcalm of France and Wolfe of England, are killed. I think I saw five or so minutes of a British mortar battery's bombardment of the city. The rest of the story wasn't worth the money. Fortunately, I only rented it...but I still feel cheated. I wish I had read the other reviews before giving up 143 minutes of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start but great read","review":"If you enjoy Steven Erickson you are likely to enjoy Glen Cook.It took me a while to get into this series but I have throughly enjoyed it. It plays with the concepts of technology replacing the power of magical and magical creatures. As gunpowder shifts the balance of power, and competent leaders find effective ways to apply it, the world changes.The story centers around a single character but it is realistic about that person's role in the world. Both Glen Cook and Steven Erickson write in a way that makes the characters more \\"real\\". Some will find this off putting as it removes the \\"hero\\" status of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Black Company","review":"I read this a year ago or so and have to say the writing was good, but the themes were distasteful. Another reviewer here drew the parallels to the times of the crusades and it was apt. I knew as I read it that the inspiration was drawn from history.However, when I read that the \\"christian\\" leaders (using the correlation to history) were into pedophilia with little kids ... pleasuring ... them under the table while they talked to others was just a little too far out there for me.Really, I would say it made me want to vomit.Cook is a masterful writer, but this is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused and overwhelmingly detailed.","review":"I loved the Black Company series, so I bought the first two \\"Instrumentalities\\" books without a thought. That was a mistake. The principal characters are interesting, but the focus never rests on them long enough to fully develop the character. I forced my way through the first book hoping that it would improve, but it did not. The best comparison that I can give is that I felt like I was studying for a history exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Harvey Lewis","review":"I agree with the review of Harvey Lewis. This book is just too complex. I bought it last Christmas AND STILL CAN'T FINISH IT!!There are just too many names that fade into and out of sight too rapidly.I am not sure what Glen Cook was trying to do with this change in style, but as a loyal fan I was sorely disappointed in this effort.There are times when the book seems to gain traction and start to tell a story but then it gets lost again in forgettable history lessons and family trees.If I were anyone looking for Glen Cook's next creation after Black Company I would give this one a miss! Wait for George Martin's next instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up","review":"Congratulations to all who finished and understoodthe characters and followed the storyline.Tooo complicated for me.

So seeing this on the shelves last year I picked it up and began reading. Then put it down.Months later I tried again. Stopped after 40-50 pages and put it down again. My son (also a Garrett fan) started it and slogged through to the end. I tried once more and gave up at about the same spot.Finally this year I got tired of looking at it on the end table and began once more. Worked my way through it and tried to decide just what it was about it that didn't work and gave up.I doubt that I would read the sequel, I know I wouldn't buy it, and I doubt that I would go through the trouble to request a copy at the library.I donated the hard back I bought to the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impenetrable","review":"I've read and enjoyed a lot of Glen Cook's books so I thought I'd like this one too, but it's so badly written that I almost gave up on it. If you can get past the incredibly boring and poorly fleshed out characters, and the at times impenetrable walls of text that spring up throughout the book (you'll know them when you see them) then there is actually an incredibly complicated plot going on behind the scenes and it was just interesting enough that I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of only one. But if you haven't already paid for it like I did then you should do yourself a favor and not buy it. I think whoever put \\"needs editor\\" as a tag has the right idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complicated","review":"I agree with many others here on the lack of coherence this book puts forth. Let me first state that I am a huge fan of the Black Company series. I have read them about 6 or 8 times over the last 20 years. Amazing. Also a big fan of Garret P.I.The problem with this book is that we are introduced to so many characters, and points of view that when a character comes around a couple chapters later you don't remember who he is. Especially since the names are very elaborate and yet similar. Also troubling is that each character does not seem unique in his storytelling. By the end of the book you have a sense of the main characters and protagonists but I can't say that you care enough about them to move to the next book. I really wanted to like this but fought through it the whole way. If you haven't read Cook before I would grab a copy of the Black Company. It is a phenomenal series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep going it get a lot better","review":"Just a short take I just finished and like some of you I had a terrible time getting started in this book which is wierd for a Glen Cook Book but just get through the first 50 or so pages and it turns into a excellent Glen Cook book.

Glen Cook fan and have every available title possible.But for some reason I am struggling to get past the first couple of chapters. I am at a point in the book that something incrediably significant has happened... and it's been explained to me why it's incrediably significant, but I am not feeling any sort of emotional attachment towards the even.I don't believe that I understand who the main characters are in the book... or even the setting of the book.Within the first 100 pages, I have jumped around to over a dozen different locations and have identified scores of different people.I am going to continue to struggle on with the novel, and take the first reviewer's advice and start reading up on my history, but that's not why I bought a science-fiction/fantasy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook Rides on his Reputation","review":"I've been reading Cook since the first Black Company novel, and I'm a huge fan of all his books.. until now. This is some of the worst-written prose that I've ever fought through, laden with confusing references and terms that are thrown into the story without the slightest attempt at explaining what he's talking about. I don't read books to play guessing games.

The \\"Plaid Mix\\" is lovely and the mix by Guy Sigsworth is every bit as good as the others.One star is deducted for the \\"Funkstorung Exclusive Mix\\". This is not a dance song.

Fortunately, my curiousity got the best of me and I carefully opened and read one of them. While the pictures are cute and cheerful, the characters and plot lack depth and substance.

I read it to a friend of mine who had just lost her dad, with whom she had sat as he lay dying of cancer in the hospital. She was returning home after settling his estate and stayed the night in my home. I read it to her as she fell asleep. When she awoke the next morning, she said that it was her first night of peaceful sleep in a long time. My reading this story to her aloud had had touched her so deeply that she decided to share it at her father's memorial service.

I will read and re-read this book many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that impressed...","review":"I'm afraid this was a bit of a disappointment... I didn't find the story particularly original or inspiring, and its presentation through the artwork and production was pretty but not much more than that. The book also has recipes, but they are all fairly simple soups that I could find in other cookbooks, so this does not add to my culinary skills.I own the Pistoulet pattern of china, and that was the main reason I looked for this book and got it. I do love the china and its whimsical patterns and colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wave GoodBye","review":"I truly enjoyed the first two books in the Genesis Wave series. However, Book 3 was a HUGE dissapointment, so I hope it is a wave goodbye for this series. The main TNG characters are relegated to minor and infrequent roles. The various settings are not tied together well at all and the linkage to the two previous books is quite. There's also a linkage to the Gemworld series which comes into play with a very weak rationale for how they realized there was a tie in (and if you didnt read Gemworld you wouldnt understand it at all). Also, Picard is too easily duped by the Romulans for the strong character he is usually portrayed as. Certainly do not buy this book in the full price hardcover, find the softcover version or find the hardcover on a clearance table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Why Why?","review":"I normally love all of John Vornholt's books, and really enjoyed the first two Genesis Wave books. I had waited a bit for GW-II to come out on paperback, and was suprised to see there was a third book - so I picked them up together. Genesis Wave - III seems very rushed and superficial. Instead of character and plot development, there are quick explanations of what they are doing (we really don't get into the minds of the characters at all). As I read this book, I kept wondering where this was going and why. When I finished the book, I only wondered \\"why?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant","review":"A completely unnecessary book, comprised mainly of an absurd effort to tie in the Genesis Wave with the Gemworld books by the same author. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Waves...","review":"The Genesis Wave: books 1 & 2 were two of the best books I ever read. So naturally, when I heard about book 3 I thought it would be just as good. But it was terrible! It's slow, boring, and off the subject. The Genesis Wave: book 3, seemed to me, to be more about Picard's love affair with a fake Romulan rather than the Genesis wave.I thought that this book was more along the line of a sequel to John Vornholt's Gemworld series (which was also a very good read). It's like he took the two book series and blended them together.I don't really recommend this book to anyone. I like John Vornholt, and the way he writes, but this book just isn't worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"just the basics","review":"Didn't have a secion full of daily phrases or a section on verb conjugation.

Its comical in places and really took my mind off of all the negative going on today. If you want complex characters with deep seeded issues, then this book probably isn't for you.

Okay, I love designers clothes, exotic vacations, hot boyfriend, and trendy restaraunts and clubs. But, not everyone who has the finer things in life act like empty headed Barbies. I mean this book was extremely dull. I can understand being materialistic and all, but you have to have more depth to yourself than that because every person does, no matter what they say/do to hide it.

If people don't know Bergdrof Goodman is a store in New York that carries designer clothing. So of course this book is going to be about fashion and the socialites that wear it. I personally liked this book. Sure Moi, the main character, is a bit superficial but that's what makes it fun. Maybe Candice Bushnell writes about New York society a little bit better than Plum Sykes but I think Plum didn't do too bad in writing a book about people who actually live this way(don't believe me?

Utter waste of time, ink, and trees.However, this much I will say for it: it's a tad more entertaining than the vast majority of the dogeared magazines one finds in a doctor's office. So if you have a choice between Ladies Home Journal circa 2002 and Bergdorf Blondes, um, maybe not. Depends on the LHJ issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh this book is tres beyond. . .vapid and boring","review":"I'm giving this book 1 1/2 stars with and extra 1/2 star because I didn't buy, but checked it out of the library. I understand that this is SUPPOSED to be satirical but it's just boring, dumb and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed were the bits about fashion and perhaps Julie Bergdorf's character. But the narrator known only as moi was a character I neither liked nor cared about. I was quite dissapointed that she ends up with a good guy in the end (come on, you couldn't have been surprised). If you must read this book (like some must watch Gigli or a train wreck), then don't buy it. But if you're smart, read Sophie Kinsella's shopaholic series. Now there is a main character with heart,brains and good fashion sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bergdorf Blondes","review":"This has to be the most superficial & tedious read ever.

I can't imagine how anyone who calls herself a writer could be so lacking in an understanding of satire and humor. I was cringing while reading the obvious efforts at cleverness (\\"going to Brazil\\") which fell flat the first time - and then were repeated over and over again. The other Amazon reviews have been much more entertaining than the book, especially the 5 star reviews from people who can't spell and recall having martinis at Bergdorf's during their New York days. Too funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!","review":"Let me start by writing that I enjoyed other novels of this dimension (The Devil Wears Prada, The Nanny Diaries, I Don't Know How She Does It) but this book was incredibly dull. I can only imagine that it's getting so much press because the author is well known Vogue writer etc.. But the storyline was banal and the writing flat...mostly the storyline was dull as ditch water. I picked up this book because reviews & synopses made it sound frothy and fun, but it's not fit for even beach reading. BORING!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your precious time","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. I had to force myself through it the entire way. The only reason I finished it was because I had no other books to read. I thought it was going to be light and witty like the Shopaholic series, but it definitely was not. The only thing it offers is countless designer name drops, depressing relationship problems and some superficial, pathetic personalities. I usually love reading about fashionistas and enjoy satirical humor, but this was ridiculous. I only paid $4 for this book, and I am sad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frothy Latte Fun & Laughs","review":"This book takes a funny poke at new york society girls with their twisted ethics and man hunting ways. But it does it in a funny light hearted way that doesn't make you feel guilty about poking fun. The heroine is very likable and I think we could even be friends inspite of her label obsessed ways. She takes herself wayyyy to seriously but it actually makes her more lovable. Very FUNNY. Warning though....i read bits of it to my hubby and he did not get it AT ALL. Chick humor entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got a Sex&TheCity vibe... it's not a \\"serious\\" read, but fun and entertaining.","review":"It's got a Sex & The City vibe... it's not a \\"serious\\" read, but fun and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"It is very funny in several parts but the fact that the narator never changed, kept falling for the same guys and got the great guy in the end disinterested me. She didn't deserve him, she didn't make you be on her side. The book was missing something deeper, we didn't get to get to know the character's true feeling. Was really superficial but i guess that was the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I am a big fan of chick lit, so I was excited to read this much-hyped book. What mindless dribble! I read the first 60 pages, then tossed it aside. Absolutely no substance. Bergdorf Blondes was so not the fun, summer read I had hoped it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe that I spent $12.00 on this book","review":"I picked up \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\" by Plum Sykes because I had some money and I couldn't find \\"The Devil wares Prada\\" I should have saved my money!

I'm losing IQ points!","review":"I made it through Chapter 3 before I just couldn't take it anymore. I hope to God that these characters aren't based upon anyone who actually EXISTS. To even write such ridiculous nonsense, fictional or not...it's (to use a phrase of one of the characters) \\"beyond\\". Thank God, I only checked it out from the library and didn't spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, and not even a thrill!!","review":"I was looking for a light read, so I picked up this book. This book was definately a light read, but in all the bad ways. Predictable from the start, tiring whining of the main character that no one could associate with or empathize with, just an overall bore. I wouldn't recommend it, even for a mind-numbing beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair-haired Narcissism","review":"This is an amazingly drawn out piece of drivel. Three-hundred some odd pages of vanity, cattiness, and shameless self-love do not make for a good summer read. The preciousness of neurotic New York princesses wears off in the first hundred pages. Besides the constant annoying abbreviations, general snobby attitude, and brand name-dropping, the book is decent if you'd like to have a laugh at what our society has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book!","review":"I bought this book expecting more since Sex In the City had some good writing.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love \\"Sex and the City\\", \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and the like. However, this was just painful. It was given to me by a friend to read on a plane and I think my time would have been better spent sleeping or even staring out the window. The Characters are stupid and shallow, to the point where it's not even remotely funny. I was too busy wanting to slap the narrator to laugh at any puns. After getting off the flight, I picked up a copy of The Economist hoping my IQ could be salvaged. Do not waste your time on this dribble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"Amazon's star system of rating doesn't do this book justice. It's not Steinbeck and the rating system doesn't distinguish between genre. I gave the book five stars because it is a slam-bang of a light, witty read. Those reviewers who thought it vapid and pointless seem to have missed the satire. That it doesn't have a point is the point. The characters appear to have everything and their lives are virtually meaningless. That you don't really care what happens to the central character in the end is precisely what the author insinuates she deserves and there's the tragedy that offsets the wickedly pointed humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn, sigh, yawn again","review":"This book was a waste of time and money. I honestly can't think of one remarkable thing about this story, in fact I've eaten cucumbers with more character than the vapid women presented in this unoriginal novel. It completely lacked depth and even the fashion became uninteresting to me, it was all just designer names with no connections to anything, boy was it dull.

I hated each and every character because of their shallowness, hoped for the better and it never came. Give me Sophie Kinsella ANY day, now THAT's real funny.

We've read it a million times before and it's just plain boring. I had high expectations (it had been recommended to me by more than three friends), but honestly I couldn't finish the book. It left me feeling like, \\"Who cares?\\" I should have donated the money I paid for the book to a charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Book","review":"If this wasn't an audio book I doubt I would have been able to read it. Totally spoiled, boring rich twits with no lives populate this story. There was not one charactor that I liked.I do enjoy a chick lit book now and then, however this one was jusst bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous","review":"I was hoping this book was going to be entertaining, but alas, I was disappointed. There was no real protagonist/antagonist conflict other than the boring \\"me against the world\\" complex, which I find frightfully boring. The main character was not one that I could really connect with and I really didn't feel bad for her through any of her drama (it would be literary blasphemy to call them conflicts) which made reading this book relativly taxing. The main character got on my nerves with her constantly thinking that everything that was happening revolved around her. Like when she can't believe that people have the nerve to be happy and in love when she had just been dumped! That is just one example. As a final note, if you're planning on writing a story, make sure you name your main character. How am I supposed to relate to her if I don't even know her name?-not recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too shallow for me, but did have an okay story line","review":"This as a very easy, light read. I thought this book was very humorous initially, but got very annoyed midway. I agree that this book is just lots of name dropping. So glad that I don't have to live in a world where it's all about names... how depressing. These girls have some major issues! Would I want to be a Bergorf Blonde? NO THANK YOU! I wouldn't waste my time with this book unless you just love chic lit. I will give the book credit as it did have a cute love story and I wasn't expecting the ending with Charlie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for fun","review":"This book should be read for pure entertainment only. its ditsy and extremely silly at times and recounts a part of a life of a rich girl in New York more than anything else. I found it relaxing to read on vacation when you dont want to read something to intellectual. If you love reading mags. such as glamour, cosmo, vogue etc. this is perfect for you.I really liked this book, the only part i thought was too slow was after the main character comes back from Cannes and there is the whole book club thing. But once she sees Charlie at the hotel it gets interesting again.Not my favorite but i will read it again for entertainment purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"good beach read","review":"This book is an excellent light read! Given some of the negative reviews, I would like to reiterate a very good point one reviewer made. Potential readers should actually take a look at the title of a book before they purchase it. The title here is \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\" not \\"War and Peace\\" not \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". This book is obviously not intended to be a deep, thought provoking novel. It is funny and light. The perfect book to pass the time with on the beach or at the pool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"This was a wonderful read that gave a glimpse into the world of a New York socialite and her friends. The only problem is that it gives you an idea of how wonderful it is to be filthy rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bergdorf Blondes","review":"Not that I expected much from this book - the same way I did not expect much from the Devil Wears Prada, Trading Up and other so called chick lit books - but I felt insulted reading Bergdorf Blondes. The above-mentioned books at least attempt to be sarcastic and try to describe New York society life with an ironic and sometimes even bitter undertone. However, this read was unfortunately a complete waste of time as well as an insult to the reader. Chick/Glam lit can be great but only if the writer is capable of injecting some cynicism and irony in her writing. Plum Sykes clearly is not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bland- cannot relate to characters","review":"If you like reading about rich women who cry over shoes and other deep issues, then this book is for you. I was hoping for a connection of some sort. I was hoping that the lead character would show an underlying depth of character. I was sadly disappointed. This is definitly not a Shopaholic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't go anywhere","review":"If you think Paris Hilton's escapades are fascinating, this book will be right up your alley.

All frosting, no cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"A previous reviewer wrote that this book looked \\"like it was written by a 12-year-old.\\" I beg to differ. Most twelve-year olds are better writers than Ms. Sykes. They know that writing a novel takes more than naming every brand available at Berfdorf's - it takes an interesting plot and interesting characters, both of which are sorely missing from BB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Determined to read this book? Then borrow it!","review":"I have to say, I could hardly make it through this one.The only reason I finished was to write a review on Amazon to help people relize what a time waster it is. Now, I am an unabashed lover of Chic-Lit. The Nanny Diaries and The Devil Wears Prada are much better written and much more entertaining than Bergdorf Blondes. This book is POORLY done. The unnamed narrator of the story is almost as shallow and irritating as the woman the term Bergdorf Blonde was based on. There seems hardly a reason for the charaters to even exist in print form other than to mention the designer clothes, shoes and handbags they own. It was vapid and boring, not entertaining in the least. I only wish Amazon was thoughtful enough to offer a no star or even a negative star option as a rating. That is what I would give Bergdorf Blondes. But please, if you insist on reading it, at least pick up a copy at your local library. You will appreciate the money saving advise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"industry connections + clever title = bestseller","review":"I am still scratching my head in amazement that this book made it to the printing press. Forget about the fact that there is no character development, story line or sustainable plot -- the grammar is flawed throughout and the juvenile euphemisms for words like \\"sex\\" are awful. Does this even qualify as an easy beach read? It was painful to finish! What Bergdorf Blondes offers most of all is proof that connections are EVERYTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good beach/plane read...but not much else","review":"This book was just okay. I bought it to read on a plane and it certainly passes the time. The story is rather predictable, the characters somewhat likeable, but the book is entirely forgettable. Much better reads in the same vein would be Bridget Jones or the Nanny Diaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"First of all, I want to say that I enjoyed other books in the same genre (Nanny Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada, etc) but I found Bergdorf Blondes pretty boring, to be blunt. I didn't find Moi to be a very sympathetic or likeable main character, and Plum Sykes' attempt at being \\"cute\\" was a bit tiring (the constant mentions of \\"going to Brazil\\" made me want to puke). Throughout the whole thing, I felt as if Sykes was trying to write a sort of \\"Clueless-in-Manhattan\\" (I'm referring to the 1995 movie with Alicia Silverstone), but lacked any of that great movie's original wit. In addition, I don't think it gives any great insight into the world she is trying to portray (and I work at a fashion magazine and live in NYC, so am familiar with the types of women and lifestyle she writes of).Overall, a disappointment, considering the hype surrounding the novel and its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"We get it...","review":"... you know all the luxury brands, the thread count of the sheets at the Mercer Hotel, and the name of all the fashionable (read expensive) places in the city. Too bad that's all you seem to know. You don't know how to create characters, how to make a plot interesting, or how to write.But let's give credit where credit is due: you must be the best self-promoter in the world because you managed, with zero talent, to get a book contract and a six-figure advance. Bravo, Plum Sykes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read fun, light chick lit...","review":"... look elsewhere. Bergdorf Blondes is boring, dull non-lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly vapid.... and not in a fun way.","review":"I wasn't expecting real literature, here. I was hoping for an effortless little bit of fluff to distract me for a spell. But frankly, this isn't even a good beach read. It's pallid and flat and lifeless and dull... It has no plot, it goes nowhere, and the characters are so tediously arrogant that I wanted to club them senseless with their own Jimmy Choos. I get the distinct impression that this is a talentless but rich and spoiled celebutante's attempt to write a thinly-veiled memoire. It had such potential to be a fun read, but it's as dull and soulless as \\"Moi\\" herself. Yawn. Glad I borrowed it from the library-- I'd feel ripped off if I had actually wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought BB's wasn't supposed to be chick lit...","review":"Plum, I had such high hopes. I loved your piece on GPK and always looked at Vogue contents to see if you had a feature. I was so excited to finally get my hands on your novel. I wished for single-girl-in-NYC-liasing-with-PAPs sarcasm, wit and energy. What I got was a TOTALLY PREDICTABLE piece of chick lit quite in line with the usually boring, banal, BS of other chick lits. BB did display a bit of sarcasm, which I almost enjoyed, but all of the good stuff was eclipsed by the embarrasingly bad ending, which, frankly, is offensive to the reader. I want my four hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Boring","review":"I don't mind reading a fluffy, silly, vacuous little book now and again. I don't need everything I read to be great literature. But if I do read a trifle I want it to at least be entertaining.This book was dull. The characters were hackneyed and uninteresting. The \\"witty,\\" \\"wacky\\" incidents were badly written slapstick. And the much vaunted insider knowledge of NYC high-society sets was nothing that a reader of Vogue, viewer of Sex & the City, or resident of New York for any length of time wouldn't have already encountered.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tres' Cliche'","review":"The only thing I gleaned from this book were the names of some designers so I could look for bargains on E-bay...otherwise, so utterly predictable and unlikley a plot(?) if that is not being too kind a word...of course you know that as soon as the main character (aren't the main characers supposed to be ultimately likable-I am a writer and learned this, if nothing else) meets a man she just can't stand, that she will, of course, end up with him. Gee, how original. The only thing in this book remotely original is perhaps, some of the clothing...But I am sure it will sell millions of copies...others (too many others) have done this story already...not all that exciting to those of us who live normal lives...gives shallow a new meaning..."},{"rating":"1","title":"First people up against the wall when the revolution comes.","review":"There wasn't one single character in the book who wasn't purely a waste of skin. And if this had been the point, then this could have been something great. But it wasn't the point. Moi-- antihero? Oh my God. So very very bad and unreadable. The only emotion that I took away was physical revulsion for the idea that there might be people in the world who find it okay to live this way.Seriously. It makes Stephenie Meyer look like high canonical literature. If this is any indication of the future of books, future academics will be offering graduate seminars in howTwilight's crisp prose style and astonishing characterization made it a beacon for quality in the early 21st century.(Okay, I was obviously the wrong reader.

Shallow characters, poor writing, non-existent plot, forgettable dialogue, and improbable events. Even the ending is silly and predictable.The young women, who live in NYC, are borderline anorexic, or anorexic, insipid, and unsympathetic. The plot is simplistic (self absorbed silly young women want to find a rich husband).

No way.Worth the time? Maybe as a study in amateurism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was looking for something frothy as a summer read and stumbled upon this book. It was horrible! Who wants to read about a rich, beautiful, thinner-than-a-model protagonist who's biggest dilemia in life is which gorgeous semi-royalty guy she will date next? No thanks - I don't need that kind of escapism. If this story was intended to be satirical, it wasn't written well enough for me to pick up on that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"While reading, I often wondered who Sykes had to go to Brazil with to get this printed. I was anxious to read her novel as I enjoy her magazine pieces. However, this was the most vapid drivel I have come across in a long time. I don't know if she over committed herself and had to dash something off quickly in order to get it completed on time, but in doing so she forgot to write a story. I can appreciate light beach reads as much as the next person, but this wouldn't even qualify as that. I actually had to force myself through it. The craziest thing is that all of the professional book reviews I've read, all applaud it. I don't know if they don't feel at liberty to call it what it really is (an amateur attempt) because they are also in the writing business, but there positive reviews are too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"With apologies to the author...","review":"With apologies to the author, I thought this book was absolutely awful. I gave it one star because that was the lowest option. The main characters are incredibly shallow to the point at which you don't even care what happens to them. They are so far removed from the real world that it is sickening and it frightens me to think that there may actually be people out there like them. I quit reading the book after the \\"narrator\\" was dumped by her fiance and I only read as far as I did because I needed to make sure that he did in fact dump her. I kept thinking that if I read just a little further that it would get better, but it didn't.

Yes, Payard is pleasant and Fauchon offers nice pastries. This book is a redundantly comedic failure. What is the point of satirizing an already self-satirical social genre? If the reader finds entertainment value in shallow characters, a circling plot, and a pointless story, this is for you. For those that desire characters that make one wring their hands in frustration of the realization that the characters are fictional and cannot be strangled, cheers to you. If this is the literary depth of Plum Sykes' talents she should be banished from the literary world. Bergdorf Blondes is wasted paper. I finished it with the naive hope that something of even the smallest value might be awaiting at the end. Not quite! This novel is literary equivalent to cheap peroxide."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE THAN A BAD HIGHLIGHTING JOB","review":"The cover is beautiful, the author's pedigree hopeful, and the first couple pages ultra-cute.But that's where it ends.

Unfortunately, this book had all the trappings, but none of the heart. It was a very fast read, which is probably good because I would have likely put it aside otherwise. I did not feel the author gave us any real good reasons to sympathize with the main character/narrator. I am not sure why I kept reading until the end. Perhaps I was looking for her to get more real, or at least less superficial. Somehow it never happened. (Or might have kept readingbecause it made me happy to be married and no longer living in NYC!)Regardless, the lives of these girls seemed very pathetic and lonely. I prefer books where the main character has a goal greater than getting free clothes and rides on private jets. I did not root for the main character, I felt I was only watching her life from afar in fascination of its vapidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oxford Blues","review":"As an Oxford graduate and an English person I'd just like to apologise to you all for Plum Sykes and Bergdorf Blondes. No, that's all. We're really sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"The problem with this \\"book\\" is that's it's about stupid and vapid people living in a world obsessed with vanity and fashion and material goods. Since I'm a sucker for the English sense of humor, and because I had read some funny lines in the reviews, I bought this thinking it would be a satire on a stupid world. But it's just boring. It's lucky to get 1 star from me.We shouldn't blame Plum Sykes ... she's smart enough to see how preoccupied we are and to make some money at our expense, but don't buy this if you care about characters in books, or if you think Sykes wants to make fun of her subjects. She IS the subject. She's MOI. She lives and loves the world she's writing about and that makes her blind to its faults. If fashion and celebrity are your thing, go on reading magazines like Vogue and People. But if you want to read a book, do yourself a favor and buy a real novel. This thing will just make you angry for wasting your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like it was written by a 12-year-old","review":"This book isn't clever enough to be considered satirical.

If you're looking for a genuinely hilarious autopsy of our celebrity-addled culture, check out \\"So 5 Minutes Ago\\" by Hilary DeVries (Villard). It's \\"about\\" Hollywood publicists, which makes it fun, but it's deeper than that. A great beach read, and food for thought, to boot.

You CAN judge this book by it's cover--the little pastel illustrations of private jets and engagement rings depict precisely what lies within. It's a silly novel infused with a thick stack of fashion magazines. The references to brand names, thread counts, and NYC will not be lost on anyone who regularly reads magazines or watches E! entertainment television. It's funny--I suppose due to the proliferation of magazines, movies, and other books like this one, the exclusive and high-flying world of the Bergdorf Blonds feels quite familiar (even to a decidedly un-Bergdorf brunette living far from Manhattan). Only in America! Take it to the beach and tell anyone who questions you that it's a highly intellectual and wicked satire.

Lest you be deceived into thinking I'm a tree-hugging granola out to save the world, think again; I was raised on Falcon Crest and loved Sex and the City. But this self indulgent crapola is beyond belief. What a useless, dull book peopled with characters who have little reason to exist. This is not a fun, light romp, but rather stomach turning. Avoid it unless you are under the hair dryer at Foxie Roxie's Hair Haven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, but Like a Train Wreck","review":"I can only give a book one star if it was so dumb I couldn't finish it. I did finish Bergdorf Blondes because it made me hopeful. Hopeful that it would get better. Sort of Sophie Kinsella meets Candace Bushnell then they both get ripping drunk and write a novel on the cocktail napkins. It was missing all heart, all warmth, and anything else that would make you care about what happens to the characters at the end. And truly, if you couldn't see what was coming, you probably can't read the first line on the eye chart either. It's not even about Bergdorf Blondes! It's about the Blonde's best friend! If you feel the odd compulsion to read this book, get it from the library and spend your money on something that won't make you feel silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Quick Read","review":"I found the shallowness of the characters in the novel very funny. It's a nice relaxing read because you do not have to think much and it makes you laugh. I read this book in 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bergdorf Blah","review":"Plum Sykes has penned what can only be called a disappointment. Beneath the fabulous Chloe jeans, Hermes Birkin and Alpha-beta peel is a plot as skinny as the very 'ana' (anorexic) Bergdorf blonde or brunette, as is the case of the main character. I had to give up the book a little more than halfway through, but not after exerting enough effort--a gazillion times--to plough through the one-dimensional, oh-so-predictable story. And here I thought Anna Wintour's recommendation on the jacket was worth its weight in Harry Winston diamonds. Could it possibly be that by being a contributing editor for Vogue, Plum has thus earned such gushing, 'perfectly pitched' remark from the iconic EIC?Entre nous, as the main protagonist loves to say, the book is tres ennuyeux. Better save your precious few dollars in the piggybank for a new Versace dress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I chucked the worthless book after reading 22 pages.

I've heard about this book before so when I spotted it in a used bookstore for a dollar, it was a no brainer purchase.Well, to start with, I was bored to tears-I don't think I ever read anything so remotely uninteresting. Sometimes even if characters are not very likable, I can still enjoy the book. Not happening here-the only conversation you will read about is about how one of the main characters is suffering because she doesn't have a newest designer bag. I like designer bags as much as the next girl but there are other things in life besides that. Is Ms Sykes writing about her own life? Sure sounds like it. I really don't think I've ever read about such lame bunch of people so it must be real. If you are interested in fun and lighthearted chick lit book, DO NOT BUY THIS! Even a dollar is too much for this \\"masterpiece\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bergdorf Blondes","review":"The Park Avenue Princesses are on a mission- find the perfect Prospective Husband. The unnamed heroine dives right in, finding what seems like the most fabulous men but realizing they are only toads disguised as a prince (literally- a prince). Along with best friend Julie Bergdorf, the group of wealthy socialites go through the life of luxury, their biggest worries being when their next alpha-beta peel is scheduled, and what to wear to the hottest party this weekend.Following the adventures of the rich and fabulous proved hilarious in Plum Sykes debut novel, Bergdorf Blondes. A light but hilarious read, it was difficult to put down because the characters were able to suck you in and make you feel a part of the clique. Chick lit readers will enjoy the fluffy plot and over the top situations, especially if you were a fan of the Clueless movie! Blondes is entertaining, carefree, and a glamorous trip through the glitzy world of the girls who have it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Euwww!","review":"I'm all for chick-lit (Sophie Kinsella or Marion Keyes anyone?) but this book is just \\"beyond\\" awful. I ended up skipping pages just to get to the end of it, hoping that it will get better as the story develops. Well, it never got better. The dialogue mimicks the way Paris Hilton speaks (think: Euwww! Bee-yond!! Like, totally) and the heroine just gets more and more annoying instead of endearing. I would not recommend picking up this book. Go with the likes of Cabot, Kinsella or Keyes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berdorf Bomb is more like it....","review":"I read this book on vacation and it was good for only one thing: putting me to sleep! Ladies, this book is 310 pages of mindless fluff. It cannot and should not be compared to Sex in the City. Sure, some of the stuff is funny but how much idiotic rich girl ranting can a reader take? The story has a nameless narrator (aka Moi) who is a moron. Moi has no work ethic, whines about everything, doesn't learn much from dating mistakes and is guaranteed to bore you to tears 50-100 pages in. Name dropping galore. I don't even recommend taking this one out of the library. You are better off going shopping than wasting your time reading about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"Yes, this book is not meant for anything but casual beach-side reading. To compare Plum Sykes to Candice Bushnell is an insult. Ms. Bushnell's writing is brilliant and fun and her stories are merely peppered with brand name dropping, not the sole purpose of them. This book is little more than a list of brand names. We get it: Rich NY princesses like brand names. No one needed to tell us that. But the similes in this book border on the ridiculous: She \\"was as excited as a Japanese tourist in a Louis Vuitton outlet store.\\" The non-stop litany of brand names and who was wearing who and where was just irritating. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Bad","review":"As much as I adore the strange universe that is NY's Upper East Side, this book is just daft drivel, not even FUN drivel. There is no structure; it simply wanders around like an uninformed shopper, on and on and on. The episodes are linked together with little insider tip offs on where to get the best fake bake, where to get bikini waxes. Reading a copy of Vogue will give you more of a sense of narrative and structure, even content. Don't buy this book. Wait for another more intuitive, sensitive and skilled writer to depict this world in all of its high-fat riches, rife with Chloe jeans and Manolos, sure--but utter saddness and hope too--as it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"Don't waste your money, unless you really, REALLY like your dentist. \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\" is so over-the-top sugary that I feel like I have a dozen cavities just from reading the first chapter.The writing, which is a notch above par, could have saved the book from the lack of plot. Unfortunately, the entire thing was sunk by \\"Moi,\\" a shallow, self-centered, beyond-spoiled whiny twit who cares only about clothes, make-up, and being seen. I would say she cares about men, but I would be lying. She cares about them as accessories, and dubs herself as being so, SO in love -- until they leave her, she goes spastic, and twenty minutes later, she's fine and with another man.

It's hard to believe this gal writes for a living. I think I could have written something better. I want to point out something, to any girl who gets her hair highlighted (as Julie does by \\"Ariette), there is no dye involved, and when the author states \\"the dye was applied to her strands\\" (or something similar), being the as savvy as she claims to be, she would know that BLEACH is applied to make hair blonde.

If you refrain from taking it all too seriously, then it will prove to be super entertaining. If, however, you are nowhere near \\"in touch\\" with your superficial side, you'll probably find this book irritating. It's completely over-the-top, which makes it a fantastic piece of fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and a bit of a Bridget Jones rip-off","review":"I found this book interesting for about the first couple pages, and then it got to be a bit tedious, a bit of a yawner, and totally predictable. I'm not sure if it's aimed at 16-year-old girls, but it almost seems like the 2004 version of a Harlequin Romance. You know, superficial and with no big surprises or revelations...or thoughts. It was very reminiscent of \\"Bridget Jones,\\" as well as the much better written \\"Trading Up\\" by Candace Bushnell. I recommend borrowing it from the library, and not expecting too much. I will give it its props, however, in that the storylines were all nicely tied up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for what it is...","review":"As a very homesick ex-New Yorker I can say that this book was what I was looking for. It was hilarious, sweet, and seemed like the author couldn't decide if a teensy bit of her wanted to live that way or if she was being sarcastic... It was probably a really fun book to write. Yay for Plum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did a 5-year-old socialite write this?","review":"This book is so awful! The author is not meant to be a writer. Sure, she's shallow and boring, but anyone could have written this book, even a child. I don't think her writing abilities are adult-level. The plot was terrible; the characters all seemed the same. There are no redeeming qualities I can think of.

The characters are fun, not to mention fun to laugh at. They are so totally wrapped up in their own little world, where the biggest problem is having next season's fashions and finding a \\"PH\\" (prospective husband), that you have to like them. There IS even a bit of character development--by the end of the novel there is a glimmer of hope that one day these girls will be mature (if still slightly neurotic) women. Don't worry; they hide it well...but it's there.Overall a fun book to waste a Sunday reading, preferably by the pool with a frosty drink and a fabulous pair of shades."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH - I'm returning it!","review":"I got through two of the most poorly written chapters I've ever read in my life. Closed the book and announced that I would be returning it. I have NEVER returned a book in my entire life.

I did read the whole book but it was pretty boring and predictable.

I heard they are making a movie from this book and I hope it will be more exciting. My advice is not to bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Even for a Fashionista","review":"As a chick lit-a-holic and Manhattanite, I was drawn to a book about fashion and love in the NYC. What I got was a collection of incidents about shopping, rich loser men and title hunters. The narrator, as well as the other characters are barely even two-dimentional and the plot is redundant where it isn't non-existant.I felt like the narrator was trying to poke fun at the silliness of her jet-set, designer lable lifestyle, but even her little jabs about other characters' superficiality was tepid. There were no epiphanies or even any sort of change within the characters' lives, and the romance was trite and seemingly without much feeling.I love literature, both serious and light, but I reccomend you save your money unless you really want to read hundreds of pages about highlights and pedicures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I've been on the waiting list for Bergdorf Blondes for months after I saw the book at Borders and I have to say....I'm SO glad I did not buy this book. Now I love the world of the rich like the next person, especially those who live in NY, but I have to say Skyes REALLY took her life and ran with it. Not that her world doesn't exist, but it seemed SO extravagant I ended up being turned off by it.

She even mentions the movie in her \\"novel\\". There is also an allusion to Azzedine Alaia dresses but this lacks the heart and sweetness of 'Clueless'. Although it is entertaining enough I am near the end of the book and feel as if I am reading a Harlequin romance in better packaging. It has the same thinly-veiled storyline. I don't know if I will even finish it, this book is that predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow but not much fun","review":"Like an overdose of \\"E True Hollywood Story\\" or Us Magazine, \\"Bergdorf Blondes\\" isn't as half fun as it's supposed to be. Relentlessly superficial with a strangely brittle quality, this novel promises bubbly fun, but delivers little but endless brand names, forced zaniness and a plot twist that's given away in the jacket copy. And for a book about carefree rich people, a queasy anxiety about money seems to pervade every encounter in the novel. Thanks, but I have enough money stress in my life to want to deal with it inexpertly rendered in fiction. Leave writing to the professionals, Ms. Sykes, and market your consumerist boy-craziness to Cosmo if you feel you must express yourself in print again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Bergdorf Blondes","review":"I got this book because I like reading the Plum Sykes articles in Vogue magazine.

The barely-conceived plotline is lifted straight from Bridget Jones' Diary, but the main character, simply known as Moi, lacks the vulnerability, foibles or humor that made Bridget so endearing. The characters are so shallow and rendered so flimsily that I found it impossible to connect - or care - about any of them. I understand that the author was attempting to portray an environment of privilege by making brand and product references, but the name-dropping is so constant and overwhelming that it feels like the same joke told 3,000 times.If you're looking for a fun, smart, satirical read about Manhattan's privileged elite, skip this and read Wendy Wasserstein's Elements of Style instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read!! Bergdorf Blonde Highlights","review":"Okay, so I bought this book just as Sex and the City was wrapping its last season.

Very fun book, do read on the beach!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing Brain Cells","review":"I honestly would never recommend this book to anyone. I think that it is just a cheap rip off of Bridget Jones's Diary. Bergdorf Blondes makes you feel as if you're getting dumber as you read further into the story. I believe that the heroine is someone you are supposed to cheer for and is someone who is supposed to grow by the end of the story. However, I found myself constantly disappointed by how shallow she was. If you want a good Beach Read then read Can you Keep a Secret, the Shopaholic series, or of course Bridget Jones's Diary. DO NOT waste your money on this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Blondes","review":"Boring, predicatable, and difficult to get through because I disliked it so much. To live life the way these girls live would be obscene. I was quite disgusted, but read on only because I don't quit books.

There's no chance the unnamed narrator graduated from Princeton, as she alleges--she hasn't a reasoned thought in her head, and though the school has affirmative action, it doesn't have it for white upper-middle-class English/American girls with no hint of being a legacy, and there's no hint that either of her parents is Ivy educated. Probably best for those who find the non-fictional lower-born Paris Hilton and Gastineau girls at all entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"I give this book 1 star because I actually read it all the way through.

The description says the main character is a heroine. Now, I would imagine there would be some redeemable or mildly interesting quality in a lead character to be called a heroine. Yet there is nothing endearing or interesting about her, she is a bore. Writing about pretentious rich people, and exposing their ironies and hypocrisy is a worthy undertaking, however this does not do that. Instead, the writer seems to lack an awareness of how really dull and sad these characters are and rambles on and on about their trivial lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best chic lit","review":"This is a hilarious novel about PAPs (Park Avenue Princesses).

From a world where women wear Valentino to work, get engaged just so they have that \\"glow,\\" go from thirty-eight to thirty-seven on their birthday, and regularly take rides on PJs (private jets), comes a story that's highly entertaining.

It is far too vague. I wanted to know more of Kathleen as a person, not just offhand remarks by her stepson alluding to her drinking making it sound like that was a big part of her life and yet I knew it was not. However I wanted that explained more fully in the book. It was interesting to read about an obviously brilliant woman who despite her brilliance made a very bad choice in marrying this man and finding out more and more about him, not getting out before she literally could not.It happens to so many, many women but I felt so very sad for Kathleen and for the lovely daughter she has left.

You keep seeing white-gloved schoolmarm in your head while you're reading her rather pedestrian accounts.I want my money back!Had Ms. Fanning taken her last chapter and made it her approach to her subject, it might have saved it, but her writing never will. No one is interested in looking at the habits of the victims as if it's the 1950's ---- most readers who buy books about real crimes want to know about the monsters who did it.Why the publisher continues to publish this author without a better/stronger editor is a mystery to me!

Parts of the book were fairly well written, but much of it wasn't. There were so many typos that I wondered if it had actually been edited. But, the misusage of words was what bothered me the most. For example, the author continuously used the word \\"podium\\" in place of \\"lectern.\\" A podium is defined as something a presenter stands upon. I found myself laughing hysterically when I read about one of the attorneys pounding his finger on the podium. I thought the image of this grown man bent over and pounding his finger next to his feet in a courtroom was quite comical. I also thought it was incredible that a published author would use words without knowing their meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness for the prosecution","review":"I come to this book after having watched the riveting documentary \\"The Staircase\\" (available for rent at netflix) fascinated by Michael Peterson but looking for the other side of the story. For as fascinating as the documantary is, it is told from the defense perspective. This book sets out the facts, many glossed over or omitted from the documenary, along with a critical but not unfair view of the accused. If you have seen the film and are looking for more information on the case, this is the book to read; it is much more factual and informative than Aphrodite Jones's much more emotional and biased account. After reading this book, I lost my conviction that Peterson was wrongly convicted, but saddened that a man of so much talent and intelligence could be capable of such violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written in Blood","review":"I thought the book was fascinating. It definitely appears to be written from the view that the guy definitely did it and it is very strange that two women in his life seem to have died in very similar ways. At least that was the claim. Another interesting thing is that there is a documentary on you tube with the actual people from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm","review":"if you you know the basics of how to stretch and warm up, and have ever hit a punching bag before, think twice, not much to see here. good job to amazon for the quick delivery though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls Not Grey","review":"Good EP.

Aside from the obvious benefits (more for your money, cheaper, etc.), I found that it just mixes up so much better than Similac; therefore my son was able to digest it so much better. He was a colicy baby, but once I switched to Bright Beginnings, he seemed to do so much better. I'm now using Bright Beginnings with my second child, and she's doing wonderfully.My grocery store recently discontinued selling Bright Beginnings to make room for their brand of formula. This caused me to do some online research. I have found that Amazon has the best price.

I mean, I'm not about to risk life and limb and drink from a cup to see which of us will live or die and get to have some bloke. Let's be honest, the reason the Cadfael mysteries work is because of the actor who brings him to life. I enjoyed the mystery, but not as well as some of the other Cadfael ones. I think it was too easy for me to figure out overall. Still, it is a good diversion. I recommend that if you haven't seen Cadfael before, you try another one first and try this one down the line. If you know Cadfael, then pick this up now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful reference tool","review":"First published in 1956, this handbook is an indispensable, up-to-date companion both in the field and in the marketplace. Topics include the vegetable industry, greenhouse vegetable production, soils and fertilizers, water, pests, weed control, harvesting, storage, and seed production. Packed with quick-access graphs, tables, charts, and line drawings, the 4th edition offers new information on drip irrigation, seed germination, plant tissue and sap testing, windbreaks, and weed management. It also gives advice on allowable pesticide and herbicide use and on the latest worker protection standards. The appendix contains sources of vegetable information, providers of vegetable seeds, periodicals for vegetable growers, and U.S. units of measurement and the metric conversion factors. A change from the spiral-bound 3rd edition is a sturdy, flexible cover to help hold pages flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be an Expert Farmer with one book","review":"Some years ago I used this book to build a very large farming company.

It is wonderful and the current edition is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I knew going in that this handbook was for commercial growers so though I hesitated at the price I thought it would be worth it because it would be so complete. Boy, was I mistaken. I can't believe this is what professional growers use. The information is so hit and miss.I guess the biggest problem is the inconsistency about which vegetables and crops are covered. In some places they list every vegetable you can think of and in others they list fewer than 15. Need to know what temperature to ship vegetables or how much a crate of yucca weighs? There are pages and pages devoted to it. Need to know germination temperature for seeds? There is less than a page and exactly 12 vegetables listed.I think most growers [even commercial ones] would be better off searching out the information they need for the specific crops they plan to grow. In fact, much of this book is dedicated to listing websites and government agencies rather than including the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knott's handbook review","review":"Very comprehensive but somewhat esoteric.

This is a great rendition of the \\"Four Seasons\\" and a must for any Vivaldi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous!","review":"I absolutely love Yolanda's work and this recording is no different. The performance is perfect in every way. Yolanda is as precise, distinct, full of expression and perfect as always.

If you are wanting the more traditional violin (original) version then this will not work for you! In that case I would recommend Nigel Kennedy's recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite exceptional","review":"Akira Ifukube was one of the greats of Japanese orchestra music. Drawing on his love of traditional Japanese music and Ainu folk music, he combined these with Western orchestra to produce a music that is both classical and yet very Japanese. In the West, Ifukube is best known for his film tunes, especially the ones used in the Godzilla movies.This album is quite exceptional. The Japanese feel of the music makes it refreshingly different and quite interesting to listen to.

She was so broke she had to move herself and her two sons in with her grandfather, yet she used her husband's life insurance money for a boob job and slut wardrobe, rather than for her kids' future?This series tried to be Stephanie Plum from the beginning, but Jennifer Apodaca will never ben Janet Evanovich. Perhaps if she'd realized that from the start, her series would've worked.

(I used my own screws as those provided are extremely cheap and don't seat properly on any drill bit--they appear somewhere near a Phillips 1 point, but don't seat correctly and are virtually unusable). All of my lights worked just fine right out of the box.Installations tips:1) Get yourself some quality size #10 .5 inch screws from your hardware store.2) Plug in the light before installing it. It will heat the plastic and make it much more flexible and easy to work with as you go along.3) You can also use cable ties to mount the lights if you get the clear plastic variety.

So definitely low quality screws.After I put the light in, one quarter of it just stopped working.. again shoddy quality control.The only positive things I can say are that the price was low and the color of the light was similar to incandescent bulbs, so warm light, not the bright white light that hurts your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 good 1 not","review":"ordered 6 strands of this rope lighting for my front porch, and when i plugged them in, one of the strands kept blowing the small fuse inside the plug. the rope was shorted somewhere internally, so i ended up with 5 strands instead of six."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - do not buy!","review":"I ordered three of these rope lights and all three were defective.

That would be ok, if the gameplay was as good the Sacred Cards too, but this game is just not fun. Its wayy too Hard, and you find yourself grinding for hours just to get enough to buy one new crappy card with 900 ATK points. Literally the 4th required duel in the game, the other guys monster average twice your power, (1400 to 700), so you're stuck training endlessly on the nearby drones.

Many of Buddy's very best tracks are spoiled by the overdubbing which sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom and all on the same day. The voices of The Picks had been overdubbed onto many of The Crickets' original recordings but the tracks attributed to Buddy Holly usually escaped the treatment.The sad thing is that the basic quality of the recordings used here is sparkling when they can actually be heard.The Picks (and The Roses, another vocal group who's voices were dubbed onto Crickets' recordings) may well deserve some kind of tribute in recognition for being involved (post production) in the Crickets story but this should not have been the way to do it.In fact, if the technology exists, it would have been far better to re-release all of the Crickets original tracks with the overdubbing removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFACING HOLLY'S BEST WORK","review":"There is no mention of The Picks on the album cover posted here, but this is listed by Amazon as \\"Buddy Holly and The Picks\\".If this is with the Picks you should know that...There is no \\"best of\\" Buddy Holly with the Picks...For some incomprehensible reason, around 1985-90 someone in authority gave license to a group called the Picks to overdub any and all original Buddy Holly recordings with their vocal harmonies.These modern overdubs of Holly's 1950s classics deface his finest work, and are widely distributed as \\"Buddy Holly and the Picks\\".As result, there are surely a lot of people out there who think Holly's band was the Picks, and that Holly and the Picks were not very good (they're not).Buddy Holly was an exceptional artist.

I envisioned great conversations between me and my kids that led us to dig into the Bible for insight and instruction. Um, notsomuch. Honestly, if the parables weren't mentioned at the beginning of each segment I hardly could've guessed what they were referring to...or that it was even content taken from the Bible! There is also a lot of cartoon violence (think Tom & Jerry) that is entertaining to a 5 year old, but pointless.On the flip side, my son really enjoys this DVD for the good, clean fun that it is. And although the content isn't as spiritually driven as I'd like it to be, I can let him watch it without being concerned that he'll see or hear something inappropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Booga Booga Land DVD!","review":"Adventures in Booga Booga Land: 'So This is Booga' & Other EpisodesThe parables of the Bible are sometimes hard for younger kids to understand.

It also comes on a flash drive bracelet. Really cool.Anyway... back to Booga Booga Land...The girls and I really loved the informative little cartoons. We laughed together then grabbed our Bibles to read the scriptures that each video was portraying.

I was kinda disappointed that there wasn't a single Bible verse or reinforcement of what these stories meant for them. I also wasn't too impressed with the visuals - it wasn't the best-drawn cartoon.

I watched this video with my 5 year old daughter and she thought it was okay, but admitted it's not her favorite. I was not impressed with this video. I don't think it stressed the lesson of the parables and it is a loose interpretation of each story. It is good for entertainment, but not for teaching the Bible.

It is obvious and scientifically proven that the Egyptians weren't ethnic Africans. They were Mediterranean, and in today's world would be considered Caucasians. Moreover, Ancient art and descriptions show the ancient Egyptian looking like the ARabs of the Gulf, the Hebrews of Canaan or the Berbers of the Maghreb, none of whom can be considered black. Although Egypt influenced Greece, Greece flourished independently. The plague of AFrocentrism must be stopped. It is merely a series of myths made to boost the self-esteem of impoverished African-American youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a gross-out book of the first order","review":"I am not a squeamish reader. Having said that, I put this book down two-thirds of the way through, sickened by the author's apparent fascination with torture and its various medieval devices. The descriptions of torture machines and how they work on the human body are quite graphic, almost as if the author was truly enjoying herself while writing the descriptions. Yuck.The plot works quite well, but unless you're willing to read this gross stuff that will surely stay with you afterwards, move on to something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, but not for the faint of heart","review":"I've read this and bought this as a gift twice now and gotten positive reviews from the recipients.McDermid leaves predictability at the door with this Tony Hill Mystery. It is dark and more than a little bit twisted, and explicit in some places one might wish it was more vague, but it definitely adds to the overall impact of the tale. Overall it is an excellent start to the Tony Hill series which will lead the reader to anticipate the next story."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired and dated","review":"The Good: The Mermaids Singing starts off well and feels like a good read. The killers narrative works out fine and hooks you early. Unfortunately as the book progresses it shows its age and in the end fails horribly. The book is about a psychological profiler and perhaps that alone made it interesting in 1995. Unfortunately nearly ten years later I needed more.The Bad: I will put forth no spoilers here but I will say there is little build up to the ending and it is over in a blink of an eye. I felt like Val needed to have the book done by 400 pages and she wrapped it up just before she over shot the mark.I love how she references Silence of the Lambs more than once and then liberally borrows plot points from it.Bottom Line: Read Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs both are way more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy plot, near-offensive gay caricatures","review":"Setting aside a gaping hole or two in the plot, the scenes of gay nightlife and the way the mystery progresses triggered all my \\"latent homophobia\\" radar. I understand McDermid has written excellent books featuring a lesbian detective, but based on this book, I figured her to be an over-simplifying dolt, not quite a \\"gay basher\\" but having more of a \\"Look at these ever so *intersting* people in the zoo!\\" kind of vibe, which in some ways is worse. I also read \\"Place of Execution\\" which i liked much better, but in both cases you wish the author were sitting beside you so you could ask a few basic questions and point out glaring inconsistances or ask about ridiculous assumptions on which the plot rests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky","review":"No spoilers included, but this book has a major gimmick in it that's popular now and thus totally overused. The characters are all neurotic. The mystery is not compelling. I liked the other McDermids I read a lot better. I think the author was only partially attentive, or was distracted by something horrible and boring, while writing this tedious slab of overwrought verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid Singing","review":"The paperback copy I received from Amazon has printing so tiny I have to practically use a magnifying glass to read it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent readl!!","review":"I thought that this book was very entertaining. It had an interesting plot. I liked the way it switched between the killers point of view and the cops. The torture scenes were a bit gruesome and they had me twisting in my chair in discomfort, but isn't that what a good novel should do? It made the horror of what the killer was doing to these men seem that much more disturbing and made the reader really want the cops to succeed in stopping the killings. I was up until 2:30 in the morning the other night and I couldn't put it down, even though I had to be up early for work. I really like the characters in this book (Jordan, Hill, Merrick). I first picked up The Torment of Others in the Charles de Gaulle airport having never heard of the author. I so enjoyed that novel and the characters therein, that I went and purchased all of McDermid's novels with these characters. The Mermaids Singing did not disappoint, and I look forward to reading the Wire in the Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Misdirection","review":"Val McDermid is one the best writers of the English language today.This, the first in the series of Tony Hill/Carol Jordan books, starts this series of psycholical thrillers with a bang. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much gore, not enough substance","review":"Enjoyed Tony Hill, both his skills and his mental problems. The story was marred by an obscene amount of graphically described gore--wholly unecessary. The author's preoccupation with sadism, torture and sexual stimulation caused by the violence and torture seemed shallow, almost aimed at justifying sado-masochistic relationships. The serial killer plot was standard and cliched. Characterization of Brandon, Carol (female cop)were pretty good--especially Brandon. The sociopathic killer was sick and disgusting--but no subtlety of characterization--just globs of violence, torture and gore. The fact that the killer is sexually stmulated by torture etc. seemed not justified, but only served to viscerally punch the reader in the groin."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Life","review":"Val McDermid has become one of my favorite authors. The depth of her research is just amazing, and it shows in how the writing draws the reader into the scene and inside the characters. Thanks, Val McDermid, for wonderful characters and craftful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A problem of holding back?","review":"As a work of genre fiction, I found The Mermaids Singing an enjoyable read.As with A Place of Execution (the other book by Ms McDermid that I've read), she holds back a major surprise toward the end. (Don't worry no spoiler here.) One can almost imagine her while writing thinking, \\"ooh this is a good one.\\" By holding this back, however, she strains some of the credibility that she's built up throughout the story. While this type of thing is common in this genre, it leaves the reader with the feeling of having been deceived.That being said if you like crime/suspense/mystery novels, I think you'll enjoy reading The Mermaids Singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, crawly","review":"The novel is creepy and scary. Also gross. Most of the characters are well drawn and believable, although a McDermid could have done better with the female journalist - who is about as complex as Rita Skeeter in \\"Harry Potter,\\" but without the sense of humor. I'm not sure that the denouement is entirely believable, but by that point I was willing to go with the flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Mermaids Singint","review":"I finished this book against my better judgement. I hoped there would be some sort of redemption at the end. No such luck. No one is a better person for anything they suffered at the hands of McDermid.

Kiss Me Baby (Kissa Me Baby) and I'm Going Down to the River are too of my favorite songs from that period. Both have blazing horns that you just don't hear that often, anywhere.

It comes complete with Glycemic indexes, nutrient breakdowns, and caloric intake charts for people over/under 15%bodyfat, active/sedentary, breakfast,lunch and dinner meal plans. The best part about the diet is that it doesn't restrict anything. Without giving away everything the nutrient breakdown goes 45/35/20- carbs,protein,fat. The book gives detailed descriptions of when the best time is to take in your nutrients, and supplement recomendations. Given that Dente runs his own supplement company that isn't surprising, but the advice is solid and from what I've heard his MHP product line is top notch. As a personal trainer I have been recommending this diet to my clients, (but actually getting them to follow through is a different story).

The beats are still hard - just not hardcore. The track selection is superb - creating an atmospheric mix that has that 'epic' feeling minus the cheese of the Gategrasher/Ministry or Cream CDs.

It was hard to understand the instructor at times (strong Japanese accent). He did not teach basic strikes to the body, only showed what to do when someone attacks you and many of the moves were from an opponent who uses karate on you. I did not find it to be useful for quick combative moves in situations of quick attacks or chaos. Was very redundant as well. Moves were not explained as they were preformed, instructor just did them (repeated the move 2-3 x then moves were shown in slow motion).

I bought but have long since lost the album for sale here, and it is terrific, although it may not be Airplane fans' cup of tea. Some time ago I saw Grace on television telling an interviewer that she was not interested in any kind of Airplane reunion tour because \\"there's nothing as pitiful as a bunch of old people on stage trying to do rock and roll.\\" Have to agree after some of the geezer tours that have come along, but she surely wasn't thinking of the old coot who took the pitiful out of her show and made it rock like it was 1972."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"the cd was a gift - certainly not my cup of tea but apparently a great cd and much enjoyed by the recipient.however, very disappointed with the delivery...it was ordered to be sent expediated delivery to the uk in early december...i paid the extra to guarantee delivery before xmas. it arrived in the new year, taking over 3 weeks to deliver which i think is very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERSONAL ESSAYS DESCRIBING TRUE TO LIFE EXPERIENCES","review":"As a former AFDC recipient, these essays reminded me of devastingly traumatic decisions that I had experienced while receiving aid and of the choices that were made.

Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others, it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature.

I fail to see how this horribly dated book would have been considered funny even when it was published forty years ago. I was so surprised the first time the book caused me crack a smile that I marked the page (page 33 - POETRY?). It would be another hundred pages until I actually laughed. Unfortunately it was almost the end of the book and I had been numbed by the comedic void which preceded it. This book is like expired milk.

As a satire it works pretty well but as an engaging read it fails. The interludes between the pranks where Guy is conversing with the two older women didn't have a point or any interesting content, just filler between Guy's schemes (which were usually really funny). I found myself trying to speed read through those as I got further through the book once I realized they weren't related to anything (like the commercials during a reality show). As a story it doesn't go anywhere, the order of the pranks could be interchangeable, but its a short book and you can get a few chuckles out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"prescient?","review":"I'll admit I got a couple of chuckles out of this book, but really it's a one-joke premise, and Southern goes nowhere with it. He has nothing even resembling an ending.The basic setup is that there's this eccentric billionaire, Guy Grand, who delights in setting up practical jokes that showcase the greed or vulgarity of the teeming masses.Southern's book has received a lot of attention lately; several commentators have cited it as unwittingly having anticipated the cruel reality shows that seem to dominate today's TV lineups.Maybe, but one difference: Grand's victims didn't know they were victims. That's what's so funny. The men and women who sign release forms and agreee to appear on reality shows or mean-spirited game shows these days know in advance they will be humilated, and frequently for nothing more than a few days of fame.So I'm not sure how prescient it is. I wouldn't read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiring, gets old","review":"Guy Grand's pranks are hilarious, sure. Actually, Southern deserves a lot of credit here. It's amazing how well his humor has held up. It's still fresh, still very funny. However, as a full on novel, it doesn't work. The prank sequences, which are all quite funny, are punctuated with pieces of this horribly boring scene that extends throughout the entire novel and fails to really say much about anything. I found myself skipping those parts towards the end and enjoying the humorous segments for what they were: disconnected comical ideas, perhaps most appropriate as synopses for episodes of an imaginary sitcom."},{"rating":"1","title":"just couldnt get into it","review":"IHThis may not be fair, but I deleted this book after only reading 1/4 into it.

I was in the market for a large pair of astro binocs for casual observing and decided to try these Zhumells, even though the price was probably too good to be true (compared to e.g., Fujis or Taks).Needless to say, these binos are very disappointing. Lots of chromatic aberration, very small useable field (The in-focus field starts to degrade about 50% out from center), dim images for objectives of this size (100mm).I wound up sending these back the next day.

Thank you to the buyer for their expediency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck On Blu-Ray","review":"I rate the show itself 5, but the Blu-ray release I give a 2. Blu-ray is just a way of formattimg the disk. Just because something is released on Blu-ray doesn't mean it's HD. This is a case in point. I assumed that because there was both a DVD and Blu-Ray release that the latter would be HD, but it isn't. It has a widescreen picture but it's a poor quality grainy picture. You might as well get the DVD version. I think the Video on Demand version looks better than this. Also, you can't select a particular episode because all of the episodes on the disk follow one right after another. I guess they assumed people would want to sit and watch 6 episodes straight through. Overall I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show AWFUL Blu-Ray","review":"Kind of like the other guys said, This show is awesome. The Blu Ray is just down right pathetic.

Pretty decent quality but not as high as some other blu-ray seasons i own."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Your A Fan.......","review":"So many have complained about the quality of the picture, and yes it's grainy most of the time but still better then the DVD. Maybe my eyes aren't as good as most but to be honest I didn't think that it was that much of a distraction. Now that I have the biggest negative out of the way...on to the rest. Anyone who has watched this show and loved it should defiantly buy this if you have blu ray.I missed most of the first season and it was nice to get up to speed and see how it all started. This show has great action and I think great humor. Is this a must own? That is up to you, but despite the picture not being as good as it could have been I still really enjoyed this box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is great. The Blu-Ray is not.","review":"Having watched the show from the beginning, and now re-watching it after its end, Chuck is a great series with humor, action, and great writing. Few shows have such a grand sense of story arc - seasons are complete stories, not just weekly episodes. Even just watching the first episode after watching the last shows how brilliant the writing on this show was.I have the DVD of season two, but thought I'd splurge on the Blu-Ray for season 1. Big mistake. Everything about the Blu-Ray is inferior. The menus do not allow you to access individual episodes. The video quality is poor. The first disc has over 4 hours on it, which is really pushing how much compression HD could take. My impression is that the DVD video is cleaner, or at least equal to the Blu-Ray.NBC isn't known for great HD, but this is a travesty. Save your money and buy the DVD version. You won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best quality but not as bad as some make you believe","review":"I was a little hesitant after reading some of the review of the picture quality suffering. Yes they are right but it isn't as bad as they try to make you believe. Some scenes are absolutely perfect while others are pretty bad. For the most part everything has an acceptable quality. While the quality might not be the best it is still better than a DVD so if you have a Blu-ray player don't believe the hype that you would be better off with the DVD version. It is however not anything that would make you want to go by a Blu-ray player.As the issue with not being able to choose what episode is really not an issue at all. While there is no ability to choose the episode from the disk menu, the title pop-up menu is the location where you find that ability. This might be confusing for somebody who has never used the title pop-up menu on their player and does things as if it was a DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is Blu-Ray?","review":"To start, Chuck is one of my favorite show. This Blu-Ray, however, is one of the worst looking things I have ever seen. I recently bought a PS3 Slim and this was my first foray in to the land of Blu-Ray movies or television series. In this land, there be monsters. From persistent noise in the shot to the lack of a menu for choosing the episode that you want to watch this is an abomination that would be in the $5 bin at Chuck's Buy-More. Do yourself a favor and catch the older episodes that NBC has recently re-posted on-line. Get your RDA of Chuck without shelling out your hard-earned simoleans on this POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's happy as can be...","review":"He loves this show & I dont.

I also thought the pilot was promising.This episode, however, was terrible. Lots of overacting and full of absurd sitcom cliches. It's hard to believe that the producer of OC, famous at first for its understatement, made this overacted, unsubtle, unwatchable episode.

Amazon Unbox a bad deal.","review":"I loved the series CHUCK, and missed the first season. So I went to buy it on Amazon, and bought the download version. But you can only view it using Amazon Unbox video player on your computer. It does have a portable device option, but only a handful of portable devices are approved. IPods are not, and it won't work on portable dvd players. I am stuck watching it on my computer by myself and can't share it with my family unless we all want to huddle around the computer. I wish I would have been aware of these extreme limitations and spent the extra $5 to get the DVDs. I could have then watched them on my computer, on the tv, on portable dvd player, loaded on my computer and put them on my ipod, etc. etc. Amazon Unbox is awful. Don't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV Series Ever","review":"When it started, this series asked us to make a leap of faith in order to believe, that a person could have every secret in the world in it's head stored like a computer. Strange concept I know, but one that change the life of every fan.Never in the history of television, a program made such a connection with the fans and it did, based on the principal that it had one thing that would appeal to everyone. It had adventure, comedy, action, romance, lovable characters, but most of all it had heart.We watch every character grow, and became a small part of the live of fans.I was with great sorrow that we the fans, despite some of the most ingenious marketing ideas to support it, had to say goodbye... at least for nowYou should try it, you won't regretted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck First Season","review":"The first season of Chuck was amazing.

And immediately it had a wonderful response. I can imagine that it gained a respectively wide rage of audience because the story is fresh and creative, mixing some 'alias' spy adventure with the 'ugly betty' hip comedy touch. The writers made a great job with the storyline and the producers manage to make every series like watching an action movie actually, very rich plots mixed with fresh comedy.All the cast played a major role in creating a great chemistry, especially the lead roles played by Zack Levy (good looking and funny) and Yvonne Strahovski (the talented Australian beauty import) and and that was the main key for the 1st season success, yes like others I surely am looking forward to catch the next season and may more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure To Be A Hit!!!","review":"This show will be the next big hit for NBC.

I think that many people will like this show if they were to give it a chance.The Blu-ray is a step up from the DVD. The picture is clear and the sound is great. One thing I must note is that the show is very grainy. I've read that this is because of the quality of camera's used to record the show. Although season 2 will most likely look better, this is the best season 1 will look. Some scenes look better than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Entertaining!","review":"Chuck is one of our favorite shows. It's laugh out loud funny, consistently entertaining, smart, full of action and suspense, and well written. The actors are perfect in their roles and a pleasure to watch.I enjoy that it's NOT predictable, and that the twists can be hilarious or even dramatic and moving. This show is what television should be.It's relatively clean as well, which we appreciate. Bottom line: I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Series Going in My Opinion","review":"Love this show, wasn't sure about it from the previews, but once I started I was hooked. The characters are great and the relationships have depth to them. This is one of those shows that takes time to develop, and a little more heart and depth to it than what most people like to deal with. It's probably not a show you can just jump into a season or two late. My recommendation is to get the first season DVD or Blu Ray and catch the fever.I really hope this show continues. It always seems to be on the ratings bubble. When shows like Two and a Half Men blow shows like this away I fear for my country. I have enjoyed watching the series from Season one on. I have all three seasons now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"Usually when I like a television series, I tend to nit pick the show to the point where it almost becomes obsessive. Something happened with Chuck, I was able to let go and suspend belief and enjoy an hour of TV. This series is witty, sarcastic, and plain good fun. Some of the fighting sequences are excellent, the actors have great chemistry, and the plots are unrealistic but exuberant and creative. This is an enthusiastic series that allows the audience to sit back and be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series ever!","review":"I have not watched a TV series in decades, but was urged to watch Chuck and decided to do so.

I am able to obtain a complete history without relying on interpreters. It has chapters on the most common presenting complaints in Pediatrics. This book helps me tremendously to communicate with my patients. It is complete, easy to use and to the point. I highly recommend it to all health care providers who care for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book","review":"I purchased this book while taking a medical Spanish course and I plan to keep it to flip through regularly as a refresher if I do not end up using Spanish on a daily basis. This book allowed me to quickly find key phrases to communicate with patients (ex: do you have a fever, how did you take his temperature, etc. ). It is appropriate for beginners as it includes phonetic pronunciations. The only disadvantage is that there is no glossary at the back, so you must be familiar with the lay out of the book to quickly reference phrases. I would recommend this book to any practicing or training pediatrician who wants to improve communication with their Hispanic patients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Dated and in Need of an Update","review":"I have purchased this and already used it in Mexico.

So if you're traveling in the more populated areas, it's great. But once you turn off 307 south of Playa, there's not much detail. It also listed accurate information for finding gas stations, hotels, etc.I understand the former version of this map software was pretty useless, but the 2010 version proved to be useful.

Bourdieu attempts to explain and militate against a tendency to allow power to legitimate itself--exposing a dangerous habit of seeing the world of power economics as a natural state rather than the product of an incredibly (and at times, unconciously) manipulative ruling class.

The only referrence to the British superstars is the use of keyboards , but Mystic Circle have managed to use them in a not annoying way . You will mostly hear Synthie strings and choirs .

The insert itself has very small openings and clog easily with loose tea herbs, which makes the straining a longer process. Also, the infuser insert has such a small edge and sits tightly on the cup, which makes it difficult to grab and hold. It is also very hot because of the tea. Last but not least, the insert doesn't fit on any other mug I have, which was the main reason for me to purchase the item. There are others which do fulfill those practical specs.However, if you can overlook all those design flaws, this is the tea infuser for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as Advertised","review":"I am more than satisfied with this mug!

I was going to buy two, but I decided to start with one and see if I liked it. I will be ordering another one. The glass is thin, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.

For starters, I've always enjoyed drinking tea out of glass as opposed to ceramic, I feel it lends a certain clarity to the tea. Second, watching the loose-leaf herbs float around in the infuser after you've poured water in brings the meditative element of enjoying tea to a higher level. It's just so beautiful, especially if you've incorporated 2 or 3 different types of colorful herbs. Lastly, I love that the lid not only keeps the tea hot while steeping but is also the perfect size upside down for holding the infuser once you've finished steeping.When I first received the mug, I was scared to pour boiling water in it, it just seemed too delicate. After 2 months of regular usage, however, the hesitation has dissipated and now I eagerly look forward to every cup with abandon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking but terrible quality","review":"This glass jar looks beautiful.

I like that it is all glass, so when I do use the diffuser, there is no aluminum/plastic in contact with the hot beverage. It's easy to hand wash, too.

The plot was predictable and the characters wooden. There was not the characer develpoement seen in earlier books. Some scenes were unlikely, even silly. This particularly applied to the dog catching episode. Ms Brockmann seemed more intent on mentioning the characters of previous books than developing a convincing story in this one. Even the short story in the rear was not up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"I linked all of the main characters a lot and enjoyed the plot. Although she tends to beat you over the head with it, I really like how Brockmann writes strong and relatively non-cliched non-white characters! Lindsay - a 100lb Asian who can more than handle herself - is wonderful, but the scene in the bar just drags on too long to be believable. Overall though, very well done. And certainly better done all the other romance novelists that - when they do have people of color in their stories - keep them peripheral, like literally in the kitchen, or using what the author thinks is typical \\"urban\\" language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best album of 1990","review":"This was the last cd that I could get my hands on from Kylie mainly cause of her 2nd album not being that big of a hit in the US so they stopped selling her here. This was a fantastic cd probably her most well put together album with PWL Label. Loved it then and still loving it now! Must Have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO IN RHYTHM","review":"I just got this cd and it really is not what I thought it would be based on the other reviews. The people who wrote these songs need to be shot!! They are terrible. They totally understate Kylie's singing ability and really don't showcase her as an artist. These songs a only great when preformed live in concert. Only get this album if you need to finish your Kylie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Disco to Gay Club, Girl-Next-Door to SexKylie","review":"3rd Album from PWL. It was Better The Devil You Know (1st single from this album) which moved Minogue from school disco to gay club. Step Back In Time, What Do I Have To Do, and Shocked are also unrepeatable hot tracks from PWL. The conflict between Waterman and Minogue resulted in allowing her to write 4 songs with American producers known for Madonna, Paula Abdul and Martica. Rhythm Of Love is full of great dance tunes and the most loved Kylie album from PWL among Kylie fans. This album also changed the image of Minogue from girl-next-door to media-name SexKylie: The Australian movie Priscilla - Queen of the Desert was originally written about male Kylie impersonaters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a '30s movie.","review":"This movie shows Wayne at his \\"B-movie\\" best, but to the average Wayne fan, this unrealistic movie (in plot and action) is just a waste of time and money. On the other hand, it does show Wayne as a character who nobody knows about, and has an excellent and surprising ending that will get everybody who has not already seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE: Colorized version!","review":"Buyers beware that this is a colorized version of \\"Blue Steel\\" & nowhere in the www.Amazon.com description does it mention this fact! If you're like me & like many others fans of old movies, you'll be highly disappointed to find that this tape is not in the original B&W. That may be OK for some viewers, but it's not OK for me, & at the very least, www.Amazon.com should have mentioned this in the description of the movie. There's no way I would have bought it if I had known that it was colorized. My rating of 1* is not for the quality of this good John Wayne movie; my rating was given for the colorization of the movie. If you're looking for a green-faced John Wayne, this is the movie to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Basic","review":"Be aware that when the author uses 'basic' in the title she really means it.

I would buy a different book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Book, Old Problem","review":"Finally someone has written a book that seems to understand the problems that parents and kids have dealing with ADD. She knows that medication is not the only answer to ADD and in fact, bravely offers better solutions by way of food, nutrition, sleep, and PATIENCE...all things that can be done without chemical interventions and will bring about lasting life changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect guide for ADHD conspiracy theorists","review":"This is the ideal book for people who'd like to tell others that their pediatrician or child study team has it all wrong because their kid actually has heavy metal poisoning, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, bad nutrition, ineffective parenting, creative genius, or an alternative learning style.The author writes well and does offer some useful suggestions in child behavior management. However, she appears to have done only the minimal research into ADHD that is required to take snappy pot shots (often in the form of call-outs) at anything that passes for accepted wisdom in this field.No doubt there is room for debate, but there are many much more informative, more balanced resources if you are genuinely interested in helping a child diagnosed with ADHD. If, on the other hand, you want at all costs to avoid accepted medical treatment -- or are trying to undermine someone else's attempts to help a child -- this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"I have read the majority of this particular book, and it is definitely biased against medication use in children. The author does provide some useful alternatives for managing symptoms; however, I am concerned about the multiple opinions in the book that are presented as 'facts.' I have gleaned some useful information from this book, but have decided that I need to purchase an additional, more objective resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased against medication","review":"I purchased this book because I found \\"The Everything Parent's Guide to Children with Dyslexia\\" very useful and unbiased. However, this book was written by a different author and clearly biased against medication. I agree that medicating children should be a last resort, however, when I read on page 141 that this author says that \\"Ritalin has been called 'a chemical lobotomy' because the results are similar\\" to surgical lobotomy, I lost faith in her objectivity. If you want a book to support your decision to not medicate, this book is for you. If you want an objective analysis of the alternatives, go somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!!!","review":"I really regret buying this. It's not worth owning. Poor picture and sound quality (I could have lived with this if the content was worth while). Very superficial content. I have a large number of instructional martial arts videos and this is one of the worst. Goes over a few kicks and punches nothing u wouldn't get in your first day or two of a real class is covered. I realize this is a begginers intro video but, there are many (too many) better choices out there. The highlight was the mediocer kick boxing matches at the end of the video. They were mildy interesting or I would only have given 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOPPY MUSIC, POOR SOUND QUALITY","review":"I was living in the Detroit area when Funkadelic was popular, but was not at this particular concert. About 20 years later, I bought the \\"Maggot Brain\\" CD, my only Funkadelic recording, which I would rate with 5 stars.While browsing a used record store, I came across the \\"Live in Meadowbrook\\" CD, and noticed it contained many of the tracks I liked.Unfortunately, the CD was a major disappointment. The band, for the most part, sounds scattered and fragmented. The resemblance of most of the tracks to the original studio recordings is distant. And the sound quality is such that I had to strain to hear many of the vocalizations, aside from the fact that overall, it sounded like an old reel to reel recording with little or no attempt to clean up the sound.If one is looking for a quality Funkadelic CD, they are well advised to avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?","review":"Not this! The worst Funkadelic album ever features songs which were mercifully cut short (like Free Your Mind) or excessively drawn out versions of others (like All your Goodies Are Gone). There is no groove to this album, just a painfully loud drummer who could not not be more out of place. Every song is worse than it's studio original. If you have ears which can filter out bad drums- I don't - you probably can hear some good stuff by Eddie Hazel and Bernie Worrell. But why make the effort? The Funkadelic discography is huge - no need to parse this product for the infrequent jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Something to Rave About*","review":"I heard this CD and fell in love with it. The BMPs are right up there, and you have no choice but to get up and dance! They didn't put \\"NRG\\" in the title for nothing, you know. It's full of energy and excitement. If you're a club-lover and appreciate good dance and house music, buy this CD! My personal favorites of this CD are 9pm (Til I Come)by ATB and Can't Get Enough by Soulsearcher. Don't waste any time, buy this CD!

We weren't going to use this on a car seat but we were going to hang it over the crib from a wire shelf (I know that sounds strange, but it was the perfect little device). There is no volume control, but thankfully there is a mute button for when I need my son to look and not necessarily want to listen to it. It has to be shut off manually. The songs are ncer than many of the items I had with my first son. I do wish the strap was more adjustable so it could extend further. We don't use it at the crib except during naps but I usually keep it hanging over the changing table. Because it clips you can move it around everywhere and I have used it on the car seat once or twice. It's a great little gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"little mobile on the go . . .","review":"This mobile is indeed compact and will travel well.

He used it every day until it broke when he was over 10 months old and pulled on it too much! For the price, it was the best value ever. Car trips were the greatest with this. I now give it to EVERY friend I know having a baby and they've had the same reaction I've had. I only wish it was available in more stores that offered consistent prices as compared to Amazon. I've seen the prices here range from $20 -$40. I think of this product as one of my MUST HAVE items for moms and babies!

We thought the music sounded a bit \\"tinny\\" when we got it, but the baby seems to like it anyway. She was mesmerized by the spinning black and white pictures when she was a month or two old, and tries to reach for the spinning soft toys now that she's a few months older. We've used it for several months (probably a grand total of several hours), and have not had to change the batteries yet.The only concern with this is that it is a bit heavy, and the clip and velcro don't seem like they can take the weight for long. We end up holding it in front of or above her instead of attaching it to the handle--this gets tiring after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After purchasing this item on Amazon i was very disappointed with is proformance. For some reason i had to replace the batteries after a week of use. I used brand new Energizers so i know it wasn't my fault for buying cheap batteries.

Cannot highly recommend this enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but really bad product","review":"This is very cute but the music doesn't work.

The protagonist wasn't very likeable, as were the other characters and the story wasn't very interesting. I couldn't get into it by 3/4 of the way through, so I just gave up.

This is pretty much how the book went. The writing style was choppy, lots of tangents. There is humor in there, but you have to dig for it. \\"I think it over Gregory Peckishly...\\" Ha!

However, The Moviegoer left me feeling depressed and it was a chore to read through to the end because of the book's slow pace. The main character struggles with the feeling that life is meaningless and seeks cheap thrills to put off his feelings of malaise. Yet, the book leaves you with the impression that the author struggled with the same feelings and never found the answer to his discontent. However, there is a God in Heaven who loves us and put us here for a purpose - to love others.

Percy tells an interesting tale about redemption through the eyes of someone going through a serious depression. The way the story is written it leaves some items open to reader interpretation and gives you space to add your own experiences. It is a fairly easy read and worth picking up. I can see why it grabbed an National Book Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American masterpiece","review":"This is the story of a man searching for a pattern in events, an understanding of himself and his surroundings. In a society where change is constant and values are not clearly set, readers are exposed to the thoughts, feelings and beliefs of a commoner who is more aware of his actions than what others credit him. Readers cannot begin to fathom how real Binx is and how much of us is in him. Although an existentialist novel, I am truly endebted to Percy for his superior way of manifesting the difficulties human beings encounter today when analyzing human existence in an unfathomable universe. If you are the \\"wonderer\\" type, you'll be delighted to experience \\"The Moviegoer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the war over yet?","review":"Jack Bolling is a soldier who comes from a long line of soldiers. Jack served in Korea, his dad died in World War II, other relatives served in World War I, some in the Civil War. The fiercest warrior of them all is Jack's Aunt Emily. She's single womanly upholding Southern Tradition and all she has to work with is Jack. Sadly Jack is still fighting his war in his mind and heart even as he successfully makes money, chases women and of course prowls movie theaters. He's damaged and can truly relate only to other's just as damaged such as his severely handicapped younger brother and his step cousin (his Aunt Emily's stepdaughter) Kate. \\"The Moviegoer\\" is finely written, dripping with Louisiana traditions and places. The book is not so much enjoyable as it is humbling. Watching Percy's troubled characters twist and turn and attempt to learn how to live around their pain isn't fun but it's rewarding, maybe even enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The early pages of this book lead the reader to believe that Binx is going to embark on a real search for meaning in life. This promises thought-provoking pages to come, but the novel quickly disintegrates into a dull collection of unimportant, disconnected, and senseless scenes. Some readers will say, \\"That's the POINT!\\", and it just may be. Nonetheless, I was sorely disappointed by this one, particularly after hearing all the hype. Reading about one's search would be great, but only if the individual has actually made some progress and learned something along the way.

I found Binx Bolling's alienation from the world a bit tiresome even though I admired the social questions that Percy poses throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but dated and the characters are a bit dull","review":"This seemed pretty weak to me overall. While Percy's prose style is definitely original, I found it next to impossible to care about the malaise of a Genteel, mid century Louisianan. Maybe this thing seemed to have a commanding vision of American life circa 1960, but its hard to read it now and not find it feeble, even impotent at times. Binx's personal crisis just feels hopelessly watered down. It sure doesn't have that sense of desperation and intense yearning which still make works by Camus and Dostoyevsky so compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Binx is cool!","review":"Binx is an extremely endearing character; his story and his \\"search\\" may not be universal (?), but they sure struck a chord with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"slowly waking up...","review":"I simply think Percy's writings are gold. This book is an amazing read that refuses to let go of you. I'm really quite surprised that there are a number of disparaging reviews here, but different strokes and all that. He really is someone you have to read, and is considered by many to be a literary giant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still here","review":"This book came out quite a while back and it's still around. The reason for this probably has more to do with the wonderful character of Binx Bolling that it does with the over-all effect of the book itself.Binx is a sort of \\"Babbitt\\" although in an entirely different setting and with a different job. He's a wonderful character study of what happens to men (whether or not they want to admit it) and I doubt some of the younger generation will be able to relate to him or sympathize.Still, the book as a whole is great and you should enjoy it even if you're not lusting after your secretary in hot and sultry New Orleans.This book should be read, along with CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES and McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"},{"rating":"2","title":"While the Alienation May Be a Given, The Poetry in this Still Sings","review":"Extremely well-written, almost poetic, book featuring a southern slacker, circa 1960, who lacks commitment to anything--women, a career, a set of values. Somehow he remains a sympathetic (if not entirely likeable) character in his attempt to come to terms with a culture that, like the weather in New Orleans (where this is set), can be stifling. The conceit of a \\"moviegoer\\" as a disengaged viewer of his world is somewhat useful, but even the author abandons it as he nears the end of the story. And the ending is less than completely satisfying, though there is some hope there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get it","review":"Maybe I'm missing something but I don't see what the fuss is about. This book is almost readable and you have to read through pages and pages of dullness to get to the few tidbits that have value. Maybe in 1961~ this book was unique and offered a fresh perspective on life, but it doesn't stand the test of time. Not for me anyway. You should have to read 220 pages before getting to the meaning. I'm not sure how this was published and I'm not sure why it won book awards. Just because something is \\"deep\\" doesn't mean its good or has value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Contrary View","review":"My book group has a real problem with this book. Instead of celebrating Walker Percy's intellectualism, we felt that the storyline was vacuous and insipid. The characters were flat and seemed self absorbed and separated from the human condition. We couldn't feel anything for these people. Binx was totally devoid of passion, a disappointment to eager readers. Our dislike for the book did inspire a lot of discussion in search of any merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Your Mind May Wander","review":"It's interesting how some people see this as one of the great books of all times and others of us believe it was a waste of our time. Does that mean those of us who hated this book are less intelligent? I don't think so. I've read many \\"deep\\" books and found much to comtemplate. But I just couldn't keep my mind on \\"The Moviegoer\\" or find a reason to care about his plight.If my book club always chose books like this, I'd quit. I have so many other books I really want to read. It distresses me to put those aside and trudge through ones such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"Something about this book rubbed me the wrong way.

This book is very slow paced and I lost interest very quickly.When Binx talked about his search in the beginning I was interested on where this would lead but afterwards there really wasn't any more mentions of his search.

Of course she lost one slipper right away.. So I ordered the same size through Capezio. When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe! That's how large it was. So I figured \\"okay, different company, maybe different fit\\" and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller. Same thing. Actually nearly no difference between the two. They really need to advise people of their fit. Which foot measurement equals each shoe size. I'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair.

Bloch brand kids ballet shoes are to be sized up 1/2 size. (If you order adult shoes, they're often sized down 2 or 3 sizes...) Any dancewear store will have this information, but unfortunately Amazon doesn't provide this tidbit, so it can be quite confusing as to what size to order. I hope this helps any future purchasers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"go two sizes up!","review":"I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class, and I bought 1 size bigger just in case.

I was very close to ordering a half size or a size up but after some research I just ordered her street shoe size and they fit. Some say that it depends on the Capezio model and that may be true. But for the Daisy 205, my daughter is a size 9 street shoe and I bought these in a 9M and they fit. They don't have much growing room but from what I read ballet shoes are not supposed to be too big. I was worried though so instead of saving $4 by ordering here on Amazon and being stuck with a size that doesn't fit, I ordered elsewhere, paid a few dollars more, but had free return shipping if they didn't fit. That would be my suggestion if you are worried about sizing. I have a feeling it will cost more than $4 to return ship them if they don't fit. I hope this helps others."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shoe for the price","review":"Great shoe for my daughter's summer ballet class.

I measured my daughter's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested. Her foot measures a little less than 6\\", which would be between size 8 and 8.5. I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still didn't fit!! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon. The shoes itself only measure 5.75\\" which is not what the sizing info states for size 9. Her big toes are curled up inside.

I was a little nervous ordering shoes without having her try them on first but I went by the size chart that was provided. According to that, I was supposed to order an 8, however they are a bit small. I would recommend going up a half size from what is suggested on the size chart. They will work in the short term but I will be ordering at least a half size up if not a full size very soon.

However I did make a right decision to buy it Narrow because its \\"Narrow\\" is equal to \\"Medium\\" of regular shoes. I'll keep this Capezio for later use.

You could say this means \\"they run true to size,\\" but that's highly misleading, as ballet shoes normally run a size or so small. To repeat: they run true to *street* size, not normal ballet shoe size--at least in size 2.5.

A pretty set ,but I was not impressed with the rapping, it was that of a slacker."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legendary Bukky Leo","review":"The compulsive grooves on these great Afrobeat tracks are great for dancing!Also well worth listening to - great album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"I just received these in the mail today. I put them on and am blown away by the sound that comes out of these. Some reviews say that they are not bassy enough. That is a VERY VERY untrue statement. Most people want there to be tons of bass... so the people that are claiming that need a headphone that boost the bass. These headphones give you the true tone of what ever you are listening to. I DJ a bit, and i write electronica/trance music these are the best headphones I have ever used. I also play in a few different bands and i have used various types of headphones. If you are thinking about getting these just go ahead and by them. Best quality ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Quality Control Lacking","review":"These are a great set of headphones but a little finicky. On my set, the 3.5mm plug isn't wired particularly well so I end up having to wiggle the very end of the plug to get stereo. After that, they sound great. I'll probably have to have the end reterminated. Other than that, they are a great set of cans. Very comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. Being a college student, I find myself reaching for them a lot either when I need to drown out the background noise of the dorm or when my roommate needs to study. I can wear them for a couple hours and be fine. Even with no equalization (which is my preference) these are very accurate. Treat these headphones well and they will pleasure your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!","review":"Garth Ennis does it agian! Strange apocolyptic western story,at first a bit suprizing, but with a great ending! I love you Garth Ennis! If you love him too, you'll dig this. Maybe not as brutal as The boys, or as much of a masterpeice as Preacher, but good ole' comic book fun for anyone that needs some interesting entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere between Judge Dredd and Punisher","review":"I truly enjoyed Punisher Max and was checking out earlier Ennis stuff. The problem is that one has to lower expectations here. This is more like Punisher/Dillon, with dark humor. Except that it doesn't quite come off as humor. More like slapsthick. For example, the guy who mated with a mutated organism and is now bloated like a furball, what's funny about that? Even in an imaginary fantasy-filled world, this imagery doesn't make sense as all other protagonists have normal shaped phenotypes. The humor is more like dank humor, stale, as the captain tosses out his followers from the doomed plane in order to save his own skin. Or the fact that the pilgrim is a cannibal, and he induces the others to feast like him when the chips are down. You could see that coming a mile away.Perhaps it is difficult to judge this issue fairly, coming as one did from Punisher Max. One goes back to the source, and finds the water tepid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story line sucks","review":"Again comics are going over the top with their story lines.

If you like rock music then buy this album!Steve Stevens is awesome on this album, he a real technical wizard and plays some amazing solos.

I love the morals, and the thought for others which come across in these programmes, and they can still bring a tear to the eye.

Love the series, was expecting a solid DVD treatment based on the look of the packaging, but there are too many problems. For example: abrupt cuts between scenes, no opening credits for each episode (as noted elsewhere, every LHOTP episode had episode-specific cast-of-characters details in the opening credits--try to find the names of the guest stars on these DVDs!), inconsistent picture quality, etc. Still happy that I have a few seasons on DVD now ... but I'll be upset if one day soon a new distributor releases an excellent (i.e. the standard quality DVD viewers have come to expect) version of LHOTP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat disappointed but still happy","review":"I highly recommend this series but as a true fan I have to complain about a few things. The box shows a picture of bandit when he was not in season 2. The episodes \\"Remember Me\\" are not restored and looked terrible next to the other restored episodes. Sometimes the scenes are cut too quickly and you miss a couple of seconds. The collecotr's box is not user firendly-you have to unfold it out all the way to get the disc you want-I think after time the box could wear out from this. I think the producers should have spent a little extra time with these releases-they seem kind of thrown together. Its still wonderful to have all the episodes on DVD! Hopefully they will release all the seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House Dreamset","review":"I bought this to use in my classroom to show my kids what life was like on the frontier.

However, after just attempting to watch the first dvd, the sound quality is HORRIBLE!! We cranked the volume to as high as it would go and still couldn't hear the characters' voices. Then without warning, the audio would kick back in and the sound would be normal. Thought it could be our TV but no other dvds or TV shows have this issue...ONLY these dvds. Realized then the last set we bought from LHOTP(season 1) had the same audio issues. Hopefully some other company produces this on DVD with better sound quality because this is WORTHLESS if you can't hear anything!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Condition","review":"The DVD's were good until we got to the last one and it skips.I will not order from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"Sorry, I can't offer a review of this product.

I especially enjoyed the vignette on the role and influence that \\"King Kenny\\" Roberts had on the Euro-centric organizational power structure.The one short-coming which perhaps Dennis Noyes will address for his NEXT book would be maps for all the circuits where GP motorcycle races have been run.This one belongs in every two-wheel enthusiast's library"},{"rating":"2","title":"For serious enthusiasts","review":"Anyone with serious interest in motocycle racing needs a reference work of impeccable quality and accuracy, and this is it. There is no point in going on at length about the excellence of this magnificent book, because it delivers satisfaction at every level, from the quality of its contributors (Dennis Noyes, Michael Scott, et al), the brilliance of its photography (Malcolm Bryan, Gold & Goose, etc.) and the completeness of its historical record, not only in describing the technical trajectory of race-bike development and rider accomplishment in all relevant classes, including sidercar, but in the vital statistics that record the results. It's all here, rendered at the highest levels of journalism and publishing.Hazelton's annual Motocourse journals on motoGP racing are terrific, but somewhat costly, but this wrapup of the entire post-WWII record of GP motorcycle racing does it all. No enthusiast should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Fiction","review":"This is a great teacher resource, I have used some of the ideas and writing prompts in it with 9th Grade English students.

I would have liked more insight to the reasons why this woman stayed with her husband for so long and why none of her devoted family or friends were willing to help her children in their time of need. The 'stayed for the kids' sake' type of explanations are hollow. That man was doing nothing good for the kids as everyone knew, he wasn't supporting the family financially-quite the opposite, and everyone watched the horrible tragedy play out in slow motion.And why give fictitous names for the children of the deceased woman only to show a picture of her headstone with their real names on it?Disappointing read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner From Diane","review":"This book lives up to her earlier works.

In this book, Gene Zirkel clearly spells out in a logical sequence what it takes to change our self image, and why that alone is enough to effect true, lasting change in our behavior.

Shyamalan deserves to be imprisoned for subjecting the public to this crap. Trust me. This goes beyond bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, just wow","review":"This was by far the worst film of the summer. I've seen worse, aka \\"The Bunker\\", but none the less this was bad. Everything leading up to this movie was misleading. I walked into the theater thinking it was going to be a bad movie. Who called it? This crazy kid did. It started off gay enough and it was all downhill from there. It seemed like it would never end. It wasn't scary, it was wasn't suspensful, it wasn't even worth the $4.50, by the way I want my money back. Even the \\"monster\\", really a retard, seriously a mentally hadicaped person employed to play the roll of scaring people into staying in the village. The monster itself looked like a mutated porkypine. What was I watching, Teenage Mutant Nija Turtles? Not all parts of this movie were that bad. The lighting was second to none, and the acting was ok. All in all, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"The only thing cool about this movie was the visuals. Other than that total crap. Not one little bit scary, the plot was horrible, the ending was stupid. Worst movie I've seen in a really long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I COULD RATE IT LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD. HORRIBLE!!!!!","review":"I can't even begin to say how utterly horrendous, STUPID, and pitifully plotted this movie was. The ending is one of the dumbest in the history of movies. I am being completely honest when I say DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CR*P. The studio - and Shamalyan - dupe you into believing it is scary when it is NOT ONE IOTA SCARY. MORONIC is the only word that will come to mind at the end of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another M. Night Shyamalan disaster","review":"A talented cast do their best, but are undone by the ultimate auteur of our age, M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a \\"surprise\\" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire. At the ends of the spectrum are those whose work I both admire and like and those whose work I neither admire nor like. Shyamalan is in this latter group.If you like any other of his films, you're probable slow enough to like this one. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"We have the magic rocks\\"","review":"I think most people who have seen this would agree that M. Night Syamalan does a great job with the monsters. They are creepy, and later in the film a girl encounters a creature in a scene that made me jump.The problem with this film is the fact that it is hard to take it seriously. They need a cure for this guy, so they send a blind girl to get it. An old lady tells the guy that he is an idiot for sending his blind daughter into the forest, yet he tries to tell the old lady the her bravery outweighs her blindness. And while the blind girl traverses the forest, she doesn't hit any trees. For some reason she is able to navigate the forest perfectly, even to the point of remembering where things were. It is said that when you lose a sense, your other senses become stronger. Still, it is too unbelievable, which ruins the creepy atmosphere.If you want a creepy film, hit up M. Night Shyamalan's Sixth Sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pace, man, it's all about the pace...","review":"The movie is not a bad movie at all. Its idea is clever (no spoils here), I particularly always cheer for a M. Night Shayamalan project, because the guy is really charismatic, enthusiastic, young and competent about his job (check the extras on this DVD to see what I mean).The problem with THE VILLAGE is its atrociously slow pace. The movie weights over you like a Jumbo 747, the traditional M. Night subtle ways are not here: it's simply slow... I'm not an action movie freak, that's not the point. I undertood the mesages, the drama, etc, But the movie is simply boring at more than two thirds of its duration. It's the kin of movie that has two hours but it seems like four and, because of that, it's a movie you will probably never watch it a second time, even if you like it moderately.Enjoy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"When I seen this I had already known that critics hated this film, but i decided to give it a chance, I mean how bad could an M. Night Shyamalan movie be? Needless to say, i was dissapointed with this movie. The acting is good, as it always is with his movies, the score was amazing. Thats all thats good in this film. The shock value is very low, i wasnt scared at all, the writing was awful, and the \\"twist ending\\" wasnt as shocking as the one in the sixth sense. I really hope his next movie is much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will fall asleep...","review":"and if you don't you must have nothing else to do with your time. I can sum this movie up in one word. Borrrrinnngg. SO boring in fact that about 30 minutes into it i just said forget it and turned it in the next day. What really kept annoying me about this movie is the whole \\"those we do not speak of\\" thing . \\"Those we do not speak of\\" but are having a council meeting concerning them. Also i understand that the director won't show the monster for sometime in his movies (like in signs) but I got so bored with this movie that I turned it off before I even saw it (if there is one) and was then too sleepy to fast foward. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"I can't even express how much I hated this film. The only good thing I have to say about this movie is that Bryce Dallas Howard did turn in quite a good performance, despite what seemed like a phoned-in effort from director Shyamalan. It was so bad, they may as well have had Stevie Wonder direct (no offense Stevie). I think that Shyamalan's formula is definately wearing thin, and I'm just sick of it. Definately the most boring movie I have ever sat through. I guess I just kept thinking that Shyamalan would pull it off in the end, which he did not. This movie was like an experiment in bad film making. I wouldn't suggest viewing this movie, unless it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Same Old Stuff","review":"I won't go into all the plot spoilers of this movie, and stuff that doesn't make sense to me because people always say \\"I am missing the point\\" and \\"You don't see Shyamalans deeper message.\\" What I will say is Shyamalan needs to either quit making movies, stop making movies with predictable twists now that he has made the same movie 5 times in a row, or stop stealing other peoples stories and making them suck.Check out Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix if you don't know what I'm talking about. She might as well have her name added to the credits.Sixth Sense was good, it got me. I liked Unbreakable, maybe cause I was still new to Shyamalans plot twists, but really I just enjoyed it. Signs was terrible, perhaps my least favorite movie of all time. Then there is The Village which is just as bad and stolen from another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING","review":"PLEASE M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN DO NOT PROMOTE A HORROR MOVIE TO THE PUBLIC JUST TO SELL TICKETS THE FIRST WEEK. THIS MOVIE WILL BOMB AFTER THE WORD GETS OUT OF JUST HOW PATHETIC THIS FILM IS. M.NIGHT SHOULD BE OFFERING A REFUND TO ANYONE WITH A TICKET STUB. WARNING YOU HEARD IT HERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"A sub-standard, unconvincing and just plain un-scary suspense film. As others have noted, the \\"twist\\" ending can be seen from miles away. In retrospect , this is only the first nail in Shyamalan's coffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I thought this film was ridiculous! I was excited to see it when it came out so I went to the cinema. I was so mad when I left because it was not what they put it out to be. Im kinda scared to see his new movie coming out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Absolutely one of the most boring movies I ever watched in my life.There are hardly any scenes that deserve to be named scary and the disappointing plot of the movie is handed over to quickly.Although for me that was a relieve really, as I could switch off the movie immediately after that. The characters are dull, but then again, so is the entire movie. This should have been an episode of Twilight Zone or so, but not a complete movie. I hope this was the final M. Night Shyamalan movie, because things get worse and worse. Unbreakable, Signs and The Village have hopefully by now discouraged producers to do another one!(SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd recommend to anyone who suffers from insomnia","review":"If you struggle with an inability to fall asleep or remain asleep for an adequate length of time, this movie is a potential cure. I've tried to watch it twice and was bored to sleep both times."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scariest part is how bad this movie is!","review":"Maybe I didn't let down my guard enough to enjoy this movie. I was expecting so much from Shyamalan, but this was not even close to his other works. The dialog of the villagers is supposed to be some type of Coloniel English, but does not flow from the actors' mouths, leaving the viewer not believing the performances. The twist of the movie is easy to figure out and not surprising at all when it unfolds. There is some nice tension built at differnt times in the movie, but it evaporates quickly, leaving the viewer empty-handed and out $4 for the rental. This will entertain and scare your pre-teenagers, but holds no value for adult viewers. Pass on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Stunned is right!\\"","review":"Touchstone presents a flaw with no story, no good acting, and no good characters. It's not even scary! There are no creatures, just humans dressing up, murders and it takes place in actual time! They make up this lie just because the man character, (Her Father)'s sister was raped and killed. Don't watch this! I'm warning! You! Totally not what I excpected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start, bad finish","review":"This movie started out kind of different and entertaining, but towards the end, it becomes hokey and ridiculous.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilling at all","review":"I was not on the edge of my seat one bit throughout this whole movie. I had the plot figured out before I even got to the middle of it. It is not original. They did something similar to this on the Outer Limits. One of Shyamalan's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Trailer","review":"Like 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' before it 'The Village' has a fantastic trailer but is a boring movie.I have seriuosly had more excitement watching grass grow.It certainly isn't the worst movie I have ever seen (that goes to the remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') but it is a huge letdown.The idea behind it would have made an excellent one hour episode of 'The X Files' but as a full length feature film it doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not see if you value your life?","review":"If you want to sit threw a boring two hour movie for a very predictible twist that i guessed in the first five minutes, well then i suggest this movie.The concept was decent, the monsters looked really cool but the lack of any suspense minus one two minute scene was dissapointing, but i dont mind the drama if it would have all ment something or went somewhere with it. People boo'd in the theater. They should let me make a movie. It would be better this guy. Hey Shymalan heres a twist for your next movie, dont make one, your twists suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"See It Before Its Spoiled For You!","review":"Let me preface by saying I'm a huge fan of the writer-director, but this film fell far short of expectations and I would have rather saved my money and rented it later.I was the first of anyone I knew to see The Sixth Sense and Signs. I recommended both movies to everyone, though some folks didn't like Signs (I'm guessing they didn't get the message?)\\"The Village\\" has a few messages of its own that are thought-provoking, but not enough to have me recommend visiting a theater to view this movie. The BIG advantage to viewing this particular picture sooner, will be to avoid having some jerk obliterate the ending for you.It WAS NOT scary, at all. Although, I must admit this one had the old tummy twisted in knots the entire time. If you like that sort of thing (with a so-so payoff at the end,) then this is the movie for you.Again, I would recommend seeing this soon or run the risk of having the \\"twist\\" exposed.I would rate it a solid B+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie was horrible. It was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Watching it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"The problem with this movie is the way it was promoted. One of the first cast interviews I saw was Sigourney Weaver saying how the movie was scarier than Alien and that she was having trouble sleeping at night. From that point on I could hardly wait to see The VillageSigourney Weaver was lying! as was all the hype about this movie a lie.It's too bad because it was a good movie, but because of the LIE most people are disappointed.M. Night Shyamalan could have just went with the secrecy hype and people would have liked the movie, instead as you are reading most hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising - plain and simple","review":"For all of you \\"thinkers\\" who have, in their reviews, called the rest of us idiots for \\"not getting\\" this movie, let me pose a question to you. Did you not see the previews for this movie before it was released? Do you not continue to see the ads for this movies at the DVD release? They marketed this movie as something that it IS NOT! This is not a horror movie, not a mystery, and I would barely call it a thriller. It was certainly marketed heavily as such, but it only exists for the so-called twist. Because of this, it's no wonder that most people were disappointed. Give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Well developed story line, excellent characters you can relate to. Imagery is superb as is the typical for M. Night Shamalian. I know a few who were disappointed with the twist but i thought it was really great. A treat for the soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mismarketed no doubt, but great in it's own right","review":"I cant really give the review I want without spoiling the surprise, but this was a wonderful movie. I was spared because I heard the not scary hype prior too seeing it. Those of you that didn't like it need to go rent some no brainer movies. Thats not an insult to your intelligence, but dont watch Night's movies if you dont want to think. This is second to only Sixth Sense in his catalog. Think about it. If it could be done how wonderful it could be. No influence from the ugly world that some places have become. Many things take sacrifice, but I'm not going to play the ethics card, afterall it is just a movie, and very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden Color","review":"Well, what can I say... This movie went past my expectations!!! Granite, I knew it would be kind of slow in some parts because of the romance, but the suspence scenes MORE than make up for it... This movie was just plain SCARY, and I honestly have no idea what all the flack about the movie is!!! The only reason this movie gets 4 stars instead of 5, is because we never found out what Luciuos's color was(for those who have seen this movie, Ivy talks about how in her eyes, she sees Lucious in a certain color)... However, I have a feeling that the color was red, and the reason Ivy didnt tell him that, was because Red was the forbidden color, and musn't be seen... So, if your looking for a good jump-out-of-your-seat thriller, THE VILLAGE is the way to go..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin line between genius and insanity","review":"To have a mind like M. Night Shyamalan's, is like having a temper like NBA star Ron Artest's (Indiana Pacer's Brawl). You never know what to expect. Not to say that the film was anything less than excellent. When I watch movies, I judge them based upon Variety, Creativity, Plain acting ability, Storyline, amongst a few. Does it take me to an alternate world that I am completely captivated in. If it is the guessing game type, does it keep me guessing? Does the action have me at the edge of my seat? Is it original? Most of all, is the movie believable? If I were to put myself in the same situation, would I do the same thing? Would I believe or think the same way? Does the movie grab me. In M. Nigh Shyamalan's The Village, he does all of those things. Regardless of how much I did or did not like it, I consider the film a SHOCKER!! A definite \\"Must-see\\". A \\"Must-Own\\" DVD. Maybe the craziest, but most brilliant twist I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie and No Nightmares!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie!! It was suspensefull with no horror to freak me out later. I thought it was well acted and well done overall. It kept me on the edge of my seat and the twist was great! I understand the disappointment someone would feel for not receiving what the trailers implied, but I thought it was GREAT to have a movie that relied on good acting and a great plot instead of foul language, sex, blood and special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent acting, script, concept, not scary one bit","review":"The acting was great, the lighting and mood was superb, but what happened to the scary aspect of a horror film? There wasn't one single scene in this movie that was scary. You could tell a lot of thinking went into the plot movement of the story, but unless great dialogue and acting (the kind of movie that belongs more in romance or drama) is your thing... Good movie, bad horror film, but since that is what it was supposed to be, I have no choice but to grade it thus. Looking for a good scare? Don't visit the Village."},{"rating":"2","title":"the village","review":"great movie. like the suspence of the plot. would suggest this movie to all my friend. keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I thought this movie was well done! I love suspenseful thrillers, and would recommend this movie to anyone who does as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be a better movie!! Much better!!","review":"The subject matter is great, but quite bad handle. And i mean that this movie could be an exciting movie but it wasn't.It's a boring movie. Lack of suspense over the 40 min, and the rest was pretty predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, dramatic movie sprinkled with suspense","review":"I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy.The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story.The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace.But still a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome To The Twilight Zone","review":"With all the well known great actors in this film, I expected better. It seemed like an overlong, overblown Twilight Zone episode. I guessed the ending when the Ivy's father shown what was in the shed he taken her to."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. Night just keeps giving great movies","review":"I love this movie! M. Night is my favorite director and I was not disapointed. The cast did a great job in their performance and the concept was very unique. It kept me in suspense all the way to the end. And I always love to see how M. Night gives his appearance and he did a great job in this one. I recommend this movie to fans of M. Night but not to anyone that expects to be scared the whole movie-it's not a horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"This movie is definitely worth a watch. Although it starts slow and does not really add anything to the viewer's knowledge till it's half over, it makes up for it all in the end. The twist is not thin by any definition of the word... only the few who do not understand the end are the ones to call it thin. But in that case the million dollar question arises: how could anybody be so dumb? The end is absolutely clear... unless you have an underdeveloped brain.The latter half of the movie is very gripping and pays off well for the patience which the audience shows in the first half.The most remarkable feature of Shyamalan's movies is, that unlike other horror movies, they are not stuffed with scary scenes. Instead, he invites the audience to think about the mystery... about what the theme is. Also, the hidden message in the movie makes an extremely strong impact.So if conventional gimmicks rather than involving intelligent direction attract you to a movie, this one is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It!","review":"I know that this movie has a lot of bad reviews because many people did not like the ending. But I did. Though I kind of figured out some of it the first time a creature makes its appearence, I had no problem with it.The acting is first-rate! The movie seems to flow very well. It never seemed to get boring. There is some nice comic relief such as when a group of youths play \\"chicken\\" against the creatures by going into the woods and seeing how long they can try to attract the creatures before chickening out."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Can't All Be winners","review":"I am very dissapointed with this movie. The Trailers made it look like it was supposed to be scary, but it wasn't. A big let-down for me because all his other flims were good and suspencefull. This one was long winded and boring. The movie kind of made the people in the village look like Cowards who cant accept what life has delt them. So i just hope that his next movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Do Proud Men Die...","review":"Clearly Shyamalan was going for a movie more \\"Signs\\" than Signs itself was: upping the rural factor, putting the adept Joaquin Phoenix in a bigger role, and changing the aliens (I'm not making this up) to hooded porcupine walruses.Missing, however, is the originality, humor, and suspense of \\"Signs,\\" or \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (I haven't seen \\"Unbreakable\\"). Instead we've got an overbearingly preachy preacher/teacher (William Hurt) and just a generally goofy story. Even Shyamalan's trademark cameo is annoying; we see the back of his head and a faint reflection on a refrigerator (ooh, who is it?)I saw this one pretty late at night; I was falling asleep in the first half hour, but did my best to stay up, thinking it would pick up. Nope.Two stars for James Newton Howard's often beautiful score and the refreshing romance between the quietly powerful Phoenix and the lovely Bryce Dallas Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOO!!!","review":"Boos over powered the ending credits in the opening night veiwing of M. Night Shymalan's latest flop. Shymalan should invest in a career of advertising and get out of the movie business. Sixth Sense was his best. The Words of New Found Glory, \\"Its all downhill from here.\\" Are synomonous with the Career of Mr. Shymalan. The advertised thriller was a boring, stupid, waste of my time and money. I often think of doing as the South Park kids and trcking down the maniacal Shymalan and requesting my money back. I strongly advise you to change your plans if you plan on going to see The Village."},{"rating":"1","title":"M.Night's REALLY gotta improve on his \\"thrillers.\\"","review":"It was worse than I expected. The only good parts were the village invasion and the woods. But the others were just plain boring. \\"The Village\\" never grabbed my attention, nor did it excite me. This is the 2nd film where M.Night disappoints me. The only part that got me A LITTLE grabbed was the end. The forest scenes were pretty thrilling, and knowing that the year was really 2000. To recap it all, anyone who's bored out of their minds could watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent but Don't buy","review":"This movie is good only once. The first time you watch it has alot of suspense and mystery but once it's over it's not worth watching again. Rent this one; you'll like it but I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I actually rented this movie with fairly high expectations which may me part of why I only gave it a two. The plot seemed severely dragged out, almost as if they needed to meet a length requirement. The \\"twist\\" was not a surprise at all, if you're looking for something similar to the likes of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" you will most likely be disappointed.Apparently others found this movie enjoyable but I regretted watching it the minute it ended. I didn't have any problems with the acting or camera work which is the only reason I didn't give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"So I got this movie thinking hey Shyamalan's other movies are pretty good. After watching it (trying to stay awake from the long played out acting) I wanted to launch my shoe at the tv. This movie could possibly be the most dissapointing movie I have ever seen. I will not ruin the ending. I will let the movie do that for you!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so scary about this movie?","review":"In my opinion I didn't think it was scary at all. It was more of a romance movie than a scary movie. Maybe if there was a book out of The Village I would think it's scary but the movie didn't scare me at all. Sorry but that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if I Were Still Pre-Adolescent...","review":"...I might find the \\"twist\\" (and I use that term very lightly) ending \\"neat-o cool.\\" But then again, if I were still pre-adolescent, I can't imagine that I wouldn't turn this snooze-fest off after 20 minutes and pop in \\"Spider-Man 2\\" or my Nintendo. Honestly, did anyone (actors, studio heads, anybody) actually read this tripe before commiting to it? Why does this man get the greenlight to make such full-length idiocies? (This is the 2nd dumbest film ever made, \\"Signs\\" being the 1st.) There's maybe enough story to fill a half-hour Twilight Zone episode, but it's dragged out to interminable length with some of the most stilted, God-awful dialogue you'll ever hear anywhere. There are some nice performances here, but \\"The Village\\" is a mighty long, hard slog for a ridiculous non-payoff that's obvious many a mile off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary","review":"Actually, this movie is not a horror film. The 'creatures they do not speak of' are actually made up by the \\"elders\\" to keep the people living in the village, not doubting anything at all. While the village lives in the 1800's, the real world is actually going on outside of this protected area, living in the present time. Turns out the elders wanted to escape a crime-ridden real life and live their lives in isolation, pretending it really is 1890. Not scary at all, and very predictible plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imminently predictable.","review":"Come on -- I had the whole premise figured out within 20-30 minutes. Then I sat there as my predictions unfolded before me.Pretty lousy acting, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really a horror movie?","review":"When i saw the preview of this movie, my first thoughts were creatures in the woods, how awesome, but now after i've watched it, I feel like the movie was a waste of time, to me it was a more of a romance story then a horror movie, and to find out the truth about the monsters made the movie more boring and dull. I simply would not recommend this movie because of these reasons"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Was Sucked !!!","review":"This movie was BORING , all along you knew there was no real threat to the village, but for some un-known reason it kept you hangin' till the end.

I'd managed to avoid hearing what the twist was until actually viewing it; obviously the movie would be a lot less fun if you knew what was going to happen. And while I did more or less figure out what was going on, I was still glued to my seat and scared silly. M. Night knows how to build tension and keep it going for sustained periods. IMHO, The Village is a *lot* better than critics gave it credit for, and definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it without any expectations","review":"This movie was a victim of over-hype. Everyone seems to be looking for the next \\"exorcist\\". This is not a horror movie in the true sense of the genre, but is more of a creepy thriller that keeps one's interest and keeps you guessing. Watch this movie without any expectations and you should be pleasantly surprised. 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better summer movies","review":"I went into this movie expecting one thing and got something completly different. I must say that before I saw it, I saw the preview and thought to myslef how great and scary the movie looks. Then I started hearing people say it wasn't that great not scary and all.

Absolutely loved it.Acting 10/10 (especially for Bryce Dallas Howard's character)Storyline 8/10Twist 8/10 (not rocket science, but i couldn't figure it out at all up until the end: that is what I call good cinema)Cinematography 8/10 sets the mood very wellOverall 8.5/10 clever, intriguing, and sinisterly haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greaat !","review":"I finally saw this movie yesterday. I had no intention of seeing it because I had already read the reviews right here on Amazon. I usually trust amazon reviews so when my friends rented this movie I politely declined their invitation to sit through the grind. However 10 minutes later just out of curosity with still 3 star (ie bad) rating in mind. I decided to just take a peek of what was going on and remain seated till the end. Village is a good movie a gripping story, fine acting and I liked it, give it a chance you may like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insidious.","review":"\`The Village' is the most horrifying of Shyamalan's film because it is possible. At the core of the story are the lies, lies which adults perpetrate on their children. Within an insulated society, a council-a junta-fabricate an enemy, an evil-an insidious bedtime horror to keep their children safe. Safe? Safe from the outside world, of course.The film is about the perversion of reality. Lie to create safety-and obedience, but the safety is illusionary. Murder is still a real possibility, and also with this seclusion comes the penalty of not being about to cure common physical ailments. No one is allowed or able to go out to the \`towns' because of those \`that can't not be named'This story is incredibly Orwellian-even totalitarian: rule through the use of fear. \`The Village' also has a \`Shirley Jackson' feel and is reminiscent of her \`The Lottery.' And, as far as I am concerned, Shyamalan best effort so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL CRAP","review":"The Village is the worst movie I've ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan should be ashamed he ever made this after a masterpiece like the 6th Sense, Signs which was okay, and Unbreakable which was mediocre at best. But this is a disgrace, its not even scary, my friends begged me that I go to see this \\"movie\\", and during the first 20 minutes I fell asleep. Then they waked me up, I saw the scene when those creatures or whatever they are came from the forest to threaten the village and I laughed, I didn't know if it is supposed to be a joke or a scary scene. Plus nothing special happens during all the story and the main actress is plain horrible, only in the end of the movie I got that she is even blind. After it ended I wanted to kill myself for wasting 5 dollars for this piece of s**t!With no doubt one of the (if not the) worst movies ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror or comedy?","review":"I frequently have difficulty telling if this director's \\"horror\\" films are not actually comedies in reality...

Next time someone else should write the screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't waste my money seeing this at the theater","review":"Thriller or not, this is just a plain bad movie.

I remember there being much hype about it because it came from the same man that did The Sixth Sense.The hype was not well deserved. This movie actually put me to sleep; two times! Luckily, I checked it out from the library and did not waste my money on it at the video store.The \\"twist\\" at the end is great, like all of M.

There's nothing scary about the movie, unless you think the frightnening music is scary.

The only merit of this movie is the actors and setting. The story goes nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.","review":"The Village is a complete mess! Even Joaquin Phoenix and Judy Greer can't save this beyond slow, confusing, and pretentious \\"thriller\\". M. Night Shyamalan thinks he is a fantastic writer and actor but he is too lost in his arrogant head to write a true horror flick. The only film of his that I do like is The Sixth Sense, now that movie is pure brilliance. You can't create magic twice and this stinker may be even slightly better than The Lady in the Water, ugh! Hope you can get through this film without shutting down your DVD player, good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Twist - is that this movie blows dogs for quaters","review":"Wow, how I totally agree with the other people's reviews. This movie was so wrongly advertised. When i went to see this movie in the movie theater I was expecting another Signs, which I thought was an awesome movie, another great horror/thriller. Well the first third of the film seemed promising but then it all turned into crap. Sorry if i am not writing intellectual enough but this movie does not deserve it. The \\"twists\\" were crap, that is what this movie did wrong first and foremost.

I kept asking my wife like five minutes after the movie if that was it. \\"Yes, that was it\\" and Im sitting here wondering, did I miss something? Nope.Something to think about for those of you who had the misfortune of seeing this dreck-they sure did alot of talking about They Who We Do Not Speak Of, didn't they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a good movie","review":"I understand that many other folks like this kind of stuff, and I don't mean to be disrespectful of their taste, but I found this movie almost totally unwatchable. There's not much a plot, nor much suspense nor any \\"terrifying surprises and frightening twists and turns\\" that the review on the DVD package promises. The special feature: Deconstructing the Village shows that the actors seemed to have a real fun time making this movie, but I can't say I've been able to share in that fun. I would suggest that instead of buying this movie, one might consider a couple good books, instead: reading \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\", \\"The Dante Club\\", or Walter Roers' \\"The Pact\\" is simply, in my opinion, a better use of one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"May I have my 2 hours back please?","review":"Too bad there is no option to offer zero or negative stars.

Seriously this film was sooooo bad. Now i dont want to get on the bad sides of everyone who liked this film, i guess it must depend on your taste, but i thought this film really sucked. I wasnt really expecting much though, and i wasnt given much so it all worked out pretty even. The storyline was weak and lame. The 'monsters' werent scary at all and the moments that were trying to build up to being scary just didnt work. Whats up with the fact that those two people that are getting married spoke like two lines to each other and then decided to get hitched? what the!

The performances are good, Bryce esspecially deserves an oscar nom. The story is well thought out and the twist at the end is very interesting. The movie is overall great quality stuff, the sets, the story, performances, the sounds, the cinematography. I think it deserves about 8 nominations esspecially screenplay, Byrce's performance, and maybe best pic.Warning spoilers ahead.The twist at the end is brilliant but i would have preferred the creatures to have been real, and maybe a different perspective on the whole thing you know. The creatures arne't real, i thought they should have been, it would make it more intersting, then just having the elders make them up to keep everybody in a safe world. If the creatures were real they could have symbolized all the bad in the world and M. Night could make up a better conclusion, but o well the one thats there is good enough to make this M.

I find him to be a good director, but a bit of a hack when it comes to plot.This movie was probably his best plot. The \\"twist\\" of it was perhaps a bit obvious; I was suspicious of it by 3 minutes into the movie and certain of it by 30 minutes in. However, the basic premise is interesting. Handled differently, this might have actually been a really good film.The directing was something any hack with a camera could have done. The scene editing made the first half hour boring, which made the rest of the movie neither scary nor interesting. The camera angle selection also would lead one to believe an amature was shooting this film. Only one scene, where Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix discuss their feelings on a porch after a creature attack, does Shyamalan show us what he is capable of.In short, don't waste money to see this, but if it's free and you've got nothing better to do, it isn't unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"hi boring","review":"This movie was so retarded...The \\"scary things\\" in woods was this fake halloween costume that wasnt scary at all.

If you can tolerate the dialogue, which is some completely exaggerated form of old-style, colonial-era English, you will find numerous plot holes and a complete lack of imagination. This movie is a real waste of time and money, although I imagine no M. Night Shyamalan fan will believe negative reviews until they see the movie themselves. This seems like the type of plot that a pot-smoking friend would come up with late at night, not the work of the genius-creator of \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" My guess is that M.

The only interesting part of the movie was when one of them left their \\"coveted\\" village to breach \\"the other towns\\" and you saw the true time \\"difference\\".

This is a boring slow moving movie with a sorry romance story. By the time the plot twist had came i wondered why the movie was still going. I am starting to think that M. Night Shyamalan got some kind of help on the Sixth sense. This will most likely be the last M. Night Shyamalan film i watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID at ALL costs! WARNING..","review":"I'm in total agreement w/ J.Lail. This is listed as a scary movie? A bunch of freaky unnatractive pilgrim people living in a wildlife preserve while the elders of the community lead them to believe it's like that everywhere. Can you say cult?? So I'm waiting for the monsters- let's see terror! We see a hint of a scary figure. And then- what? It's all made up? No monsters? Stories made up by really mentally challenged elders to keep the village from going into the \\"woods\\". A crazy guy dresses up in costume to follow the ucky blind blonde to get medical supplies after crazy boy stabs her weird \\"boyfriend\\" THE STUPIDEST movie I have seen in a long time. No scary things. Avoid at all costs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One to avoid for horror fans","review":"Advance word on this film was that it was really, really scary. It isn't. Not even remotely. The overriding emotion provoked by the Village is - besides a lingering a sense of unease - irritation and, to be quite frank, boredom. I won't spoil the plot but then again, there's not much of a plot to spoil. Even a blob of jelly could guess what the ending is. The Village is slow-paced, but lacks the tension and bite to counter balance it. William Hurt talks real slow - even slower than usual - and the rest of the cast wonder about the set like extras out of Little House on the Prairie. When the 'twist' at the end comes it is surely one of the biggest anticlimaxes since Y2K. So, if you want scary, check out The Grudge \`cause this will most likely send you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"Ok, so when the previews started for this movie I was so excited to see it. i told everyone about it and got them wanting to see it.

The dialog was campy and the \\"suspense\\" was just stupid. M. Night Shyamalan needs to move on to a different type of movie (if he can) because the plot of The Village is so thin, it is clear that he has run out of ideas. A real film maker could have taken this story so much further - The \\"evolution\\" of the creatures would have been a thousand times more interesting. How did the village get built? Why? That would have made a really great film - instead, M. Night Shyamalan waste a super cast (how does he get these really good actors and actresses to act so poorly?)on a rip off of the Twilight Zone and the novel \\"The Giver\\". He needs to get over this \\"Written, Produced and Directed by M.

This movie starts out slow, wasn't able to hold my interest too well, and was peppered with a lot of bad acting (except for Bryce, I thought she did wonderfully) The only part that was worth it for me was the ending, and even at that, I thought it was a rather weak delivery. I wasn't expecting much when I went into this movie and I'm glad that I didn't, or I would have been let down even more. I was also rather confused with the direction of this movie, it seemed like things weren't really making sense. I went into the extras, it made a little more sense after that..but even so, I can't see myself watching this again.

This movie's a good candidate for rental but save yourself the money and agony and watch it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the suspense?","review":"Loads of people on Amazon have already stated exactly what I want to say, so I'll just give my two-cents: 'The Village' is extremely misleading, uneventful, predictable, and most of all NOT A HORROR FILM AS ADVERTISED.Lots of reviewers stated that the twist ending of this film was easy to predict within the first 10 minutes of this film. I, personally, was surprised by the ending (maybe I'm slow?), but was supremely let down by the ending. It falls flat and makes you feel stupid for spending $7.50 on a ticket.This film is not a horror film. Nor is it a suspense thriller. It is simply a romantic drama with a spooky back-drop. If I wanted to see a romantic drama, I would have walked into the next theater over and saw \\"The Notebook\\". The idea of this film could have taken off, but it crash-landed soon into flight.

The first time that thing walked (sorry, waddled) into the frame, I laughed my head off. What was that?Shyamalan tries too hard to make a surprising twist. What made his other movies great was that they dealt with small stories.Yes, in Signs aliens were taking over the world, but it wasn't about the aliens. It was about that one man who is trying to protect his family. Yes, it was very absurd, but the way it was done was very believable.I know five year olds that could have made a better \\"Village\\" than the one that was released in theaters.I hope that Shyamaln's next film will be much better.Maybe he will return from his vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like the previews!","review":"THIS DUMB MOVIE TRAILER MADE IT LOOK SCRARY!!!

I've got the ending.... now how should I fill up the other two hours.\\" And the answer is - with nothing. I guessed the twist ending along time in advance, and even if you don't it's still not very good. The movie is filled with long \\"artsy\\" shots of random things like chairs sitting in a field, and it doesn't add to the movie at all.

Then after seeing the movie I was like \\"Dude, rip off\\", yet I enjoyed the movie. Ok, many people who I know said that the movie is horrible, maybe they are expecting to see what I was expecting, a monster movie filled with gore and action. I knew something like that was not going to happen, knowing what M. Night Shyamalan is capable of. Great story and visuals, from the monster to the setting of the movie. I love all of M. Nights' movies, can't wait for M. Night's next movie \\"Lady In The Water\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit Saying it was Bad!","review":"I understand people who approached \\"The Village\\" with dispositions based on the previews, but the story was incredible. While some of the finer aspects were lacking (acting, cinematography...) the storyline was remarkable. How M. Night is still capable of creating these stories is beyond me. Initially the film starts out as stupid. The entire notion of a village secluded and hiding from scary monsters who prey on the color red is absurd, but after the \\"big secret\\" is revealed how can one still claim the film was bad? I enjoyed it. I must not conclude without mentioning the score. James Newton Howard's music and Hillary Hahn's innocent and haunting violin were astounding. If you didn't like the movie, you must have at least enjoyed the score."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Sleeper\\" Film","review":"This film was a sleeper--literally. OK, so I was really tired when I watched it, I fell asleep about 40 minutes into it, and woke up near the end. Not only did I have a good nap, but I spared myself the utter pretentiousness of this film, whose visual interest quickly wears thin in the absence of any meaningful character or plot development.While I am a huge fan of M. Night Shamalan's earlier works, I felt betrayed that this was marketed as a horror film, when the scariest thing about it is that I actually paid to rent it. Far from his best work, the film lumbers along, and upon waking, my wife brought me up to speed on the plot twists in about two sentences. Perhaps the most glaring testament to the film's ineptness is that it did not even sustain my curiosity enough to want to review what I had missed the following day. If you're into movies with silly fixations on color and dress from an indeterminate period, then you may enjoy this. I preferred my nap, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Village","review":"I found The Village to be a really good scary movie, although it doesn't take much to scare me, with a really beautiful, funny love story in it. Even though it was easy to guess the suprise, the movie had more going for it. It told the tale of people who wanted to preserve their way of life in the best way they knew how. If you don't compare this movie to all of M. Night's other works you will find yourself pleasantly suprised by this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect scary....","review":"If someone had told me before I watched The Village that it was not a scary movie, it would have been a better experience for me, but the trailor advertised it as being this incredibly scary movie and it wasn't. The story, though slow-moving, is a good one.I don't want to give away any of the plot to ruin it for people, but I just want to warn people to watch it for the story and not for the scariness."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. Knight's Best Yet","review":"With one of M. Knight's surprises toward the end of the movie, this causes you to, again in M. Knight's fashion, reflect back onvarious 'clues' that he gives you throughout, and say, \\"I should have figured that out!\\" The landscape of Southern Chester County, PA, is beautiful, and it is amazing to see (on the extra material) the work that went into building the village. The plot line and script are, in my opinion, the best yet by this talented, young writer/director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story + Bad Acting = A Really Bad Movie","review":"From the promo campaign I really wanted to see this movie.

The story of the film is shockingly weak and the suspense of the film is quickly replaced with a really stupid story of a blind girl wandering in the woods charged with saving her love. This is a film that could have been great with more work on the script. M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directs this film and it seems to me he needed someone to tell him the script was more like a half hour episode of the twilight zone that a full length film. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid. Save your money and see something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I, like most people, loved this director's previous work. \\"Signs\\" and \\"The Sixth Sense\\" are two of the best thrillers of the last five years *arguably only outranked by \\"The Ring\\"* and I expected this to be just as good if not better. Sadly I was wrong.The trailer is very misleading, however genius. By viewing the trailer alone, this movie looked fantastically creepy and horrifying....this little 19th century village isolated and surrounded by woods where something lurks....Unfortunately, the movie takes a different twist and ruins it. Don't get me wrong...I never saw the twist coming and it was definitely interesting, I was just expecting a diffrent kind of movie....the one portrayed in the trailer would've been one heck of a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I rented this movie after everyone I talked to said it was bad. I should have listened to them, it was a horrible movie. It started off interesting and I thought it had a good storyline and the after a while it fell off a cliff. The story just turned out pathetic. Once you find out what's really going on and there is no mystery anymore (which is about 40 minutes into the movie) all you want to do is hope that the movie ends, but it doesn't. It just gets worse and worse and you start questioning yourself why didn't you listen to your friends, the ones you should trust, and you continue to torment yourself because you won't turn it off and tell them how right they were. But they are right, and the movie finally ends and you want to hang yourself for watching a dumb ending to a terrible movie that you should of listened to your friends and never even rented it. I am being honest people, don't even borrow it if it's free. You will waste 2 hours of you life."},{"rating":"1","title":"His films keep getting worse","review":"M. Night Shyamalan seemed to have a promising career after \\"The Sixth Sense\\" but each film has been progressively worse than the last one.Just watched this film on cable( wont pay anymore to rent or see his films) and within the first half hour I had figured out the\\"big secret\\".I dont have a particular knack for this but M. Night Shyamalan made it too easy.All you have to do is watch enough reruns of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" to figure out his M.O.At least Rod Serling was merciful enough to condense his entertaining stories to mostly half hour episodes while M. Night Shyamalan unecessarily stretches his into hours.The only saving Grace in this film is the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard.She has a bright future ahead of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"need to fall asleep fast?","review":"about as scary as a wet sponge...ending about is shocking as two wet sponges...dialouge about as intense as three wet..., well you get the idea...out of sominex, pop this baby in the dvd player and you're on your way to snoozeville"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Village was on the same level as Gigli","review":"Where to start? Lame story, extremely predictible twist, horrible ending, awful dialouge, not scary at all, boring as hell and the list goes on. It took me the whole movie to figure out if the blind chick was really blind, and I'm still not positive, but if she was she did a horrible job. So basicly this was without a doubt, absolutly one of the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and really wish i could get my $7.00 back.

At a serious part where the creatures inside the woods were attacking, me and my friends and a ton of people in the theatures were laughing so hard, when we should have been terrified.But you still should see it just so you can be a art of discussions, but I highly recomend u wait for it to come out on dvd then rent it.This movie could have been awesome, but like i said, one thing just kills the movie, and made it seem that the 2 hours spent watching it was for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAKY GROUND","review":"M. Night Shymalan's clever plotting may have come to an end with the overly amibitious, and ultimately ridiculous The Village. Part parable, part sermon and a load of you know what, this claptrap doesn't even come close to the highs of The Sixth Sense or moments in both Unbreakable and The Signs, though with each movie, the device is wearing thin. The revelation here is Bryce Howard, who is lovely and excellent in a difficult (to put it mildly) role. The cinematography looks beautiful and the sounds provide some fun diversion, but long before this movie is over, you will be smirking in your seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad movie but its misrepresentation makes it the worst","review":"I think that this is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen many bad movies. Though I think that what makes it so bad is that its marketed in a way to make people expect something that in now way, shape or form is delivered. This aspect of it pissed me off because I grew sleepy with the film but stuck with it to see how it ended but the ending just annoyed me.

Night Shymalan stealing the idea for his movie from the book, Running out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix. This website gave me a tough time and made me feel stupid because I stressed an opinion. Well, looks like I was right! The good news is, it was announced that Margaret Peterson Haddix and her publisher are pressing charges against Shymalan and Disney. I don't know how M. Night Symalan thought he could get away with stealing the plot of the book for his screenplay. Maybe he didn't realize what a classic it is and how many people have actually read the book. Stay away from The Village and read Running Out of Time instead. You'll thank me later.P.S.

Since everyone already guessed that the monsters weren't real to begin with all we were left with to amuse ourselves were the characters and dialogue -- both of which were boring. And the plot just didn't make any sense in the end. If the elders could have easily gone and gotten the medicine -- why did they insist on sending the blind girl? What was the point of that? She was the least likely to make it to the towns and the most likely to blow their secret once she got there even if she did happen to run into a security guard. It just didn't make any logical sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain disappointed","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Shyamalan's previous movies, especially Unbreakable. But, I honestly don't know how anyone that has seen this movie can give it anything more than two stars!The pace was extremely slow. The story was obvious and very predictable.

Their motto is essentially \\"be good and the monsters won't bother you\\". As it turns out, the village is really run by a bunch of religous zealots, the movie takes place in modern times and the village was just a little west of a strip shopping center.I can't believe there was money to be made off of this.

This flick makes any Ed Wood film seem mesmerizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spooky Spooky Waste!","review":"I think this is the most slow moving stupid movie I have ever seen.

To call it slow would be kind - it was turgid, pretentious, but without the ooomph to back up those pretentions. Lots of lingering middle shots; horrid faux 19th century dialogue; bad acting; and with a twist a 10 year could've spotted 5 minutes into the movie.

Were you people watching the same movie I was? I should have known off of the back of the case. It sounds like something out of a fairytale, with an enchanted forest in all. The build up was ok but the monsters looked like something out a of low budget high schooler's english project. The movie was way too slow. I couldn't understand what year it was supposed to be because in their little village they were stuck in the 1800's but when Ivy got to the outside, the rest of the world was in 2000 something. I recommend watching something else. Anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Signs\\" is still Manoj's worst film","review":"I thought the red-robed creature was effectively chilling.

She can see just fine for the first half hour of the film (Note how EASILY and SWIFTLY she darted away from Brody and RAN across the field), THEN goes BLIND?!?!?! WHAT???? I hated the dialogue (Is there not a single contraction within this film? I do not think so). How does Joaquin Phoenix keep getting work? Like his character in Signs, ALL of his lines are spoken with a trembling over-seriousness. Most of all I hated Shyamalamadingdong's insistence on putting himself in the film yet again. Once again, the extras are few. No commentary - again. Manoj really DOES want to be like Spielberg!

Very Pathetic","review":"Obviously, I didn't really like this movie. After seeing it, I almost laughed out loud when I remembered this was supposed to be a horror movie. It wasn't the least bit scary at any parts, except for when the first sighting of \\"Those We Don't Speak Of\\" occured. Everything else, in my opinion, would probably be classified as drama. It was pretty off-the-plot, and had the most boring beginning and most trailed-off ending ever (I didn't even find out if Lucius lived or not).

He shoots scenes of the woods for like 10 min straight. Yea , like that adds atmosphere. The monster in the red cape was laughable. The ending was so predictable and done before that you ask yourself is this it? Very long tedious and boring. Uneventful , Not scary. Ridiculous dialoge. Same with the ending in M.

Now twists are good, if they are used right, as in The Sixth Sense. But this twist, and I won't give it away, is so unbelievably ridiculous that it completely negates the entire movie. There is no plausable way that this movie could work. The first two thirds of the movie is very entertaining, with good performances by Joaquin Phoenix and a very good performance by Adrien Brody, but once the monsters are out of the picture, it takes a deep dive into awfulness never to recover. The Village is definitely M. Night's worst film, and it serves as one of the worst films of 2004. Never in my life have I seen so much potential wasted by such an unbelievable movie. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind you say?","review":"I guess that they really went all out on a nationwide talent search and cast Mega Director Ron \\"Opie\\" Howards daughter as the female lead in this mild shocker.

And her father was willing to sacrifice her because of his own guilt over the little boy dying without any medicine in the village? I guess the elders didn't quite think it through. Why wouldn't you have a Doctor in the village? If they wanted to build a \\"utopia\\" and get out of the big bad city they should have thought it through better. What I want to know is do they pay taxes? Because if the rest of us have to deal with \\"Real\\" life and have the taxman up our butts why shouldn't they?

He set the old, damp, village atmosphere well. I wasn't a big fan on how the end was shot or handled (supposed surprise)(I loved how he cut to the credits from the bed/room shot though)so I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.I love this film for the love story part.

The movie doesn't have tons of shocking twists. But the twists all shift your view of the movie and make you think.

It's deep and philosophical, and very very clever, and I for one couldn't see the big twist in the story coming. I don't know why some people could as it wasn't the most obvious thing at all. Brilliant brilliant film, and those who keep banging on about it being rubbish really are not understanding the film at all.

The acting/dialogue is tedious and at times painful to hear, the storyline dead-ends in the middle of the movie; overall, this is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it a 0","review":"This movie is just total crap. It started off so good, amazing even. The acting was phenomenal, I will even give it that.It wasn't until the \\"twist\\" when everything went horribly wrong. When it ends it even leaves a big question behind, and not the obvious one the actors point out. I am so tempted to leave spoilers, but others might like it and I woulnd't want to spoil it for them. What I will say is don't spend 8-20 bucks (ticket, popcorn, etc.) to go see it. Just wait until it comes out on video, and not just that, wait until it's at the 1 dollar rental section in Blockbuster or wherever you rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Village\\" Should Be Burned","review":"Someone told me that this movie was \\"scary,\\" but there was nothing \\"scary\\" about it. Once you find out half way through the movie that the \\"monsters\\" are actually people in costumes, the movie is basically over . I continued watching anyway because I was still hoping for suspsense, but there was none. Too much of the movie was dedicated to a boring romance and a blind girl wandering through the woods. According to Quotes & Trivia: \\"Sigourney Weaver suffered nightmares for two weeks after reading the script.\\" Well, I suffered from depression and severe boredom after watching this waste of a film. Definetly skip at ALL costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disapointment","review":"This had to be one of the worst movies of all times... from the lackluster script to the stupid ending... as if you could not figure it out a half hour into it!!!!!

Based on this story I would probably never read or go to another movie by this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not That Scary","review":"Not nearly as scary as I thought it would be. However, it has some similarities to \\"Blair Witch Project\\". Especially in that it could happen in real life (truth is absolutely scarier than fiction, we often just don't want to think about it). The older style of English almost got on my nerves, but not so much. Overall, decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the village","review":"When this film finally ends and it says an M.

Plain and simple, it's just not good. Anyone who says it's good is really reaching like a parent picking out the few good qualities in their bratty, ugly children. Of course, there are a few things done well... other than that it's a waste of time.

I have loved lots of movies that other people have found long and slow. This movie is just long and slow without any justification for being so. I thought that there would eventually be some payoff for its seeming emptiness but none came. There is something to be said for trailers that don't give away too much particularly when there is an unexpected ending in store, but in this case I just feel that all the hype was very misleading. There were some good performances but this movie was just plain dull. That's two hours of my life that could have been better spent reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie Watching Experience We Do Not Speak Of","review":"I rented this movie from Blockbuster and brought it to a family gathering last night. Popped it in the DVD player ... slowly but surely most of the family got bored and left the room. Only my mother and I made it to the end. We agreed that it was one of the worst films either of us had seen.M. Night Shyamalan must have a lot of relatives judging from the number of positive reviews for this dog of a movie.

Bryce Dallas Howard's performance is the one bright spot in an otherwise terrible film. let's hope that producers can see past the rest of this garbage and get her a better vehicle next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another \\"could have been a great movie\\"","review":"M. Night is losing it, as far as making movies goes. I was really impressed with Sixth Sense, so as with most his fans. His movies are slowing degrading in his story lines. I think he is running out of 'material'.Disappointing in a word.Though it had promise.This movie starts with a kind of \\"hunh?\\" thought.. and ends with a \\"unghh.. \\" feel.It starts out visually appealing with a range of familiar faces. Slowly it gains momentum before screeching to a halt and leaving one to wonder \\"why?\\" Why is the movie still going on? why am I no longer interested in what happens? Why are the best characters so under developed?The Village is one of the most boring movies I've seen in recent years. The pace is so slow and annoying that it makes \\"The Sixth Sense\\" look like an action movie. The so called twist towards the end of the movie is so predictable that you'll have to shut your brain completely not to see it coming"},{"rating":"1","title":"''don't let them in'' by anthony m jones","review":"When I saw the trailer for this I was thinking yahh M night Shymalan's made another pants wetting movie. Well I watched the movie and after the 1rst hour it got flat out boring. This is no horror this is a mockery of horror. The movie did have some suspenceful moments but its just not enough. If I could i'd give it a half of a star. Its basically just about a girl who is in love with this boy the boy get stabbed and she must venture into the forrbidden woods were the so called monsters wait ,to get medicine to heal the one she loves, the movie flips the script on you at first you are thinking that its a horror then it turns into a romantic love story what a let down.I know you are probably thinking that it can't be that bad ,after all were talking about the man who created Signs and the Six Sense which were both creepy movies. Now don't get me wrong I think M Night Shyamalan is a genius but he really made a mistake here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Village-Im very disappointed after a long wait","review":"This movie is certainly not what you expect it to be(unless you hate Shyamalan). From the amazing preview of the village, I was expecting a really good movie. I was waiting to see this one for months...To make a long story short, this movie has alot less scares then what I anticipated. The movie started out slower then hoped and while you wait for it to get better, it only gets worse. A potential scarefest turned into a realistic borefest. The terrible ending only makes you hate the movie even more...Shyamalan seems to be the Mike Tyson of movies. He started out great, but fizzled out fast. He will still be able to sell tickets to future shows, but with every show he will lose credibility in his profession...Casting=4.5 starsending=1 starsplot & storyline=2 starsreplay value=1 starsOVERALL= 2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was really confusing and NOT scary at all","review":"it was okay, i mean it had a good vibe to it but it was supposed to be scary and it was more like a drama than a horror.

The comercials and advertising were very misleading. Save your money folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Levels of The Village","review":"Spoiler Alert: Don't read this if you haven't seen The Village.I really liked this film. Granted, it wasn't a wall-to-wall fright-fest, but for me, it worked on three levels.1. First, it's a love story, and a touching one at that.2. A second theme illustrates the fact of man's extreme susceptibility to irrational fears and beliefs. Humankind's long history of believing in unseen, unproven gods, demons, devils, angels and so forth is ample evidence of that.3. The third theme is that you can take the boy away from crime, but you can't take the crime out of the boy. Set up a commune to get away from the crime and ills of society, and it's only a matter of time before someone is found with a knife in his chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Another hit! This movies was not as scary as I expected it to be, but still made me jump here and there. With a surpising, yet silly ending, this movie blew me away! The creatures in this film were amazing looking. I enjoyed this film and would watch it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time","review":"Give this movie a few decades, and I'm sure it'll be looked on as a classic. Either people will forget to look for plot twists in M. Night Shyamalan's films, or the plot twist here will be known so well that the focus will turn to the film's social commentary, which it has in spades. The Village isn't a typical horror movie, and once viewers manage to get past that point, they'll find the movie has many subtle nuances and a lot to offer. I had great fun with it.A smattering of extras on the dvd. The deleted scenes and production footage is nice, but Shyamalan's old home movies don't really add anything to the package. The Village is solid entertainment that just needs a few years to find the right audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...It was okay","review":"The Village has a very decent story plot and the beginning through the scene where the creatures attack is scary as hell. The end however is a very not welcomed suprise. But to others it was a cool ending. I personally won't buy it on DVD but it is definately a rental. If you rent it and don't like it just take it back and if you do like it then buy the DVD. But if you haven't seen the movie and don't know too much about it it is definately a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you were expecting?","review":"It seems that the many reviewers who did not like this film, or even (hard to believe) hated it, probably didn't get it. It goes so much deeper than just a plot twist. If that's all you were looking for, then you have a right to be disappointed. I viewed the film with no expectations and very little information about the plot (just the DVD jacket), and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by the many facets of this film. It is a masterpiece that I will be turning over and over in my mind for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who said scary? Not this one, but a great film","review":"Mr Shyamalan is a great director. People often do stupid sentences as \\"a scary director\\" or \\"a funny director\\" or whatever. Great Directors made just beautiful movies. Forget the past. Forget \\"Sixth sense\\" and \\"Signals\\". Just watch this film without pre-ideas, it's just marvellous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary boring","review":"This movie could have been cut down to about a 30 minute short, but instead Shyamalan decided to double space his way towards feature length in what was a very disappointing film. Firstly, I thought the movie was supposed to be a horror film, but there are really just a few scenes where suspense builds and quickly disperses.An interesting thing about this movie, there is a twist at the end that no one is going to see coming...unless you have some common sense and a bit of an imagination. Basically the end is predictable if you are able to remain awake for the duration. Also, watch for Shyamalan's forced little cameo.The only redeemable quality about this movie was the fact that it was technically sound. All the cinematography and audio and good stuff like that was decent, overall the production quality was high, I just felt that the movie itself was not entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Village\\"","review":"Well, the wait is over...the Village has arrievd!I will only make some quick commets.- If you think alot you will predict the twists as I did...- ...so don't think- See the movie for the acting...thats what made the movie.- The dialogue is first rate.- The movie is not that scary but the scenes that are scary are very terryfying.- The ending is neat but at the same time I was let down and satisyfed.- This is not his best movie but I might be a cult in the future.- In the end I did like this movie...I was very well made and I liked the overall final product.- See the movie if you are a fan.- See it soon so no one ruins the ending for you.- See this with an open mind.- This is an underrated film- I will buy the DVD.Rating B- *** 1/2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night does it again!","review":"Night does not disappoint. Just when you settle in your seat, there's surprise or twist around another corner. Night is a genius! Definetely a movie to see again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EXACTLY THE BEST, BUT HAS IT'S MOMENTS","review":"In the long run, this movie was quite a letdown. Unlike the fabulous SIGNS, this movie will scare you the first time only. The plot is very promising, as is the beginning of the film. A ninteenth century village is surrounded by a forbidden forest inhabited by vicious \\"creatures\\". Both have an understanding not to intrude upon eachother's area. But one night, the peace is broken...Sound spooky? Well, that's how the previews played it.I won't give anything away because this movie will scare the bejezus out of you then make you feel stupid for bein scared at the end. My problem is that after you see this movie once, it will never scare you again because you know how it will turn out. The magic of Shyamalan's scare tactics, which was worked o perfection in SIGNS, is that the threat is right around the corner and could jump out at any time - but it doesn't, and you can cut the tension with a knife. It works every time, but not in THE VILLAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriguing but don't expect horror","review":"As long as you know that this is more of a romantic drama you might not be let down. I think that had I not expected lots of terror I would have a better idea now of what I think about the actual film I saw. It did have some provocative (and timely) political allegory, and the second revelation (what's in the metal box?) caught me by surprise and made me feel great sympathy for the characters. The first twist, though, was sort of on the level of a Scooby Doo mystery. I guess I would have been more satisfied initially had the film been more like the trailer suggested, but I like that Shyamalan always manages to undermine my expectations while not leaving me utterly disappointed. I'm sure that, like \\"Signs\\" before it, \\"The Village\\" will grow on me upon seeing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. Night's Final Trickery","review":"The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs are three terrific suspense/mystery flicks from director M. Night Shyamalan. Lady In The Water and The Happening are two of the worst. The Village falls right in the middle; the final time that M. Night truly entranced us at the theater.I wish I could give you a little plot summary, but this is the type of film where the less known about it the better. I will say this: Whereas today's \\"wonderboy\\" director JJ Abrams is all about time travel and relative physics concepts, M. Night's trademark was misdirection. You think this movie is about one thing, but in the end it is 180-degrees of surprise.Overall, this is a suspenseful, mysterious film that will have you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy the 104 minutes while you can, though, as after this effort M. Night was never quite the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The movie trailers lead you to believe that this is somewhat of a horror flick - while it had a few jump in your seat moments - it is not a horror. It is intriguing with all the twists and turns. Many times I found myself thinking \\"What?\\" - without spoiling anything I can't say more. It is a good movie - well worth seeing in the theatres! Bryce Howard looks as thought she will be a great actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, Disappointing, and a Waste of 104 Minutes","review":"I thought \\"The Sixth Sense\\" was wonderful: well-done, scary, and with a twist that worked.This movie is no Sixth Sense. Only at the end is it quite obvious that most of the previous 90 minutes has merely been a set-up for the final \\"no big deal\\" twist. I won't give anything away in this review; that wouldn't be fair to you if you've yet to watch the movie.I'm surprised that actors like Hurt and Weaver would accept roles in such a drab script. Pan my review if you must; in the end, I'm sure that you, too, will feel that these 104 (or so) minutes could have been used doing something more productive or enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Takes a Village Idiot (aka Adrien Brody)","review":"to get any action going in this lifeless pseudo-thriller from the self-loving M. Night S. Dull and utimately very predictable, there is absolutely no payoff here and very few chills along the way. It also has some major gaffs, like the town elders who know the truth and yet - there's a whole population of folks in the same age group who seem clueless as to what is going on. Hello? Were those folks drugged and kidnapped or something? You'll understand when the \\"secret\\" is revaled. Anyway, Brody's character is the only one who inspries any real action in the film, and, to be fair, Bryce Dallas Howard is very good actress and has a promising future.Self-indulgent and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of M.

Keeping with the way he directed \\"Signs\\" this movie was much like that, its obvious they were done by the same director, there are some similiaries.The idea for this movie was an interesting, unique one and pulled off well, however, there was a surprise twist (like all Shyamalan movies have) that took the movie in the wrong direction. If Shyamalan had left the twist out of the loop the movie would have been much better.Not as edge of your seat as his other movies, it wasn't as special as I had hoped it would be.

Night Shyamalan to go back to the drawing board and see where he went wrong in writing this movie.Adrien Brody's character nearly sank the movie and so did Bryce Howard's.She is a good actress,but what was her character doing in the woods?Alone?That's like having Luke Skywalker facing Darth Vader without using the Force.Or a drunk driver smashing in house and suing the owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise - what a disappointment","review":"The village had a lot of great elements but they just didn't come together.* secluded community cut off from the world.* secretive controlling community council.* 'real' monsters in the woods.* forbidden buildings.As a horror movie this was a big stinker!As a drama - again stinker!Don't get me wrong, there were some really nice moments in it - that all added up to about 3 mins of film time.I have to wonder if the best parts of this story were never shot or ended up on the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love M.

With \\"The Village\\" Shymalan proves without a doubt that he is not infallible.While \\"The Village\\" is a beautiful to look at movie it fails entirely as either a love story or a horror story. The actors speak in a kind of pseudo Colonial American. The plot moves along at a snail's pace. The, so called, \\"others of which we do not speak\\" are neither scary nor are they paticularly threatening. The love story is down right silly. By the end of this mess I was joyfully rooting for the untimely death of the movie's young hero and heroine.

The great looking previews and trailers for this film are COMPLETELY misleading. The scarefest advertised in the previews never happens. And any spook the movie may have had dies giving birth to this awful, formulatic, senseless, and shockless storyline. I'm not kidding. If you go to watch this film expecting a solid scary and powerful film ala Signs, forget it. This film is Manoj Night Shyamalan's worst offering. Even without comparing The Village to M's previous works, this film still flops horribly. Anticlimactic is the best word to describe it. Anticlimactic and indolent. I guess if we broke it down to a quick metaphor: An olympic runner jets to full stride at the sound of the gun...and falls on his face because his shoelaces are tied together."},{"rating":"1","title":"numbingly dull script, poor direction","review":"the director wieldeth powerful magic--he hath the power to turn sigourney weaver and william hurt into wooden boards, the talking kind. i hope he returned them to their original incarnations after the shoot. this is the kind of movie for which an actor should call in sick to the premiere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Let's just say that i slept throught the whole film...Dont waste your money on \\"the village\\" its horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF CELLULOID!!","review":"I saw this film in the cinema and disappointment doesn\`t come close!

By far M's slowest, and that's saying alot. The some of the characters were well developed, but some of the performances seemed phoned-in. Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody both have done better. The huge \\"Plot twist\\", and there were 2 this time, were both letdowns and seen well in advance. Pacing is crucial for suspense, but this bordered on ridiculous!

It has great graphics, yet it has a lack of cars to choose from. Cars don't handle well with upgrades. I love the dyno run simulator for the parts as you upgrade your car. It is better to see real numbers and graphs instead of the usual power bars like in NFS Underground. The addition of woman and videos is unusual but very nice. Namaco has created a good racing game. With a little more work it can be as good if not better than other racing games. If SRS and NFS Underground joined they would have a game that would top all others.

I gave this game a 4 out of 5 stars because the cars look great and there is damage simulation. However, this game can be difficult to a beginner and when the cars are going 160 mph it looks like its 100 mph so not very good speed feeling if your car is slow. But after you get into this game it becomes very addictive because you can customize up to 50 cars and store them in your warehouse! I gave this game a 3 out of 5 for education because it teaches the player the physics and strategy of racing. I would give this game a 5 out of 5 for education, but since the theme is street racing, I lower cause it teaches kids to speed (not really, but I need an excuse). Thank you for reading my review and buy this game if you want a solid racing game for 50 bucks ($49.99)+Average durability+Fun and addictive game+On Xbox Live-Not as much customization as Need for Speed Underground?$49.99(Reviews based on Xbox version)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"I got bored of this game after about 10 minutes. The level is lousy, the car control is lousy, and it's a total waste of time to even try to complete it. Online is boring as well.The girls in the game is probably an attempt to cover the lousiness of this game. Even if you're just buying this game just for the girls, it does have hot pictures of them on the menu in skimpy clothes, but it's not really much. You can also earn videos of real models dancing, but it's not really that sexual if that's what you're expecting. It's just a girl in slightly skimpy clothes like at the nightclub. They don't dance in skimpy bikinis like at a gentlemen's club. Don't expect that kind of stuff. This game is rated Teen, not Mature or over.Anyways, this game is lame and a waste of time to complete.

I find the shampoo and conditioner to be outstanding, and possibly slightly better than the reconstructor. The only issue that I've found with the reconstructor is that it smells a bit more strongly than the shampoo and conditioner.

Both Tina and Evelyn are great, heart wrenching characters and every success and failure feels like a direct reflection upon a secret life only you know you ever lived. However, despite this being such an amazingly written book I was frustrated to find that the ending felt like there was something more that should have been written but somehow had been forgotten during publishing. This could possibly just be my own feelings and I still highly recommend this read. I look forward to reading her other books and maybe down the road she'll revisit Evelyn and Tina and hopefully things will have continued looking up for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About Point of View","review":"I bought this book for my Kindle the one day it was offered at $0.01. I figured I'd just get a good, quick, simple read before I decided on a heavier, more main stream book. Was I in for a surprise. Moriarty does a great job creating a character that most of us can related to as she grows up and faces the many peer pressures and life's bad lucks from an appropriate age point of view. Evelyn is a smart girl who lives through and watches hard life lessons by her family, friends, and acquaintances starting from her age of 10 to 18. The lessons to be learned throughout the book are that harsh, quick, and initial judgements have room for change, understanding, and compassion over time. I loved this book! Easy to read.

Highly recommend! cannot wait to read another of Moriarty's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book by a great new author","review":"Laura Moriarty is a wonderful new writer, who has come up with a winner with her first novel. This is nominally the story of Evelyn Bucknow, of Kerrville, KS, daughter of a struggling single mom, and granddaughter of a kind, evangelical grandmother. But really, this is Moriarty's attempt to paint an illuminative portrait of the kind of family who got lost in the shuffle in Ronald Reagan's America (the story takes place in the 1980's, when Reagan is the president). And she succeeds beautifully, with a fully realized portrait. She treats this family, and all of the books' characters, with so much dignity and respect that it is impossible not to root for all of them. Laura Moriarty is going to change the way we look at poverty in this country, as well as the way we look at the state of Kansas (where I happen to live!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Center of Everything","review":"Interesting book - Would not definitely recommend it unless there was nothing else.

It was absolutely awful. It's a story about a girl who lives with her single mother and is estranged from her relatives. The mother gets pregnant and has a disabled child which is talked about being cared for a lot. The girl loves a boy but the boy loves her best friend and then he gets her pregnant and marries her all while still in high school.There is no point to the story, no real plot. You follow the boring life of a teenager.I'd find something else to read, it was not enjoyable in the least and just as the title says, I have no idea why I even finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut novel","review":"I enjoyed this beautifully written book. It captures the essence of an intelligent adolescent girl who has a sense of what life is all about without being handed any real tools to help her draw conclusions. Through the influence of teachers who believe in her, she begins to believe in herself. Moriarty's novel tells a story of family strife, love, discords and growth on the road to Evelyn Bucknow's maturity in a way that is believable and not syrupy. It is not a \\"downer\\" at all. Instead, I found it endearing and think it could be inspirational to teen girls faced with some of the same problems. I hated to have it end and found myself thinking of Evelyn for days after I finished the story. Now I look forward to Laura Moriarty's next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was poorly written and boring, lacked a good character development, and the plot was very dry and unexciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Novel About the Journey To Adulthood","review":"Evelyn Bucknow, the narrator of Laurie Moriarty's novel, \\"The Center of Everything,\\" is 11-years-old at the beginning of the novel. Describing her experiences as she steps into her teenage years, we learn of Evelyn and her mother's desperate financial circumstance; an affair with a married man that leaves Tina, Evelyn's mother, pregnant; Evelyn's first love, and the myriad ups and downs on the rollercoaster of growing up.I picked this novel up because it was on sale and it sounded vaguely entertaining. I had no idea that I would become so attached and care so much about the characters in this book. Moriarty crafts Evelyn's voice in such a way that she bursts from the pages and into the lap of the reader. Her emotions are so true, and palpable, that it is hard not to cry when she cries. \\"The Center of Everything\\" is a posivitely brilliant novel that the reader will be sad to finish.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, funny book with great depth!","review":"This is a charming, engaging, and sometimes familiar book that you will too soon end. I look forward to reading more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something More","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but I didn't quite find it: I found something more. I was impressed with the way Moriarty was able to capture the reality of her protagonist's perspective as she move through childhood and adolescence. A coming of age story for the nerdy girl who wants to be loved, the good girl who isn't sure she wants to be good, the gifted girl who must make something out of nothing and figure out what's really important along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice coming of age story","review":"Told from the voice of a teenager, this is a coming of age story from a girl growing up poor during the 80s. The main character, Evelyn, has several influences in her life that she considers as she is making her decisions. Tina, her mother, who had her out of wedlock and struggles with bad choices, loves Evelyn fiercly. Her grandmother, Eileen, is religious and introduces her to a fundamentalist church. Then there are Travis and Deena, other kids in her neighborhood that are struggling with their decisions. There are several teachers that influence and encourage her as well. This book shows how you can rise above adverse circumstances if you have people that care and take an interest in you, and if you make good choices. I really liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if I had read to the end?","review":"I only read about a third of this before putting it down. I just couldn't deal with the young protagonist's mother's poor choices.

Each, in their own way, achieves a measure of success, although it is likely that Evelyn will be the only one who is ultimately able to recognize and nurture a personal center that will allow her to fully blossom. I would have liked to have seen greater development of at least some of the many significant events and difficulties that beset this Kansas community. Possibly this was intentional, allowing the reader to enter into the resolution in a less directive manner.

The layout and presentation is excellent along with the photography. Readers should be forewarned that many of the recipes are not exactly \\"heart-healthy\\", especially when the distinctive rouxs come into play, so some discretion may be called for. Nobody will be dissapointed with the quality of the recipes and the flavours and aromas they produce. Some consideration is also given for those who have an aversion to heavily spiced or seasoned dishes. There is something here almost literally for all tastes. The author is very generous with his knowledge and experience. An indispensable book. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"How I became a Cajun","review":"I have never been to Louisiana!

With her second book, \\"Bull Dancer\\" she amazed me again with her knowledge of ancient history.Korsness's first book, \\"Ancient Fire\\" had me believing she'd visited ancient times in order to write the book, and reading \\"Bull Dancer\\" convinced me she is so in tune with the past, she must have lived back then.Sure, writers do research; but the style these books are written in pulls the reader into the flow of the story and makes them feel as if they are back in time...and I mean, wayyyy back in time.The message that women were just as eager to do what men do in ancient times rang true in this beautifully written tale of adventure and searching.

I have to say that after encountering the twelfth typographical error, I began searching for the publisher's address in a frustrated attempt to write back to them, informing them that their proofers were all on vacation when the print files were released. I wound up putting it on the shelf unfinished, and I plan to include it in my next yard sale. The plot was predictable and I found the characters to be shallow.

This is the second book by this author I have tried to plod through, and only because I was hard-up for something to read. I got bored reading her one-sided page long dialogues.

The story is one that stays with you, the characters are memorable and I don't know how Ms. Michaels does it, but she speaks to the heart of every woman in such a way that I hate to finish the last page.It never fails that I identify with the characters, or that they are exactly like someone I know.

I give it a twelve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the recycle bin","review":"I could not believe that this book was published. The dialogue was stilted at best and moronic at worst. The characters were not believable and the only reason I finished the book was to see how bad the ending could possibly be - it didn't disappoint.

Usually if I don't like the characters or the story at least I can admire the production. Not so here. I disagree with the reviewer who implied that editing of typos and grammar was unimportant. Any book that represents itself as literature should at the very least not contain hundreds of distracting typographical errors.

It is an attractive bag and very functional. One of the features that I enjoy is the strap for long carries in large airport terminals. The padding on the strap has elastic characteristics that provides a very comfortable fit. The storage space with the various compartments was also surprising and accomodates all of the accessories that came with my Panasonic 9 inch player. Not only that, but the main compartment also allows a pair of Sony noise cancelling headsets that I got for listening on a noisy plane ride. The headsets twist sideways for a flat profile and are able to fit on the top of the player when it is strapped in. It's a tight fit, but works very well. Overall, it is a bag that will provide effective carrying of your player, accessories, several DVD's or CD's (22 total) and even note pads, pens, boarding pass or flater items in its front and back compartments."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Easy and good for travel.

Like many earlier writers ACG sees a beauty in the Lord that he seeks to bring out at all opportunities. In particular he follows the Lords lead in showing Christ throughout the OT. This is achieved mainly through typology. The views are a fairly standard pre-millenialist, conservative stand and the fact that this is a complete commentary forces the author to tackle some passages that might otherwise be ignored. To a modern reader ACGs complete contempt for liberal and catholic views may appear harsh although he usually tempers this with real information and accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight Training Advanced & Intermediate","review":"I purchased the Weight Training Intermediate/Advanced DVDs featuring Charles Glass.

I liked it more than any other Rendell/Vine book, with the possible exception of \\"Dark Adapted Eye.\\" One of the most fascinating features of the book is the way in which forms of sexual pathology get repeated, with variations, through three generations of a family. Gerald's mother's relationship with her second husband gets echoed in Gerald's relationship with his wife, and Gerald's two daughters act it out in their own peculiar ways, until the very end, when one of them wakes up. There's great insight into what might be called the erotic lives of families, and the writing is first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sense of location","review":"I liked the book a lot, and agree with many other reader comments: plot a little predictable, but a great ride along the way. I spend a lot of time in the area in which the book is set & think that Vine has done an excellent job in depicting the scenery & atmosphere. Her descriptions of the sea mist are particularly evocative - and I know because I've camped nearby many times.It may interest readers from outside the UK to know that most of the locations mentioned are real - Ilfracombe, Barnstaple etc. The main place, Graunton, is fictional but very similar to Saunton Sands combined, perhaps, with Braunton Burrows. The actual hotel there is the \\"Saunton Sands Hotel\\" and is a huge art deco edifice, in a similar clifftop position. In the novel \\"The Dunes\\" is architecturally much more like the neo-edwardian \\"Woolacombe Bay Hotel\\" a few miles down the coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"To put it bluntly, this is a mystery without mystery, a thriller without thrills. Like \\"Anna's Book\\" and \\"No Night Is Too Long\\" it is populated by obnoxious and predictable people. Two thirds of the way through you have everything figured out and there are no surprises left. The typical Barbara Vine twist at the end that shocks, surprises, and delights is totally lacking here. What I find most dismaying is that a writer of Vine's stature has sunk to using gimmicks to spice up an otherwise pedestrian plot. I hope she waits until she can come up with some decent characters and a plot that that has more to offer than tabloid sensationalism before publishing another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Hyperbole, the worst book I've ever read.","review":"I was excited to read this book, because I thought it was going to be interesting and engaging. It was not either of these things. The book plods slowly through an lackluster plot towards a predictable and unfulfilling conclusion. I got the book for free and was still disappointed that I wasted so much time reading it. Save your time and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very \\"skimmable\\" and MUCH too long to reach the \\"revelation\\"","review":"I LOVE Ruth Rendell--but maybe not so much Barbara Vine.This book simply seemed TOO LONG--it starts out interestingly enough but there are so many blind alleys as the daughter begins to investigate who (or what) her father was.And the final \\"revelation\\"--revealed in the last 5 pages--is disappointing because it simple seems to take forever to be reached, and we're left wondering why we have spent so many pages with all those other characters who added nothing, simply passing the time/pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her heart wasn't in it","review":"I am also a big fan of Barbara Vine. I loved both A Dark-Adapted Eye and A Fatal Inversion. I almost didn't finish this one, but ploughed through only out of a sense of loyalty to the author. There is a description of one of Gerald Candless' novels, something to the effect of \\"his heart wasn't in it, or maybe the heat got to him.\\" I feel that way about The Chimney Sweeper's Boy. None of the characters really came alive for me and, as others have said, the plot was predictable. The only thing I really found intriguing was the relationship between Sarah and Adam. I hope that others will give Vine's other books a try - there's so much more that she's capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment-","review":"I've been an ardent fan of Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell) for years now, and this is the first of her books that I've been disappointed in. The ending you could see coming a mile away. I felt like the whole book was an exercise in pushing a liberal agenda on sexual mores rather than a good mystery-mainly because there was no mystery-it was all quite clear what the outcome was to be, and I'm usually not good at seeing the end coming! It is the last of her books I will read. I think she's run out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, three unhappy women and one sick man","review":"Mistery, yes well, what mystery? You can read in the first pages that Gerald Candless wants kids but cannot imagine conception with a woman. That is a good hint at what is bothering the man.What really turned me off was the fate of the Candless women. All unhappy because of their husband/father. Not only unhappy but trapped. Ursula, the best of her years wasted on a loveless marriage. The girls, so hung up on their father they are unable to form relationships of their own. Hope has a boyfriend but does not seem half as involved with him as with her (dead) fahter. How awful. What a macho story. The author never lets one the three female charcters doubt their place and role in that family. There is no inkling of braking away for their own good. It's almost hard to believe a woman sat down to write a story of such trapped female souls. No more books from Barbara Vine for me, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This was my first Barbara Vine book, and I was disappointed.

We haven't had any problems with the battery or with it malfunctioning.This is also one of the cheapest ones out there, so it didn't hurt us to purchase several of these.

I figured a different brand had to be better, right?No.I put in fresh batteries, and this one started making a squealing noise, somewhere between a proper alarm and a sick baby. Something was clearly not right, and no amount of pushing buttons or changing batteries would help.The other more expensive model was no better -- its fancy LCD panel displayed random meaningless lines rather than letters or numbers (similar to the way the Kidde models had failed, in fact), and similarly refused to be reset to a sane state.I don't know about you, but that's all the chances I'm willing to give First Alert. If the two I got were so broken out of the box, how can I possibly trust any replacement?So I don't know what I'm going to get, but it won't be from either First Alert or Kidde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Just what I expected and wanted I have no problems with this product and would recommend this product to anyone interested in this type of item.

This means the time consuming hassle of re-filling and re-drilling all those holes in order to properly hang these things up! I returned ALL of them except one (new drilling anyway), and found 'Kidde' CO2 alarm units that fit my pre-existing screws.

The most outstanding is the author's description of the vampire bat as having a beak. He refers to the bat's beak many times. Since a bat is a mammal and has a nose and a mouth with teeth, I think it is evidence of the thinness of Mr. Kurtinski's research. The story is as predictable as the last reviewer states.

The story is OK but nothing to dish out money for. The girls are good looking, as I have already pointed out, but they barely do anything to give the film a R rating.

It'd be acceptable if the writer had some minor grasp of Holmes, and the style in which he deserves to be presented, but his portrayal of Holmes and Watson here is as accurate as the cartoon Three Stooges were to the real thing.

However, if you are expecting a story of Sherlock Holme's exploits and detective skills you are in for a big disapointment.

Eventually after everyone has paid the inflated price, Paramount will lower the price.

That show was shot and finished on film. It won't be widescreen, but the masters are on film so hi def resolution is supported.However, Next Gen, DS9, Voyager and most of Enterprise was SHOT on film, but edited and finished on NTSC VIDEO (in fact TNG was the first show ever to do this). That means the master tapes for these shows are all 525 line video and they will never look better than they do on DVD. It is physically impossible to release them in hi-def.Enterprise switched over to 16:9, but it was not actually finished in hi def until late in the game.The movies can all be hi def, except for (sadly) the new edition of ST: The Motion Picture. The special edition director's cut was only finished on NTSC and can never be upscaled to HDTV. Only the original theatrical version can be re-scanned to a higher resolution.Use this info to plan your purchases accordingly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What is Advertised","review":"When I heard about this collection I was quite excited. It would be an opportunity for me to get all of Star Trek at a reasonable price. However, \\"The Ultimate Star Trek Collection\\" does not contain all the Star Trek episodes, and it is not reasonably priced. The animated series from the early 1970s is missing. To me this is a big omission. I have seen most of the episodes of every series except the animated series. One of the reasons that I considered buying \\"The Ultimate Star Trek Collection\\" was that I would finally be able to see all of the animated series. Failing to include it makes this product much less appealing to me. The price is another problem. US$2500 is a lot of money, particularly for an incomplete collection. Until a true complete collection is available, at a reasonable price, I will continue to get my Star Trek fix on Spike TV on nights when I can not sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A sterile and old-fashioned (in a bad way) war film, The Great Raid is about as perfunctory and bland as movies get; no wonder it sat on the shelf for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"complaint","review":"I ordered The Great Raid in a Wide Screen format.

I was highly disappointed at the dramatized version of the movie. The book tells the real story of the soldiers who were imprisoned for over three years (after being abandoned by their country) and the Ranger company that rescued them. The movie only tells the story of the rescuers.The real story lies in the atrocities committed by the Japanese. The American soldiers and the Philippino civilians who endured starvation, diseases, cruel treatment, torture and cowardly murder at the hands of their captors deserve to have their story told.

The bare-bones DVD (not even a trailer) comes only in fullscreen! I went all over town checking it out. Typical Miramax, over-pricing its DVDs.

The movie also shows the bravery of civilians, American and Filipino, who risked their lives smuggling medication and other things to the POWs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing scenes from the Blu-Ray edition","review":"This is a fantastic movie - however, the Blu-Ray edition is missing at least two scenes that are included as part of the movie in the widescreen DVD release. The first scene that is missing is where Connie Nielsen is making a deal for medicine in a warehouse. The deal goes bad, and a gun battle ensues. The second is when Connie Nielsen is attemping to pay money to get Fillipino refugees transported out of a soon-to-be-warzone. Why these scenes are not included in the Blu-Ray release of TGR is unexplained. They were good scenes and helped to move the story and develop Nielsen's character.

The low-key build up is what gives the raid and its aftermath the impact it has in this picture.As for the Blu-ray itself, the picture looks great. The detail and deep colors are there.

This book and CD set is a good example. For those who are just beginning banjo, these solos help you get used to playing various combinations using finger picks. I found the accompanying CD indispensable from the get-go: the clean, crisp sound of a pick striking a banjo string is one of life's simple inspirations. In addition to some basic three-finger combinations, there are three tunes that introduce frailing; and, in addition to teaching the basic chords in G tuning, the author introduces the C tuning which is less common these days but was used in several earlier Mel Bay banjo books. I've docked the package one star for having a few misprints, but those are fairly easily spotted even by the beginner and, hopefully, won't cause too much stumbling."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Author launches into examples of concepts which were not previously explained.

He's got a voice that simply cannot be duplicated. And, in 1999, he got a collection in UMG's '20th Century Masters.'In 2006, Hank was given a second volume in the series. I, personally, prefer the second volume over this one, although this isn't a bad Hank CD. Both discs have 12 songs, and both are relatively skimpy, but volume 2 has 'Your Cheatin' Heart,' 'Kaw-Liga' and many other gems that this one lacks.This is, however, a nice set, nonetheless. 'Lovesick Blues,' 'I Saw The Light,' 'Hey Good Lookin',' and 'Move It On Over' all appear on this 12-song CD.This isn't a bad choice as your first Hank CD.

I bought this album the day it came out and I'm still in awe with it. Gift of Gab seemed to pour his soul out into this one. The album is filled with spiritually uplifting verses. I have to say I listen to this album for spiritual comfort at times. Some people might knock it b/c it's too spiritual, but it's just real! He touches on topics alot of people deal with. From peer-pressure to just finding your way in life. In the end, Gift looks up for guidance, and he doesn't mind sharing it. With all the garbage out in the hip-hop scene as of late, it's extremely refreshing to hear such positive spiritually uplifting music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A THOUGHT FROM THE OFFICE","review":"I purchuased the album yestarday, and I am already seeing my thought process change a little. Some may say that allowing a cd to change how you think makes one very impresionable, well it doesn't happen often but it did with this one. When MC's treat hip hop as an art form, they really can influence the lives of others in a positive way. When that message their tyring to send out hits and you realize that you feel the same way but havent yet been able verbilze those feelings, it allows your mind to expand. I love music that makes you think, and this album did that for me. Think postively and enjoy those around you, which is easy to do when your driving with the windows down, past swaying palm trees with the gift of gab all up in your ear but for now, i gotta go back to work cause this was just a thought from the office."},{"rating":"2","title":"you will love this album","review":"on his first solo effort, rapper gift of gab, delivers a relaxed and very articulate album. The album, entitled 4th dimensional rocketship going up, drives off a strong production team including vitamin d and jake 1. Their talent mixed with incredible vocals by gift leads to an amazingly deep and listenable cd. if you like anything by pharcyde, gangstarr, mos def, or dead prez, you will definatly like this cd. its relaxed beats go well with the fast paced delivery and i would highly recomend this cd to anyone that likes real hip hop. this cd is hip hop like it was supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hop on board the Rocketship for a ride of your life!","review":"This is truly a great and meaningful album. I never heard of Gift of Gab until I got this album and it was well worth it. I think he is one of the illest rappers out there today. His lyrics are on point and fiery. The album is like taking an uplifting journey from the very first song all the way to the end. This is influential rap at its best. What I really enjoy about the cd is the noticeable Seattle flavor and it never gets old. It seems like the more I listen to it the more I like it and thats rare nowadays in any album. I may take some time away from listening to it but I always come back to it and it seems to rejuvenate and uplift me. It is a special cd and I'd highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly overrated","review":"Gift of Gab's first solo album, 4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up, is a candidate for most adequate release ever. Typically motor-mouthed Blackalicious emcee Gab usually draws you to his tracks with an exceptional delivery, but here, little stands out as exceptional. Unfortunately, even less seems as though it will be remembered in a couple of years. On the positive side, the beats never get truly wretched nor does Gab get completely boring. It's just hard to call any of these songs better than OK. Even \\"decent\\" would be pushing it. \\"Sufficient?\\" That's more like it.For production alone, tracks \\"Way of the Light\\" and \\"Hold On\\" shimmy above the rest, meanwhile the gimmicky \\"Flashback\\" and \\"The Writz\\" fall flat. An album full of tracks as energetic and inspired as \\"Just Because\\" would stand the test of time, but \\"Rat Race\\" and most of the other faceless songs began fading away just after their release."},{"rating":"2","title":"an alluring book","review":"This lovely cookbook combines authentic recipes with stunningly beautiful photographs of food and landscapes. Each recipe is accompanied by background information on traditions, history, and the specific place of origin. Many of the recipes are featured in full-page photographs. The combination of color, lighting, and authentic backdrops gives these images an exquisite beauty. Other excellent photographs show the people of Greece involved in traditional tasks such as making cheeses and breads, milking sheep, and harvesting grapes and olives. The recipes are detailed and delicious. The text is infused with the author's experiences growing up in Greece, along with folklore and references to classic writings. This book is a feast for the eyes, palate, and intellect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a glove","review":"I was hesitant to buy this case for my Palm T/X after reading some of the reviews but I was pleasantly surpised to find out that it fit my Palm TX perfectly.

There are two larger pouches which the ads show holdingcredit cards. I can't imagine anyone putting a credit card with something so highly desireable for a thief. I would rather have smaller pouches for additional cards. Another down side, the strap that goes across the lower half gets in the way when using the control buttons.Overall, I like it, it's good protection for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This case works just fine for the Palm T/X...","review":"...even if it does have 'Tungsten' embossed on the front. The leather on the outside is fine cowhide, the seude on the inside helps to keep the T/X from slipping, and the fit to the machine is virtually perfect. The padding is soft and should aid considerably in protecting the T/X. I had considered not purchasing this case based on a couple of reviews I'd read, but I went ahaead and purchased it from Amazon.com anyway.Out of the box the fit wasn't at all what I'de expected - it was somewhat like I'd read, with a bit of the screen obscured. But, leather stretches, and with just a day of adjusting it with tension I got the case fitting the device like a glove. It's probably true that putting media cards into the case could be a bit dangerous, but I haven't tried it, and can't say anything definitive.This proves a little patience goes a long way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased for Palm TX based on the prior glowing reviews.","review":"I purchased this case for my Palm TX, based on the prior glowing reviews. I was looking for a nice book-style case made in soft leather. I recently up-graded from a Palm VX with Palm case.This case is far from a perfect fit for the Palm TX, which is suppose to be the same size as the Palm T5. The top of my PDA protrudes out of the case about 1/4 of an inch. The PDA would crack if dropped on its plastic top edge. The case blocks the top portion of the screen, making it difficult to access some of the menu options. I find my self constantly removing the PDA from the case to use it. The case is not a good choice for the Palm TX. Also, the leather is too slippery for my taste. I fear dropping the unit. The case has a cheap snap to keep it closed. I don't think the snap will last very long.After reading the prior glowing reviews, I am scratching my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice case","review":"I like the case. Good quality, nice leather outside, nice suede inside. Looks like I paid more that I did for it. The additional pockets on the inside are nice. I put am 8x11 folded piece of paper in the large pocket and have put receipts in the other pockets and it does not compromise the shape or closing of the case. Fits well in my purse. Looks nice when taking and using it in meetings. Slightly cushioned also makes it nice. Has a small pocket in the center crease for stylus (or additional one if you use the slot on the palm.

The SD card slots do not hold the cards, particularly the WiFi card which would continually fall out; additionally there is no cover for them as in past models. The \\"quality suede\\" interior and fastener do not fit my definition of \\"quality,\\" looking rather like something at your local dollar store. Fit is not good and cut-out for connectors is off center in miine. Best case I ever bought from Palm was for one of the original black and white PDAs and quality and design seems to have gone down hill with every further purchase. I'll be buying something else...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT fit a Palm TX","review":"I bought this case because it was supposed to fit a TX-but it really does not. The screen is cut off at the top and you have to take the entire PDA out to access menus or anything at the top of the screen.

A flip case allows users to plug into their desk top USB cradles without removing the Palm from the case; this is impossible with the T5 leather case.

I don't have any problem with the fit. Plugs etc are accessible. A few complaints:1. Hard for headphone jacks to fit flush to the TX so I only get \\"mono\\" instead of stereo2. Have to take the palm out of the case, to properly connect it to power and sync cables. I think #1 and #2 here likely have something to do with the contours of the TX also.3. The slot that I assume is to be used to hold an extra stylus will not hold one securely, so I don't use it4.

The speaker phone and voice dial features are invaluable in the car or if you want to conduct a conference call. I'm amazed on how well the voice dial feature can recognize names I've entered into my address book. The display is easy to read and the menus are easy to navigate. The big, clear buttons are ideal for larger hands. Verizon's network is more reliable than most, and this phone seems to get better reception than other LG and Motorola models I've owned in the past. Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.

After another month, the screen began blanking out more and more. Finally, after about 5 months of use, the screen would blank out continuously - maybe 15-20 times a day.Several people I know have the same issue with this phone - it is clearly a defective model.

The last time this phone broke I temporarily activated an old Kyocera phone that was about to be donated to the goodwill and it blew this thing away.On the bright side this phone is user-friendly and has a nice interface.

Everything else on the phone worked, but the display was dark (almost like an EnergySaver mode). Needless to say, a cell phone without a readable display is not worth a whole lot. Fortunately, I was within the 30-days, so I got a replacement from Verizon. Now, I've been with the plan for almost a year and another one of the phones is now doing the same thing. This tells me that I didn't get a \\"bad apple\\" at the beginning, but yet the LG VX4500 is just not a good phone. Unfortunately, I don't have any warranty to fall back on this time.

Her thoughts are mean, rude, inconsiderate, and loathsome. At first it wasn't so bad, but she just goes on and on- 'woe is me','I have issues','everyone else around me is an idiot'. Seriously, all of this consumes the first half of the book- and the read itself is roughly 230 pages. I don't have that kind of time to sulk in her misery.

I do and I didn't.First of all, I loathe anything reincarnation themed but was unaware for some reason that this book had such strong overtones concerning just that. Combined with EXTREMELY coincidental things happening, this book fails to be entertaining on any level. It is overly long and concludes at the appointed time you can see coming.The characters? Who cares? They're not engaging nor exciting. The only excitement about this book is the prologue when \\"Laura\\" is in the basement.This is a very early Koontz novel so it really does not matter if he receives a very poor review, his later books were great and praised.

It is a very slow paced novel with not much action. Most of the words within this novel are trying to get you attached to Carol and her husband and in fact you never really do get attached. I to be honest did not really care what happened to them. Likewise Jane Doe did not do much for me either and I couldn't have cared less halfway through the book if she got over her amnesia or not. There are a few cool chapters of a fight to the death between an old lady and her beloved cat but you've got get through a lot of boring chapters to reach this scene. There are far better Koontz novels out there to spend your money on instead of this one. Night Chills, Watchers and Intensity are three ones that I can remember just off the top of my head but there are more literature masterpieces by Koontz as well. The Mask is definitely not one of them though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT typical Koontz!

I like books on reincarnation, especially when it goes back a century or two and revolves around a tragedy (read Suffer The Children by John Saul - excellent), but I have to say that I'm glad my fellow Koontz-loving sister paid for the book and let me borrow it!

The story seemed like a good one, but, sad to say, as a book it leaves too much to be desired. The characters are very overacted, you just don't believe them. They are not characters, they are more like actors (bad ones) representing the story. And it is also oh-so-very predictable. You just don't care about what's going to happen.

The only way to be a Navy SEAL is to go train with them. That said, this book is excellent for an ordinary person who wants to get in great shape. I am using it to train for rugby and the strength excersises are what I find most helpful. Using body weight has left me less sore than using dumbbells but a lot more tired. This program is primarily for building muscle endurance, though you will get stronger. I recommend it more for a high school/ college athlete as a supplement to whatever your coach has you do.

Had some of it copied, poorly onto a cassette tape. Now thanks to Amazon.com I finally have the whole thing.One little caveat - Album was sent via UPS and some one must have sat on the package as the center holding finger were busted out and so disk is loose in the Jewel case. Have to handle very carefully.

I want to find the hole in the wall restaurants, and those that are not necessarily frequented by only tourists.I knew Venice would be a challenge food-wise because so much of the town is pretty touristy, and Venice is not necessarily known for it's food (relative to the rest of Italy).This book was the perfect companion for our trip. All of the details about location, hours, etc, were spot-on -- a feat in a town where it's difficult to find street names.The restaurant descriptions were accurate, and the narrative was very approachable.

Venice is definately one I would not leave behind on future trips.Over the four days we spent in Venice we ate at 5 of Shannon & Ruth's recommendations and we weren't disappointed. Thier reviews were accurate, insightful (mainly because they give the \\"back story\\" of most of the places they review and that helps give you a better sense of the place) and perhaps most important in Venice, clear instructions as to how to find the restaurant in the first place, which is always a challange.The food glossary in the back of the book is so good that I wish it was a \\"pull out\\" so I could use it as sort of cheat sheet while looking at a menu."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Live in Italy!

Fit however is a bit of a problem. First there were no cutouts for the mirrors. This made the cover ride high on the windshield. Not sure if the little diagonal strap in the corner that fits over the door is the security strap but if it is that doesn't provide much security. Also, due to the way the cover bunches over the windshield and mirrors the magnets in the lower corners don't provide much security. Instead the magnets are more like a \\"rock in a sock\\" beating the finish or smacking the window if there is more than a light breeze. While I haven't made any cuts to accomodate the mirror mounts I think it would be a much better fit and a better product with the cutouts. I also noticed that while the upper corners are supposed to fit over the doors of the MH, if the door is open more than an inch or two then the cover will not reach to install.

I had to put my own padding inside because of this.The outside 'metal' has got to be plastic. After a week of very light usage, it looks like trash.

There is no cushion supplied inside the aluminum case. I ended up taping a pice of bubble mailer to the inside of the case to keep my device cushioned and still. This helped a lot. I had the case for a few weeks when I dropped it (while open no less!!). I must admit the Palm T|X survived the fall, I attribute this to the bubble mailer inside the back of the case! However the case itself bit the dust. The cheap plastic strip that slides ito the groove on the Palm device to hold the Palm inside the case, well it broke clean off upon being dropped.Also there are NO speaker holes, if you want to hear alarms you better have the case open. No access for charging while case is closed, no access to SD slot without lifting Palm device from case. All in all a poor case for your T|X or any of the T series Palms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh, not bad but not good","review":"Aesthetically pleasing case. Seems quite rugged for the several months I've owned it. Not an exact fit for the TX (even though this case is supposed to work with TX and T5's per Palm) so it can rattle around inside if you don't take up the room with something. I used the foam cupboard liners. Really needs a cut out or for the seam to be re-aligned on the bottom so you can hook up your data/power connection while the unit is in the case.

I could not stand not being able to close the case when the latch broke, and I was silly enough to buy a second case. This latch lasted me 3 months, and snapped off today. I bought the aluminum case for the protection that it offers, but I have never seen a case with its latch be able to last. I think you're ultimately better off with a leather case, because this case is no good for protection once it cannot latch any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap!","review":"This is probably the worst case sold by Palm.

The hard case was well-made and fit the PDA snugly, protecting the PDA quite well from bumps and the occasional drop.The latest incarnation of Palm's hard case is something of a disaster. It's a bit too large for my TX, so the PDA rattles around inside the case when I carry it in my pocket -- the PDA's case is scuffed in a few spots because of the rattling. In addition, the latch on the hard case is plastic and after a little over two months' use, it's already broken. I now have a hard case that won't click shut and flaps open at the slightest provocation, offering no protection for the PDA at all.I got the hard case at no charge as part of a promotion when I bought the TX and I would never consider buying the product at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PRODUCT SUCKS","review":"I've had this darn thing for less than three months, and the latch broke yesterday.

It doesn't fit a Palm T|X tightly, isn't padded on the interior, and it's hard to get the stylus out without lifting the Palm out of the back of the case.Like other reviewers, the plastic latch on mine broke after a couple of month's very light use. Then began the nightmare of getting Palm to honor their 1-year warranty -- and that experience was another sad reflection on Palm. I've spent almost an hour and three phone calls with no success. The Indian tech support are clueless about accessory warranties and Palm's phone directory seems designed to avoid warranty claims on accessories.My advice: buy a BoxWave ActiveCase -- it fits better and BoxWave even responds to email!I have owned Palm PDAs since 1997 and this accessory was my most disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"The little plastic catch broke in less than a month","review":"I purchased the case along with my new Palm TX to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it. It's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner. The little plastic catch in the lid half, which keeps the case closed, never seemed to work quite correctly, requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut. On a trip on March 3rd, this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away. Now it has no catch to keep it closed. Since the case cost me about $24 new and I'd only get about half price for the return, I figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return. I'll use a rubber band around the case, reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is. Save your money and don't buy this case. I don't remember reading the reviews before I ordered it -- so there's a $24 lesson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks hard","review":"Latch breaks easily (e.g. first time it fell out of my backpack).

I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard case doesn't deliver on protection","review":"T5 does not fit securely in case (rattles).Was dissapointed that the catch mechanism to keep the hardcase closed is nothing but a tiny tab of plastic. The case pops open even from a slight drop (this may save your T5 from initial impact, but not from the follow-up bounce or skid). After the weak plastic tab that keeps the case closed breaks off (which it will), the product is just a flappy clamshell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look somewhere else","review":"Although the case seems durable, I cannot physically open the case.

I think you'd be happier just shoving your T5 into an old sweat sock: protection would be similar, the ease of access to ports and the stylus would be more or less as difficult, and, at very least, the sock would not rattle, nor would it ding the screen. The price would certainly be more in line with the utility, too.

Look elsewhere before you purchase this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"latch breaks too easily","review":"The first time the latch broke, I thought, maybe it was because I dropped the case (with the palm in it). I bought another case and then broke that one in the exact same spot (a very thin plastic vane that is the 'click' of the latch) - but this time, it was just a bump into the arm rest of a chair as I was putting the palm into my coat pocket! This is definitely a design flaw. A company as well established as Palm shouldn't have let this go to their customers - it was irresponsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Case Is Worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this case hoping that it would protect my palm and it does so; however, the case itself is already broken and i have only had it for a week. Furthermore, it makes quick access absolutely out of the question. You have to take the palm out of the case to do anything...hotsync, charge, listen to the player with headphones, etc. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"OK, so it protects the TX on a fall, however the latching mechanism depends on a thin piece of plastic that eventually breaks, rendering the case without anyway of remaining shut on its own.Replacing this with something like the BoxWave.com hardcase, availab le from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This PDA case has no holes for any of the PDA parts. You have to open both flaps to turn it on our take out the stylus.Terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Card holders can damage your T5 screen","review":"I tried checking how far away the memory card holders are from the screen, and came to a conclusion: one hard knock on the case when the case is closed and your T5 lcd will need to be replaced. If you did take advantage of Palm's promo - got the case free, my recommendation would be to cut/file off the card holders. Better safe than sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, latch broke, rattles","review":"Bulky, rattles (loud) in your pocket, and now it won't even close as the tiny plastic latch snapped after very light use for several months. Just a really poor design for fit, latch, and usability. So awkward to use (can't reach the stylus or power button), it makes me not want to use my TX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I'm very happy with this purchase. The case does an excellent job of protecting my new Palm T/X. While it doesn't have all the access cutouts at the top and bottom found on other hard cases, it easily swings out of the case to access the stylus, SD card slot, headphone jack, and hotsync/charger ports by connecting to the T/X using the same slide-in bar as found on the leather cover that comes as standard issue. The T/X did rattle a little in the case but that was easily fixed with a piece of 1/4 foam cut to fit into one of the card slots on the inside of the case cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"This case is really BAD!","review":"I have a Tungsten T/X and it rattled while in the case. Plus it was hard to open. Return it and order the Rhinoskin case instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy and flimsy","review":"This case is very clumsy to use. No cut-outs means I have to manipulate my TX around every time I want to charge, HotSync, use headphones, or even take out the stylus. The finish got terribly scratched up from being inside my purse, and the clasp broke off after 3 weeks of use - and I'm not rough on my stuff! The only good thing I can say is it does protect the PDA quite well. I'm glad it came included as a free bonus in the package with my TX, I'd be really angry if I'd paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The small tab broke","review":"I have had this case for about 4 months now. The first thing I noticed was the Tungsten T5 does fit snugly in the case; what I mean is the PDA will keep moving back and forth inside the case while you carry it in your pocket, making a \\"clacking\\" noise. This is due to the improper fit. I circumvented this but sticking a small piece of sponge on one of the card holder tabs.After using the case for one month the weak tab used as a latch to close the case, broke. I somehow managed to stick it back with super glue but it lasted only for a couple of weeks. It is a waste of time trying to fix it.I carry the T5 as it is with the original flip cover that it came with. If you are still considering buying the Hard Case, I hope you have better luck than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea--weak implementation","review":"The hard case is a good idea--it protects the T5 as I carry it in a cargo pocket or toss it in a briefcase. As someone mentioned, it rattles inside the case, and the rattling in the cargo pocket is annoying. Having to flip the T5 back and forth to turn on, plug in, or Hot Sync, is annoying. And the strongest drawback is the weak plastic closure. As someone was afraid it would do, mine has broken already, less than a month after purchase. They were prompt at getting the rebate out. I got my rebate check days before the clasp broke. I'm going to have to find another case. This one still closes, but I don't think I'll get more than one or two more uses out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attaching Anxiety & Depression","review":"I found the information to be helpful.

I know what Mr. Edwards has accomplished, because I went through \\"the transformation\\" and now enjoy happiness and an authentic life. I have learned how to deal with the system & the automatons in it which in itself is a subject worthy of writing about. Now instead of stressful, It has become merely routine. The point is to become independent, develop critical reasoning skills, and have the freedom to develop all your human powers that have been repressed because of the killers of social control and conformity. Mr. Edwards is on the right track. Take the time to read the book and think about what he is really saying. Good luck to you. You can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly idealistic and paranoid","review":"When I first started reading \\"Burning All Illusions\\" I went into it with an open mind. As I continued my pursuit of \\"freedom\\" I was more than annoyed to find yet another book that does nothing but complain about the government and the media. I seems that the media has become the great modern scapegoat, always blamed when there is a problem in society that no one wants to tackle head on. \\"Burning All Illusions\\" is no exception to this trend. If there is a social problem from poverty to alienation, it is the government or the media who are at fault, not the public. Any solutions to Edwards alleged grievances are overly idealistic and unable to be implemented. I don't know why Edwards thought that the world needed another clich�� commentary on modern society, but he has provided one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating #5","review":"This is my favorite of the series in overall content.

It is a nice mix of SmoothJazz and Electronica, along with elements of World Music withIndian and Brazilian overtones. The vocals are nice, especially\\"Eternity\\" and \\"Naked\\". This CD will not be for everyone, butif you are looking for a nice blend of interesting music, Iwould recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Praful - Pyramid in Your Backyard","review":"Praful's second album, PYRAMID IN YOUR BACKYARD, doesn't start off auspiciously... \\"Moon Glide\\" has a bit too much lite-jazz flavor that I'd like. But the pseudo-Indo-ethnic beats \\"Says Kabir\\" help wipe that out of the memory banks (though it present its own set of problems). \\"Acredite\\" gets back to the Brazilian vibe that marked his first album, and \\"Eternity\\" is sufficiently pretty to grace lounges across the world. \\"Naked\\" continues the mellow vibe, though Praful's vocals and lyrics aren't the strongest. The horns in \\"Drop to the Ocean\\" are quite nice, as are the stop-start guitars on \\"Wishful Walk,\\" but I'm not sure it's enough to overcome a certain blandness, endemic to the album, that overtakes both tracks. The closing track, \\"We Live On,\\" is good, but it's not quite enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you like Praful's first CD? Then don't buy this one (revised)","review":"Nothing new here. Strickly hack work with no creativity at all. Looks like they're heading for the one hit wonder heap. Too bad. One star is being very, very kind.Okay so I'm wrong. Heard them live in Seattle, great show. Played most of Pyramid. Maybe I just needed to listen some more. I'm sold on Praful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, sensitive account of war and family","review":"Like other reviewers I struggled a bit with the way the book is written -- the first person/third person narrative switches. But the depth of the story makes up for it. Character development is fantastic. I enjoyed the second half of the book the most and the increasing feeling of hope as the end was near. We all need a caring friend or neighbor to be there, no matter how bad it gets. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and depressing read","review":"First the good: The author is definitiely a gifted writer. She is able to paint a vivid picture of her characters and settings. The tone of the book is dark by design. Having said that, the book is overly depressing, and fairly predictable. I also found the jumping from character to charater in the first person often confusing. You often had to read several paragraphs into the chapter to figure out in who's head you were. Add to that the jumping forward and backwards in time is frustrating. Some chapters are told from the current perspective of a dead person.Towards the end of the book it really starts to drag. It almost began to appear that she was trying to meet some committed page count. The story really goes no-where. However, if you live or lived in Northern Wisconsin, you might find some of the local color interesting.Note to the author: Tree stands for hunting deer in Wisconsin were illegal during the time period in which your story occurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that stays with you","review":"This is one of those books you read and think to yourself, \\"I know I'll never forget this story.\\" Mary Relindes Ellis, a Wisconsin author, sets the story in a small mining town in northern WI and Vietnam. Teenage Jimmy lies about his age to join the Marines to escape small town life and an abusive home situation, leaving his younger brother Bill to seemingly fend for himself. Bill comes of age amidst rejection and violence, but throughout it all, he has the spirit of his brother and a concerned older couple who secretly watch over him. This book is a commentary on the inter-generational effects of war and a painful yet redeeming look at the expectations of manhood in our society. Much of it makes for very sad and heavy-hearted reading, but what sticks with you is the hope shining through the last pages, that even the most lost have everyday angels guiding them behind the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Turtle Warrior","review":"To those of us near or beyond a certain age, i.e., 50, the interplay between WW II and the Vietnam conflict (remember, it was never a declared war) certainly plays on our emotions. This book is not an easy read; it is one you need to put down and ponder before reading further. War is fought on many fronts, with each character in this book having lost something in his/her war. I found the narrative format mesmerizing, not like a voiceover where you envision a movie in the making. To those of us who grew up in the rural midwest during this time period, it invokes memories of the simplicity, conflictions, and emotions that we faced, and gives us insight to what our parents were facing at the same time. Please savor this book, especially the last line."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly stupid book","review":"Don't waste your time with this book. Klein was a pampered brat growing up in an affluent society and her guilt trip led her to write a book that would normally have died a quick death if it weren't for the fact that left has gotten hold of her as their poster girl.The arguments are weak and the book, though entertaining at times, reads like something a high school student, hoping to impress her teacher, would have written.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is going on?","review":"I tried watching this film, and could only stand about 20-30 minutes before I took it out od the DVD player.

His description of the story if quite good and through but all three were biased and word for word identical. The narrative was very good, but the evaluation was obviously very slanted. However, three things need to be added. The film was 90+ in a foreign language with subtitles, it never explained why the Polish and American troop wanted to imprison and even kill the Polish men they liberated from the concentration camps and lastly the \\"love\\" story did not seem to develop as one would expect. But the film did flow slowly but maintained my interest and the acting of the two main characters was good. I never did understand the marching and violin playing. I gave it one star because the other review were apparently very biased and rated this movie way to high. SORRY but that's how I see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justify The Means is a must read","review":"The characters are well defined and the reader is able to relate to them, especially Maggie.

The Ottoman Empire extended to the South of of the Uskok enclave of Senj. This frontier (in modern Croatia) is where the Ottomans, the Austro-Hungarians and the Venetians converged, all with their own agendas. The result is a engrossing history lesson in in war, peace, diplomacy, religion, negotiation, political deals and merchant trade.

However, the work itself is academically and scientifically weak - The Discovery Channel was one of the few sources referenced! The text is redundant and vapid. The editing(if there was any)was [horrible]. I couldn't finish the book (Lord knows I tried) because of the spelling errors, fractured syntax and the proliferation of grammatical errors.

Unfortunately there was one big problem. No where in the description nor on the picture did it mention the zone it could be played in. I was excited to get it in the mail and was heavily disappointed that my DVD player rejected it. I'm all new to the Amazon thing, but this was a black eye for it. Anyways, if you are wondering if this DVD is right for you then take a look at where you live. If you reside in the United States, this movie WILL NOT play for you.

Those are my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Women - The Closer You Get","review":"This was originally released as \\"The Closer You Get\\".

While the authors acknowledge that \\"there was another side to China as well\\" in both introduction and conclusion chapters, the majority of the book is devoted to horror stories and negative anecdotes. Although many of the stories may well be true and news worthy, the book as a whole does not provide a balanced, realistic view of today's China.Imagine a book about the United States that devotes 25% of its pages to describe murders, 20% to the homeless, 15% to drug trafficking, 15% to single-parent families, 10% to White House scandals, 10% to greedy business people, and 5% to the unprecedented prosperity of the last nine years. \\"China Wakes\\" is the China version of such a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering glimpse into China's lightest, and darkest, days.","review":"A startling and intimate look into China and its ever-changing culture. The book alternates between the writings of Sheryl Wudunn and Nicholas D. Kristoff, and provides a good cross-section of what China is really about: From its politics and traditions to popular culture. The authors' first-person narrative of the night of the Tiananmen Square massacre is equal parts riveting and calamitous - an affair that abruptly and definitively altered history's course in modern Asia. The narrative moves swiftly and is not shackled down by reams of history. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"mirror images of China's struggle for democracy","review":"This book is not only a perfect example of bravery and perfectionism in journalism; it is also a breathtaking and multi-faceted analysis of China's realities elaborated by two professional journalists.As a reader interested in the struggle for democracy and transparency in the world, I have had the chance to explore the extreme and intense examples of a country's painful struggle for its future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"The authors of this book were working as journalists for the New York Times at the time of the Tiananmen Square Incident. They paint a vivid picture of a China caught between two futures. Even though there has been great progress in certain things since the Mao era, there are still many things that are terribly wrong with China. Will progress overcome corruption or vice versa?This book was published in 1994, so many recent developments (Hong Kong's intergration into China, and the spy plane incident for example) are not included. Despite the age of this book, the commentary on the Chinese government still seems to be accurate. It provides a window into the government of one of the most important countries in the world. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY GOOD","review":"Anyone who truly believes that, we Americans treat our prisoners down at Gitmo so badly, should read this book and learn about the prison system in China.Some of the stories in this book are just incredible and fascinating.

The bad and the good.Very well written with many great details.The authors know their stuff well and have done some incredible research to write this great book.For anyone who is fascinated by China, its history, culture, social and political structures, this is a book for them.I knew something about China, but this book taught me much more.It's like I was there seeing it with my own eyes.Dated but very much needed if one wants to know why China is where it is today.Should we be worried about a rising China, NO, should we be amazed, YES.Wonderful book and very readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of China","review":"Just came back from 3 week trip to China on myown. No tour group. I don't speak Chinese but had similar experiences as the authors. I travelled by trian to Beijing, Xi'an and Urumqi. Spent time in Tianchi with the Kazaks. I came back with similar ideas as the authors. Not as in depth because I was limited by language, time and places I travelled. I thought I got a slanted view as I had no problems, but it was refreshing to know I saw China in the same light as the authors. Easy reading with lots of insight especially for those that want to relive their China experieces. Found book purely by accident. I would personally like to thank the authors for their devotion to China. I am more optimistic then the authors were 3 years ago. I think China is going to be a great economic superpower for years to come with minor political upheavels."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful book","review":"The authors bear a startling resemblance to an American expat couple of my acquaintence who absolutely hated China and had the worse time in Beijing.

I have seen many crab books in my life, but this is definitely the best. The sections about hermit crab anatomy and behavior are fascinating. It describes in detail crab mating and breeding, behavior in the wild, what the crabs like to eat (and what they avoid) and also discusses how they relate to other crabs. The section about aggression is a MUST-READ for new crab owners who have no idea what goes on in their crabitat at night while they're sleeping.

The Word is filled with his driving guitar melodies and if you are able to not sit still when these songs are playing, you are a better man than I. Hands down, this CD rocks and every track is money. I'm not even going to list the good tracks because each is unique with Randolph's stylings and perfectly harmonizes the evangelical gospel sound. I'm not a great fan of religious music, but these instrumentals break new ground for mainstream music. BUY THIS CD NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleached Gospel","review":"Let's be truthful, the Word is a bunch white boys, (okay they're not all white and color doesn't really matter, BUT ...)trying to sound soulful, but the soul is missing. Robert Randolph is definitely an able player who was brought up in the church and knows how to \\"evoke the spirit,\\" but if you want to hear the UNDISPUTED MASTERS OF SACRED STEEL, THE CAMPBELL BROTHERS ARE THE REAL DEAL. Just ask the Word band members on this CD, they too will acknowledge that they are neophytes when it comes to church/gospel music.

It's all instrumental gospel with a rootsy feel. I'm a natural grouch and this record makes me feel happy and hopeful.I'm a lousy guitar player, but the music I have focused on is pretty much the same as the music on the recordings that Luther Dickinson has been been putting out with the allstars & etc. I really appreciate the work he is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the ratings say.","review":"I bought after reading the positive reviews on other sites.

Chapters 1 through 5 take the reader through the art of crafting the story. Chapter 6 is all about what happens once the story is done, dealing with agents, publishers and the like.

This is a great sounding live disc, at times you would think it was a studio recording.The whole CD rocks. Lyrically Pauls songs are a little bit silly, but he makes up for them with his guitar playing and vocals. My favorite tracks are the last two, \\"To Be With You\\" was changed up with a bluesy opening jam, and a really good solo in the middle of the tune, and the last track is ELP's Karn Evil 9, where Paul nails Keith Emersons solo. Also, Tell The Truth has a great jam at the end of it with everyone trading licks.If your a guitar player, this one is worth adding to your CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound","review":"The songs on this CD are available on other CDs (Groovin High on Savoy, eg) with much better sound quality.

My only complaint is that in order to get to a specific scene in an episode, you have to fast forward through the entire episode, because the DVD's are not broken down into scenes. Also, there is supposed to be a quiz on disc 6, and the quiz doesn't work. Otherwise, I'm just happy to finally be able to own season 1 and 2.

Truth is it is based on Laura Ingalls Wilder's autobiographical book series. I think that if they were going to make up things that never happened in the books, they should have called the series something different. If you read the books you will find that some of the stuff in the TV episodes has NOTHING to do with Laura's life. I think Landon gets more credit than Laura. It takes away from the true seies too much. Mary never did get married and Jack on the set is a sheepdog instead of a bulldog...I just don't think the TV series always did the books and Laura's legacy justice. Is there ANYONE else who feels the same way I do???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"I never watched this when I was young because we didn't watch much tv. However, I did read a lot, and the Little House books were some of my favorites. So, all these years later, to see this television show that is supposed to represent the books that are sweet, touching and educational, I was highly disappointed.The tv show does not follow the books. The events are not accurate. The personalities are not truthful. My kids and I had the privilege of visiting all the locations the Ingalls family lived. What a trip! Seeing Pa's fiddle was truly the highlight. On the tour of Laura's final home, someone asked about the tv show and how accurate it was. The tour guide stated it's 90% inaccurate.To have a show like this is fine, but it should not have been titled after a non-fiction book and quickly made into a ficticious tv show.You are far better off going right to the source and reading the wonderful books. Skip the hollywood version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality transfer","review":"I'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does, I suppose most are simply glad the show is available on DVD. However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible. On an opening night shot on disc 1, there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs -- inside the house! The colors on these prints aren't even as good as what is shown on TVLand. This show might be 30 years old, but they cannot be using the best prints available.For those who are defending this package, the upcoming Daniel Boone DVD set is a good item to compare it with. That show aired in 1966 and the remastered print is fantastic. Studios and re-issue companies can do a good job when they choose to. It's a real shame that, in this age of big-screen TVs, this program will look so shoddy. It's apparent that with such a popular show, they could have recouped the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little House - Complete Season 1","review":"I don't want to waste everyone's time here just like to mention that there are a lot of deleted scenes from this series. A VHS version I have of \\"Town Party, Country Party\\" contains the full length unedited episode but the DVD version does not. A number of episodes in this Season 1 package have been edited. Very disappointing.... Many of theses episodes have just aired recently on cable in their full length unedited form... Why edit them for U.S. distribution? Do a web search on Little House deleted scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the closed-captioning?","review":"Where is the closed-captioning at? I can't believe that NBC would allow this to be released on disc without captioning. As some of us fans start aging our hearing may not be so good anymore. Since I've loved and watched the show for years I really don't need to hear all of the lines anyway. The extra features were a little shoddy. The quiz section does not work at all, and the family album shows cast members who were from a long way off yet. I thought the visual quality of the episodes were a lot better than the ones shown on television today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't like LHOTP?","review":"In this season: The Ingalls move to Walnut Grove.

The quality on these is superb. The colors are very sharp and vibrant. These episodes have never looked better! Definitely worth the money for any Little House fan. The packaging is very nice, too. The only real drawback on these sets is the opening credits are only on the first episode of each disc. Also, the original \\"teasers\\" which were shown when they were originally aired and in reruns are missing. Hopefully in future releases they keep the opening credits at the front of each episode, complete with teasers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"I ordered season 1 and 2 and watched every episode in order over a span of a few days.The video quality is very good. I have no complaints.I have to agree with some of the negative things regarding the audio. Season 2, Disc 6 had the noises and very brief moments of humming/static noise. The other discs were fine. Also, it seems like the speaking volume (when the actors talk) is much lower than the music. Many times I have to really turn up the volume on the TV to hear them talking, and then getting blown away when music plays because it's so loud.Despite these minor flaws, I recommend getting both season 1 and season 2, and each season as they are released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series...Poor release.","review":"This series deserves a better release than this one. I was very excited to see that this series was finally released...until I got it home. The picture quality was not up to DVD standards. Most of them look just okay, a few of them were dreadful. I haven't had any of the sound problems that I've read about on here. But the worst part is NO OPENING CREDITS?! what were they thinking? I want to see the pre-show teasers as I did in the 70s and I want to see the opening credits as I did in the 70s...ON EVERY EPISODE. Nice try, better luck next time...Michael Landon wouldn't have stood for this if he were still here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't WAit!!!!","review":"I am so glad that this show is made available- Before all you could buy was certain episodes, but to me all the shows were wonderful!!

Season one is just terrific! Hundred Mile Walk was SOOOOOOOOO good! also A Harvest of Friends and Country Girls were excellent!! Most of the 24 episodes are just super, but there were a couple I could have done without: namely The Love of Johnny Johnson, in witch Laura (who looks like she's about 5 years old) falls in love with 15 year old Johnny Johnson; and The Lord is My Shepard pt. II, in which Laura meets some angel at the top of a mountain.

A family favourite that sits right up there with the Waltons, this is a wonderful stroll down memory lane.Set in harder, yet in so many ways simpler, times LHOTP is a welcome relief from the sadistic and sewer garbage that dominates the TV screens these days.The transfer to DVD could have done with more TLC - as with the Waltons DVDs this release is pretty much just a simple copy and paste from the original tapes with no effort spent on remastering the picture and sound.But such is the strong appeal of this show with its focus on good honest family values and the community spirit that the mediocre transfer quickly takes a backseat to the sharing of life with the Ingalls.Look out Season 2, here I come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best TV Show Made From The Book","review":"I love Little House On The Prairie.

These are hands down the WORST video and audio mastering jobs I've ever seen.The bitrate on these DVD's is horrible, the sound quality is horrible; the video is seriously on par with an average VHS tape. I don't know WHAT they did to the audio - but Charles sounds like Mickey Mouse half the time it's mixed so badly.The only way some of these reviewers could be remotely happy about these is if they are so emotionally attached to the show that they are blinded to the reality of how shoddily and quickly these were thrown together.The only thing that saves this is that the shows are so great.

I used a headset and the belt clip with this phone, and the phone dropped and hit my hardwood floor. The phone now only works on speaker and will not work anymore with my headset or on \\"Talk\\". This happened on my second phone as well after dropping it from a distance of 1 foot, and now it only works on speaker. How disappointing, and it was not covered for repair under my warranty. Great phone for 3 weeks! I hope you have carpeting in your home, because this phone can't take much abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disposable","review":"I was happy with this phone for a while after I got it but it went wrong too quickly. First, the antenna broke off. We don't have kids and are only two adults in the house. The phone was not subject to any kind of abuse. We like to take care of our things. But the antenna was just not very sturdy. We also take care to avoid battery memory issues by not charging it constantly, but rather letting it drain the power before placing it to charge on the cradle. Still, the battery life decayed very quickly. Right now, after only 5 years of gentle and casual use (we use our cell phone much more than the house phone) it will not hold a charge at all. Even worse, a new battery made no difference. And the battery replacement is too expensive just to try it out. I am very disappointed in this phone. I don't expect it to last forever, but certainly more than 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable & Feature-Rich","review":"We used this phone with Vonage VOIP.

Oh, the phone is all \\"la la la I love its range and clarity,\\" as other users report, but my face hits the Mute button as I talk. Unaware that my calls are muted, conversations break down into two kids with crappy walkie-talkies: \\"Hello? Hey, you there?

The base is compact and doesn't take up a lot of room. It has your basic options for ringer, phonebook, etc... The phone handset is pretty small and it can be a pain if you have your hands full and are trying to balance the phone against your ear and shoulder. Takes some practice to keep it from slipping back or forward. Other than that, I'm very happy with this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"People can't hear me","review":"I got this about a year ago.

I am finished buying panasonic phones, and for other products I buy, I will consider other brands first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handset sound volume issues during conversation.","review":"I really wanted to like this phone from all the good reviews, but received one with issues, returned it and received another with the same issues; so it must be the phone model.The below items do not involve using the handset speakerphone feature which requires a \\"wait for you\\" \\"wait for me\\" behavior; just normal handset.-When you first answer an incoming call, you usually have to wait a few seconds for the phone to make available 2 way converstion; otherwise, you can say hello and the caller can't hear you and you can't hear them.-During a call using normal handset, background noise and even regular conversation can cause the phone to block the volume of the caller as though you are using the speakerphone feature when you're actually not. After a few seconds the volume will become audible again. This issue causes bits and pieces of the conversation to go unheard. This happens more on long distance calls than on local calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone unsuitable for use in metropolitan cities","review":"I purchased this phone because I thought Panasonic made top-quality phones and 5.8 GHz speed gave me the impression that it would be a current edition and easy to program. Turns out, that isn't the case. It only stores the last 7 digits of incoming phone numbers, not all 10. I live in a large metropolitan city where all 10 digits are required for local phone numbers. When more 10-digit phone numbers are entered into the phone book, a \\"1\\" prefix is added by the phone, making it unsuitable for local calls. I contacted their online customer support several times and only received one reply -- a convoluted reply that didn't answer my question -- so I assumed that the limitations were true. Returned the phone and replaced it with a Uniden TRU-8660 that works perfectly in my area and is easy to program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive & Sturdy But My Brain Moves Faster","review":"This phone has a nice sturdy feel, a modern look, a good range, and good sound quality. The colors and lighting are attractive, the buttons are clear and easy to understand, and the speaker phone works pretty good. The only problem is that my brain moves faster than the phone can accept my typing, sometimes resulting in a mis-dialed number. If you have a bit of patience you probably won't have this problem but for those Type A frenetic types like me, it may be something to consider. Without shopping around, I'd say I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accessible Housing by Leon","review":"Don't bother buying this book if you are an architect, which I am.

There are 3 CDs in the set and some of the wack tracks on it should've been replaced with something by the hip-hop artists I mentioned above. Overall, The History of Hip-Hop is good, but I'd advise you to walk and get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm having a read problem with this book","review":"Jackie may have done some great things to keep her marriage together, but after reading this book, I wonder why she put up with Jack. It is really disgusting to read how he acted while many important events were going on. I've lost all respect for him and I can't feel sorry for her for putting up with it.What a poor excuse for a leader JFK was. It was all smoke and mirrors and we didn't know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, Rude-Awakening, and Yes Suprised","review":"I think that my title about says it all. I was in my teens when JFK was shot. I believed in all of the hype up and into my late adulthood. Now, I am extremely disappointed in finding out in greater detail of JFK's sexual problems. Not happy with Jackie in how she dealt with his sexual problems but given the times in which she lived I guess that this is what she had to do to stay with the man that she loved and father of her children. After about 3/4'a into the book I just about threw it down. The sexual over tones is so much that it is disgusting but I am hard believer in finishing a book once started. The extremely longrepeated parts of the 'Cuba 1' and 'Cuba 2' should have been shortened...we are not dumb we get it. My rating is based on the repeated sentences over and over and in part due to the depressing information that I have experienced in reading this book. The passage of this information is now in the hands of the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading book title...?","review":"The author could have steered her manifest talent away from an ongoing, relentless and often non-contributory attack of the late president's dalliances, and rather used the same space - or possibly less - to write a book about Mrs. Kennedy. Maybe it's a \\"chick-book\\" that I should have not invaded (it was given to me by my voracious-reading love after she read it, albeit with some discomfort) but I found myself quite put off by some of her dubious inclusions - e.g. \\"...JFK should have known the moral tenor of xxxxx, as she was introduced to him by Frank Sinatra...\\" (words not exact). Why the shot at Sinatra? This type of writing went on throughout the pages. I would not recommend the book, nor offer the one we own to a friend, as is our custom with most books we buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias.Bias.Bias","review":"According to Leaming, Mrs Kennedy was a major depressive without a scintilla of healthy self esteem. Her impression belies the fact that she raised two wonderful and talented children. I would love to hear Caroline's appraisal of this book. Mrs Kennedy was extremely intelligent,poised and introverted While the author may at times mention something admirable about her subject,but when she gets her breath, she manages to denigrate the positive, find something negative and attribute it to Mrs. Kennedy's poor self esteem. Frankly I found the book tiresome and was glad that I hadn't bought it. Public libraries are great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If I wanted to read a blow by blow of JFK's most notable presidential descisions, then I would read a book strictly about his presidency. The book is entitled \\"Mrs. Kennedy...\\" yet she takes the backburner. I also do not grasp how a book which was supposed to focus less on this particular era in Jackie's life (\\"America's Queen: The Life of Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis\\" by Sarah Bradford) gave the most important details. In short, the title of this book is false advertising at its worst and the author might have done well to spend less time trying to read minds. The most repeated themes of this book are contridictory and the writer's voice is projected too loudly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie - a true lady","review":"I have always admired Jackie and I found this book to be a sensitive work about her life.

I can't tell you how often themes are repeated and repeated to the point where it seems like the reader is assumed to be dumb because they aren't expected to remember an important point already made. Secondly, the exchange of a few letters - none of which are quoted from Jackie AT ALL - forms the premise of this \\"great\\" relationship between her and Harold Macmillan. Quite a stretch. But the real problem with this book is that there is total speculation about what Jackie is thinking and feeling. CHeckng the footnotes indicates nothing at all about where the author is getting all this. It's all interesting but its more like a pyschological fiction than a genuine piece of \\"missing history.\\" All that said - the speculation is interesting and well-thought out by the author - its just that this is about the author's feelings and thoughts, not Jackie's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled promise","review":"I read this book hoping it would be useful in a class paper I am writing on Mrs. Kennedy's White House Restoration, to provide a little background to her work. I was sorely disappointed. The crown jewel of her time in the White House was given a few pages. Stories of Jack's infidelities fill the book, and Jackie's responses to them. But little is said of Jackie's work, only of what she did in response or in aid of Jack's policys and behaviors. If you are looking for a Biography of Mrs. Kennedy, I'd suggest another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redo's, Re-records !","review":"Only ten tracks, 24 minutes and they are re-records.

It's not clear from the description - but it runs on both AC and batteries and it comes with 6 rechargeable batteries that recharge automatically when you plug in the speaker.

The sound quality and range was excellent for a relatively modest price. I say \\"loved\\" because after 7 months the product stopped working. Now I have to pay to ship the item back to the manufacturer in order to get it fixed or receive a replacement.To add insult to injury I found the customer service representative I spoke to on the phone rather rude and disinterested in my problem. He rattled through the warranty-return-address so quickly I could not write it down even after asking him repeatedly to speak more slowly. He demanded my contact information rather than asking politely for it without the use please's, thank you's and any apologies.I would recommend purchasing from a brand with higher quality and better customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for the first 2 months","review":"The iBall works great and has a strong signal.

Keeps perfect time and love not having to change the day and date. Have owned other Seiko watches and there are many to choose from. A problem that I've encountered is that the battery has gone out. I've tried to get one installed at a few watch repair shops and they told me I would have to mail it to Seiko. I contacted Seiko and sure enough, I have to send it to them to get a battery installed. Had I known that when I bought it I wouldn't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Beauty","review":"Really didn't think you could purchase a watch with any distinction for under $200, WRONG! This watch is incredible for the price. Very stylish with date and day display. I paid $900 for a Movado in April of last year, however, I find I wear it very seldom because of the style and looks of the Seiko. Can't go wrong with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Seiko i ever owned","review":"I purchased this watch in 2006. I thought it was a fine watch until it came time to replace the battery.My local Seiko dealer refused to attempt a battery replacement so i tried to do it myself. That was a mistake.

Do not buy this watch is my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"new watch","review":"This is my first non-gold color watch and I really like the change. So far it has automatically kept up with the various days in the months which is convenient. It is a Seiko so it is accurate as I would expect it to be.

Sadly the \\"epic\\" does not deliver if you like your fiction to be pacy and exciting. I valiantly plodded along since it is an easy enough read but found the book got bogged down by long passages of philosophy of life, love and marriage, none of which endeared me to this family who sin with impunity whilst their daily mantra is calling on \\"the only God\\". Their lives are tedious and their secrets and sins become repetitious and are just not interesting enough to recommend this book anywhere near to what I consider a 5 star read"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cairo Trilogy: Who Translated it?","review":"I very much wanted to buy this book, and read the pages available through the \\"Look Inside\\" section on the Amazon page. (I didn't want to give the book a star rating, but Amazon's system forced this upon me.)

For this reason I am not, with regret, buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"This three-generation saga of a decaying Cairo family will totally envelop you. Mahfouz creates a complete and detailed world of characters, places, atmospheres and emotions that you will be reluctant to leave.

Your antisipating for that test line to finally be dark like the control line so you know you are ovulating. One day I got a little bit of a dark line, but the next day I knew I was going to be ovulating because the test line does get dark like the control line and same for the following day which was my ovulation day.

I'm not planning to start my own business right now, but it has given me the tools to plan for my future. It's very easy to read, I read it in a couple of days, and it's full of great advice. Topics range from \\"Are you up to the challenge?\\" self-evaluations, methods of funding, how to be a fair boss, communications technology, and general encouragement for women in business. It's also very realistic, and breaks down the positives as well as the negatives so that you know what you're getting into.

But it does present sort of an outline of all the different aspects you need to consider before going there. And there are several great \\"mini-interviews\\" throughout the book from actual business owners highlighting working examples of each subject the book touches on.I would recommend this book for non-MBA types, those who are in the \\"just thinking about it\\" phase of starting their own business but are unsure about what all is involved.

You could say, How could he it be a great album when he was an amateur, but in reality Pat was putting it down with Screw(a legend Down South known for slowing down albums so they can be better felt)years before the release of Tops Drop. Pat was a real rapper and poet, not some hollywood backstreet rapper. This album speaks the heart of an american playa and his struggles and stife,backed by an onslaught of tight beats put down by platinum soul. The album is better than Big Pun and little short of Tupac,RIP."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"a very good book\\"","review":"This book is a blessing.

We found this to be the best piece of work by the author Tiffany L. Warren. The storyline flowed well with a very realistic plot. The characters engaged the reader with heartfelt prayers and thought provoking dilema's. We highly recommend this novel for a women's ministry bookclub.

I couldn't finish it. I just got the impression that these characters wasted their life. They couldn't seem to get dressed in the morning without asking God what to wear! At some point I just wanted them to be adults and make a decision! I could see if they meditated on some things but my goodness, it was just a matter of \\"Jesus, should I walk now, Jesus, what should I do, Jesus when will I do it\\" and for me it ruined the book. All three women fell into a bad category and if they were real I would tell them \\"Don't be so heavenly minded, that you are no earthly good!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it.

If you think this is \\"too cajun\\" for you, i.e. you're new to the genre and don't quite get the classic nature of this album, start with something like \\"La Pointe\\" by Balfa Toujours, a very excellent \\"classic contemporary\\" album of itself, which includes Dewey Balfa's daughter, Christine, on guitar and vocals. Once that one whets your chops, you can return to this one and see where it started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basics Blinded by the Lights","review":"Often blinded by the lights, bells and whistles of what appears to offer the best and brightest among us and often leaves the basics of character, judgement and morality the sad consequence of being left behind in the race for popularity, power and wealth. Seldom is loyalty among those qualities.Like a Christmas tree usurping the real meaning that Christmas was meant to observe, commercialization is often the outcome praised and enviable that ignores the lasting quality of more altruistic ideals or grandeur of simplicity that formed the anchor for such celebrations.The ability to keep foresight and hindsight allows the abilities of real heroes to maintain their luster despite the lures of momentary treasures and excitement of temporary thrills."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right gear","review":"Had an oppurtunity to use the kit.

There are many twists and turns in the plot. You never know who is lying and who is telling the truth. Some characters are telling the truth but not the whole truth others are totally lying and a couple are telling the whole truth. That makes it a very suspenseful and intriguing book. All in all is a book that keeps you on your toes and you can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perry Mason at his best (& worst)","review":"This is the 24th Perry Mason novel I've read (the 5th in the series), and it's Perry Mason at his best--or worst. For this is not the sanitized Perry Mason of television. The real Perry Mason routinely manipulates, suppresses, and, in this case, even plants evidence. Two eyewitnesses saw the bride kill her husband. She herself claims she did it. But she's Mason's client, so she couldn't possibly be guilty, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"chris","review":"Intelligent spy movie with great characters and cast.

However, it doesn't stay on. I have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. I was sold by SJP on this perfume when she appeared on Oprah. Loved it when I went to the counter at the mall to check it out. I have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. About an hour after I put it on I (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. Trust me, I learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay.

First of all, I LOVE Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City, so I was excited to hear of her perfume. Just by her personality I thought I would like it, and then I saw it on Oprah and couldn't wait to smell it. I finally made it to Macy's, and I must say I was disappointed. I thought it would smell maybe a little more citrus like, and a little less musk like. I put a little on and my roommate said it smelled a little like a man. I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it without smelling it and making sure it is for you first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so lovely...","review":"As some people before me said already, this scent isn't THAT lovely. I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity.My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture!

Unfortunately, I had destroyed all the packaging in the labor to get it open, or I'd have returned it immediately. Lessons learned. Try to open it gently (impossible), and KEEP everything.

Mary made sense of the most confusing dilemmas that all moms face."},{"rating":"2","title":"group study","review":"I initially bought this book for myself (after liking my library copy). I then suggested to my bible study that we use this book in our group. Like any book there are things you like/dislike. For the most part I really like all the things in this book. The writer doesn't get very deep. However, the topics she has chosen and the questions lead to a deeper discussion, which is better anyway. Overall, my bible study group does like this book. As with anything, it is what you make of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, those Silly Angels!","review":"What escapades they are up to!Has this press, this religion, totally run out of things to talk about, such that now we have to have a SECOND volume of discourses on Angels?I wonder how many of the students in this sad excuse for a religion ever make it past Volume III. I mean, I'll give the writer of the original two books some credit: they at least had the merit of people stopping panther attacks, men rising into the air, and the author being whisked all over the world and time like Aladdin on a magic carpet (Volume I)...and the never-realized possibility of hanky-panky between four youths in Volume 2.Where can this series possibly go next?Volume 21: Discourses on the Wings of AngelsVolume 22: Discourses on the Feathers of the Wings of AngelsVolume 23: The Feet and Hands of AngelsVolume 24: Thoughts on the Fingernails and Toenails of Angels (Very Clean!)Volume 25: The Asses of Angels"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Path with Heart","review":"It is a crying shame that this beautiful book is out of print. Lynberg is a wonderful writer, who has distilled wisdom from spiritual, creative, and philosophical writers and activists and directed that energy into defining how we can evolve into successful, generous people. I advise you to search out copies of this book, read it, absorb it, act on it, and pass it along. In moments when we question the very essence of what we have become as Americans, as citizens, as souls, Lynberg reminds us to look inside, identify our gifts and to share them with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A remarkable philosophical statement\\" -- Norman Cousins","review":"If you're looking for this book (which M.

Lynberg has also added a lot of new material in his latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The soloists manage to focus well enough on their solos. But on the choral pieces, they're not able to muster a consonant between them. Except for the occasional ss or ch or ooo, the choral texts are a blur of schwa. And, the first soprano is frequently inaudible.Is it possible for an ensemble to be OVER-blended? Something is definitely wrong with the mix! It sounds like they were going for ethereal, but instead of angelic, it sounds quite ghostly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achingly beautiful","review":"I'm a big fan of the American Bach Soloists - in many ways I prefer the pace and subtlety of their Mass in B Minor. In contract this version sounds somewhat clipped and precise. But this harmonia mundi version is nevertheless so enjoyable. The Kyrie is exquisite. Qui sedes ... in the Gloria and Agnus Dei sung by Andreas Scholl are worth the price of the CD - perfection. Check out the duet with Scholl and Zomer - wow! I only wish there were more information about the instruments ... it's clear this is performed by period instruments but there is little information about the musicians or the instruments. Considering the artful interplay between voice and instrument on this CD, for example the horn and bass in Quonium to solus in the Gloria - why no credits? Nevertheless this is a CD to enjoy again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost like they're not singing or playing...","review":"This performance is very hard to listen to.....very muted and restrained. One wants to say, \\"Hey, sing out.\\" It's almost like they wrapped cotton and duct tape around the choir and the instruments.....to hush their sound. Plus, the music is a bit too over controlled. Wow, let these singers and musicians loose. One would expect more from a piece of this stature. Granted, the Klemperer is a bit over the top. I wish I had bought the Gardiner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swingle Singers in a Bus Accident?","review":"As much as I hated this record, like a rubbernecker can't stop looking at a traffic accident, I couldn't stop listening to this recording. The sound was freakish. The chorus sings accurately, but with a strange romantic lushness. I thought they might have been the Swingle Singers (does that date me?) or a small group from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. That coupled with the overly recorded period instruments (yes, those are the sounds of the bassoon's keys being played) was bizarre. I kept thinking that a busload of singers from the Mormon Tabernacle had gotten into a wreck with the Concentus Musicus Wien. That said, at least this recording has more character (odd, though it may be) than the Harnoncourt. Somewhere there must be a decent period recording of this masterwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe all the 5-star reviews...","review":"...because this is by far the most boring, lifeless, soporific of all the HIP recordings of the B minor mass that I know.

Absolutely great shells!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"RecommendationI recommend this book to children 12 and older because it is based on an historical war in Southern America. The events that took place were interesting and frightening. It was also a story about friendship. The narrator's friends Lolo And Ignacio get captured into the revolution army and then he got them out of the army. \\"You must get out of the army and become a school teacher like you had dreamed\\". Another example of friendship is when Uno is watching Lolo to make sure he does not run from the soldiers. \\"Uno new without glancing at Lolo that he was thinking 3 men standing around us should I run or not run\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"War Storie of Centrial America","review":"Pablo Ramirez or Known as Uno; he was 14 when he was taken by a group of men known as the Revolutionaries. They are fighting against a different army called Loyalist. The Revolution army is trying to take over so the country will have a government like ours. This is the countries forty-third war, that Uno is fighting in. Uno is an honest soldier in this book. That kina makes it interesting I don't like that Uno ask a bunch of questions to Captain. I thought it was stupid of him.I would recommend this book to who ever likes suspense, action, and likes war stories. Those people who like those things will like this book. To find out to what happens to Uno you have to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Geese & the Ghost","review":"This CD would be interesting to any Genesis fan. While musically this album is nothing special, and sometimes a bit dull, but it helps you understand what went into the early Genesis works. Sometimes you can almost hear the same tunes as you would expect to find in the Trespass, Nursery Crime, etc.Anthony Phillips has had a fundamental influence on early Genesis while he was with the group. Apparently after leaving the band he had stayed close to his guns and never ventured too far from it, at least so in the time frame of The Gees...Definitely worth to be included in a full Genesis collection, next to Steve, Tony, Mike, Peter, and Phil.Master of Times is nice, though.I give it 4 stars for the \\"historic and collectors value\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Genesis To Revelation","review":"Having been a fan of Genesis from what I thought was the inception (Nursery Cryme) - well, at least in the formula that consecrated them - imagine my Revelation when I started to dig in their earlier work and found out about this guitar player, Anthony Plillips, which quit the band before it became famous. Digging a bit further I found he actually had a solo career. Listening to his albums, I then understood that much of what I loved about the early '70s sound of Genesis was based on his contribution. Not to diminish the roles of the other giant artists that comprised this most accomplished prog rock band, of course, but one needs to listen to this album and judge for themselves. The music is sublime and even if you don't agree on this point, it will be at least an interesting historical finding. A must have for any prog rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"And then there were 3 [outside of genesis]","review":"I first heard this album 12 or so years ago and loved it . Out of what I have heard [Sides, PP&P1&3,and a couple of others I can 't recall only Private Parts and Pieces #2 seems as good , if not better.It definetely requires a love of renaissancey english folk type stuff ,and makes you wish genesis had gone this way after Hackett left, or at least after Duke! Collins vocals are beautiful and stark - no megastar bluster or smoothness here.Rutherford seems to pkay the same sort of invisible support guitarist role as in pre 78 genesis -but here there are probably 10 guitar and co. tracks to the tune on some much more. All in all like a walk in Middle-Earth in the spring and fall well into the fourth age in Arnor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"I bought this a year ago after liking the samples, and have rarely been so pleased with a purchase. This is tranquil, contemplative, earnest music. The 12-string guitar dominates, with an occasional injection of mellotron, and the odd explosion here and there. The second disk of demos is even better than the original album, especially the poignant and beautiful \\"Master of Time,\\" so I would certainly grab the two-disc set.For those who want to compare this to Genesis, imagine an album of \\"Stagnation,\\" \\"Dusk,\\" Entangled,\\" \\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats,\\" and \\"Mad Man Moon.\\" I have been a Genesis fan for over 20 years. \\"The Geese and the Ghost\\" will not grab you by the throat like \\"The Lamb\\" or \\"Watcher of the Skies,\\" but easily ranks as an equal to the best of 1970's Genesis. And for those who don't know/like Genesis, don't worry, even the presence of Phil on vocals (2 tracks) shouldn't turn you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful remastering job!","review":"The 12 string guitars and the string sections just ring out so clearly in this 2 disc remaster. Wonderful CD booklet complete with lyrics, album covers/single covers/promotional material photos, and the story of the making of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album- buy the rest only for their covers","review":"This is really a pretty good album and if you like the old Genesis this is sure to please. I've heard about 4 other albums by Phillips and they are EXCRUCIATINGLY boring but oddly enough they feature some of the greatest cover artwork to ever grace an album- in fact, several seem to be take-offs of the previous cover- sort of a serial type of thing and exhibiting a great deal of humor which cannot be said about the music contained within!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Martin!","review":"It's Martin so what else can you ask for.

Not even the likes of - Blanca Estrada, Cristina Galbo, Sara Mora, Loreta Tovar, could save this sad excuse of a picture. Adriana Vega even had a bit-part (uncredited), reading a newspaper ad.

I would suggest it for younger children. What is nice is that it is used on your TV set which makes it much bigger than a hand held or computer game.

If you're looking for the orignal tetris music and graphics, you will not find it with this game. Still, I found it ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Fun while it lasted.

I think this is the very best album Larry ever put out. The song \\"Perfect Peace\\" is such a moving composition, that I have decided to have it played at my funeral.

Awesome album .. nuff said !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...","review":"this is perhaps the ONLY Larry Carlton album that I can listen to over and over again...and I have been doing just that since the album came out on vinyl many years ago. My favorite cut is \\"Perfect Peace\\", and one has to listen to it on a quality stereo to appreciate it fully. The whole album is gorgeously recorded, and that is important for audiophiles like me. I recently bought the CD version (one of very few albums that I feel I want both formats)...it's good, but cannot compare to the vinyl version. I wish Larry would make another like this; \\"DISCOVERY\\", the follow-up to \\"ALONE\\" is truly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps His Best","review":"I have been a huge fan of Larry Carlton for years. His career has taken him several directions. But, I find his acoustic music to be his best. My favorites on this CD are Smiles And Smiles To Go, The Lord's Prayer, and Perfect Peace. The only bad thing about this CD is that is too short. This is some of the most relaxing guitar music out there. Purchase this one...you will be glad that you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book light reading, happy ending","review":"This book is well written. The story is about life, and while not that substantial, it's an easy fast compelling and light read. You'll enjoy it anytime and anyplace.

They were all cute, in college heading in the right direction armed with much sex appeal and wasn't afraid to use it. Jazmyn seemed to be the most logical one of them all, but my assumptions were quickly deterred as her character was extremely naive at times letting Brea's words echo in her thoughts. Trina was the spoiled, book smart, big bootay sista of the trio who quickly learned that life wasn't all peaches and cream without having daddy to depend on. Brea was a mess! She was very manipulative, influential and the biggest freak of them all realizing that sex can get you ALMOST anything you think you may want:-) Overall the book was a good fast page turner just as his first novel. There were lots of twist, turn and many many scandalous steamy sex scenes. Keep em cumming Winston :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cliffhanger!","review":"OH NO, CHAPMAN...don't leave us hanging! This was a good book.

It has to be said that meanwhile this exhibition has been partly revised after a number of court trials revealed a considerable number of untrueisms.Yet, it is a fact that some German soldiers were involved in mass shootings of members of the communist party and jewish civilians, and for that it is a necessary book. On the other hand, a whole number of incidents simply did not occur as shown in this book, many were committed by the NKWD (later became KGB) and the Germans got blamed for it. Let me point out, this is not opinionbut things which were found out during court trials before German courts, and even former KGB members testified this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in thisCD.

Both were fine mathematicians and anything they would have had to say about mathematics I would have wanted to know. Not surprising as I was a professor of mathematics at the University of California. I admit to not knowing much about philosophy and this book is concerned with Godel's philosophical thinking. I learned for example that Godel rejected logical positivism which was interesting to me. But when I also learned that Godel created ontological proofs of the existence of both God and the hereafter; proofs that Godel acknowledged would be unconvincing to those who weren't already convinced I began to feel there wasn't much meat for me to chew on in this book. A few chats with professional philosophers about Godel's well known philosophical views convinced me - the book was not for me.Apparently Wang thought otherwise and so you have to decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the actual title nor the actual book.","review":"If you are looking for James Huddleston's book called RUBE, this is not the one.

It took some time for the completed Mahler tenth to acheive wide acceptance, and will take awhile for this Bruckner ninth to do the same. The recorded sound is excellent, the booklet unusually informative and the often slower than usual tempi lend a more \\"majestic\\" atmosphere, but with no loss of forward momentum. There are at least a dozen excellent recordings of the most popular symphonies, the fourth and seventh, and there are no great revelations in those performances in this set, but the rest, save the 1981 recording of \\"Symphony 0\\" are at least among the best 3-5 recordings I've heard.

But back to the book, I felt that Tori was very forgiving of Jake despite the fact that he walked out on her for a year without a word whatsoever.

This story is so slow and the author repeats the same things over and over again. Another thing is that black people do not talk like the characters the author is portraying. This is a good book title, but it needs another storyline with stronger black characters that don't pretend to sound white. Sad to say, I could not finish this book because it was going in circles. I skimmed through it and of course, predictability was inevitable. The main character, Jake, really was not what one would call a \\"prodigal husband.\\" Thomas should have made his character more like the prodigal son of the Holy Bible. Jake didn't do enough dirt to be considered a prodigal husband.I'd like to see Terri MacMillan or Sister Souljah rewrite this story using the same title, or perhaps a strong contemporary christian fiction writer could rewrite it.I love christian fiction, but I wasn't feeling this story at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Plot Thickens...","review":"The Prodigal Husband is a must read. The Author combines romance and christian beliefs to create one well written book. I might add that the television advertisement was a great move.The title of the book is perfect. Jake is the Prodigal Husband who strays from his wife Tori. Sheila is the conniving business partner who succeeds in tempting Jake to commit adultery. I was in shock at how devious Sheila was and how no act was beneath her...if it would break up Jake's marriage. A tradgedy of the worst kind also weighs heavily on Jake and Tori's marriage survival. The plot thickens to enhance this well crafted novel with a long kept secret as to why Aunt Kate does not care for the Madison men; Nicholas...the handsome writer who carries a torch for Tori and Charlene's strained relationship with Jake's brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading and interesting characters","review":"Ms Thomas has just graced us with her second Christian Fiction novel and again, she has done a superb job.

We have always removed the plug and throw it away so it won't be accidentally swallowed, but these last balls for nearly a year, even with incessant chewing by jaws that have demolished all other, lesser toys. Furthermore, at the 3-year check up, the Vet asked how we brushed her teeth because she had the healthiest 3-year old teeth she had seen. Since we don't do ANY dental hygiene for her, it has got to be due to the constant chewing on this ball. I guess the nobby protrusions act to clean her teeth and massage her gums.

Follows the show well and it's fun to get the background of the stories. Excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"a misnomer","review":"The title of this book is misleading. I was looking forward to a good read about a real travel adventure and instead found myself reading a self-indulgent memoire. There is very little that is independent about the itinerary (the entire trip is booked before she even leaves the US) and the author mulls over her own life experiences instead of painting images of the world she is meant to be exploring.This book is simply too average to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unadventurous traveller ever","review":"I cannot believe that in this day and age someone could write a breathless account of her travels with a bus package tour in Italy - and find a publisher for it! The author of this book takes herself so seriously in her faux-independent travels, sending postcards to herself form her various totally boring destinations - that it almost fits into the \\"so bad it's good\\" category. But not quite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and Well Written","review":"For people who are expecting a series of essays on the culture of small towns and cities in Europe, this book will be a disappointment. This is more a travelogue of someone's self; Alice Steinbach's journeys are more inward than outward. That said, she writes about travelling alone, dealing with the passage of time and thinking about her past and present relationships in clear, engaging prose. I read this book on a long train ride, which might be the ideal conditions for reading Without Reservations. I thought it was a real pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I was given this book to read and was told that Alice Steinbach was a Pulitzer Prize winner. Sure enough, in the back of this book, was that information. I was, because of this, expecting some very thought-provoking, talented writing. Instead, I found that the author wrote as though she were a high-school student. The one thing I did find interesting was that she traveled around the world. I DID like the format and pictures in the book. They were undoubtedly appealing. There just wasn't enough there to hold my attention for long. Ms. Steinbach's ideas are certainly interesting, but they have not been presented in a fluent, educated manner. I am only unhappy that there are no half-stars, becausif I could, I would give Ms. Steinbach ONE AND A HALF STARS, to give her at least a little credit for her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor Desperately Needed","review":"Perhaps Ms. Steinbach is not altogether to blame for this self-indulgent book that's so annoyingly larded with first-person pronouns. Let's point the finger at the publisher, who should have assigned a REAL editor to this project, not some marketing specialist masquerading as an editor, as is so evidently the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland on the Loose","review":"I was disappointed in this book, which I and my book club were looking forward to. What's the opposite of a tell-all memoir? The author mentions such events as meeting a foreign man, re-meeting him, and having an affair with him--but discreetly doesn't make him a subject of her story. Not that I'm prurient--this is just one example of the surface-skimming manner of the book. Alice (who writes herself postcards, a cloying device) sets off for adventure, a year of travel. Nothing much happens. She gets sick and some women take care of her, but we don't learn very much about them, about the countries she visits, or even about Alice. (To be fair, I'm writing this from the memory of a book read a few years ago.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous Independent Traveler","review":"I lived in Italy for a year and Paris, France for two years before I settled down and had a family at 29 years old.I read this book because my book club chose it. When I read the back cover description and review, I became excited that I would be revisiting places I had loved. Alice Steinbach writes well, but I felt she didn't really feel or see the places she visited in a way that I found stimulating or educational. I had to make myself finish the book because it felt shallow and lifeless for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Self-Involved Woman","review":"I found this book excruciatingly dull. It is about nothing except the author. It tells nothing of any city--at least not enough for anyone who doesn't already know the (few) cities mentioned well to get a feeling of them--nor does she ever go off the beaten path. (Even to go to Perugia and Sorrento, neither of which she even writes about, she goes with a group). What this book is, for the most part, is her \\"twee\\" postcards to herself (all addressed \\"Dear Alice\\" and signed \\"Love, Alice\\") and her junior high school musings about the man she's met in Paris and is having an affair with. If your idea of travel clothes are silk suits and you consider buying a black cheomsang style dress or wrap-and-tie espadrilles the height of daring, you may enjoy this. The author is a reporter, so I'm surprised she shows so little interest in other people--or in places, history, art, anything besides herself, for that matter. As for independence, this baby hasn't come a long way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to engage","review":"I found this book to be very detached in the author's approach to the people she met and her travels in Europe. This book utterly failed to engage me compared to say the Best American Travel Writing 2000 which was full of wonderful perspectives of people and places. I found the writing good - quite readable but the author is very aloof and I was unable to identify with someone who although lived for some time in Paris just stayed in a hotel and made no attempt to really live in the city - there was no meeting of locals - just other tourists and no real empathy, awareness or stimulating knowledge of the environment considering the amount of time she must have spent in Europe. Altogether very disappointing as she is obviously a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess You Had to Be There","review":"I was eager to read this book; after all, who wouldn't love to take an extended leave from his/her job and live in Paris, Oxford, and Italy? The book, however, is a sad disappointment. Alice Steinbach, a former reporter for The Baltimore Sun, has neither the wit nor wisdom to entertain or instruct. The writing is curiously flat and lifeless, her observations about life are mere platitudes, and her postcards to herself quickly become trite and embarrassing. I'm sure this sabbatical transformed her life, but she is unable to translate her experiences for the reader. Guess you had to be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star - barely","review":"I picked up this book because I am also travelling to Europe as a single woman. Thinking I could get some insight on how to manuever in a foreign environ. Wrong. Talking about affairs of the heart and referring to other authors doesn't do much to inspire me. Or others I would imagine. Talking about places to go, great. Talking about the cat back home, not interesting. Perhaps it was marketed incorrectly. It should be marketed as a diary, not a travelogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"I found this book on my library shelves and after perusing through a few pages, I took it home. I'm so glad. What an enjoyable read. A memoir of sorts about Ms. Steinbach's travels and how the places and people affected her. A travel guide? No way and not written to be one. But instead, an encouragement by the author for us all to put aside \\"reservations\\" and take a path by ourselves, discover places, persons and a bit of our own selves in the process. Her descriptions are excellent and put you in that place at the exact moment, that you can almost smell the lavender, feel the mustiness of an old church, the frivolity of a party. I recommend this book highly to those looking for their own path, without reservations. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, but not wholly fulfilling","review":"I read this book while living abroad and traveling from my home base for short trips here and there. I could relate to the feelings of trying to find who I am when I'm not labeled, but I didn't feel completely satisfied at the end of the book. I enjoyed hearing about the places, the food, and people she met, but wanted more of something to bring it all alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully descriptive","review":"I loved the locale descriptions included in her travels and traveled vicariously through her eyes. I dwelt in the depth of her characters, her unexpectd love interests, and the people she met along the way.

I got so much more than I had expected, and was sorry to have the book end. \\"Without Reservations\\" is non-fiction but reads like a novel in many ways. She is a fine story teller, and her descriptions of all that she observed in her travels, (from the distinctive and unpredictable rooms she rented in small European hotels, to the views of an amazing Italian countryside, as well as the wide array of interesting, yet unexpected short-term relationships she developed along the way) were vivid and very entertaining. I would have liked a little follow-up regarding her life since her travels which took place back in 1993, but this is a minor complaint. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but independent. Trite and embarrassing drivel.","review":"Anything but independent. This book was at points embarrassing especially the fling with the Japanese man. Expensive hotels and meeting friends along the way. Not much self discovery or true solo traveling. I found the author self-centered. Why do these women travel writers always find a lover along the way, too. How about truly traveling solo. I think there is an underlying need for a man to make them whole. So many smart independent women travel to off the beaten path locations who could write much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about me","review":"The book starts out promising: Here is a successful single-mom who is beginning to wonder if she's so independent after all. Then she proceeds to travel around the world like the whole place is a theme park. The pronoun \\"I\\" is used ~ 3,000 times (calculated by counting the number of \\"I\\"'s on a random page and multiplying by the number of pages in the book). This isn't a story of self-discovery or personal growth. It's a journal of someone who's very self-conscious and never grows out of it. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This is a wonderfully written book about a woman taking a year off of her life to see if she can find the woman she wanted to be. I could relate to the musings about her children being grown and her love for them as adults, yet her sadness at the passing of the time of them as children. Her descriptions of her times on her trip brought locations to life that I have never seen. But most importantly, she traveled to find herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quel disappointment!","review":"A friend recommended this book to me so I began reading it fully expecting to enjoy it. But it didn't take long for me to start to develop a strong dislike to the author and her tale. The device of the cards posted to herself from various places seemed juvenile and the postcards themselves fell far short of literary masterpieces. Rather than a free-spirited travel book, this is a very self-conscious piece of mediocre writing by a woman who strikes me as anything BUT independent... The references to art, literature, opera, etc. smacked of pseudo-intellectualism. The account of her affair with the Japanese man was embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to disagree","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I am about the same age as the author, and I spent much of my 30s and 40s as a solo traveler. But I found this book full of cliches, self-justification, and name dropping. Sorry, folks...."},{"rating":"1","title":"My reservations","review":"This book is all sell - great bookjacket, good idea, poor execution and the author doesn't even seem to know it. She is a fine prose writer from a technical standpoint, but has so little wisdom or insight into her own life, such a case of a somewhat developed intellect over soul. Flimsey and shallow, don't waste your time. Steinbach just isn't interesting enough to travel with if you're over 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This would have to rank as the most tedious, self-indulgent drivel I have ever had the misfortune to read.

She travels WITH her plans and reservations all made ahead of time, and most of the book is about her NON-independent time with the interesting people she meets on the way.

Peggy is able to identify the man who escaped after the police capture him, but a friend of hers tries to convince her that the man is innocent. If this is true, there are many suspects. Bell was a real womanizer and many women and their husbands had reason to kill him. Also there was considerable professional jealousy within the art department.

Merrick uses great ingredients. The first few ingredients in Cowboy Cookout are beef, beef broth, sweet potato, carrots, green beans, apples & peas. Plus, Merrick does their own manufacturing. To me, that's a big deal - no enormous plant that manufactures food for dozens of different companies. (Seems that once one brand of food at these large plants is recalled, others follow. Including some supposedly premium brands.)I'm happy with my dogs' health on Cowboy Cookout. But, they'd be doing just as well on any of the Merrick canned food.

Of course keeping it age appropriate is a must as the darts do come out much faster/harder then most other similar types of guns.

Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture is more comprehensive in scope and, to my mind, better written. In particular, it provides a solid, highly pragmatic framework for understanding and utilizing patterns at 3 levels of scope/abstraction -- i.e., architecture, design, and implementation -- not only design. Moreover, the authors pay significant attention to variations of patterns, trade-offs between alternative patterns, and the relationships between patterns that in practice may need to be combined in order to accomplish the objectives at hand. The book's overall organization, presentation of material, and referencing of related pattern sources (including the GoF's work) is superb. This is my top patterns reference, with others as serving as adjuncts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second book on patterns","review":"Definitively, after reading the GoF book, get this one !

It take a little time to understand that the great idea is elsewhere. POSA book (this one) tackle directly to this great idea, and exposes several patterns categories (3, in fact). Architectural patterns are really well explained, much better than in the GoF. The POSA book receive less attention probably because authors forget the idea to \\"attract\\" newcomers, at least in my mind. Anyway, the Design Patterns is my \\"book of the Decade\\".

By the time children start formal education, it is actually much more difficult (and less fun!) for them to learn then it was when they were babies! For an inspiring and *scientifically sound* approach to the topic of early education, I IMPLORE you to first check out Glenn Doman's book, \\"How to Multiply Your Baby's Intelligence\\"--it will change you and your child's life immensely. Leave this stinted view of children's capabilities behind, and TEACH THEM--they are so hungry for learning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy sounds of the Seventies","review":"This collection contains all of Dawn's hits, like Knock Three Times (the very first seven single I ever bought), Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Old Oak Tree, Candida, What Are You Doing Sunday?, Who's In The Strawberry Patch ... and Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose?, plus their covers of other hits of the era, like Vaya Con Dios, Rainy Day Man, the Goffin/King classic Up On The Roof and James Taylor's Carolina In My Mind. Dawn were the masters of melodic vocal pop and they really shine on those hits, especially the aforementioned Knock Three Times which is a brilliant piece of power pop. Some of the covers are so-so, but overall this album takes one back to a happier, more innocent era that evokes pleasant memories. Dawn were Tony Orlando and two gorgeous female vocalists, and they certainly made their mark with their particular brand of seventies singalong sounds. If you like pop with personality, you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good oldie","review":"This was a gift to my uncle Randy and he absolutely loved it.He is listening to it probably as I type this.

I wrote to her in Japan and got an autographed picture back in 1994! She's awesome and has such a creamy and beautiful voice! I first discovered her on an old Columbia Jazz sampler from 1987. Her version of Jobim's \\"Dindi\\" appears on that compilation. I was so blown away by the beauty of her voice that I bought her first two American releases on CBS/Sony, \\"For Lovers Only\\" and \\"Follow Me.\\" After that, she disappeared but resurfaced again in 1994 with \\"Sophisticated Lady.\\" She is billed as the \\"#1 Female Jazz Vocalist in Japan,\\" but I suspect she's probably the ONLY ONE, which is a GOOD THING! After watching this DVD, I feel that much more connected to the face/voice behind the music that touched my heart twenty years ago. She reminds me of Barbra Steisand meets Nancy Wilson. She's great and I can't believe she's 62 years old! THAT does NOT seem possible at ALL! She's stunningly beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of junk bonds in the 1980s","review":"Today the phrase \\"securities fraud\\" evokes Enron, WorldCom and Tyco. Two decades ago, it evoked Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank that ruled the junk-bond realm and helped fund some of the most audacious corporate takeovers of the 1980s. Enthroned at the center of Drexel Burnham was the king of junk, Michael Milken. Was he a financial genius who found ever more clever ways to make markets more efficient? Or was he a swindler running the world's biggest Ponzi scheme? New Yorker writer Connie Bruck sets out to answer those questions in this cautionary tale of Drexel's rise and fall. getAbstract recommends this fascinating, highly detailed financial history. However, the flaw in Bruck's narrative is the absence of a third act: She inexplicably ends the book before Milken's trial and sentencing. While its ending is weak, this provocative story makes one thing clear: Uneasy lies the head that wears a leveraged crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Misdirected","review":"Spurious, sensationalistic, and, yet, uninteresting--Bruck somehow manages to exaggerate an inherently entralling story to the point of abstraction and, ultimately, of flavorless moralizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written and informative","review":"This is a good book for anybody interested in the late 80s shenanigans on the Street.

The dramatic events really keep you hooked, although at some points the level of detail requires hunkering down for the long haul. Overall, recommended for any Street junkie or anyone interested in Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for what it sets out to do but really leaves a lot out","review":"This is a decent overview of the malfeasance that was perpetuated by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken.

It didn't provide very good code examples and fewer explainations about the built in functions of VBScript. It gave an insight to VBScript's use with ASP and COM, but it neglected areas it needed to clearify better. It covered a lot of extras and not the meat of VBScript so I had to turn to other books for clear explanations and good code examples. If I hadn't had a college instructor this book would have been of little help as a sole resource to VBScript."},{"rating":"1","title":"Index is Incomplete... Very Hard to find things","review":"I bought this book because there was nothing more recent and I figured it was a Wrox book so it should be complete.However, the Index is very small and incomplete.Very poor work. I could not find the Trim Function in the index and there are probally a lot more topics I won't be able to find over time in the index.For a reference book, the index should be very complete and this one isn't.The other readers are correct, you can't find Functions in the index.You should be able to find simple and difficult topics for a reference book in the index and this one doesn't fit the bill.Seems like this book was poorly edited and produced so it could make a deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book - even for beginners","review":"Great Reference - Good examples, wish the index covered sample code better. Many functions and examples were in the book, but not found in the index. One of the more useful books for VBScript using it as straight programming for reading files and processing directories from a command window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Read, Useless for Reference","review":"Like most of the reviews here, I liked this book. The information was presented well and the examples were good. Once I had read the chapters I was going to read though, the book became a bit useless. If you look something up in the index, it will send you to pages where the word happens to be used, even if it was only used in passing. It's like they used a vbscript word-search to create the index. Totally useless. The appendix that is supposed to be a reference is organized by types of things like file system objects, or WMI objects. This is great if you're browsing, but if you're actually looking for something specific, you're SOL. The appendix is not even covered in the useless index. Good read though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a beginner's book (as they said)","review":"Here is what they wrote under \\"Whom This Book Is For\\" (the very next page after \\"Contents\\"):--If you are a complete beginner who has heard about VBScript and have come this far, that's great.You've come to the best possible place. As a beginner, you have a fascinating journey ahead ofyou. We suggest that you go through this book from cover to cover to get the best from it.--Unfortunately, that's not true. For the most part this book fail to provide enough VBscript examples, just covering theory and that is not in much detail. References for VBscript objects, methods, properties are copy-pasted, that could've been done in Appendix section. Authors failed to discuss VBscript examples completely, they didn't discussed enough of FSO (File System Object), many terminologies came out of the blue - without any introductory discussions, confusing a newbie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever You're Looking For, It's Not In Here","review":"I cannot begin to count the times I've referred to this book and closed it with \\"I can't believe they don't have [fill in the blank] in there!\\" Save your money to buy the O'Reilly (\\"seal\\") book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Functions or Subs!","review":"Bought this book 'cause I wanted a VBScript language reference and it sounded good.

Just rubbish.","review":"When I saw the topic of \\"VBScript Programmer'sreference\\". I thought this just what I want.(so stupid Iam). Because I'm an experienced VB programmer, a reference seems good enough for me. But in this book, it's not only very difficult to find function, actually, they didn't put a lot of useful functions in this book. If you see the back of this book, they will tell you what this book covered. covered? or mentioned? 800 pages book, mentioned everything but useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a reference on VBScript, but on HOW TO USE VBScript","review":"This book isn't a reference in the way you would think, but it is good at showing you real world examples of how you'll end up using VBScript. If they really only wanted a reference book they would have just published the pages from Appendix A, which is the part of the book I end up referring to most, but not having an index makes it difficult. Overall, a good reference - not on the language itself, but on its implementation and uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, be sure to buy the 2nd Edition","review":"This is an outstanding book. At first I was confused by some of the older reviews, until I realized that Amazon is still selling the old 1st edition, and many folks are buying that one instead of the newer, much better Second Edition.Be sure you're buying the Second Edition! That book's ISBN is 0764559931. It's the one with the picture of three authors on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"As another reviewer has noted, any book that has eleven authors is bound to need a good editor, but this one shows no sign of even having been looked at by a copy editor. Many sentences don't make any sense at all, the cringe-inducing substitution of \\"it's\\" for \\"its\\" occurs all too often, the first person singular appears inexplicably (who is \\"I\\"?), and some of the code samples contain obvious bugs.On the positive side, there is a lot of information in the book, but the lack of attention to the text makes one wonder about the quality of the information as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of useful information, but...","review":"The author never does address what skill level is necessary to fully appreciate this book. From my reading it should be clarified at the beginning that this book is not for beginners. Being new to ASP I found this book very frustrating to follow. It wasn't until page 51 did the author decide to inform the reader exactly how to 'run' scripts in Windows. From cover to cover I felt the book was organized poorly. However, if I was a more experienced programmer I think that I would better understand the book's layout and be able to 'fish' through this convoluted book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking for a VBScript reference book for work. One which I could use to look up a command/function in the index and find examples of the syntax within the book. In this respect the book was a total let down.I would consider this book to be a good introduction to the capabilities of VBScript, since it covers a wide variety of VBS topics (though not with much detail).Don't let the title fool you -- this is anything but a Programmer's Reference. Even fairly basic functions like left, mid and right are not found in the index."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized","review":"As informative as the authors try to be, trying to find any desired topic, in this book, is virtually impossible. The index is imcomplete. The examples are okay, but the book could be organized better. Too bad I couldn't recommend a better book. To be efficient, take the time to browse through the book and use small bookmarks to highlight the important sections. Personally, I've learned more and have been more productive with a good book on ASP."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best guide to the latest Microsoft tecnologies","review":"This book is not exactly what it's title suggests - I would say it's title somehow underrates it.At first, it helps you understand the core VBScript and how to write code in it.Then, it takes you to a tour to the newest Microsoft software innovations, such as the COM, Distributed COM and COM+, the Microsoft Transcation Server, the Micosoft Message Queue, IIS and ASP, the fascinating new \\"HTML Applications\\" and many more...Lastly, it includes the references you expect to find when you buy it - and these are very well-written, practical and organized.However (and that not the book's but Microsoft's fault), VBScript is not the language of choice to manipulate the technologies mentioned above - a REAL programming language like Python can do the job much better.So, no matter how odd this may seem to you, if you want to script the Win32 platform, I recommend the use of this book together with O'Reilly's \\"Python Proggraming on Win32\\" by Mark Hammond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't judge this book by its cover...","review":"I was looking for a good \\"reference\\" book on VBScript that would cover each function, their methods, properties, etc. While this book does indeed contain this information, its only 100 of its 800 pages (in an non-indexed appendix). It tries to be a little bit of everything (COM, ASP, browser controls to name a few), but doesn't excel at any of its topics. For example, there is a 16 page chapter on using COM components in MTS (this is supposed to be a Visual Basic Script reference guide remember!) This is a topic that can't even be introduced in 16 pages.The book almost seems like outtakes from books that never quite made it to print.If you're looking for a good VB script reference, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue DVD","review":"This DVD stopped right in the middle, which was very upsetting to a 4 year old.

It's amazing how absurd this series has become since the UK days, and this is the worst of all of it. The writing is awful, the message is ludicrous, and even my 4-year old is sensitive to the contrived story and nonsensical plot contrivances. This is basically a 90-minute toy commercial written by people who have never seen a train before, and don't seem to know how they work or what they are for.Roger Corman movies are far more realistic and interesting. Instead of buying this, get a collection of old episodes before the CGI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas & Friends: Misty Island Rescue","review":"My kids love Thomas movies.

I actually had to use a GMC dremel to remove a screw that was stripped from factory to change the blade. Thus, I have not actually used the blade the saw came with.Contacting customer support for replacement parts on the screws which needed replacement was useless. They simply took my name and number to have someone return my call, ultimately ignoring me.Otherwise, with a high end blade and alot of adjusting, this unit works absoutely great. The laser feature is extremely useful when making most cuts and does not use additional batteries like some cheap units may require. The brake feature works pretty well and still runs like the first day of use. Dust bag works decently alone, capturing maybe 40-60% of the total debris with no vacumm. Lock included.Great value and recommended if you don't mind spending some time adjusting out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"GMC 15 Amp Dual Bevel Miter saw.","review":"This saw has plenty of power. The saw is easy to use. The miter stops are acurate. The laser works well. It could, however, be a little bit brighter. I gave it a 4 star instead of a five because the saw tends to tip to the right or left when placed at a right or left bevel angle. Idealy this saw should be bolted to a table when making bevel angle cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap in a bottle","review":"I purchased this stuff because a friend recommended it because I have a serious issue in my basement (where I sleep) with Spider Crickets, aka Camelback Crickets and Cave Crickets.

I sprayed the outside of my house, and in the basement, and surprise surprise it didn't even faze these nasty little insects. I even sprayed one directly with the spray to see if it even did anything and the cricket just hopped away, perfectly fine! uhhhh so frustrating. I would not recommend this stuff.

I continually had all sorts of bugs and critters finding their way into my home. This was never the case with the Spectracide 9-month product. Perhaps I did have to re-spray it every 6 or 7 months but I didn't have any bugs crawl into the house with that product.

(I have used the bait traps in the past but they are a little unsightly and tend to bring more ants before they get rid of any). I decided to start early this year before the ants had shown up and this spray didn't do one bit of good. I applied a thick line drenched in this poor excuse for an insect killer around the house, the ants still came. I sprayed it on them directly they died alright but as soon as it dried ants walked right over where it had been sprayed. Guess they left out the part where you need to constantly keep the area wet with this garbage. Oh and it's definetly not waterproof, the stuff just washes right off in the rain.

Completely frustrated, I suddenly remebered my aunt (who is deathly terrified of bugs, like myself) always kept a gallon of Home Defense under her sink. I googled and found it on sale here. I was relieved, until I saw the price! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for hiking up the price of this product. Last week it was $20, now its $17.99. I got the exact same amount for only $8.99 at Target.I sprayed EVERY SINGLE corner, nook and cranny, inside and out. I haven't seen a bug since!

Did not see a decrease at all in bugs and they just kept stomping across the \\"barrier\\" that we sprayed down as if it was water so we still ended up calling an exterminator. This was $12.00 wasted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for spiders","review":"I know the description says it works for spiders (excluding black widow and brown recluse), but I thought it might work if I soaked them with it. I sprayed my firewood shed with it until it formed a puddle, and wolf spiders and several other kinds were walking right through it as if nothing happened. I sprayed a black widow in a crack for about 10 seconds straight and it just sat there. I waited several minutes, and the black widow just walked out of the crack like nothing happened. I sprayed a wolf spider about the size of a dime directly in the face, and he held his arms up like he was in attack mode. Then he walked away. It may work for ants or something, but it doesn't work for spiders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product not so great hose.","review":"now, the product works great for killing spiders, or ants idk what other bugs aswell, but as one other reviewer did say, The hose went bad on us, but you wanna know why? you really shouldn't leave the hose in the spraying position, i mean close the nossle and have no xtra spray in that hose with that lever, thats the only reason it prolly opened up, aslong as your wearing gloves and cloths its all good, the chemicals in that stuff isnt enough to harm us if a little gets on the hand or face, i had some back spray when spraying the wall, no irritation or any thing bad happened, spilt some on had twice \\"not a good sprayer\\" and nothing happened.

Unfortunately, it didn't provide any protection and it just seem like the bugs were saying, \\"That's all you've got?\\" Pffhh. My current solution to prevent bugs from entering my house were to use Raid instead. I sprayed near my main door and the outside of my basement's windows and that seem to keep them off for about two to three weeks. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this spray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give no stars if I could","review":"I tried this stuff because I have sugar ants coming through the window and eating my cats food, And I sprayed inside and outside. They are still coming in! I resprayed to make sure I didn't screw up and it does nothing to them unless you spray right at them! I even soaked the entire wall in this stuff and almost emptied the entire canister and it hasnt repelled a single thing! Most useless product ever, I will never buy another Ortho product again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it just for the sprayer","review":"For the record, I bought this at one of the big box stores. Even think it was a bit cheaper than Amazon. I have had success with the 'house' brands that sell for about $8 a gallon but the hand trigger type sprayer was just something I was used to.........until I got the Ortho Max. Simply connect the hose to the flip switch on the container and pull out the handle in the end of the nozzle and hold. It sprays a stream where you aren't constantly squeezing the trigger. The handle siphons and sprays, then you pull the handle out again. Three sprayer settings, too.Even if the bug juice is no good and I go back to what I was using, the sprayer is the bomb. I'll keep the bottle. Might even put herbicide in it. The pump kind of sprayer is a pain too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad trigger assembly","review":"Dont know if this product works.

I decided to try spraying them with this directly and it did absolutely nothing. I sat and watched a roach after I sprayed him and, other than being annoyed, it seemed fine. Ran around in circles for several minutes before I finally killed it the old fashioned way.I thought maybe I had gotten a bad one and I wrote Ortho asking for help. They sent me a form letter. Fine for them. They have my $15, but poor products and communication are enough for me to scratch Ortho off my list in the future.

I went from catching 4-6 per day to 1-2 over the past week.Bad news: 1 hour after soaking a slanted outdoor ledge underneath a window, I watched a young earwig crawl right over the treated area, he then proceeded into the cracks of my screen. 1 week later, earwigs are in full force, crossing any barrier I created with this product, and surviving.

Her character moves from being an overly confident heiress to a bumbling, blushing little schoolgirl who is in a tizzy over Tarzan's \\"Innocent/Natural/Virgin\\" state. Her father, James Parker (Richard Harris) is portrayed as an outspoken, vulgar,sex crazed expatriate obsessed with the elephants' graveyard and any female he can find. O'Keeffe's gives a \\"wooden\\" performance as Tarzan.Three Chimpanzees and a lone Orangutan follows the \\"Lord of the Apes\\".

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a unique look at fashion, and how fashion intertwines with real life and gardening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Commentary!","review":"Blevins' work is a great work into an often overlooked opinion of Revelation - that Revelation was written as a Greek drama, mixing the Greek notion of circular history with the Hebrew notion of linear history, showing God's defeat over evil specifically in the Roman empire and his promises to the persecuted believers of the first century. While I have no opinion of the theology of Revelation, this is a work that is a nice read that is outside the usual scope of 'isms' that usually are discussed when debating the nature of the book of the book. Although his work is succinct, I would not call it simplistic or shallow. But I would like to read a little more in depth on this particular position of Revelation. So, it is to the point, but not callow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video set up","review":"This was a very good start out for set up on our projector systems. Everything was straight forward in it's text, and very helpful. Only one problem keeping us from giving this DVD a 5 star was trying to get to different chapters was very difficult. Otherwise this was very useful. Great audio section in the first few chapters for set up of sound around. Hope they come out with a new version including DTS. Thanks again, great job.

This is probably only an issue for projection sets, and only if you plan to not have it professionally calibrated.Think TVs at your local Good Guys are set up correctly? I spent an afternoon doing comparisons of three sets from the same manufacturer using this DVD, and you wouldn't believe how differently they looked. Since the store wasn't busy, the kind salesman let us calibrate their sets for convergence, color, brightness, etc. using this DVD. Only then could a real comparison be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWEAK?

Even then, Rent It!","review":"For me, this purchase was a total waste of money... I have surround sound and a regular 27 inch Sony tv. I had set everything up well before even buying the disc, when I went through everything...nothing had to be changed. Now, if you have a serious, complex, advanced A/V system or don't understand how to set up your system, then this title is for you (even then I would still say, \\"rent it\\"). If you just have a TV and surround sound (a \\"normal\\" home theater..no offence to you A/Vphiles) then I don't think you need this....again, rent it, if you find it is helpful, then buy. For the price, I think it is not worth it. This DVD takes advantage of the fact that some folks still won't take the time to figure out how to program their VCRs. Final Verdict... Rent It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best A/V Setup DVD","review":"This is arguably one of the better setup discs around, if not the outright best. Two pieces of advice for peak tweaking: 1) for video setup you really need to do this at night with all the lights off, unless of course your screen is in an already very dark dark room; 2) watch the video all the way thru before making any adjustments, if you are a novice at this type of thing. For optimum audio tweaking you must have a SPL meter. Radio Shack sells one for $35.00 and it is well worth it. Also, make sure your running Dolby Pro Logic for any measurements and balancing of the surrounds. If you pay close attention to all the instructions you will be in for an audio-visual treat once you have completed all the tweaking - enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the diehard only","review":"You probably could live with out this DVD, but if you are a perfectionist you won't have any other option but to get it.

Be warned, you will look ridiculous looking through that blue peice of plastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive, doen't have convergence for projection TVs","review":"This DVD has good explanations of what it is doing, the use of the filter to set the color balance correctly was useful. Running this did actually marginally improve the picture.However, if you are a videophile with a projection TV there is one enormous omission: There is no pattern available to make sure the three colors properly converge on your screen. Incorrect convergence has a huge impact on picture clarity.This DVD is desperately in need of an update, it needs to take projection HDTVs into account. More attention to detail is required to get the best from the latest and greatest TVs and it just wasn't available here.As it stands this DVD is worth no more than $15. With a few more up-to date features (such as convergence) It'd be worth up to $25. As it stands I'm very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I have purchased the precursor to this disk in a laserdisk format.

I did the whole dvd & some of the moves were hard to do all the reps or have the correct form (ie Legs completely straight while laying on my back & having them up in the air), but that's why I'm a beginner. If I do this regularly, I know I'll stretch out & get in better shape. Also, you have the option of turning off the music OR turning off the instructors voice OR hearing both instructor & music. The reason I gave it 4 stars: the camera angles aren't the best -- you can't always see the modified positions (watch the dvd before hand so you have a clue), a little more stretching would help, you can watch some of the exercises at the end of the dvd, but she should recommend watching them before you start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting And Entertaining","review":"The descriptive and unusual experiences of a man raised on a cotten farm who helped build liberty ships and later rode the unpredctible atlantic on merchant marine ships transporting every type from wounded soldiers to war brides makes interesting reading.I could not put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview for the novice","review":"Although no one area is covered in any great depth, it provides enough general knowledge to point the reader in the right direction for further research.

(It took two days at a major Comic Book Convention). I was able to complete my run on most of the missing issues for $1 to $2 a piece. I don't think I spent more than $10 for any given issue, even the earlier ones. I WAS LUCKY!

I guess that if I have to say something positive about it is that the last 100 pages was the only part worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby...","review":"When I first bought this book, I thought it would be a classic hack and slash type of story. But after the first few chapters I realized that it definetly had more going for it. The story is about a medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta, and the recent serial stranglings that she is working on. It has politics, emotions, and a very clever killer. Although Kay's hunches usually lead her in a very large circle, it constantly keeps you on your toes. The ending was a little abrupt for me, but it didn't make the book any less wonderful. Overall, Patricia Cornwell succeeded in creating a very realistic and suspenseful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read !","review":"I read this book many years ago and followed it with the next half dozen or more in the series. Then I became too busy to ever have time to enjoy reading again. Now that I once again have the pleasure to read, I have gone back to the beginning of the Kay Scarpetta series via Kindle so I could enjoy them all over again and pick up where I left off. I think Patricia Cornwell is an absolutely amazing author. I have never read anything by her that was even a hint of a disappointment. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVED THE BOOK!!! I first read it when I was 11.

I got totally lost in the book as if i were there.Its wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle formatting detracts","review":"This is an enjoyable book to read in print form as were nearly all of the early Kay Scarpetta series. I had read Postmortem many years ago and decided to re-read the Kindle version. Unfortunately, the formatting in the Kindle version is poor in many places. It often takes several seconds to decide who is speaking because there is no indication in the formatting. This seems to be a problem with many of the Kindle books.In summary, Postmorten is an entertaining book and highly recommended, but the print version is less frustrating to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift matters","review":"If giving a gift, DON'T buy a can opener. This is a favorite autor of my wife's and she likes it. That's all that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely an original.","review":"I read this book soon after it came out. This was YEARS before the whole CSI genre. I thought \\"who is this Patricia Cornwell?\\". This stuff about forensics is so interesting and new. She coupled that with characters that you could like or find interesting and a great story. Fast paced. Interesting characters and really scared the boots off me while reading it alone in my house. I ended up reading the first half dozen books along with the her other book \\"Hornet's Nest\\" which was a big disappointment. After a while she really had played out the characters and cliche took over. But the first novels are still fresh and original. Loved them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent crime thriller","review":"Dr Kay Scarpetta has a difficult job on her hands investigating a series of horrific murders where the victims are all well-heeled young women. All of them are found naked, bound and strangled in the early hours of Saturday morning.As she unravels the forensic clues with the brash detective, Pete Marino, her task is made even more difficult as it appears that legal officials, who should be on her side, suspect her of compromising evidence and leaking to the press. The case is made even more complex when it appears that her ten-year-old niece, Lucy, has become involved. To cap it all, it looks like the perpetrator could have inside knowledge of the investigation.The reader is kept guessing almost to the very end of the book. The suspense is never-ending. That's the way that a good crime thriller should be, and this is one believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her normal excellence","review":"One of her early novels. Good reading and great suspense.

Personally, I prefer the characterisationof Alex Cross in James Patterson books thanDr Kay Scarpetta, though Patricia Cornwelldid impress me with some very fine writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a sappy woman's book.","review":"After hearing great praise for the works of Patricia Cornwell, I enthusiastically picked up \\"Postmortem\\" expecting a Thomas Harris or Michael Connelly like read. I haven't been more disappointed in a novel in a long time. The focus seemed to the relationships of the main character, Kay Scarpetta, not the crime and investigation. Big disappointment for this male reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of purchase","review":"I paid full price for this book which was the most expensive copy listed on Amazon.No where did it mention that it was coming without a dust jacket. Most of the others specifically mentioned that they did not have a dust jacket.I feel very strongly that I was misled into paying more money for something than what I had too considering it was not what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"POSTMORTEM .","review":"Another well constructed story from Ms Cornwell. I am never disappointed in this ladies writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious plot complicated by inept descriptions.","review":"The plot of this novel plods along slowly with several useless side bars. If you can stick out the first 100+ pages, the second half of the book picks up the pace. However, the reader is insulted throughout with ridiculous descriptions. One example would be explaining that a black man's voice sounds like Eddie Murphy. Clever. The book could have easily been edited down to 250 pages. Subplots with a niece and a potential lover are really worthless. If the second part of the book wasn't at least readable (for the most part), then this novel would be a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry woman.","review":"Scarpetta is some angry and tormented women inside. Her resenment and anger actually detracts from the narrative which is not that interesting anyway because everybody is one-dimensional. I used to enjoy Cornwell's, but not anymore. (I can't believe I even like the latter book in which Scarpetta was even angrier!) She relies on a lot of technological gizmos (including computer) which seems dated in the year 2000 (the book is originally published in 1990). Other than one angry woman, cookie-cutter characters and technological hoolaballoo, there is not much to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star rating?? can we give just a point on of the star?","review":"This has got to be THE worst book I've ever read!!! I hate reading in the \\"I\\" form, it makes the author look stuck up and doesn't appreciate the reader. There's no character build up or any drama involved. I put it down after the 1st 150 pages. Grrrrrr I hated not finishing a book but this one was TOO rediculous. The book is too long winded with too many unnecessary details. I wouldnt even give it a 1 star rating maybe like one point of the star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of something great.","review":"Book #1 of a wonderful series. I love Scarpetta. She's her own worst enemy, emotionally, at the same time as she is wicked smart and zen-focused on saving the world, one autopsy/bad guy at a time. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Mortem","review":"I am a huge fan of Kay Scarpetta. She is such a \\"real\\" character, extraordinary in an ordinary way. I became so involved and enthralled with both the plot and the characters that I lost myself for an entire weekend, spoke to no one, forgot about housework (which is easy anyway at the best of times!), did much of nothing aside from total absorption in my reading. I love a book that leaves me with a feeling of \\"Well now what?\\" because the book has become my life for a short moment in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 to 4 Stars","review":"This is the debut novel of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. It is the first of the series that I have read, yet it is difficult to judge the book because of its subject matter. Scarpetta is a the Chief Medical Examiner for Richmond, VA. The book was published in 1990, hence it's coverage of forensics and computers is hopelessly dated. Dialing up to a mainframe? DNA is only recently being used. Perhaps this book would have read better in a pre-CSI, pre-Crossing Jordan world. Also, the whodunit isn't revealed until the end, leaving the reader without a chance to figure it out. The 'whodunit' is more of a 'howdunit.' That is to say about all to figure out is how the killer came across his victims.Regardless of the flaws of the debut novel, it is a long running series and I plan to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a winner","review":"For new readers to the Scarpetta series I think this is the best book to start out in because it introduces all (well most) of the main characters in this series and sets up a lot of background information as well. This is a great book with wonderful characters and plot twists. It also has amazing detail about autopsies and forensics that will keep you spellbound to the end. I didn't like her conflicted relationships with men but I did like the conflict between her and her family. Her family conflict just made her feel less like a character in a book and more like a real person. True the ending was a bit fast for my taste but all in all a brilliant book especially for it being her first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I have heard.","review":"After being told how great this book was i decided to pick it out. Unfortunatly I found this book very tedious in places. There is too much time spent on the main characters relationships and sentimental nonsense for my liking. It has been said that her books are more appealing to women than men. I now feel that is very much the case. Most of the girls I know think it is great, most of the guys don't care about the niece or whether the cop likes the main character. On the plus side she does have a good understanding of the workings of the homicide unit and of the way crimes are investigated and this does come across in her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"the killer smells funky","review":"I do not understand all the hype for this writer. The plot is okay but not great. What motivates the killer? The characters are lame. Boring forensic details take up too much of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & Steady Doesn't Win The Race In This Yawner!","review":"I've heard good things about the Kay Scarpetta series but this introduction to the character didn't really show me much. I was underwhelmed by the \\"drama\\" and all the characters seemed very transparently one note. The 10 year old alcohol-drinking, cussing niece didn't make sense. Maybe if I had read this when it first came out the computer and DNA talk would have been more riveting instead of tedious. Not much here to keep you turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"who do you trust","review":"In postmortem we first hear of Kay Scarpetta who has to stop a killer who kills for reasons the only killer knows. And leaves no clues. The book is very fast in the opening then slows down, but still makes you want to find out who really the killer is. Kay must deal with her own problems in and out of the job. From working with a cop named Marino and her niece Lucy. And a nasty reporter. Who wants to really know it all. Who is this nobody killer? Read to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"beginning and middle were better than the end","review":"Overall, I thought this book was an interesting read and that's why I gave it 4 stars. I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed by the ending. It just didn't explode in the fashion that I had hoped. I was really interested in starting to read the Kay Scarpetta series but I've changed my mind now that I've read the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and start to a series....","review":"This is the first in a series of books featuring Kay Scarpetta...it's a great series. This book provides a good foundation about Kay and the other characters. The plot was very good...easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postmortem","review":"I liked this book as I do all of Patricia Cornwell's books. However there were a few places in the book towards the end that seemed like the author was rushed and I didn't think some of the text segwayed into the next section. I found myself retreading some spots in the book as I thought I had missed something. Overall, the story line was great and kept you guessing as to who the murderer was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postmortem","review":"Great book I love the way Patricia cornwell keeps you guessing I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the scapetta books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a Great Series","review":"I am a late-comer to this series, this first entry having been originally published in 1990. A friend of mine kept recommending Patricia Cornwell to me and I finally bought this book to start and I am glad that I did.This is more of a police/medical procedural than a classic mystery. Dr. Kay Scarpetta is the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, VA and is working with the police to find a serial rapist/murderer. Along the way, her office is implicated in some leaks to the press and she must deal with her boss about that in addition to the stress of the case itself.The action is plotted at a nice pace, some of the details are graphic (as in Kathy Reichs' series), and the ending is exciting to follow. There are not many writers today that can truly make the reader nervous and Ms. Cornwell did that for me.Looking forward to buying and reading the next in the series soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lock your doors, turn up the lights, and enjoy!","review":"The first in the Kay Scarpetta Series is a jarring introduction to the world of a Chief Medical Examiner. Facts, gruesome or not, are presented with an unblinking attention to detail. Mystery is woven into a palpable fabric.This book (and series) is great for those who are fans of forensic science/detective shows like CSI.Be forwarned, however, the view into the criminal psyche is chilling at best. This book will have you checking the locks on your doors and looking at strangers in a whole new light."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it when a plot comes together","review":"This is Patricia Cornwell's first novel. I have read a number of her books in this series and decided to go back to the beginning to see where and how it all began for Kay Scrapetta.

I also have the Cold Gear Hood which is the perfect companion to this item.

When it came i was positively surprised that it didn't even need en extra power connector. Another plus is the fact that it doesn't come with a fan but is *silent cooled* so it really is very quiet.Finally i have to say that it actually exceeded my expectations in terms of graphics power. resolution of 1440*900 playing bF 2142 max details is not a problem for this card.Reason i only gave 4 stars is that the performance for playing ghost recon is definitely too poor.Conclusion : Price/performance - the best you can get!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't care less","review":"This movie was the worst I've seen in a long time. I didn't care about \\"the girls\\", as all they did was parade around and smirk in the camera. James Woods and Kathleen Turner were washed out and lifeless. The dialogue was so limited, that I felt I knew nothing about any of these people and their pointless, wasted lives. This movie came across as sympathizing with spoiled, brainless teens. Why did they kill themselves? I know suburbia is boring, but most kids realize they'll be out of the house in a few years, and put up with it. Yes, Kathleen Turner was the sterotyped over-protective mother in need of psychiatric help, but I still think it was over dramatized and insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty","review":"I guess I must be missing something.

I thought it was deeply flawed, and its problems were too great to be overcome by a flimsy plot or hit-and-miss acting. It's obviously a \\"first film\\" in the sense that Sophia Coppola makes typical beginner mistakes and seems a little too captivated with adding in interesting shots at the expense of pacing and story. It's not the worst film ever, but it left me feeling annoyed and disappointed. The story gets boring in parts, and is totally obscure and silly at others.

I cared more for the purple rhino in 'Death to Smoochy' then I did for any of those girls. The story I felt was lacking, why were the girls lives so miserable before the lock down? Did running away even occur to them?Their emotion was more expressed in words then anything, couple shots of 'bored teens' but that's all. I can't understand how anyone could feel any attachment to the characters in this movie except for POSSIBLY the boys. In the end it's like the boys lost more then the girls did and honestly, you have no idea what it was they lost.Most characters are completely one-dimensional, most of the movie is predictable and the only memorable thing is the tree in their front yard, which by very expressionless action you can tell they care for, but by emotion? You'd have no clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book Brought Over to Film","review":"It was the idea of the director to make this movie as much like the book as possible. As it is, this movie is seen by the viewer in a third person perspective, in which allowing the viewer to grasp the concept of the idea behind the movie easier rather than the characters. But unlike some movies, (Donnie Darko) this movie manages to present you with great actors which accentuate the film and keep you entralled, while still keeping your mind on the whole moral of the film. One of my favorite characters is Cecilia, which in her short film parts, gives you an understanding of all of the girls, and an intimate look at her attitude about suicide by her brief words and actions to the doctor. The partents are wonderfully clueless and perfectly innocent enough to make you feel for them. Yet the girls are lax enough to leave you in question as to why they did what they did. This movie might leave you wondering why, but either way, it will leave you in awe."},{"rating":"1","title":"what? HUH?","review":"After reading all the hype and whatnot about this calamity, I was SO hoping to like this flick. Even 3/4 the way through, I was looking for any semblance of brilliance and ingenuity to grasp, so I could eventually belt out \\"God, what a masterpiece!\\" At the end of the film, alas, I found nothing. This film, an amazing masterflop, digs too deep to make some social comment but paradoxically enough doesn't dig deep enough. I am a fan of film noir, and I know I'll get ripped up for this review. I agree with the reviewer that stated, \\"there were holes big enough to drive an elephant through\\". Actually, one could drive a pack of elephants through some of the holes. All the elements were there: great cast, great music, great sets, great everything -- oops, except the lack of an interesting, developed plot. I guess you can't win them all, Sophia Coppola. Would someone PLEASE redo this film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adaptation of the book","review":"Sofia Copola does a wonderful job directing this film. The book is very dreamlike and full of poetic language - the sort of stuff that often does not translate well into film. However, viewing the film and reading the book, you see how she translated some of the intangilbe qualities of the book and translated them into the film; while leaving still leaving us room to use our imagination. The film is very dark, surreal, yet keeps you captivated by its youth and wonder.Kirsten Dundst was wonderfully cast in her role. I know that the other sisters had much smaller roles, but I don't think that they were cast as well. We know that the boys are drawn to them, partly by their mystique, but it would have been better to have girls that looked a little more alike and who could have captured more of the mystique."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was The Best","review":"Watching this movie made me realize that I shouldn't commet suicide. The fact that I am in my teenage years right now and watching this movie really helped me out a lot. I think all teenagers must watch this movie b/c you'll learn a lot from it.

I hope to buy the movie on dvd so I can watch it at boarding school."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book, don't watch the movie","review":"I don' understand how people who have read the book can praise this movie saying that it follows the book so accurately. It doesn't. And I can understand why those who panned the movie without having read the book can do so. The movie was an atrocity. Nothing like the book. I'm on the fence about the book but it certainly made more sense than the movie. So much was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Success in theory. Failure in delivery.","review":"This film might have been good... but wasn't.It is a true failure of delivery. It's clumsy and overstated... but endearing in theory; Kind of like 'Harlod and Maude' in that sense. I can't blame fans of this movie for wanting to like it.Fans of this movie tend to be fans of this genre, and therefore excuse the poor direction and pacing.Bottom Line: Another filmaker could have done much better with the same material.Sofia Coppola is apparently still learning during the making of this film. Air's soundtrack has many more memorable moments than the movie itself.A good effort though. Coppola did much better on 'Lost In Translation'.'The Virgin Suicides' feels like 'The Royal Tennenbaums' if it lost its sense of humor and was insincerely directed by young a hack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie and beautifully done.","review":"It shows, it shows completly just how taken about Ms. Sofia Coppola was when she read The Virgin Suicides(book) I recommend the book as well. It's such a beautifully done film with just amazing visuals, colors and MUSIC! Both The Virgin Suicides and Lost In Translation had Soundtracks that would have come from my own collection of music. The film was just like many great photographs put into a brilliant sequence. It was just like someone reading me the book and seeing the small pictures from ones head come alive, it was captured very nicely. The woman has excellent taste in everything she is like your best friend and who wouldn't say no to a friends recommendation. Bottom line a beautiful film for both young girls and old and pretty much for everyone. If you enjoy good films with a world of it's own see The Virgin Suicides it's just beautiful.Happy Trails"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful on SO many levels","review":"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I can only surmise that the reviewers who liked it read the book first, allowing them to see qualities in the film that aren't there. The characters are one-dimensional and interchangeable, the dialogue is vapid and obvious, and the technical aspects of the cinematography are amateurish. The characters act without motivation as if they are chess pieces being moved on a board by Sofia Coppola. Her direction is highly uninspired and adds nothing to the performances. As for the script, there is extremely little insight into the reasons justifying the girls' suicidal mood. This could have been a haunting character study and statement on teenage angst, instead it lays on the surface like the cellophane wrapping the cassette box. My only praise goes to the editors who were able to cut out enough film so that the total length is only ninety minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book","review":"I have to disagree with \\"flickjunkie\\". I thought this movie was really good. The acting was wonderful throughout and the scenes were gorgeous.The suicides were a by product. The movie is about growing up, first loves, obsession and oppression. The statement that suicides are predictable and obvious, thus preventable is ridiculous. That's the point.But, back to my original statement. The Book! I was fortunate enough to have read the book before seeing the movie. The book gives insight that the movie does not. Characters and motivation are more spelled out for those who need it. Read the book and then watch or rewatch the movie. Things will be more clear, background wise and your movie experience will be more enjoyable.But for all intents and purposes this is an excellent movie. It boasts an amazing cast and is moving and haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and depressing","review":"this movie was obviously adapted from a novel; it has the timeline, pacing, and internal dialog problems that come with a poor adaptation. as some one who grew up in michigan during the 70s. i found the setting to be entirely inaccurate. from looking at all the italians, the exteriors, the interiors and etc. i would swear i was looking at long island, rather than lansing, ann arbor, flint, battle creek, detroit, or another MI city. i gues the midwest has some sort of exotic fantasy appeal to bicoastals. it reminded me of gummo in a way. i did appreciate the directors feminine interpretation of all the characters and the story. i also enjoyed the 13 year old girl details and nostagia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and unrealistic.","review":"The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressive Overall","review":"I was not very impressed with Virgin Suicides. Just knowing that the five sisters would all be dead by the end of the film probably assisted in my lack of enthusiasm in following the narrative. The mini-documentary in the middle of the film was entirely out of place and really just made things more confusing. The use of music to converse was certainly interesting, but was one of the few bright points of the film.The acting is good overall (not necessarily brilliant), and the choice of background music generally appropriate. Still, this is not a film I would enthusiastically recommend unless someone was a true fan of the actors and actresses in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative family kills daughters","review":"Or something to that effect.

It is told through the watching, voyeuristic eyes of young boys who obsess over the girls mentally, emotionally, sexually, and even intellectually.It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. There really isn't much I feel there is to say about it, as it is a pretty self-contained little movie. Coppola satirizes the clean warmth of suburbia without the self-indulgence of most artists dealing with conformity. I'm surprised by the cover descriptions and synopses that talk about this film as if it's a mystery; it's about as mysterious as what drives Charles Kane.

We get that the girls are unhappy but they are not abused, they have no restrictions in dress or appearance and they are all under 18 - meaning they have other options in the very near future. Dad is loving but spineless, Mom is religious and a tad overbearing but even with the removal from public school.. I don't see the cause for suicide. To me, this is a story that would influence young people to end their lives for reasons that are miniscule in the scheme of things. Nowhere in the plot did the children reach out to other adults or family members yet those same kids were willing to climb out windows, pull pranks and were fully socialized with their peers.

Very well crafted, suspense is present in every scene. I very much appreciated that the movie did not end as one might have expected. The end \\"sorta\\" completed the story, rather than leave EVERYTHING dangling. The acting is uniformly good (even though I am not a particular fan of Kirsten Dunst, I think she did exceptionally well here), and Josh Hartnett so convincingly fills his role that I paid no attention to the fact that he was acting - he was real.

Probably people in favor of this flick should rate the shocking ending. But that is what the author wrote - not the director's invention. And it makes the movie more miserable that a lot of good actors appear, trying to fill the void the director couldn't fill, or even find.Don't waste your precious time and hard-earned money on this.

Just to make sure it wasn't just me I asked friends to read the book and then watch the movie they totally agreed that without the book the movie make no sense. It totally left out the emotion that the book held. The book allowed you to know these people as though they were your neighbors. The movie lost the entire feeling of the book. It never allowed you to know the character. There was no purpose to the movie. Unlike many other movies written from books this movie lost the total essence of the book. The book was amazing. If you like Kirsten Dunst see the movie she did a great job other then that theirs really no reason to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Book!","review":"This movie has to rank as one of the worst book-adapted movies of all time!! The movie utterly lacked the insight, the depth and most of all the continuity of the wonderfully written book. There is absolutely zero development of characters, no poignancy present in the book, no urgency and no sympathy. Furthermore, the movie is, simply put, so tedious I almost fell asleep. Here is a telling point: I had NO clue what was going on in the movie and I read the book!! A friend with whom I watched it was supremely lost from the word, GO. She had no chance. Do yourself a favor. Read the book and stay away from the movie. Sophia Coppola's debut, I'm sad to say, matched her unrivaled performance in the Godfather 3 and anyone who saw that movie knows her performance all but ruined the entire movie.

There was nothing wrong with the cast, or the plot. It was just a waste. There was nothing that could be done. AND after the little sister died, it all went down hill. IT WAS JUST BORING.

That's the big shocker, the big selling point that the book this movie was based on used to make it a best seller, the big plot innovation. Outside of the five suicides, there really is no plot development. The movie is told from the viewpoint of one of a group of boys, over the vantage point of about 25 years, who like these pretty girls and watch them from across the street. The characters are one-dimensional and cartoonish. It's as though the director would like to make some profound statement about the human condition, and thinks that just having the five suicides, sans any real motive or character or plot development, is enough to carry the day. Sorry. Maybe David Lynch could have made a good movie using this premise, but not Sofia Coppola. Oh, and guess what, the title is a lie. As is amply demonstrated, one of the girls isn't even a virgin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be more developed... little information","review":"I think that the movie could have had a future with the story, but it was to wide.

It is definitely not a family movie, and the ending.....Well, I could definitely write better then this. I would say that this is like Eyes Wide Shut. Though this movie does have meaning, it is very choppy, and though it is hard to imagine that this happened in real life. I don't like how the it is narrated, and I think that people who don't want to waste time and money should neither buy it, or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not translate well to big-screen","review":"Definitely do yourself a favor and read the book. As a movie, it's flat, sick, boring, and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!","review":"This is one of the worst films ever created. There was no point. You sat there waiting for something to happen, and it didn't. Everthing happened within the last five minutes. The movie was about depressed girls, and obessive boys. Once the first girl dies (which happens within the first ten minutes) the movie drags until the last five minutes when it still isn't any good. There is truly no point to watching this movie. I cannot stress my my opinion enough that nobody should should waste their time sitting through this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bit too predictable","review":"This was a pretty good first draft of a film. A really good director and editor might be able to take out some of the ridiculously self conscious, incongruous stuff (like a boy narrator near the end saying how he now had some understanding of what a prison it was to be a girl, but how wonderful it was at the same time because girls were inspired to think. Do boys outside of extreme feminist dreams ever say things like this?)and add a few scenes to tie it all together.Some of it was quite clever. It was just a bit too pat. Most of the characters had their cardboard cutout existence which couldn't be fleshed out lest it deter the tunnel vision plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is very good, except the story","review":"This movie has the aesthetic sheen of all other high quality films. The performances were top notch--Kirsten Dunst's cocktease performance is every man's fantasy, and every woman's fantasy of how to torture a man. Josh Hartnett is a very good looking studly guy. And all the other actors were wonderful.The only problem I have is that just as you think the movie is gonna reach a great climax, we find out that the four sisters simply committed suicide. It's anticlimactic, and doesn't make for a very good movie.I think Sofia Coppola did a great job, but the book wasn't great for a movie (read: beginning, middle, end). Many people like this movie, but many won't.This is a love/hate movie. Rent it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one I would watch twice.","review":"Maybe I am not \\"high brow\\" enough to enjoy this movie. Lots has been written about the book and there was a fair amount of fan fare for the movie. I just did not get the point. I was an English major in college and I STILL didn't understand what was trying to be said here. So It did not work for me. It might for someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriuging","review":"After viewing this film, my friends and i were left first dumbstruck and then we couldn't stop talking about it, but as yet, we have found no answers to why the girls commited suicide. The film's sucess lies in the fact that it makes suicide very ordinary and mundane even. The plot gives no answers as to why the girls would commit suicide, and when they are speaking they are seen to be happy and laughing. I am very intrigued by this film and the point it was trying to put across. Worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Pathetic","review":"With an indirectional plot, dark themes, and uncompromisingly horrible direction, Sofia Coppola tries unsuccessfully to create a lasting impression on viewers, however, this movie just ends up leaving viewers bored and at best, horrified. The acting is at least B+, with talented actors such as Dunst and Hartnett, but even these up-and-coming stars cannot save this dull, plotless film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather unimpressive","review":"I do know what it was but this movie was rather dissapointing. I must say the performances are nothing but spectacular . I just seemed to have an empty feeling as i never was pulled into this so whatever sypathy i was suppose to have for any of the charecters was never developed. I also think there was a lot Lucky that we should have got to know but we didn't .The major flaw with this movie is there is no directive start of these charecters . This movie seemed to have a lot of art house cliches yet It was still dissapointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious trash","review":"One of the most pretentious, artsy-fartsy films I've seen in the past ten years, this film was just awful. It doesn't work as a statement about anything, it doesn't work as entertainment, it doesn't even work as mood (e.g. a 90-minute music video).To put it plainly, it just didn't work for me. I say \\"for me\\" because given most of the other reviews here, I'm likely to be roundly lambasted for my opinion about this film. Please remember that it's just an opinion, and yours is equally as valid.Having said that, I can't tell you how much I disliked this film. Absolutely, utterly pretentious, nose-in-the-air egotistical sickening (and sick) nonsense. And I was a (suburban) teenager in the 1970's... trust me, it wasn't even a good portrayal of 70's teenage suburbia. Phoney, phoney, phoney! Stick to acting, Sofia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decadent, artsy trash","review":"This is one of the most truly decadent movies I have ever seen. It attempts to stir refined, delicate emotions based on the deaths (suicides!) of children. Caligula would have loved it.It has been compared to Picnic at Hanging Rock, but in that interesting, flawed film, the girls simply disappear without a trace. Whatever happened to them, the reasonable viewer is unlikely to conjecture that they committed mass suicide.If the movie suggested responses of shock, horror, pity, or indeed any of the responses that people genuinely have to such tragedies (say, the Jim Jones Guyana tragedy), I could be more generous. Instead, it seems to reach for a kind of dreamy, wistful nostalgia.It is reasonably well made for what it is. In fact, it took a couple of days for the truly repellant aspects of the movie to become apparent to me. I think that it is disgusting and decadent. Even if intended as a metaphor, the choice of subject matter is appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i purchased this product and was not aware it was a region 2 product, which meant it wouldnt be able to be played in my dvd player, as i am from the united states. i contacted the seller 30 minutes after i realized it and they did not cancel the order, it was delivered to me about 2 months later and i once again contacted the seller to let them know i was unable to use it and that i contacted them previously to cancel the order and they did not follow through. they then told me i would have to send it back with a handwritten note with the order number and also explaining the situation as well, so i did. i have not received my refund or anything from the seller and that was about 2 months ago. i am not pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion.....","review":"If you have read the book you will find missing parts in the movie. In the book Mary doesnt die, she stays alive for 2 more months and then kills herself. It was a movie with no plot and made absolutely no sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell?","review":"I don't know what everyone else saw, but I was bored to tears. If I had the choice of watching this movie again or bashing my head in with a big blunt object, I would find the biggest rock I could, and smash away. I am just being honest when I say that this movie deserves zero stars because it's like watching paint dry. It's drawn out and painfully boring to no end, and I felt like scratching my eyes out completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portrayal of suburban life","review":"This movie is very,very good. Although there isn't much character development, you can identify with the girl's sense of loneliness and desperation to be free. This film is a perfect example of suburban teenage life. I guess I can really identify with it because I'm from suburban Detroit and I grew up in a rich neighborhood so I know how tough some parents can be and how most parents truly don't understand their kids. If you haven't seen this yet, watch this movie. It's the perfect movie for 21-24 year olds from suburbia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back","review":"I was skeptical of Sofia Coppola's directing ability after seeing how bad an actress she was in Godfather 3. I also loved the book, which usually makes it hard to like the movie version. But Coppola's movie remains true to the essence of the book and she totally redeems herself in my eyes, leaving out less important details in favor of recreating an overall visual atmosphere that tells the story. Fortunately, Coppola doesn't sell out and over-explain things for a general audience. Unfortunately, I know there will be a lot of people who don't get this movie as a result. That's too bad, because they're missing a gem. I highly recommend this movie. I only wish it had been a little longer.My biggest kudos go out to the cast (and the casting people) for bringing each character to vivid life. Seeing how the males and females reacted to one another, their glances and body language, made me remember what it was like to be a teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better movies for your time.","review":"Movie drones on and on. A bit fractured. Didn't have enough character development. There are many more movies more worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise ending makes for an interesting film.","review":"It was an original story line that held my interest. It was also well acted. Sofia Copola did an excellant job directing her first movie. I guess the apple does not fall far from the tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"really enjoyed it","review":"I liked this movie, despite it's melancholy plot. I do wish there had been a bit more of an explanation after the girls died, but I guess the director wants us to interpret that for ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow movie","review":"I honestly never felt the movie got anywhere. At times during the first half it was interesting but the movie never really made a point. Maybe its just me or its just one of those movies for those who like to break down a film and find reasons for it or reasoning w in the film your average Joe will not like this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"A troubling descent--first into Purgartory, and then Hell","review":"In this troubling film, James Woods and Kathleen Turner play characters utterly different than their previous roles. Instead of the tough guy he usually plays, Woods assumes the role of a nerdy math teacher and radio-controlled model airplane hobbyist. Instead of a self-assured siren, Turner plays a severely depressed and frumpy hausfrau. Together they define the bunker mentality of the ultra-conservative Catholic parents of a house full of blossoming teenage girls (including a young Kirsten Dunst)--one of whom has already committed suicide. The viewer is drawn into the seemingly inevitable descent of this family into a tragedy that the clueless and repressed parents are incapable of preventing--and even unwittingly drive forward to its emotionally-wrenching conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant scared the living daylight out of me!","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer below. I found Cuttings to be Grant's best mystery to date, and I also thought number 2 was better than the first. This book in particular had added suspense that kept me awake until all hours. And here's another thing we disagree on - I think Sydney should have trusted Tom Thurgood less, not more. A great read IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I tried author on basis of great reviews from other customers. After wasting time reading the first 5-6 chapters I jumped to the last 2-3 chapters and was glad I hadn't wasted more time reading entire book. I never felt anything for any of the characters, especially the policeman boyfriend who was about as animated and interesting as a lump of dirt. The killer was easy to figure out (and I didn't even read the whole book) and the reasoning for the killing left me thinking, huh? I guess we all have our likes & dislikes and I seem to be in the minority of opinion about this author, but I found Cuttings to be boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A towering performance!","review":"Thanks to the lovely effort of a high appreciated person I could know this outstanding recording, sincer and deeply expressive in this Jazz sesion.

I read the book from start to finish in two days, called the 800 number and started a group in my area. All of us in the group have lost a great deal of weight. I have never been able to stay on a weight loss program for so long (7 months) and have never lost so much weight before (46 pounds). This book was written in such a way that I knew I could do this program. It was a \\"page turner\\" for me, which is not usually a characteristic of a self help book. I highly recommend it for those of you who are struggling with overweight in any amount. This transformation program can save your life too."},{"rating":"1","title":"not user-friendly","review":"I have had a rather hard time finding suitable materials for my 8-12 years old Sunday school class. I tried this book, but have felt rather disappointed. Each lesson was not very well-constructed, hard to follow and spot the point. The content was also rigid. It tells you what exactly to say rather than guide you to create a fun environment. I don't think the book can provide lessons that speak effectively to the active young generation with short attention span."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"I have struggled with a few of this author's books, but none so much as this one. The main complaint I have with Mr Smith's writing style is that he tends to go off on a tangent, and pads his books with pages and pages of unnecessary detail about things that really are only vaguely relevant to the story.In the case of 'Reckless', there was relatively little written about the actual murder of Lana Clarkson - in fact there was very little information about Miss Clarkson at all. This book is no more than a rehash of the life story of Phil Spector, taken from a number of 'sources' and put together by Mr Smith in this very uninteresting piece of work. I didn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money!!","review":"I've read other titles by Carlton Smith and have enjoyed most of them. However, \\"Reckless\\" is by far the worst book I've read in quite some time. In fact, I had to force myself to finish it.One is led to believe by the back cover of the book that the story is about the murder of Lana Clarkson. Don't be misled. It really isn't about Lana Clarkson at all. It's almost entirely about Phil Spector and his life as a record producer. Smith quotes heavily from two other books in this story. It's almost as if he wrote a repeat of what has already been written before by someone else. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Lovely School Research Paper","review":"Reckless is NOT a true crime book. It's a biography of Phil Spector - and not a very inspired one. There is no indication that Carlton Smith spoke to anyone involved with this case, and it's not an ancient case with all the key players dead.If you like student research papers where the author simply looks at the other books and articles written about something and then checks in with personal observations, then that's what you get here. An overview of the literature. Some unqualified personal observations. And, he says the same thing over and over and over again.Very boring. And it could have been a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the death in the castle.","review":"Instead, Mr. Smith delivers a one-sided slam against Phil Spector who according to the author hasn't done one nice thing during his whole life. It's amazing that St. Martin's Press would publish such a biased book while a court case is going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author. Probably the last, too. I kept reading to get to the story about Lana Clarkson and Spector.

Klobuchar's writing style is such a train wreck, I cannot for the life of me understand how he got a job as a sportswriter other than the fact Minnesota must not produce, nor is able to attract, talented and skilled writers.I'm dying for a definitive book on the Vikings. Sadly, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glory Ends Sooner Rather then Later","review":"A great read on the adventures of the Minnesota Vikings. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the Vikings both a passing fancy and a hardcore dedication.

I am a Parelli fanatic and the truth is that Pat's philosophy was first shared in his book. While he markets his Levels Packs and Liberty and Horse Behavior Set on his site, the core of the program is this book. It has all the sayings and acronyms that are really helpful to remember when working with your horse. If you watch his programs, he's always quoting from his book.Pat gives us real insight into how horses think. The knowledge he offers has changed my and my horse's life profoundly. My tips for beginners include finding Parelli-friendly people in your area to learn with. Most likely one of them has some of his DVDs that you can watch at a movie night.

I can't believe this book received bad reviews! Parelli's students are his proof. Yes it takes time and it won't happen overnight. He sells his own tools(not gadgets)because nobody made what he was looking for. The \\"normal\\" people just don't and won't get it! I have to say that if you get this book (and you take the time to read it) you will want more info and Parelli Natural Horsemanship has all of the info you could possibly need in getting it natural & right with your horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"It kinda frustrates me","review":"Don't get me wrong I like Pat Parelli and I can't wait to be at a level to use his techniques. But he's expensive. And not for the novice trainer that is on a limited budget. I think to get the most from him you have to buy his whole program or go to his ranch camp. I'm new at training and most of his stuff is too...i don't know....not specific. I think he is more of a fine tuning type guy until you are really experienced(or can afford his stuff) But I love his philosophy and ideas.

Trust me, I had to experiment a couple of times to get this whole process down. Another thing you really want to do, is take a fork and put some wholes in the tortilla, once it's been pressed into the pan. Just like you do with a pie shell you're going to bake.

Not that that's saying much; still, definitely worth a watch if you like sci-fi and humor rolled into one. The science is sometimes a little questionable, but that's okay because Eureka is really character-driven. Where else would you find the garage mechanic is an existential physicist, the town dog-catcher has hunted wild beasts from Africa to the Arctic, and the local shrink runs a bed-and-breakfast with emphasis on the \\"bed\\", if you get my drift. Add a Deputy whom, except for the by-the-book fanaticism, is very little like Barney Fife (better looking for one thing, and way more competent) and an Opie who may be autistic but can do differential calculus (on sidewalks) and you have \\"Eureka\\".

What's not to like, a town where Science is king, and the sceintists get to play with as many of their toys as they want, government funded to boot! The cast have grown into their respective characters very well, and each brings something to the show, and the personal interactons between characters is becoming well developed as well.Along with Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, the show is well written, the science makes sense, even if it's out there sometimes, you never know what's going to happen.

I'm going to be buying the dvd for the holidays: I'm waiting to see if they release the second season this december or wait a bit in which case I'll just get the first.There are a lot of longer posts and summaries about this show so I'll just write why I love it: the actors, the writing, and the premise. This show gells together and hangs on in a way that Lost hasn't and Heroes does. It's got excellent production values and the futuristic look blends with the hear and now.I love it. Tuesdays at 9 on SciFi for new episodes. Be there, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka","review":"OH my goodness how I love this series. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD. One of two shows I make sure Im in front of the TV for!!! That is saying alot for a fulltime college student, parttime working, & single mother of three children ranging from 18 to 7. Yall this show is excellent if you are even interested a little in the premiss you should watch it A+ entertainment in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough!!!","review":"Not quirky enough, not funny enough, not dark enough...basically, not \\"anything\\" enough to sit through. TV is full of examples of that this series tried to copy.Unfortunately for those of us who said \\"I'll give it a try,\\" we remain scratching our heads about how this made it past a pitch meeting in the post-cocaine Hollywood era. I love shows that aren't traditionally popular. This ain't one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intelligence-insulting drivel.","review":"It's hard to believe all these great reviews. This show tries way too hard to develop a Northern Exposure-like cast of quirky characters. It also tries way too hard to convince you that everyone in town is a super-genius a la \\"Real Genius\\" with Val Kilmer. However, the real trouble starts when the entire town comes together and starts finishing each others' sentences - solving impossibly complicated problems with a few minutes of facile, preposterous techno-babble. It's enough to make me long for the plausibility of the worst episodes of Star Trek Voyager, if not a quick death. I wonder how Hollywood executives thought that writing a show about geniuses and mind-bending science at an elementary school level of sophistication would be a good idea... oh yeah, all those great reviews. Never mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been Here Before","review":"Here's the latest lousy high concept, THE X FILES meets NORTHERN EXPOSURE. This is a low budget, cheap looking show that tries to be funny and misses by a mile. I don't get why the Sci Fi channel has so much trouble coming up with good orginal programming to match BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. How many X FILES meets (fill in the blank) concepts do they have to air on that channel? What of the biggest stumbling blocks about this show is that it is far too complicated for its own good. The acting is uneven and the more you watch it the more you lose interest. I got the box set as a gift and traded it at Amoeba for DISTURBIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun show.","review":"The first season of Eureka was great, I liked all the characters and how they developed. As a fan of Sci Fi, this program was very refreshing with it's many humorous plots. The show is oddly touching at times too.While the second season of this series isn't out as of this writing, I have seen some of the episodes. Don't expect the second series to follow the first. They take some of the characters in completely unexpected directions, which hooked me even more.If you liked Wonderfalls you will probably like this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Quantumland","review":"Eureka is a fun romp through Wonderland, or should I say Quantumland, where geeks rule, and Alice is replaced by new town sheriff, Jack Carter. The characters are quirky, intelligent, witty, and believable. Even the \\"bad guys\\" are generally likable. Most of the plot-lines are unique and even the couple that are obviously borrowed are uniquely presented. Although the geeks rule in Eureka, it is the sheriff, who is occasionally reminded of his comparatively low intelligence, that always comes up with the idea that saves the day. Eureka's writers offer an unusual blend of sci-fi, comedy, and drama, then wrap it all up with a bit of suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, entertaining series","review":"I managed to catch a couple of episodes on cable TV and became hooked on this show. It is a hybrid comedy/drama with more emphasis on the comedy, with some very interesting and unique characters. I bought the season on DVD so I could watch all the episodes in order. I think it is one of those quirky shows that people either love or hate. But it is really quite funny and is watchable by most of the family. This isn't Stargate or Farscape so don't expect lots of action or wierd aliens, but do expect to be entertained. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town-Big Laughs","review":"I love the season 1 DVD of Eureka! The episodes here are very good. I LOVE the Pilot episode. I laughed SOOO Hard!

We don't care for reality shows, have enough of that in real life, so we really like to watch this one. Every week it's all fresh and new with all kinds of wondrous and funny things happening to the town of Eureka. It's a nice, clean, family show that is fun to watch.

The metal part meant for anchoring it to the bike is weak. Bent while I was tighten the bolt so that it gets a good grip on the bars. Metal is to soft, and keeps expanding, hence the mirror keeps moving. I have decided to remove them and ride without mirrors. Sadly, I bought 2 pairs for my bike and my wife's bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for.","review":"I had been looking in the big box stores for a good mirror like I had on my bikes as a kid. All they had was dinky rubber armed models that just didn't work. I found this one and have been very pleased. Good price, fast service, and it mounts solidly and holds its adjustment. It's also large enough that you can mount a small convex mirror on it and still have space left over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mirror.","review":"This mirror blows away bar end mirrors, but may not be for you depending on your bars and brakes/shifters. It works fine for me on 5\\" rise bars. The arm was too short for me to get a workable top mount position, but I was able to mount it hanging underneath. I would have preferred a top mount position, but I can see fine and this is still way better than bar end mirrors that are constantly getting bumped out of position. When my trekking bars arrive I think I'll have a top mount option on those.If I could change one thing on these I'd add a second axis of rotation where it mounts to the handlebar. That would open up a lot more mounting possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong mirror for the job.","review":"Now I'm not saying this is a bad mirror. But it did not work for me on my bike. The arm was too short. It might work for you if you place it on the farthest end of the handlebar, near your pinky finger. But I was looking for something more near the center, near your thumb on your left hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mirror, But Not for Straight Handle Bars","review":"I tried these on my bike, my wife's bike, and our two kids. Good quality mirror for a great price. Our problem was that the mirror could not give us a good view behind us, due to our straight handle bars. I suppose these might work well on some, depending on the exact shape, size and configuration of the handle bars, but on all four of ours, no such luck. If you think you can handle a great mirror on the end of your handle bar, take a look at theMirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror, and my review there."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so mirror","review":"I have a hybrid bike with straight handlebars.

Now I can see behind me perfectly, no moving around on the bike necessary. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked it to be a little wider - but definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clamp is weak","review":"I'ts a big mirror and has a nice look to it, but the clamp can't handle the weight of the mirror and it tends to start sliding around not long after installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the History of Christendom series","review":"This is the best in Warren Carroll's History of Christendom series. It answers many questions a Catholic may be searching for in other history books that tend to have too short a treatise on the subject of the Protestant Revolution and Catholic Reformation. Carroll, a protestant who had converted to Catholicism, anticipates many questions and answers them clearly. He provides very insightful analyses and explanations. A Catholic may always wonder why so many protestant sects are vehemently anti-Catholic. The answers are revealed in Martin Luther's letters. However, it would be extremely helpful for a reader to have read all the books in the series (I'm almost done with the 5th and so far the last volume in the series) as many doctrinal issues are tackled in the earlier volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cleaving of Christendom","review":"The book came in excellent condition as mentioned.

Sure, there are those who say it could have used a bit of editing, but I'm glad he went over the top for this one.One caveat though: This CD is in desperate need of remastering. Hello? Anyone out there? REMASTER THE RIVER and earn your fifth star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks, it has heart","review":"It makes sense that this was the first really successful Springsteen record (\\"Hungry Heart\\" is famously his first top ten hit) - the blazing anthems are especially energizing, the slow numbers are tender and deeply human. That makes for an amazing slew of songs, most of them outstanding, but a less thematic, cohesive outing than Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town. Compare the difference - say, the peppy summer anthem \\"Sherry Darling\\" and the sprawling balladry of \\"Drive All Night\\" - you have two brilliant songs that don't seem to belong on an album together. In which case, it means that it happens to be only as good as a great rock record should be, as opposed to his masterpieces which fly past any of those standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"his worst","review":"i really like springsteen, but am not a \\"bruce can do no wrong\\" type of fan, and after listening to a borrowed copy of \\"the River\\" recently i gotta say this is his worst album. i'm glad i listened before wasting my money. if you're a new fan start with something great like Tunnel of Love which won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated album by an over-rated artist","review":"This irritating, tinny, repetitive schlock soared on the hot air pumped out by Bruce's moonie-like fans. This record served first warning that BS would devote much of his time to chasing the ghost of Woodie Guthrie - hence, the ponderous, grim tone of \\"The River.\\"The only noteworthy thing about this record is the worst sample of grammar in music history - from \\"Hungry Heart\\":\\"Don't make no differnce what nobody says. Ain't nobody likes to be alone.\\"Ain't no 20th century artist, with the possible exception of Ernest Hemingway, more over-rated than Bruce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Springsteen Album!","review":"The River is another of Springsteen's great albums. He is one of the greatest song writers of all time, and this album has Twenty of his great songs. This album is a Must Have for any Springsteen fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUR DE BRUCE","review":"A simply suberb album. You can feel the tension that Bruce sings about woven through the songs on this double disc featuring the fabulous E Street band. My favorite cuts are: Hungry Heart (if you haven't heard this one, you've been in a cave since 1980), I Wanna Marry You, Stolen Car, The Price You Pay, as well as almost every song on this CD. I feel this along with Bruce's The River album are among his best works. You will enjoy this CD, at times it is kind of haunting and somewhat somber, but overall a very passionate collection of timeless artistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated Springsteen Album","review":"In the 70's Bruce released 3 masterpieces, all completely different from one another. The Wild The Innocent, Born To Run, Darkness On The Edge Of Town. 3 practically flawless, mature paintings - everything you could want in an album. I was convinced Bruce could do no wrong. And then this thing came out. There are quite a few good songs on The River, maybe even a couple great ones. But what makes this album a real clunker is the sheer number of half-baked, mind-numbing, happy-crappy pop songs. The man who gave us Incident On 57th St, Thunder Road and Darkness on The Edge of Town now presents us with Crush On You, I Wanna Marry You, I'm A Rocker, Ramrod, and a few others which I thankfully can't remember now.

The first card, an Asus Xonar card, crashed while playing certain games. So, I bought the tried and true Creative. After about 5 minutes of use it emitted an ear-piercing scream - along the lines of a smoke alarm, or building fire alarm. I tried different ports, disconnecting the I/O drive - reinstalling the software - typical things one does to try to avoid the RMA process. Amazon tells me that the replacement is enroute, and I hope that the new one doesn't give me the same problem - because if it does then I'd be looking at replacing the motherboard, assuming then that the sound card isn't the problem. If it does reoccur then I'll try the card in another pc to see what happens.

This is the only place where one can find SAVE THE WORLD on CD because this album never saw the light of day on CD being released individually. It might have been a definitive overview of this British glam-rock band formed in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1972 if only such favourites as their version of THE HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN and ROCKIN' WITH BOYS TONIGHT were included, but they weren't regrettably.

It is paperback, much smaller and lightweight (ideal for taking to the nursery).So save the [price] and get the better book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I checked this out from my local library. It is simply amazing. Each rose is intensly described, has pictures, and has entertaining sections about roses in other cultures, histories, and uses. This is a very (okay, not too very) useful book if you are a hybridizer as it provides info about each rose about its parentage, etc,.,. Modern Rose 10 is more apt for the rose hybridizer, but this is a book to browse and gaze at some of the incredibly photographed pictures.Enrique"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Rose Book","review":"This is an incredible book. I identified my old garden roses in it, ones that were not in any other book. It's not only a beautifully illustrated book, it's chock full of information.

One couldn't ask for two better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhelpful","review":"I did not find this book helpful at all. This is one of the worst writing books I have ever read. I purchased this based upon it being mentioned on the BluRay for the television show LOST. I really admire the writing on the show, and thought that this might be a personal recommendation by the show's writers. I am vastly disappointed with the book. I did not find one single part insightful. Other writing books that I would recommend instead would be any of the books by Noah Lukeman, but especially A Dash of Style. Another one that I would highly recommend is Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight Swain. All of these are worth their weight in gold.

Who doesn't know how to fly an infant around on their arms, or to bounce them on their knee?

This CD,however, sounds like an experiment gone terribly wrong, either that or Mr Kawasaki has sold out to make a few bucks from the club scene. While his guitar work is as flawless as ever he has backed himself with some of the cheesiest preprogrammed synth beats I have ever heard. The backing sounds like it came out of a cheap casio keyboard. Jazz guitar and watered down programmed hiphop beats do not mix well at all. If you are a lover of jazz or fusion stay away from this one.

The Sound and the Fury is carefully written using stream of consciousness refering to a sibling of the family. Even the very last sentence can easily take the reader back to the very first sentence. It is beautifully written, as well as As I Lay Dying. As I Lay Dying is written in many perspective's of each person in the family. The full story is obtained through reading through each person's mind and opinions and happenings. A suprise ending adds to the punch of this book. Both of these novels (combined into one book) are stories that critics and others seem to love, cherish, and remember for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful writing","review":"This is a beautifully written book that explores love and friendship in a creative and surprising storyline. It made me laugh out loud several times and read sections aloud to my wife repeatedly. The wordcraft is wonderful.While there are some things this book that one can question, that seems to miss the point. Mr. Spragg wasn't following my idea of what should make perfect sense or what he should explain. Rather he wrote the story he wanted to tell. I absolutely loved reading it. His character development, dialog and sense of place are exceptional.

But if you're looking for a Chick Book, read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be well written. The plot, however, left much to be desired. It centers around a man and his friend's search for the man's wife in response to goofy, ridiculously self-absorbed letters left by the wife (for some unexplained reason) at various post offices throughout the west. What occurs during the search is even less realistic. Moreover, we are told very little about the wife who we are to accept as some sort of modern day Helen of Troy. All in all I found the substance of the story silly. This was disappointing because Spragg's writing at times is excellent. For beautiful writing about the American West in a highly realistic context, try James Galvin's far superior The Meadow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Corey is a fat loser.","review":"You'd think that with all his education and \\"expertise\\" he would have been a professor at a prestigious university, perhaps Harvard or Princeton. But no, never...at least not according to his CV. In fact he's done more work on why men cheat on this wifes/girlfriends than on religion. I love how one reviewer (probably Corey's mommy) wrote, \\"I marvel when I thumb throgh [sic] the bibliographies in the back of your books. You are the scientific equivalent of Bach.\\" \\"the scientific equivalent of Bach?\\" are you kidding me? Wow, he has extensive bibliographies, that's amazing, if only his arguments and reasoning were as extensive and impressive. If Michael Corey were the \\"scientific equivalent of Bach\\" he'd be well respected in the scientific community, which I can find no evidence of. And, by the way, Christian freak scientists don't count, because they will defend Corey because he defends their silly faith.

It is basically an advertisement for the NAET method of allergy removal. That method might very well do everything claimed, but I was hoping to get some insight into what I might do for MYSELF. That was missing. Instead, an introduction into the struggles of the author, some of the theory behind energy therapy, and a basic introduction into muscle testing.

The total list of ingredients: water, roman beans, white beans, blackeyed peas, onions, olive oil, salt, sage, garlic. And a whopping 20 grams of dietary fiber per can! AND Amazon's free shipping policy makes it cheaper than it was when I used to purchase this soup in my grocery store (I live in a state that charges sales tax on food).I've tried all four varieties that Amazon carries, but in my opinion the three-bean soup is by far the most delicious. The lentil and the five-bean are also quite good, but I confess the white bean doesn't do much for me.It broke my heart when the specialty store that carried Coco Pazzo soup in my neighborhood went out of business.

It's nice to see a different side to the President's many different achievements.Whom else could you ever want to see and hear?

I love it so much, I gave a subscription to my mother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger Than Fiction","review":"Referencing a real life incident- the Spanish Flu of 1918, this book deals with a town that quarantined itself and the ramificantions of such a decision. The characters are well-defined. Excellent book for book clubs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and impressive debut","review":"This debut novel works on many different levels. It's a compelling page turner. It's a slice of history. It's a powerful anti-war story. You get the picture. Mullen brings the reader into the isolated backwoods town of Commonwealth, Washington, during the waning days of WWI and the great flu of that period. It's a small snapshot of those times but Mullen fills the canvas with big sweeping ideas. The story just naturally seems to fall to the page. Take a group of people, isolate them in the wilderness, let disease and violence gallop through the ranks, and then see what happens. The protagonist Philip was my only problem with the story. He just wasn't the interesting. It's a small quibble. Can't wait to read Mullen's next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting backdrop","review":"I bought the book to learn more about a period in history while also enjoying a book of fiction. I really did not learn much about WW1 throughout the book until the author's note at the very end. I was really surprised to learn that the influenza epidemic killed as many as 100 people worldwide in one year.I always believe the sign of a good book is one that stays with you for awhile. I think the backdrop of the influenza epidemic has piqued my interest. I think the decision to create a storyline around this tragedy attributes to the success of the book. My next book is about the Great American Dust Bowl....seems like I am glutton for learning about terrible times in US History."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall a disappointment","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The whole idea sounded so intriguing, but in the end the book really fell flat to me. Not only was it hard to get attached to any of the characters, but the plot ending really fizzled and left me disappointed. The pacing of the book also seemed very slow in parts, and I really had to almost force myself to finish it at the end. Sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Work!!!!!","review":"I was blown away by this book! Mullen is a fantastic writer which would lead one to believe that he has written many books and boy do I wish that were true! I can't wait for his next book to come out; I will surely check it out the first day its out on shelves! Some writers in my opinion write choppy and try to sound overly intelligent, but Mullen writes in a sensible clear-cut way which really intices his audience and draws them into the story being told. I can't wait to read more from Mullen! I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys historical fiction that is cleary written and makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a story about Commonwealth, a little mill community at the end of a road in the forests of Washington state. It is 1918, WWI is drawing to a close, and the Spanish Flu epidemic is in full swing in America, but has not yet come to Commonwealth. So the residents decide to quarantine themselves. No one comes in and no one leaves. But two different soldiers show up at two different times, under suspicious circumstances and things start to fall apart.I found this book very disappointing after hearing about all the praise it received. While the premise of the book sounded good in summary, Mr. Mullen has a very difficult time getting to the point, inserting LOTS of pointless description on every page. I don't care about how someone runs their finger around the rim of their cup or how tendrils of hair flutter in the breeze. It doesn't contribute to the story at all. Without all that description, this story could have been told in half the number of pages and been a much better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character development","review":"One of the best things about this book is the way it leaves the reader asking the question, \\"What would YOU do?\\" The idea of \\"cutting off\\" a community to save it from what's going on outside that community was a very real option for folks living in that part of the country during that time. The pros and cons are so interesting to think about. I love Mullen's character development. His subjects are complex and his writing really gives you a chance to get inside their heads. This is a very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot wasted","review":"After reading some reviews here I decided to read the book myself. I made it to page 186 before giving up on it. The plot idea is great, but Mullen does not do it credit. There are two major faults: 1)whenever any tension starts to build, it is broken by long passages of boring detail; 2) this leads to the second problem: too much \\"filler\\" that does not contribute to the storyline. Mullen could greatly benefit by studying a writer like Hemingway who knew how to say something in a concise manner. Mullen repeats character background stories to the point of boredom. He began with a very workable idea but let his writing get in the way. Better luck on his next attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could kick myself","review":"for buying this book. Why didn't I read the other 1 star reviews first? I got as far as 30 pages and resigned myself to the fact this book will not get better. I had apparently read the first chapter online here and found it very good. I assumed this was how the book would continue...but no, it took an abrupt detour into a shallow story with not much mention of the flu. Words spent on character development but moreso, the writing was elementary and uninteresting. Descriptions were nondescript and boring. I could have written this book. It was like Message in a Pill Bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the empathy?","review":"This book had everything that it needed to become a really great novel. It had an excellent plot, an original storyline, etc. But I never felt emotionally invested with the characters. So disappointing because I felt like this book could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sputter, sputter","review":"The story setup was great ... quarantined town, neighboring towns in trouble, fort nearby, Philip's moral dilemma. All the pieces were set, and then ... the author just didn't know what to do with the great setup he'd created. The last 50 pages were an extreme letdown. I can just imagine someone like Stephen King taking the story's setup and running with it ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction","review":"A well structured novel that unravels in details and plot with characters making complex decisions. There's much WW I, Spanish Flu and Labor history shared in this provocative story about a Washington town.For those listening, there's an excellent, detached narrator that keeps you interested. I thought this was a great audiobook, as the descriptions and dialogue are rather straightforward and easy to follow. There's plenty of suspense, though it's not genre fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Town on Earth","review":"Take a minor event in American history, add the flu epidemic 0f 1918, WWI, a new mll town in the northwest and you have the makings of a great story. Thomas Mullan has done just that in \\"The Last Town on Earth\\". With the flu epidemic wiping out towns across America, the newly formed mill town of Commonwealth has decided to quarantine the town to keep people out so that their residents do not catch the flu. Then a soldier appears at the blockade and is killed. What happens next as Commonwealth struggles with being locked inside its own borders? Mullan has written a fascinating and touching story."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"This was a beautiful story! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the ending - I was hoping it would be a little bit happier. But what a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Town on Earth","review":"This is the worst book I've read in years. The story line is so promising, but the author lets us down with an incomplete ending. The only reason I read past the first half was to hopefully find some last chapter redemption, but alas. I love historical novels, and this book is supposedly based on some historic facts, but the history was not dealt with in either an informative or entertaining way. Only two of the cast of characters were given more than cursory examination. The book was just a lot of words dealing with a lot of sadness. I couldn't get a closeness with any of the characters, so I really didn't care what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest book I've ever read-But I did read it","review":"Good to read if there isn't anything better in the house.

Finished, I felt like I had just read Ethan Frome or Goodbye, Mr. Chips. It held a subtle strength of meaning I had to really think about to get in hand. I have a hunch literature classes will be looking at this book over the years and peeling back layer after layer of meaning and sharpening little brains on the stone of the story. Read this book in a few hours, then wonder about it for the days and weeks to follow. Mind candy, it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written tragic story","review":"I don't know where Thomas Mullen has been hiding all these years, but judging from his first novel I think it's safe to say this is not the last we will see of him. The Last Town on Earth is a very well-thought out, thoroughly researched, and well-written story. The main characters in this book find themselves in an absolutely impossible situation created by the war, the influenza outbreak, economic realities, and other factors. The result is a tragic story all the way around. It's always great to come across a writer as adept at his profession as Mullen is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great topic deserves better","review":"I'm in line with the other 1 and 2 star reviews. I went with 2 stars because the topic is so good and I was able to finish it (what a relief).If you're going to start out your novel on a plague with a quote from Camus - you better deliver. This novel did not.The characters are shallow stereotypes. The plot is painfully predictable while at the same time being juvenile and unrealistic. In the authors opinion people who would take reasonable steps to protect themselves and their families from a deadly plague are foolish and wrong. Count me as one person who would keep the kids home from school while a deadly plague like that of 1918 is rampaging through the community!The authors ignorant view of humanity is well matched by his writing ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring detail. Weak characters.","review":"This book for me did not live up to expectations. I found it boring and too many times strayed off the center story line to go into long boring sub plots that I simply cared nothing about. I wanted to care about these people but I didn't simply because they were weakly developed with too much time spent on boring detail. When the prisoner who is thought to be a spy tells Phillip his story the author tries to put you there while it's happening to him. The detail in dialog is just to the extreme and halfway through I did not care about this guy or his history and in the end it simply did not matter. So why spend pages upon pages to tell his story? The history of the flu epidemic was interesting and I liked the authors 'idea' of how one town handled the situation but other than that I didn't care about the people or what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful struggle....","review":"....to get through this book. I thought the concept was intriguing, and, liking history, also thought the historical component of the storyline would be interesting. They're not. The writing is painfully sophomoric. I'm certain a 12 year old could pick this book up and it would be an easy read for them. Mullen does not write convincing dialogue - it comes across as flat and unemotional, leading to weak character development - compounded with his inability to successfully change character points-of-view, adds up to failed literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, weak execution","review":"I was bored by this book. The idea is a compelling one, but the writing is leaden and drab, in need of a much more talented editor to tighten it and make it come to life a bit more. The anachronisms and editing lapses were annoying too. Did teenagers in 1916 really refer to their mothers as \\"my mom\\"? I don't think so. I bought this book because there were so many positive reviews here which usually bodes well, but if you like books that are actually compelling to read, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and predictable","review":"This story moves too slowly and I lost interest midway through the book. The writing seemed stilted, too. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly frightening","review":"I read Flu: The Story Of The Great Influenza Pandemic, as well as Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It, so was interested in the premise of this work of historical fiction. During the Spanish flu epidemic, a small logging town quarantines itself from the world, refusing to allow anyone into the village.The story is interesting, weaving German spies, conscientious objectors, and the political climate of WWI into the underlying story of human values.It's a quiet book -- even with many emotional conflicts, it never gets loud or bombastic. I enjoyed it, although a few bits went on a trifle long.Recommended!Lori Anderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"All downhill after the third chapter","review":"The Prologue was riveting, and the first two chapters held my attention. Then it seemed that another writer took control: the prose became wooden, the dialogue sounded manufactured, and the characters felt one-dimensional ... so much so that reading became a chore; I didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"Very good style of writing and fast-pace for a novel that explores an unknown period of history.

At first that was more or less how I, too, attempted to attack this book, but even short passages began to test my nerves, and I soon found myself skipping ahead, looking for the meat of the book. Of course, there is no meat, there are just pages and pages of what happens when an academic tries to write about kitsch----meat-flavored cotton candy. Well, not quite, but something just as empty, incongruous and unpleasant. The author fails to connect what eventually comes across as self-obsession and vanity with the book's supposed subject, and as a result it is not successful as academic writing, as sociological or media study, as biography, or, most importantly, as entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissism on parade","review":"What a waste of paper! It would be hard to imagine a more self-indulgent exercise than using literary critical skills to analyze your own gushy fantasies about a celebrity--at times it veers from mere triviality into being deeply offensive in its presumptions about how one can \\"dissect\\" someone's private pain.

I cannot imagine anyone reading it straight through; but rather, it is excellent bathroom reading, to be opened and shut quickly.

It is, quite simply, a sick symptom of the celebrity obsession of our culture, being passed off as East Coast intellectualism. There is nothing intellectual about it.

So I managed to find the correct bolts here on Amazon, which added several dollars to my cost. But worse than that, now that I've finally got it installed, the little flaps at the back that cover the bolts will not stay closed!

The instructions are minimal, and consists of an illustration of how the screw, the bolts and the washers should fit. There are two washers, one metal and one thin rubber one. It is difficult to tell whether the metal one go on top or the bottom by looking at the illustration but I figured it makes more sense for the metal one to be on top. The seat looks good, with a good thick shiny finish, and better than some plastic ones I have used. There are a couple of spots where the wood had tiny imperfections, if I want to nitpick, but the paint covering it is plenty thick so there is no chance they will cause any damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Seat","review":"Bought as a replacement part.

For home- or student-study this edition can be warmly recommended. German-speakers (or, like this reviewer, Anglo-German) may find the interstitial Italian libretto an irritation. But at this price, who can complain, especially as it has a sewn spine, which will bear re-covering in hardback long after the cover has become worn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading","review":"Schuon has an ability to write from that rare place--in comparison to which most people writing on religious diversity simply do not have the requisite tools--to give the sacred its due.

Assuming that the photographer couldn't have flown over all the locations by chance, I think it safe to say that it took a plentitude of imagination to complete this project. How would one know how the resulting photos would look like before seeing them himself? Perception of beauty changes with many things, and availability of its images is no small factor.

The outside ID still works, but NOW, the inside screen is either, black or white OR multi-color with so many horizontal lines, that I cannot function anymore. I can't access my address book and not all info is on my SIM card... guess I've lost some valuable information. I've been a faithful Motorola customer for 5 years.

I've taken mine into a store to replace it and was told that the store didn't carry them because of all the issues with them. These are not worth the money. I had to replace mine again last week.

I was told the phone is still under warranty, but that if we return it and they find the damage is caused by the user, they will charge $150 for the replacement phone. Well, no phone is going to break if you put it on the shelf and leave it there. No cell phone should break from flipping a flip phone shut (as in screen damage) or from being taken in and out of a pocket.

I was trying to save a buck - big mistake. I'm not a big fan of Cingular and I can't tell which is worse, their service or this phone. I can barely hear out of the phone and forget it if you have the windows down in the car. The ringer is easily drowned out, even at its highest setting. And when I go to my mother's house, which is 10 min from mine, I can't use it all. The address book is set up weird; for each entry there's a separate line which is dumb. And on most phones, you can personalize the screen, not this one. I guess I was spoiled by my previous cell provider. The free phones I got from them were way better than this one, and I paid for this one.

Yes, the screen is SLIGHTLY smaller that a few other phones but if you want a phone to actually make and receive calls, this is a great phone... What I especially appreciate about this phone is the volume in loud areas.... I got rid of my previous phone, an LG brand phone, because its battery did not hold a charge, it often made me restart it before I could make a call after exiting a building, and because it had low volume... The Motorola phone is plenty loud and has great reception. Some people complained about the lack of included ring tones. Well, that's a valid complaint, but ALL Motorola phones are like that...spend the $1.99 to buy the ring tone you really want from Cingular - big deal....

As of now, I can call manually and receive calls but heaven forbid it goes into voicemail.

I always end up having to call the person back. Also, the V220 often has a very weak signal in places where my roommate's phone will have a full signal, and I frequently have calls dropped.

For a month after my return I attempted to upgrade to another phone, only be transferred, told to go online, told to go to the store, told to call, etc. In one month of trying to work with Cingular, not ONE single solitary person helped me in any way.

The biggest upside honestly is that it smells wonderful and holds well in damp hair for a little while.In the end i don't know if you had to have just gotten your hair done or something for it to take effect but it didn't do much for my long, relaxed hair.

Every gay character in this film fits a stereotypically macho straight image of what gay people are, and you can tell because the acting on both sides is very forced and very rarely funny.

As always, they fall in love and sneak of with their 'true love.' Predictable, boring, shallow and a lame attempt at a movie. These girls aren't people your daughter should look up to.

And it has paid off over the years in how much more expanded their minds became. I loved the fun rhyme in this small book. The words splashed and played, and made you want to recite them aloud! I look for such books because rhyme, alliteration, and so forth, are very good developers of the whole brain, allowing right and left hemispheres to communicate and strengthen their synchronicity together. I wish major publishers weren't so afraid to do this type of thing more often. I much prefer books like this to books published by major publishers with movie and TV-character tie-ins! The drawings were lovely, and made you want to look closely amidst the ocean to see something no one else sees.

I puchased this new one, as I have just recently moved my youngest daughter into her big sisters room and she has been asking for one. Tent is good quality and have not had any issues with it. If there was a downfall, it would be that the bottom is made of nylon and and you cannot place a sheet over top of it due to the fact the bottom is fitted to go over a twin bed. You need to throw a blanket over it and even then it is prone to slip off. My daughter does not seem to mind but it would bother me. Still a gerat product and is enjoyed by my daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tent, worth the money.","review":"Our 4 year old daughter loved receiving this tent for Christmas!

She also feels safer during storms as she has told us that her tent \\"protects\\" her. I had struggled with paying this much for a bed tent since the Disney ones are much cheaper, but after reading all the reviews I decided that I would spring for this one instead and I'm so glad I did.

I was excited to find similar role models. I was deeply disappointed in this book. I thought this was a Christian book because that is the reputation Mary Lee Tracy has and the book was published by a Christian publisher (Standard Publishing). I was disappointed to find the contributors from all walks of life and philosopy including New Age. Many of the athletes' entries are pretty light on Christian committment. And, one contributer is outright New age. Dr. Allison Arnold is a sports pschologist who is highlighted in the book. She has trained with monks and admits she is a closet eastern philosopy junkie whose sport's philosophy is based on the wisdom of the east. That would be ok if that was known prior to buying the book.

Keith Barton is a fascinating thriller about an unlikely duo, a cop near retirement and a young health care executive with a brilliant career.

The main plot and the parallel plots all come together to a very surprising end.

Scoblete not only tells you how to play dozens of the most popular games in the casino, he also explains what your psychology should be when you play them. The last chapter of the book, called \\"A Day in the Life of a Guerrilla Gambler,\\" is wonderful and would make a great movie.

To save you ten bucks, let me summarize: Play only the games with the best odds, (other than video poker) Play only a few hand/rounds/rolls, if you are ahead, leave the table,you are now a \\"guerrilla gambler\\".

Scanning, Wonging, or whatever you call it will get you tossed in the real world in minutes. Also, who wants to fly to Vegas for five minutes of play? Taking odds on someone else's pass line bet, while innovative, is a good way to get a facelift. Buying numbers for $38 instead of 40 to save a lousy dollar? Clipping coupons and betting opposite sides to win $5? Might as well stay home, IMHO. Biased roulette wheels? Sure--guess how they pay for all those lights. The anecdotal chapter is interesting, but Barry Meadow's Blackjack Autumn and Stuart Perry's Las Vegas Blackjack Diary are far superior examples of the reality genre.

For those that cannot stand his longer films, this would be the perfect venue to view his topics.Michael Moore's short lived \\"TV Nation\\" gets a long awaited resurrection and make-over with \\"The Awful Truth\\" which demonstrates the true power and potential of television. Michael Moore is the documentarian behind \\"Roger And Me\\" and \\"The Big One\\" and author of \\"Downsize This\\".Do yourself a favour, catch this show, have a laugh, and watch an important crusader do what he does best, make slimy corporations very nervous, and improving the world a bit at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"michael moore is a real american","review":"same. just bumping up the rating. by the way, did you know that if bush didnt have the most powerful family in the country he would not have even gotten into college? also, did you know he is an imbecile? and did you know that the saying is \\"let freedom ring\\" and not \\"let freedom reign\\" as bush seems to think? even if moore is a college dropout, at least he has the ability to not mangle the english language damn near every time he speaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mean side of Michael Moore","review":"It's easy to see why Moore didn't last as a teevee host. I thought he had a tendency to be mean at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore is Dishonest and Misleading","review":"Michael Moore's series is just another attempt to create inflammatory sentiment towards conservatives because of his left-wing liberal beliefs. I do believe that it is a useful function in democracy for opposing forces to check one another through vigorous debate. However, it is clear that Michael Moore is guilty of the very thing he accuses: He distorts the truth to suit his own political purposes.In fact, he has even admitted that his documentaries are not based to reflect pure historical accuracy - but rather, tailored and edited piece by piece to fit his own agenda. If this is the case, let's accept his work for what it is, a piece of theatre with maybe entertainment value, but no serious political value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I'm giving this 5 stars because the music is fantastic and I don't want to bring the rating down. However, make sure you're buying what you want!! I was on the page for Fake Plastic Trees CD2 (which includes acoustic versions of FPT, Bullet Proof, and Stret Spirit) and Amazon said it was available on MP3. However, when I clicked on the link to the MP3 version, it took to me Fake Plastic Trees CD1, which is completely different (featuring India Rubber and How Can You Be Sure?). Fortunately I realized this right before I made a purchase. So if CD1 is what you're looking for, you're good to go; if CD2 is what you want then you will have to buy the CD or look for the MP3s elsewhere as Amazon does not appear to have them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Good riddance Woodie.

Alison's voice is AMAZING on this disc. This girl has the writing and vocal talents in the same league as Bjork. The eq, mixing, and acoustics are extremely pleasant on this recording. They're not the most heavily funded band out there, so what they had to work with as far as gear and sound engineer staff probably wasn't what you'd expect from famous bands on big labels. There's some wobbling and imperfections hear and there, but it's quite endearing in its own way. I'm compelled to recommend this to someone who doesn't have any or many Cranes CD's. This is one to get. The entire range of the band's greatest moments is represented here. I just can't believe so many of those moments from their albums that send a wonderful chill (or whatever you want to call that pleasant tingly sensation) down my spine translated so well in a live setting. I feel an urge to buy a plane ticket to their next concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing concert, an amazing band","review":"Not much to say about this.The song selection is near-perfect (not too heavily-reliant on their newest album \\"Future Songs\\", a nice mix of older songs), and the sound-quality is near-perfect.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"another winner","review":"As with the other Daybreak Mysteries, B. J. Hoff does a great job of putting Daniel and Jennifer right back into the action and suspense that seems to follow them wherever they go. In The Tangled Web, they meet a mob informant as well as a mentally handicapped boy who will eventually become their son. The way that Daniel deals with his own handicap of blindness is an inspiration in this series as well as the way that the characters lean on the power of God to see them through dangerous and even life-threatening situations. The Tangled Web, like all of the Daybreak mysteries, kept me reading until the end and I thank B. J. for her great writing style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew out within a couple of uses","review":"After two uses the amplifier stopped working. There was sound coming out but no amplification.

They looked at it and said it was fried, the whole board needed replacement costing $250. Finally threw the amplifier in the trash and bought Behringer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I loved this system after I bought it brand new, out of the original boxes.

Because there is nothing in Geordie to put this band above some of the most dull, insipid and common rock bands from the 70's.

I walked away from this CD with 13 new favorite songs, and that doesn't happen very often. In fact, \\"You Wanted More,\\" which will probably power the sales of the album, is one of the weaker tracks.

I saw it in a store and i bought it cuz i didnt know what else to buy. It turned out that it was my summer anthem for 2008. It reminds me of a lot of good memories that summer and my summer love. This cd totally reminds me of my boyfriend and till this day we are still together. Every time i hear the song \\"sugar\\" it reminds me of him. FAV Song on the album! and when and if i do get married to him the last song on the album will be our wedding song! Ive decided! haha! Get the CD and u will not be missin out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the '90s","review":"Sugar is one of the great records of the '90s, in fact its in my personal top ten. The rock songs are instantly catchy and the ballads have a quiet depth lyrically and musically. The overall quality of the songwriting is outstanding. Their previous album was uneven with some rock'n'roll highpoints, 'Sugar' is all quality. The followup to 'Sugar' is 'Head on Straight', while not quite as smooth as 'Sugar' it too is a worthy addition to any rock and roll record collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Cd","review":"I really like this Cd. I first heard it when I rented it from the library not knowing how good it would be. I'm not a huge fan of the softer bands like Fastball, Matchbox 20, or Radiohead, whom Tonic could be compared to, but I really liked this Cd. The first four tracks are worth listening to over and over especially my favorites #3 and #4 (\\"Knock Down Walls\\" and \\"Mean to Me\\"). The rest of the Cd is alright. The first four are the obvious stand-outs that really make this Cd good, but I can listen to the whole thing even though it gets softer and a little bit bland. Seriously, though, if you like the bands I mentioned above, TRY TONIC! If you are like me and thing they are decent, but not horrible, I would give this Cd a chance, because I did and I am glad that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tonic","review":"Tonic and Collective Soul are like brothers from two different mothers. Both bands represent the heavier side of rock with a high degree of sophistication. The new Tonic is a good successor to \\"Lemon Parade\\". This time around Tonic ditched some of the acoustic elements in favor of electronic instruments, ok by me. The writting, arrangements and sound quality are all above average on this CD. The songs are not \\"hit\\" catchy but grow on you with familarity, my favorite way to enjoy music. This band is probably one of the most talented, and likely under selling, band you can find. If high quality, adult heavy rock is your pleasure (try it you'll like it) this CD will not disappoint, it really cooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Wow...I got this one earlier today and have listened to it twice already. I was a big fan of Tonic's first album \\"Lemon Parade\\", but this one is even better. There isn't a bad track to be found. Tonic's rich and layered sound is as powerful as ever; if anything, they've picked up a terrific mature edge to their music. My early favorites include \\"You Wanted More\\", \\"Knock Down Walls\\", and \\"Waiting for the Light to Change\\", but every song is catchy and the album as a whole is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mega pop","review":"Beatlesque chords and harmonies over driving drums.

I'm satisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"Become a Tonic-holic!","review":"This is the most underrrated band around - Tonic possesses the ability to write songs that you have to listen to over and over. The only downfall is that you will have to purchase more than one copy to replace the one you wear out! The only thing better than popping one of their CD's into the player is their live show! This band is genuine and their music reflects such diversity. From melodic ballards to songs that rock even the hardest rocker.This album and their previous one (Lemon Parade) is a favorite for all ages. Without a doubt, you'll be hooked! Catch their act when they hit your town!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"This is one excellent CD. If you're a fan of all those pop rock bands out there, you will love this CD.
