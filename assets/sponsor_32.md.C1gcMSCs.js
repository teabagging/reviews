Terrible software","review":"The printer isn't more than an ordniary inkjet and they changed the ink cartridge size to very small ones so you keep buying them (it seems). But the worst part of this printer is the software that goes with it. If you want to install all the features be ready to let go of 780MB of space!! That has to be bloatware incompetent programming.

I even shined a flashlight inside and I am baffled as to what is causing the error.

Eye of the Storm is a magnificent tone poem for guitar, Along the Way is a superb folk song, Green Kitchen is beautiful and it bounces along, and The 5:55 is a great steam engine and jazzy piece. The whole CD - it's beautifully recorded, enhanced by the fact that LJ plays without fingernails - which makes for a beautiful texture of sound - flesh on steel against wood - he simply has the best tone possible. The thing that is great about this album, is that it grows on you - there is great composition, technique, and genuine musicianship from LJ, who sounds like he is playing from his heart - his authentic self - which is a joy for me, because he is truly one of the masters of guitar and composition.

I couldn't put the book down. Jane Dunn brings an impressive amount of primary scholarship to her account of the blood rivals, Elizabeth I and her cousin, Mary Queen of Scotts; but her narrative skills and psychological insight drives the story forward and makes the two passionate principals vividly alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"JANE DUNN- all her books are excellent","review":"I just wanted to leave feedback, not write a review. Book is excellent. Balanced between Mary and Elizabeth with great insight shown in both characters. What a time to live--as if in a plague. People dying from poverty, illness, guillotine. Fascinating to read and compare our lives. The court intrigues were not much different from what goes on in our government."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE SIDED","review":"Impartial to both rulers, I find this book terribly one sided...much in favor of Elizabeth while essentially chastising Mary through repetetive points of describing Mary's sexual appetite and ineptness even though the next lines and paragraphs have nothing to do with the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"The latest of a great biographer","review":"I have read Jane Dunn's books since she began with \\"Moon in Eclipse,\\" the story of Mary Shelley, the author of the tale of Frankenstein's monster and the lover of Percy Shelley, the English, tragic poet and friend of Lord Byron. She has grown as a biographer over these 30 years, from someone that dared not be public in her great talent to a mature writer who now has not only the courage to build a reputation for herself, but as someone who has taken a unique place in literature similar to Lyton Strachey, and with the potential of Virginia Wolf without the madness. This, her latest, rich volume will take its place in that tapestry that she sews - hopefully for many more adventures to come.I certainly would not have known of this extraordinary relationship between two monarchs without Jane's efforts and ability to paint a picture that comes alive again in her telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good account of the cousins' complex relationship","review":"Two incredible women, historically significant figures, are thoroughly dissected and portrayed in this highly readable account that actually seems to pick up momentum and becomes more entertaining as the story unfolds.While there doesn't seem to be too much startlingly new information, the structure of their complex relationship is intricately and interestingly put together for genre fans. The author's bias seems to be with Elizabeth throughout, but remains good historical reading nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for a book that would give me an unbiased discussion about these two women and their relationship. Instead I found it was really just another of many many books that put Elizabeth on a pedestal and Mary somewhere very much lower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but it grew on me","review":"I'll admit to being disappointed when this book first arrived (a couple of years ago now). I must not have paid very close attention to the details and was expecting something different. However, I came to enjoy reading about how Halloween was celebrated in its Golden Age.The one complaint I have about this book has been stated by other reviewers as well: the illustrations are too small! Many of the images would be SO much better if they were larger. (The desktop publisher in me also *cringes* at the page layout!) More pages with larger graphics would have resulted in a better book (and five stars from me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage/Two Step Dancehall?!","review":"This is a good record (dancehall reggae). The songs are recorded over the same music track, but a very danceable one, and it sounds like Garage House/Two Step to me even though it's from 1994. The best songs are from Leroy Smart (best one), Lemsky Don, Beres Hammond and Junior Tucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This had the potential to be so much more than it was. To quote from the description, 'Over four hundred women fought disguised as men in the ranks of the American Civil War.'I'm sure there were many fascinating stories that could have been told. Unfortunately, the wrong story was chosen here. These 2 women were on a journey for much of the movie yet their story never really went anywhere. Their paths crossed but not enough effort was made to show a relationship developping between them, be it friendship or something more. The ending was particularly disappointing but by then I had lost interest in the characters anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Production Values","review":"An interesting concept for a film, unfortunately it is a very amateurish production.

You also get a feel for Elvis's childlike enthusiasm and charm: I particularly liked the part where Elvis gets a horse and then decides that all his friends should have horses. He then goes out and buys a stable full of horses. Several little stories like that make this book worth reading. On the critical side, this book may not be well suited for audio format: the narrative overall is very choppy. But that isn't reason enough not to read it: thumbs up for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boredom and drugs finished off Elvis","review":"Interesting but sometimes a too detailed look at the slow, sad decline of a legend. Elvis's recurring nightmare which he had for years was an image of being left all alone at Graceland with the Colonel and his extended family long gone and no fans lining up at the gate. His bizarre eating and prescription drug abuse habits made sure he would be dead long before this could happen. The author must have got hold of extensive accounting reports when writing this book because he liked to give detailed percentage cuts of the profits on movies and songs between Elvis and his manager Col. Parker, this kind of slowed the reading down a bit but I guess it showed how inept both Elvis and his father Vernon were when it came to business. It was surprising to see how Elvis's spending habits had forced him to take out another bank mortgage on Graceland which must have added to his bleak outlook of things near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Behind the Scenes Glimpse","review":"This book was very detailed in the events of Elvis' life post army and until his death; he led a fascinating life and this book gives you an in depth look. However, it was so detailed that certain parts became very boring, such as the financial details of his performance engagements. Overall though, it was quite good. Even if you aren't a huge Elvis fan, this book was very insightful, especially on his downfalls including his prescription drug addiction, diminished record sales and movie credibility, and his many women. You almost feel like you were there getting to witness the greatness of this legend and suffer the pain of his heartbreaks with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put book down!","review":"From cover to cover, this book was absorbing. The quotes were intertwined with the fast-paced narrative. I felt as if I were living life alongside Elvis as a \\"fly on the wall\\" so to speak. This is a book every Elvis fan must own. His human flaws only make you love him more and wish we still had him with us. What a dear person he was: An original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure for Those Who Love Pop Music","review":"Careless Love, the second volume of this exhaustive biography of Elvis Presley, is one of the finest, most detailed books I have ever read on any subject. But this book is not only for Elvis lovers: It transcends that by appealing to those--and there are many of us--who care about a famous life, brought to life with authority, compassion, and suspended judgment. One does not come to know Elvis, but to understand him. Rock on, Peter Guralnick: your work is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a book on the greatest musical artist of modern times","review":"I just finished reading this book and am amazed at the insights into Elvis' life that the author showed. He covered a lot of things that have been covered ad nauseum by others yet made it read like a novel. And, he adds so much more detail to the day-to-day life of Elvis that provide a much fuller description of his life. Even the footnotes are fascinating reading.For a true Elvis fan, this is a must have for your collection. I could hardly put it down and this is not trivial reading, given that the book is more than 700 pages. Mr. Guralinick's 1st book on Elvis (\\"Last Train to Memphis: the Rise of Elvis Presley\\") is a must read also."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pinnacle of rock and roll biography","review":"As a preface, I'm a fan of rock music and as Elvis was the personification of rock in the late fifities, I'm also a fan of his early pre-movie work. Taken together the two volumes are a masterwork of rock biography and should be the standard set for rock bios to come. This volume is a retelling of the long spiral down from his Army years to his last days. It's less sensational than the Goldman work of several years ago and more penetrating. Mr. Gurainick chronicles the change in his later years by showing how his changing attitudes affected his concert performances and set list. Some parts changed my views of the last years. Others confirmed some already held opinions Most importantly, when I finished the book, I had a sense of sadness at the waste of talent as poor judgments steer him from his 50's greatness to the mediocrity of his Hollywood and Vegas years. We really do see the \\"Unmaking\\" of the man portrayed in Last Train to Memphis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb companion to \\"Last Train to Memphis\\"","review":"As he did with \\"Last Train To Memphis\\", Peter Guralnick has once again written a definitive book on Elvis.

Even if you are not an Elvis fan, you will find this book engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much is fabrication?","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Peter Guralnick is a skillful writer. There is likewise no doubt in my mind, after reading the paragraphs about Johnny Rivers and the song \\"Memphis\\" in his book, \\"Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley\\", that he is also an unethical writer. Either Guralnick did not investigate the motive of his sources prior to presenting the \\"Memphis\\" incident, or he was aware of the glaring inaccuracies and chose to write the misleading account anyway. Perhaps he was attempting to elicit sympathy for poor, trusting Elvis. This is an amusing paradox, as Guralnick seems to have little difficulty in exploiting the memory of Elvis for his own gain. I urge anyone who feels they must read this book, to take everything that is presented as truth with a grain of salt. I know the Johnny Rivers/Memphis accusation is a falsehood, how many other bits of fabrication are contained within this supposedly non-fiction work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my mother hate Elvis","review":"I gave this book to my mother as a gift and she told me that it totally destroyed her love for Elvis.

I've read other books before that i didn't like , but it wasn't because it was boring , it just focused on one elment to long and seemed to be bias. I think i learned more about elvis in Led Zeplin book. These books from what i've read are supose to tell every thing there is about elvis. If this is true he was very dry and boring , i feel like i'm not reading a biography but a dry boring novel about some guy that happened to get famous.

A major problem is that Elvis' life from 1958 to 1977 just isnt as interesting or dramatic as his initial rise to success. Mostly what we have here is a catalog of desultory and listless moviemaking, punctuated by an occasional recording session or concert that ignites the King's interest. To Guralnick's everlasting credit, he enjoys Elvis' music and its place in the American Pantheon, even when the music isn't all that good. This is the closest we have yet to an objective biography of Elvis Presley, but this half of the life did not merit an entire volume. And what is all this nonsense here on Amazon about Johnny Rivers? So what if he beat Elvis to the punch releasing Chuck Berry's Memphis? Does anyone whose last name is not Rivers really care anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K but not definitive, or for everyone","review":"I did not enjoy this book as much as other Elvis biographies that I have read. It is simply a hash of a number a biographies written over the years by the people surrounding him and hashed together by a writer -a good one at that, but at what -700 plus pages long it seemed to actually reveal less than some of the more personal, shorter and even judgemental books around. The Elvis biographies I personally liked best and would reccommend are \\"Elvis and Gladys\\" and \\"Child Bride\\" as well as Alanna Nash's book on the Colonel.. Strangely those were not included as the source for this book. Therefore I think it's wrong to call it definitive as has been in previous reviews. It's not bad but I don't think it's the best bio -even if others says so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and save your money.","review":"I've been a long time Elvis fan, and have read many books on him. This book has about 20-30 pages that are interesting, but the rest of the book is just plain boring. The author talks a lot, and I mean alot about contracts, other people who most people couldn't care less about, and does so in a long and boring style. How many pages can be devoted to boring contract deals over and over? It appears that this author is just putting together a lot of filler to sell a book. Like others have said, there is virtually nothing new in this book that hasn't been published before. I got through about 75% of the book and will probably finish it, but it is one tough read. Thankfully, I got this book used at a discount book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing book","review":"I have read a lot of Elvis books, some good, some not. This one seemed determined to just show the bad side of the man. It is a thick book. By time I got done reading it, if I had not read other books, I would really think he was a bad person. I truly regret buying it. I tossed it in the trash when I was done.If you like Elvis, do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis is King","review":"I am still reading the first part Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley but can't wait to start this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written, scholarly treatise","review":"Few people have ever impacted American culture as did Elvis Presley; his contribution to rock music is immeasurable. Guralnick takes a scholarly approach and writes a carefully researched, detailed biography of The King. The first book deals with his meteoric rise from humble beginnings; the second deals with superstar Elvis and his sad decline. No doubt readers will wonder how they could have saved Elvis if only they'd known him; unfortunately, the only person who could have saved Elvis was himself. Forces and fate no doubt played a role which drove Elvis to use drugs as an escape from the stresses and abnormality of his life.Both books by Guralnick stand alone as well-written biographies of the King. However, I recommend reading them both to get the full impact. It is refreshing to have available a serious, respectful book on Elvis Presley that's void of the usual sensationalistic, simplistic trash found in other, hastily-churned-out Presley biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Intelligent","review":"As a native of memphis, I grew up surrounded by Elvis and his music. While not a fanatic, I have always had an appreciation for the man's music-and the circumstances in which he found himself. So I found this book to be the best I've read so far-honest, revealing and smart. If you think the man was/is some sort of deity who could do no wrong-or if you stubbornly view Elvis as an overweight, vegas joke- then this book will make you rethink your opinions. It is straighforward AND sympathetic. Guralnick restores Elvis's humanity, for better or work, and slso exposes the syncophants -and true friends-who surrounded him. a very important book on a very important man.PS- why wont all the johnny rivers disciples get off amazon and take it to Guralnick?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but with 2 criticisms","review":"The book was great, as was Volume 1. I only had two regrets about it. First, I wish that there had been a bit more of a \\"retrospective\\" view of Elvis' life at the end, including the author's own views as to what may be learned from Elvis' life. Instead, the book ends somewhat more abruptly than I had hoped, with his death occurring virtually on the last pages. Second, while the book has been (accurately) complimented for being scrupulously fair and non-judgmental, I would have like to see it be a bit MORE judgmental, so as to learn the author's views as to those who were really the \\"good guys\\" in his life (i.e. those who saw what was happening and tried to stop it) vs. the \\"bad guys\\" (i.e. those who were either oblivious or those did not care.). While I have some of my own views, I would be interested in the author's. As it was, it was like reading an excellent newspaper with no editorial page and no op-ed page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"captures the era .. and the man","review":"I really enjoy Guralinick's books on musicians and music history. This one was also a very intriguing and informative read. There is no doubt that some of the diehard Elvis fans will be angered or disappointed with some of the material in here about Elvis, but hey, he was just a man and had faults like the rest of us. But you can't knock the research that Guralnick did, and I think he gives the story of Elvis' later years a fair balance. I learned a lot from this book, and it actually inspired me to go back and listen to some Elvis albums, and buy a copy of the \\"From Memphis\\" CD reissue. I love the way that Guralnick described those recording sessions and the musicians involved in the process and what they were thinking. You don't have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this book, and in fact an initial disinterest in the man and his music might be a better requirement, or at least lead you to a great appreciation and enjoyment of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Pick!","review":"I have tried all those fancy picks and these without a doubt are the best. They have just enough grip for sweaty hands, but the material doesn't change the tone of the guitar. It's not just the feel that I love about these guys, it's that tone it brings with it. I was a proud supporter of the .58's for a good year and a half, and those could pull off anything from twang to metal... but sadly, they were a bit too flexible for my taste, so I bumped it up to the .71's. These bring with it a fuller, more solid tone (I play mostly hard rock and metal/djent), and they don't have that annoying strumming sound that you can hear while even your amp is on. Basically, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent","review":"These certainly do hold your grip a little better than regular picks, and they DEFF hold better with sweaty fingers. That's the only difference, playing and tone is the same. Which is a good thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite picks","review":"The texture of these picks make them very easy to hold on to. They are also very tough and don't have a tendency to break like regular plastic picks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier to not drop; not sticky; best with new strings","review":"This pick has some kind of coating that increases the friction with your fingers, so you are less likely to drop it, but the pick does not feel at all sticky. The coating seems to wear away after a while, but the pick is still easier to avoid dropping than a regular celluloid pick, which is slippery when your hands perspire. The pick has a darker sound than a Fender medium pick, apparently because the material is not as hard. The pick seems to wear faster than a standard Fender pick, but it still has a long enough life that the difference is unimportant. I like this pick best when strings are relatively new because this pick takes some of the treble edge off the sound of new strings. After the strings start sounding duller, but before they are dead, I like to switch to a Fender pick, which brightens up the sound a bit. I like the sound, the feel, and the friction of this gator grip pick very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"No so much","review":"No scent... Hmm. My girl can tell when I wear it.

I thought it would be better since i can use it with my favorite cologne, but it's a bad news bears. Just buy the scented one. I bought this to seduce my professor so she can give me a better grade just for the lulz, but no it doesn't work.Let's talk about the scent itself. Even though it's unscented it smells a little plastic with oil. If that's what pheromone smells like then i have no clue. There wasn't any label on the bottle what so ever so it may/may not be a legitimate \\"Scent of Eros\\". I may be wrong, but i didn't get any response from any ladies so far.

None of the terms or products are the same as the USA. Even the explanations of techniques are hard to understand because of all the english terms and slangs.

As others have posted, this live version of Kite from Sydney, Australia is amazing. Forget Live in Boston, forget Slane Castle. Those are good and adequate live versions of this song but this one is the best because of Edge's extended guitar solo. Edge must have the frequency of heaven wired through his guitar or something because angels weep when he plays on this track. If U2 doesn't incorporate it permanently into all future live performances, it will be a disappointment.Make sure to get this version with the live tracks of Zoo Station and Kite because there are other versions of this single out there that don't have these bonus tracks.Buy the thing already.

I'm still in the middle of the game, but it is definately a great game to play. If you like Final Fantasy and Dark Cloud type games you'll love this game also.

Since Chriatmas all I can think about is this game and how I'm going to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best RPGs","review":"Shadow Hearts is one heck of a game you can't ignore, I played it for a few minutes and was instantly hooked. It's got excellent graphics and great music, the battle system is unique and the story is truely good. I would recomend Shadow Hearts to anyone who liked Final Fantasy. You play as Yuri - a young man with a mysterious past - trying to save the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Psuedo-Sequal to Koudelka-and IM GLAD!!!","review":"This is one of the most overlooked games I have ever seen. It's inovativness and originality go hand in hand. With the slew of different characters and dynamic storyline this game is sure to keep gamers pulled in. My only recommendation is that you play an beat Koudelka first. Otherwise in my opinion you will ruin alot of the plot twists in the story of Shadow hearts. So if you can run to get Koudelka do so. If not don't worry. Theres still plenty of thrills an chills to go around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game with a fantastic storyline","review":"A different kind of game - one that actually has a good story. I picked this game up on the recommendation of a friend and was she ever right! The game is great. While it took a bit to get used to the interface I was impressed by the overall storyline.While the graphics are good it's the story that's really is the high point of the game. It takes place in the Victorian era - one with magic and evil plots and heroes. It really is an interesting twist on the fantasy RPG and that's what helped me through the game.The graphics are good, not great but good. They were enough to keep me entertained without boring me or slowing down the action. The only negative points I can say about the game are that it really isn't for younger kids - there are few overly violent/graphic images that may bother them. The other bad point is I needed to download a walk through for some of the more difficult strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School RPG","review":"A great RPG. It requires some skill but is not overly difficult.

After seeing not to stellar reviews I still decided to play it. And I actually really liked it. Too many people compare it to Final Fantasy X, although they are two seperate game's entirely. I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, obviously, and I still liked this game.The Judgement sphere things for collecting items and fighting battle's is a nice change. It give's you a chance to see how much damage you will inflict upon an enemy. As monsters go, there is a nice variety of of types you face off against.If you can't stand anything below par of Final Fantasy X, you might want to skip this game.

And that's how I came across Shadow Hearts. I started the game and in the beginning of the game the CG graphics were pretty good. The Judgement Ring system made the fight scences more interesting. The game is a mix of Horror and RPG and with a Mature rating is really made for people who don't mind an occasional blood and gore scene. I found the story to be very deep and it made you want to play the game to the end just to find out more about the character's past. The music is one of the highlights with music that blends in with the scenario. With over 100 monsters you fight and an intriguing plot line, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must play RPG","review":"This game was suggested to me buy the guy in the video store so I got it along with FFX and I must say I cant stop playing this one I'm enjoying it more then FFX (surprised me)It has a very gothic story and non annoying charaters. Yuri is one of my favorite charaters in a video game along with Squall(FFVIII) and Dante from Devil may cry.The voice overs on some of the cutscenes are rather dumb but this is proably my new favorite role-player game I cant wait to reply for the other ending.

Over-all, idin't want to put the game down. Its like a good book, that you just couldn't put down.( at the young age of 69, I find most good RPG'S are like that).

Certainly this debut album is about as good as the first albums by those bands, or better. Big success apparently wasn't in the cards, but this record is still a powerful one. Ripping through nine aggressive compositions in forty minutes, Exodus were clearly of the \\"fast n' brutal\\" school of metal. The twin-guitar riffing brings to mind a combination of Metallica's KILL 'EM ALL and Slayer's REIGN IN BLOOD. Fast tempos, bucketloads of riffs. Lyrically, Exodus apparently wanted to scare us with their tales of unholy violence, but whenever the words go a little over the top, the music is solid enough to keep things credible. I think the obvious highlights are the title track, 'A Lesson in Violence' and 'Piranha', but all the songs are enjoyable.

If you classify it R&B;, then it blows away most of the garbage on the radio, today. As a jazz disc it is fair, certainly more melodic than most. However, since she really is best at writing masterfully crafted pop, this album does not stand up to the quality of her previous work. Even her vocals don't have the smile and power and sheer joy of singing from those other two albums.I would not recommend this one if you're a fan of Brenda's, because you'll be very disappointed that you wasted your money.

Well one of those magnificent treats has arrived. \\"Between The Sun And The Moon\\" is simply a joy. African nuances both musically and vocally can be found throughout. The music is solid and the vocals are right on point. Highlights include the infectious \\"You Know Our Day Will Come\\", \\"Too Cool For The Room\\", and the thought-provoking \\"Let Somebody Know\\". I can honestly say, I like all the songs on the CD except for two. Ten songs out of twelve aint bad. In a word, MAGNIFICENT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRENDA AT HER VERY BEST!","review":"WHAT A CD!

Covering their golden era-the 80's, the band's best tracks are collected here from their first 8 albums. Brilliant remastered sound, great liner notes by Mick Wall, and 52 tracks all on 3 cds. Beware, as there seems to be 2 versions of this out there, one without the essential anthem, \\"Denim & Leather\\" and including a live version of \\"Midnight Rider\\" instead. I got the one w/ \\"Denim\\". Also the price is amazing-I bought mine new at $10.99-not bad for a 3 disc set. Glaring omissions: \\"This Town Rocks\\", and the rockin' version of Sweet's \\"Set Me Free\\", and I would have left out the horrible, embarassing take on Christopher Cross' \\"Ride Like The Wind\\". That aside, this Saxon collection is essential for any true fan of classic heavy metal.

But except for the classics from the first 5 Saxon cds\\"LPs\\" this item is full of fluff. Great songs include, Dallas 1 pm, Denim & leather, Power and the glory, wheels of steel, and Crusader to name a few. There are also live versions of some of the classics. The biggest problem I have is the drums sound very hollow. I know Saxon never had great production, but I think the analog to digital transfer could have been done much better. One more thing, just like all greatest hits collections they always leave one or two \\"GREAT\\" songs of the list, in this case it is The Eagle has landed, one of Saxons greatest songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early Metal and a great deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great deal for someone getting introduced to saxon.

Not only did we find them with the information provided in the book, but the photos are fantastic and amazingly accurate...or, at least as can be expected considering the subject. As my travel companion and I discovered, taking pictures of the bodies is sometimes frowned upon either because of fear of tarnishing them in some way, or simply out of respect for the saints.

Now that I have read other readers reviews, I am relived to know that I have a more interesting read ahead of me with The Forever King. Life is too short to read a really boring book, or drink bad wine. I finished this book so it couldn't have that boring. The author did portray the knights as complete heathens, I suppose it must been hard to fit in when you have been thrust into a different century altogether.

I got the impression this was written in haste and it shows, (let's just get the third one out and be done!) the author owes her fans (now previous) more than this. I actually thought there must be a 4th book coming out as the characters just flat disintegrated, what a way to end what started as a good inovative new look at the age old problem of might vs right. Both the editor and author should be ashamed (actually I would fire the editor) to put this chaos into publication, at least put out a 4th book to clean up the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but lost it's focus at the end","review":"I'm a fan of books about the Arthurian legend and similar themes, such as The Mysts Of Avalon and DaggerSpell. The idea of Arthur reappearing in modern times to complete unfinished business was intriguing, and for a while The Third Magic really held my attention. Unfortunately, in the last third I felt the book started losing focus. To much attention was given to all the interrelationships of the character's past lives and in the end the whole thing just melted down. Still, I appreciated being reminded of the \\"old magic\\" and give the book two stars. If you're new to the Arthurian Legend I would not recommend this book as an introduction, but for old hands it can be a pleasant diversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even the same series?","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, and it was one of the biggest literary letdowns of my life. It has almost nothing to do with the other two books. It is completely inconsistent with the plot of the second book in particular, and the overall tone is nothing like that of the first two. It feels like it comes out of an entirely different series of books, as if the author completely ignored the fact that it was a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe my disappointment","review":"I have read The Forever King many times and always loved it and shoved it at everyone I knew. The second book in this series' The Broken Sword was...well, not awful, but had some plot problems and certainly didn't compare favorably with the first novel. Well, I just completed the debacle that is The Third Magic and can't believe how many problems there are. Inconsistencies abound, sometimes within the same paragraph. I honestly have to wonder if Ms. Cochran even reread her first two books in the series before she sat down to pen this one. She doesn't seem to remember accurately most of what had gone before. I had waited on this novel for so long and my disappointment is huge.

Tabulature is very easy to understand, but if the book does not explain it well enough for you, go to www.olga.net for more information on how to read tab. The book also has the lyrics to all the songs. The CD has each song in the book with out lyrics, and then has the songs again but without the lead guitar so you can play as the lead guitarist.

It's like being cornered by the most boring person at a party, who likes the sound of his own voice--regardless of whether he is saying anything interesting or not. The way that he has hijacked a biography on Reagan, and placed his own history like a leach on the primary story, leaves me gasping for air. This is only surpassed by his repetitive and abusive use of foreign clich��s, as if he was looking down his nose at the poor, illiterate peasant who has scraped together enough money to pay homage to Lord Morris by purchasing his magnificent tome.

The space dedicated to Morris' own fictional character seems to eclipse that spent on Reagan himself and is -- as a figment of the writer's imagination -- useless in a biography.

I finally had to quit reading on page 367, I just couldn't stand it any longer. I completely agree with previous reviewers of this book who describe the author's smug, arrogant, elitist, self-important writing style. The author's use of nonexistent characters to utter unqualified remarks about Reagan indicated to me that the author is not to be trusted. There was more about the author's imaginary friends than there was about Reagan. I hate \\"revisionist history\\" and this book is the ultimate in history abuse.

True to his credentials as a media elite, he paints Ronald Reagan as a lucky fool, stumbling dumbly through his duties. This is a terrible biographical attempt, and the fictionalized re-creations/dramatizations he creates are truely mind-boggling. I would imagine a school-child with a nodding sense of Reagan probably has more insight into the man's character than Morris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Waiting For","review":"After having to wait several years for this book, I must admit that I'm sorry I purchased it. Morris confuses the reader with his fictional characters and all-too-often used foreign phrases.

In other words, very little of the Reagan presidency is actually discussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the definitive biography Morris was hired to write","review":"I don't have very much to add to what has already been written. However, what I was most disappointed by was the little new information about Reagan's presidency that was developed.

As I read \\"Dutch\\" I couldn't help but sympathize with Edmund Morris' predicament and the tools he had to resort to. With 200 pages devoted to sources it's hard to argue with the accuracy of Morris' basic account of Ronald Reagan. Much like the latest tools used by geologists, a pattern of well-placed seismic blasts can reveal textures and characteristics that would otherwise be buried deep underground. Reagan's past is brought into relief like the rivers of oil 3-D imaging software the prospectors use. While many critics are disappointed with Morris' placement of himself in the narrative, I thought his character helped add perspective and texture.

The author appears to be a liberal, elitist, intelluctual snob who couldn't accept the truth. The truth being that this honest,simple, modestly intellegent man became the greatest president of the 20th century. The author is constatly attempting to attach deep complicted meanings to President Reagan, but is unable to. Thus resorts to his fictional accounts and the injection of his \\"intellectually superior\\" self into this piece of garbage called a memior. Note that most favorable reviews are from Reagan haters. Love him or hate him this book is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing! It's a novel, not a biography.","review":"I was intrigued when I read about Morris' unconventional approach, and looked forward to the book. But once I got into it, \\"Dutch\\" made me angry. It's not biography. It's a fictional tale about an extremely self-centered writer, with Ronald Reagan kind of flickering around in the background. The most self-indulgent and infuriating part of the book is when Morris spends two pages telling us how successful his Roosevelt biography was in 1980 -- but only offers half a page on the fascinating presidential election that year. Morris is much more interested in himself than in Reagan or U.S. history.I'm almost tempted to ask for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I had placed an advanced order for the book. Frankly I am worst than extremely dissapointed at the style and content of the book. My expectation was for a serious work and what I got was a mixture of fiction,commentary and an author with an oversized ego. This is not even close to what I had expected.I guess that I will have to add the name of Mr. Edmund Morris to my list of authors to avoid.A truly incompetent piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally have to agree, a great disappointment.","review":"Unlike many people, I waited until I read the last word of thisbook to make my judgment.Mr. Morris is a beautiful writer--he verymuch has a gift with a pen. The material is very much there, but he essentially failed to present it as it needed to be. If only the rest of the book were as good as the prologue.Readers would be better advised to search on Amazon's out-of-print search for President Reagan's autobiography, \\"An American Life\\" or, better yet, Lou Cannon's books about Reagan. As for this one, wait until it hits the remainder bins.I hope Mr. Morris can redeem himself with the second volume of his life of Theodore Roosevelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"Although the invention of an alter-ego for the author is occasionally jarring this is over all a great read and I think as \\"fair\\" a biography of RR as would be possible. Those who complain most violently about that device should ask themselves how much it differs from many authors assumption of their subjects point of view in writing biography. This book like Morris' TR works is very well written and documented to an almost excruciating degree. This portrayal of Reagan is not as worshipful as some other choices -- frankly I think that is in its favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"After reading the biography on Theodore Rossevelt, I was excited about getting this book. However, the book left me with an ill feeling. How can Morris put a fictional character in the book to tell a life story? It makes no sense for a respected author to do this. The fictional accounts take time away from what the author should have been talking about in the first place. I'm sure no sane author would have done anything close to this travesty..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reagan deserved better than this","review":"After hearing Edmund Morris elegance on TV as he promoted his book, I could not wait to read it. I expected great biography, what I got was a hodgepodge of fiction, biography, and Morris endless drivel about his childhood. I never knew where history stopped and fiction began.I would tell myself over and over again: Surely, this book is going to get better. It was a vain wish. After reading only 200 of the nearly 700 pages, I put it down, never to pick it up again. Ronald Reagan deserved better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Rest of Him?","review":"Edmund Morris's biography about the president who least resembled an IBM Selectric II typewriter (he lacked both a memory and a colon) is a bit of fantasy all by itself.Reagan, who greatly damaged our country with his absurd deficits, his Hollywood-war \\"Star Wars,\\" and his numerous scandals (who can forget everything from James Watt's rape of the environment to HUD?) now gets the cheesecloth treatment in this \\"elegie.\\"Morris could do a \\"Madlibs\\" with this book, and create a glowing bio of North Korean Dictator Kim Il Sung. It might even make a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"innacurate and hard to read","review":"I dont care that the authors technique was unusual, but I do care that the book is a torture to read. The story jumps around from situation to situation, and from person to person so much that it sometimes doesnt make sense. Also, the style is so overly flowery, almost like a poorly written poem, that it becomes quite tedious.The author is more concerned with his own viewpoints and feelings that he forgets that the book is supposed to be about someone else.All in all a very disappointing tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Serving at best","review":"Mr. Morris robed $3 million and also the American people who deserved much, much more of President Regan's life and times. Presidential memoirs are to be held in a certain reverence as a bookmark to history. Mr Morris has shattered that belief and leaves the reader trying to swim through what is fact, history and fiction. Inserting himself into one of the most anticipated biographies this century will forever brand him as a selfserving, self-important hack. He himself justifies this title by having to defend his methods on the talk show circuit and in the begining of the book. It's pure trash and a dis-service to the reader and to the Regan family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical revisionism","review":"I can not comprehend why the author decided to introduce fictional characters into his biography. This technique is inapproperiate and deplorable. You would be much better off skipping this book entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN UNPRECEDENTED LITERARY DISASTER!!","review":"I'm fascinated by Reagan and I came to this book with enthusiasm. But after weeks of trying to read it, I sadly admit defeat. Dutch is the most poorly written biography I have ever encountered. Its smug, superior tone combined with the arrogance of its effete author is supremely offensive - and it's showy and artsy mixing of fact and fiction is confusing in the extreme. The effect is a bravura performance of a glib, overly-intellectual author high on an unparalleled ego trip. Mr. Morris is narcissistically in love with his superior (in his own eyes) intellect, and is a crashing bore in this book. Words really can't describe how infuriating it is to read a biography like this and have to suffer through the blathering fiction of this arrogant author. I hope the pblisher lost a fortune of this mess - it would serve them right. And I trust the decision of the Reagans in choosing Morris as their official biographer will go down as the greatest mistake of their lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Reagan?","review":"I have been laboring through this book and I don't know if I can finish it. I didn't want an autobiography of Edmund Morris, but that's what I got. And in it, I learned about this hoity toity fuddy-duddy old fart who hates the fact that he never got to know Ronald Reagan. Perhaps Reagan sensed that this weirdo couldn't be trusted. I understand that the review must stick to the contents of the book, and since Edmund Morris decided to write his own memoir and trick people into reading it by disguising it as a Reagan memoir, I feel perfectly justified in criticizing this writer. I'm dismayed that this man spent so much time with Reagan and failed to see what made him great. Morris couldn't even refrain from condescension and jealosy in relaying the most innocuous information. If you were looking for a Reagan Memoir, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace, and a waste: A terrible book, great president","review":"This book is unbelievably bad. The truly sad thing, however, is that Morris had a unique access to Reagan just before he became seriously ill. That is a missed opportunity that will never be repeated. What is stunning is the insistence of the writer that he is more imortant than the subject, and his weird mix of fiction, biography and anecdote. It flops completely - I have perhaps never felt this way about a book before. There are a few reviews here that talk about the book being honest - in fact, it is profoundly dishonest in its mix of truth and lies.Ronald Reagan was a larger-than-life president who transformed the world. His economic and plitical and dilpomatic legacy lives on. His integrity and vision honesty and honor inspired millions. This book might have captured some of that - or at least tried. Instead, the author creates a book that is not even non-fiction. A disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"work\\" a real piece of work. . .","review":"When everybody knows (and Morris has stated on C-Span and in other interviews) that Morris has \\"filled in\\" first person reportage created from whole cloth about a profoundly ill subject who could not recall ANY aspect of the \\"first person\\" that Morris so blithely slathers across the page. . .Morris has no excuses. He has no subject. He has no facts. He has no interviews with the subject. He has no shame. He HAS money from the thinnest excuse for biography since the average 3rd grade book report.Well, fiction is too kind a term."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of garbage","review":"Having read and admired the Morris book on TR I was looking forward to his book on Reagan. I was very disappointed. When I start a book I finish it with very very few exceptions. After torturing myself with the first 200 pages of this book I tossed it aside-just couldn't see wasting any more time on it. Morris had Reagan's life in front of him-I don't see why he had to put himself in the book as a fictional character. If you are going to read this book- don't buy it-rent it from a library. That way you won't feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petty Hackjob","review":"I can't figure out if Mr. Morris is clueless or simply envious of Ronald Reagan. From the beginning, the author never really gives the president his due, but instead credits Reagan with only incredible luck. It isn't until P.335 that he finally reveals the source of his animosity, ( his son belonged to the radical 60's weatherman faction of the S.D.S. and went \\"underground\\".) This the author blames on the policies of then Governor Reagan. It's quite obvious that Mr. Morris feels himself intellectually superior not only to Reagan, but to most Americans as well. He and his elitist friends are completely perplexed by the popularity Reagan enjoyed. Some decent tibits here & there, but if you're looking for the true picture of Ronald Reagan, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dutch: A Disappointment","review":"Edmund Morris is a first class writes and historian. Given the access he had to primary materials this book is a disappointment. Personally I think it was Ghostwritten by someone much less talented - maybe one of Reagan's speech writers. Whoever wrote it, Morris needs to hire someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"VERY difficult to read this book. Author spent more time showing off his vocabulary than telling a story. Could not get past the first 4 chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre!","review":"Bizarre is the best word I can think of to describe my opinion of this book. And the only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that I believe Morris did try here. Most opinions that he failed, however, to understand Reagan are visibly correct. I say bizarre not only because of the fictional twist but because of the strange flow of this biography. The best example I have is found in chapter two when he switches from fiction to Reagan's visit to his birthplace (with Morris) and then goes into facts such as time, date, situation etc. and points out for \\"the second of his wives (Nancy)\\" the zodiac stats. I tried to get into this book but feel that the effort to sort it out won't produce any further understanding of one of our most significant presidents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as hell!","review":"Edmund Morris, author is undoubtedly a windbag if this book is any indication. Actually he does say a few nice things about President Reagan when he is not saying something about himself. I find nothing redeeming about this fat book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!","review":"Deserves less than one star but one star is the lowest rating I can give. Return this book if you have purchased it.This book is more about Morris than Reagan. Morris, for all he obvious intellect, cannot figure out how Ronald Reagan could accomplish so much without being an intellectual.I gave the reviews and write-ups the benefit of the doubt however after force reading 65 pages of Morris' drivel, I am returning the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morris is a self absorbed cynic","review":"Edmund Morris confuses cynicism with sophistication. He constantly offers the reader snide commentary on RR that has no value whatsoever beyond gossip.The author is too self absorbed to be a biographer.The margins of my copy of Dutch are full of notes I wrote expressing my frustration at this idiot of an author.I will never read anything he has written again and I recommend to others that they save their time by doing the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morris Misses the Mark","review":"After reading the book it is obvious that Morris tries to advance the mantra that the liberals pushed on everyone during Reagans Presidency. Mainly that Reagan was a doddering old fool, with no substance, absent minded and full of bromides and platitudes. Page after page reeks of Morris' disdain and elitist attitude toward Reagan. What Morris gives us is a corny old actor who approaches his Presidency much like one of Reagans B movies, with lots of glitter and no substance. The contradiction, in my mind, is how did this affable dunce, (according to Morris), stand up to, and defeat Communism, reduce taxes, build up our military, beat back the malaise of the Carter years, among many other accomplishments? If you want to read a much better accounting of Reagan and his Presidency, read D'Souza's book. With all the access Morris had to this great man, his book woefully misses the mark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In My Trashcan","review":"This book is awful. What a disappointment after such great success with Theodore Roosevelt. I forced myself through half this book straining to distinguish reality from the fiction and fantasy that Morris interjects willy-nilly throughout. What a chore, what a bore, what a waste. This went in the trash can rather then the bookshelf to insure no one else might pick it up and waste as much time as I did on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Morris, you owe us an apology!","review":"How can someone spend so many years with so much information and have so little to show for it now? I did not vote for Reagan, I didn't want this book to make him into some sort of mythical God of perfection and I didn't want to spend 800 pages trying to tear down a President. I did however, expect to learn a little! There was nothing in this book that I had not already learned about this man and his Presidency! Many times I had to put the book aside out of frustration. Morris included more information on his TR book than on Iran-Contra! Was he even interested in Reagan? As an American I feel cheated out of the book that should have been written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Masking Confusion","review":"To read this book is agony. The interjections of the \\"fictional author\\" generally annoy and never enlighten.How could a biographer spend so much time with his subject and his closest associates, with access to both his official papers and his most intimate diaries, and so fail to understand him?Perhaps Mr. Reagan is not the only one suffering mental deficits."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Not* a history of a president","review":"This is not, in itself, a bad book. The fictional narratortakes himself far too seriously -- and putting his made up 'diary' inthe footnotes is ludicrous. But my main complaint is that it covers much less of Ronald Reagan's political life than we have a right to expect. There's almost nothing on the 1980 or 1984 campaigns, and pretty close to that on 8 years worth of domestic policy making. There are very interesting pieces on RR's relations with the USSR, and Morris writes well, even brilliantly at times, when he's not writing about himself. Somewhere in here is 40 pages of a fantastic \\"summing up Reagan\\" article trying to get out. But for anyone doing research on Reagan the president, this is not the place to go -- and it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called Edmund Morris, I love to write about myself","review":"As a person who voted in my first election in 1980 for RonaldReagan, and as a person who had many a disagreement with his policiesduring the eight years he served, I anticipated reading a well written, in depth look at the man and his times. Unfortunately, Mr. Morris' book is not any of those things. Aside from the almost unreadable prose, the poorly orgainized material, and the lack of any sort of thoughtful analysis of what drove Reagan to be Reagan, the book is simply first and formost about Edmund Morris. Do you remember the SNL character Al Frankin? His famous line was \\"What does this mean for me, Al Frankin?\\" Well, Edmund Morris is the Al Frankin of Reagan biographers. Do Not Buy This Book. I am going to do my best to get my money back. I can only say as a student of history with a degree in the field, this book is plain awful. Shame on you Edmund Morris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great book...","review":"...and the problem isn't the \\"fictionalized\\" character. The problem is that it doesn't paint Reagan in the proper light. As one of the most frightening, dim-witted, puppet presidents in United States history. With more staff and cabinet indictments than even the Clinton administration--it's important to remember that the damage Reagan did to the country won't go away by dry cleaning it. Check out the books \\"Firewall\\" by Lawrence Walsh and \\"The Last Mogul\\" by Dennis McDougal if you want to read the REAL story of the most decietful, bumbling president in our generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Bio","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected to read a candid bio of Ronald Reagan the man, including the good and the bad. Instead, I read a book that contained fictional characters inserted throughout, leaving the impression the author was attempting to mount a disingenuous one-sided piece about his personal opinions of the man. If this was a fiction piece, such as the \\"North and South\\" series or the childhood \\"We Were There\\" series, then there might be some accolades to share. But to be published and promoted as a bio, this book is sorely lacking. It is my opinion the author wasted an incredible opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an incredibly awful book from a great writer","review":"I'm not sure what happened here but Morris ruined his reputation as a great historian by writing one of the most bizzare books ever written.

We have here a fairly average study of Reagan as a person and far too much on the biographer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible read!","review":"How an author can manage to write such a terrible biography on such a fascinating subject is beyond me! His use of fictional characters (including himself!) makes you wonder at times who this biography is really about. I do not care to hear about Edmund Morris's father. As a great Reagan fan, I wanted to learn about what was going on inside the White House while he was President. While we do receive a few interesting anecdotes, the book is peppered with totally useless verbatim that keeps our attention away from what is truly important. It was such a terrible read, I could not even finish it! I will have to read Mr. Reagan's autobiography in order to satisfy my hunger for insights on his presidency because this book did not serve its purpose at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"What to say about \\"Dutch.\\"Unlike many people, I was initially intrigued with the rather unique narrative style. It's a memoir of one man's search for Reagan, essentially.But after a mere fifty pages, it got old. The language is flowering, and Edmund Morris' other books are amazing. This one, however, seems lost in its self-involvement. It goes nowhere and takes it's time doing so. Repetitive descriptions of small Illinois towns and quaint lifestyles becomes played out quickly. Perhaps the book gets considerably better, but from my understanding there is little in the way of politics in it, which makes me feel that if I didn't like the book after the first 50 pages of the early days of the author and Reagan in Illinois, it's not going to get any better.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Concept, Bad Novel","review":"Edmund Morris tossed away his reputation as a biographer on the par with the biggest names in the business, indulged himself in an unrealized ambition and made his book on President Reagan into a work of fiction. What was he thinking? And what were his editors thinking? It was hard to get past the slightly goofy/creepy concept of a non-fiction novel where the author intrudes so often into the story, but the secondary and damning fact here is that this is also not a good book at all. Morris says inexplicable things about his subject like when he mentions the clarity of our fortieth President's saliva. What was THAT about? Morris might recover from this, who knows, but my advice to anyone, Reagan fan, history student, lover of fiction, is don't pick up this book because it's not even slightly worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully crafted; a wonderful read!","review":"I enjoyed it and think it will become the definitive biography about President Reagan.

After reading it (which was NOT an easy thing to do), I felt that I HAD learned a lot about where President Reagan came from and what motivated him, but I also felt that entirely too much time was devoted to the author himself and his little escapades.Given the rare opportunity that the author had, I was hoping for a book that would look more towards how he will be remembered and less of what one person thought about how things seemed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an exercise in flowery and fictional imagery","review":"The audio version should not be played while operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery.

The prologue reveals all when Morris refers to Reagan as an Iguana and ascribes Reagan motivations to 1950s movie.

I think Ronald Reagan was the best president this county has hadthis century and I anxiously awaited this biography from his \\"authorized\\" biographer. But this book is a bad joke. The injecting of fictional episodes into the biography of a real person is unforgivable for a serious biographer. Morris doesn't even do us the curtesy of italicizing what's fictional, so we can skip over it and get to the real stuff. It's hard to say whether the fictional episodes are worse than the constant yammering Morris does about himself. Open the book to any random page and, instead of the life of Ronald Reagan, you get the author talking about himself. To be fair, Ronald Reagan is mentioned every so often. I wanted a biography of Ronald Reagan, not a book about how Morris feels about being the biographer of Ronald Reagan. Just tell us about the life of Ronald Reagan."},{"rating":"2","title":"After looking beyond the author's personal insertions...","review":"It was still a valid opinion piece.

Edmund Morris, author of celebrated works about Theodore Roosevelt, was given extensive access to Ronald Reagan and the workings of his administration. Even Reagan's admirers admit the man had a downright spooky lack of affect in his dealings with others, and the strain of dealing with this sphynx apparently unmanned Morris, who elected to blend biography and fiction by writing himself into Reagan's life, showing himself present at all kinds of crucial events -- even being rescued from drowning by Reagan as a young lifeguard. A bizarre performance that has left me unwilling to read anything else by Edmund Morris, even though his Roosevelt books would normally be right up my alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan","review":"This book fulfilled two old adages.

It was the weirdest biography I have ever read. Much of the book was written in the first person by and about the author. It was often not very fair or favorable to Dutch and seemed to take cheap shots at him.After reading the other reviews I do not know what to believe is true or not true in this book.It is different read and I will probably read another Reagan biography or his autobiography to get other views of him as he is one of our greatest, most important presidents.

My wife asked why I kept reading it and I replied that I like to finish what I start.Morris keeps reminding us that he grew up near Reagan and went to college with him for a semester. Wow!I wondered the entire book, like the young lady on the plane to Geneva asked him, \\"Do you like the President?\\" I don't think he did.

Reagan is brought to life with a warmth that few of his critics would acknowledge. This is not a hatchet job on Ronald Reagan - despite the displeasure voiced by conservatives (you don't hear any liberals pointing to this book as \\"evidence\\" of Reagan's incompetence). There is much content lacking from this book. The material from 1975 to 1980 is extremely thin and this omission is a disappointment. The '76 and '80 campaigns were rich with the ebb and flow of the political dynamic, and that story alone could have easily covered an additional 100 or more pages of this book.

Maybe Mr. morris would have been better served to write two books; one an autobiography( which he comes close to in this book, and a book about DUTCH"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE OLD LIBERALS NEVER GIVE UP","review":"When a ultra liberal sets out to trash a decent man, he uses all the techniques his \\"intellectual\\" arsenal provides him. The goal that Morris sets for himself is constantly getting in the way of the \\"real\\" Ronald Reagan which Morris never finds. More of a book and scary at that about the liberal hate of conservatism than a biography of Reagan. I really didn't buy the book to read about Morris's life or that of his spoiled son. Fortunatley, I bought it cheap on e-bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I don't think I have ever read such an horrible book in my all life. The author was supposed to write President Reagan's biography but sometimes it seems that he spends more time doing a fake biography of himself. If you are a fan of Reagan as I am, you'll get the desire to toss the book away. I think that Reagan was one of the greatest presidents of the United States and he deserved a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of... Who, Exactly?","review":"Edmund Morris does a fine job of recounting his own past, as well as his visions of Reagan - however, Reagan is viewed not as a man, but as the central character to a pretentious, convoluted student film. Though his words are masterful and poetic, Morris' text reads like the biography of one Alzheimer's sufferer as recounted by another. Muddled and prosaic, this is one biography best left to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dutch\\" - A big disappointment!","review":"Very disappointed in this book. What a sorry example of what should be an official biography of a president. One can't determine what is fact and what is fiction. After reading such books as Truman by McCullough it was really a letdown to dig into this book. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for any serious reader of presidential biographies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!!","review":"To my disappointment, Mr. Morris has put together a disjointed, and dare I say boring account of a President deserving far greater treatment. I was willing to accept the idea of creating a fictional character as a vehicle around which portions of President Reagan's life could be told. However, I was not willing to accept the fact that this character takes such a central and time consuming role in the telling of the tale.I found myself skimming numerous portions of the book trying to filter out unecessary information. Mr. Morris' fictional character was not nearly as important to the telling of the story as Mr. Morris, the author, seemed to believe.I can only hope that in my lifetime a more acceptable \\"authorized\\" biography of President Reagan will be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most infuriating book I ever read.","review":"Although I had advance warning of what I was getting into, I purchased the book in spite of the generally poor reviews. I was unable to get beyond the first 50 pages. Morris' ego is simply too much to handle. Good or bad, I wanted to read about the subject matter of the book, not the author. I fully agree with many of the reviewers -- what a waste!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb retelling of history - doesnt matter if its part-fiction.","review":"The reviewers who gave this a book a thumbs down are wrong. This is an excellent, highly readable and engrossing account of Ronald Reagan's life. I think everyone wants a true story written but the only story they will get is one that reflects the writer's perspective and biases. There is no true 'true story' of Ronald Reagan - the subject himself, as Norris admits, was inscrutable. If you're suffering from an emotional dilemma after reading the negatives posted here, my advice is: get over it, go buy this book, and then thank Edmund Norris for a story well told. Never mind that it is partly fiction; we all want stories told the way we like it and that's that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique, but bad style","review":"I could not get into this book because of the very unique style. This book is not written in a typical biography style. You'd rather like this book because of the writing syle, or you'd hate it. I am the latter. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a memoire, not a biography... just bad writing!","review":"It's a shame that Edmund Morris squandered such an unprecedented opportunity. DUTCH is a disservice to Regan and the country. In the end, it's just self indulgent junk writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed- More about Morris than Reagan","review":"Best advice I received on this book was read the prologue and then skip to chapter 28. The first 400 pages are spent by Morris writing about his own fantasy childhood. The chapters on Reagan's precidency are interesting but lack insight into his decision making process."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monumental waste...","review":"Although I applaud Mr. Norton's creativity and ingenuity in employing a remarkable new literary device, I found this book to be confusing and very tough to determine what is indeed fact. Those who buy this book are interested in Ronald Reagan, and I found the author's self examination and own family history to be inappropriate.Mr. Norris had unprecedented access to a President who Alzheimer's has now taken. There is only one way to characterize what he did with that time and information... a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly abysmal","review":"I took mr.Morris's advice and waited to read this book before commenting on it.I can safely say that it is appallingly bad!How dare Edmund Morris insert himself into Reagan's life story?The book should be titled\\"Edmund& Dutch\\",since it seems to be mostly about mr.Morris.How come Carl Sandburg never thought to include himself in Abe Lincoln's life story?He could have had a ball writing about double dating with Abe and Ann Rutledge in New Salem!And David Mcculloch should have written about his days as an apprentice in Harry Truman's haberdashery!Who cares if they weren't born yet!Details,details!That doesn't bother Edmund Morris any!Perhaps when Morris spent time with Reagan,he was horrified to discover that there was no \\"there\\" there,{as Gertrude Stein said once about Oakland)but then if that's the case,he should never have written the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great piece of fiction - when does the movie come out?","review":"A terribly disappointing book. Although Morris is talented, he falls far short of writing any sort of satisfying biography. The book was more reminiscent of a rather inane soap opera than an objective look at a former President. Also, the fictionalization was quite distracting, and the author's blatant inclusion of himself into the \\"story\\" line was just tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconcerting","review":"Ronald Reagan is NOT a hard man to understand. He's a simple man (of great integrity) from a simple place and a simple time who became a great leader of a great country. Why do we have to plow through over 800 pages and the lives of fictionalized characters to understand this? In a biography???? So much of Ronald Reagan's time as Governor of California and President of the United States has been ignored in this book. In 1985/86 when Edmund Morris became confused about his subject, he should have begged off the project immediately and given someone else the chance of a lifetime. It's just disappointing that Mr. Morris, who was given this opportunity, has squandered it. David McCullough, where are you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed. I expected much more.","review":"After reading Edmund Morris' book about Teddy Roosevelt, I looked foward to his book on Ronald Reagan. What a disappointment. It was a struggle to read the book. It was boring, self serving and in some cases down right inaccurate. Don't even bother buying the book. If you're interested in Ronald Reagan, you would be much better off reading the book by Dinesh D'Souza. I rated the book 1 star because that was the lowest option given."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Orson Welles Approach to Narrative","review":"In Barbara Leaming's biography of Orson Welles, he encouraged her, during an interview, to seek a different way to tell his story. In Welles' view, that was a way to uncover new truths. In the case of \\"Dutch\\", Morris has tried something pays off. The book is readable, it's different, and it reveals new information. It has also shown how envious, weak and traditional some TV pundits are. I have heard one woman say, while grimacing theatrically, that if she had had the access, the time and the subject, she would have turned in a great book. That is like hearing people testify that if they had been born under different circumstances, they would be rich and powerful. This is a decent book that's fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"When I purchased this book I could not wait to start reading it. Unfortunately after 50 pages I became disgusted because the author talked more of himself than of the President. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much left to desire in Dutch","review":"Having enjoyed immensely the Pulitzer price winning \\"The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt\\", I was anxious to read another biography by the same author. Big mistake. Dutch uses a completely different style of writing that I do not appreciate at all. The author invents a character whose biography follows loosely the geographic history of the real subject Ronald Reagan. He uses this trick to add more color where he admits he otherwise had little material. I found it quite distracting and did not make it far before I put the book aside. Others have found the book a good read, but my copy is now a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"More revealing of Morris' character than Reagan's","review":"Morris had the opportunity of a lifetime and blew it. Unparalleled access to a sitting president, and Morris can't understand what made Reagan larger than life? Morris seems utterly disappointed that Reagan is not Teddy Roosevelt, and proceeds to paint Reagan as a amiable dullard pretending to be president. Morris misses the mark, and his invective only throws his aim off even more. Edmund Morris comes off as an erudite Michael Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"It is a literary trajedy that Morris squandered the opportunity to do a thorough historical biography on this interesting President. The book is poorly organized, difficult to follow and demonstrates Morris' obvious contempt for Reagan, his family and his country. I have anxiously awaited this book. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unfounded rhetoric","review":"The messages listed in the pages of this book are unfounded rhetoric and nothing more. Morris is your typically pompous Brit who has successfully pulled together a book based upon peer speculation. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sin Of Hubris","review":"The chief job of the historian is to remain distant from his subject so that, at the very least, a semblance of objectivity can remain. True objectivity is of course a myth, but a good historian will at least make the effort to avoid emotional involvement with his subject.Morris doesn't even try to be objective, and in fact became so close to his subject that he inserts himself into the text as a major player. The historian is the observer, the recorder, and the chronologer, not the participant. Morris blew it. If you insist on buying this book, stick it on your self next to Dinesh D'Souza's tome and other bad hagiographies of Reagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting","review":"From what I have read, I find that Morris' unusual bioigraphical technique is distracting from the story itsef. Rather than concentrate on the life of Ronald Reagan, I am involved with his so-called 'friend'. Morris should NOT have disclosed that the narrator is fictional. Then, perhaps the reader would enjoy this biography for what it is. (Actually...boring)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Terrible writer who is more in love with his own pompous ass than in writing an informative and usefull book on the subject at hand.Can't believe something like this ever went to print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the BEEF?","review":"\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" was Edmund Morris' Citizen Kane. This book is a manipulative attempt to rewrite history. Ronald Wilson Reagan was a statesman. In writing this book, Morris pawned his soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PRESIDENT'S BIOGRAPHY IS MISSING!!!","review":"THE PRESIDENT'S BIOGRAPHY IS MISSING!!! It's hard to believe, but Edmund Morris--who did a sensational job of bringing Theodore Roosevelt to life in THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT--has done a lousy job of writing a biography of President Ronald Reagan in DUTCH, and instead ends up with a myography, a book that mysteriously includes Morris himself as a character. DUTCH isn't even a biography, it's more like a novel, and it's a bad novel, and a major disappointment to all the Reagan idol worshippers like me who expected so much after all the advance publicity about DUTCH, which should have been subtitled, THE PRESIDENT'S BIOGRAPHY IS MISSING!!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dutch:A Memior of Ronald Reagan","review":"Totally disappointing. Continually tried to grasp the author's intend. Convened entirely too much to author and many, many others not remotely related to memoirs of Ronald Reagan. Too many paraphases, acronyms, abbreviation and meaningless paradoxes. Failed to convey any sustantial contributions to Ronald Reagan. Would not recommend reading to anyone. I purchased copies for myself and a friend. Have decided not to give to friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"I looked forward to this book as I knew the author had extensive access to the President. I requested this book for Christmas! Unhappily when I started to read it I discovered the writter was much more interested in himself than his subject. If you are interested in the life of Mr Morris than I suggest you purchase this book. If you thought you might get some insight into Mr.Reagan you might be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to put this book down...","review":"So who is Ronald Reagan? a brilliant, humble, discreet diplomat, or an actor all the way? I Could'nt get an answer this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book with a black marker not a highlighter","review":"Edmund Morris seems to have forgotten that the main character in a biography is not the author. If you choose to read this book, and I recommend you don't, take a black marker and cross-out all the references to the fictional character who seems to be Morris himself. This will lessen the dribble for you to read and somewhat diminsh the pain of the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great cd to add to your collection.

Now I have heard Faster Pussycat's Babylon & thought no one could ever do that song over, no way! But let me tell you Backyard Babies rocks that song out! Ginger also does vocals on it from Wildhearts. Babylon is a great Faster Pussycat remake. It has Beastie Boys inspired lyrics but it is a Faster Pussycat song written by Taime Downe & Greg Steele of FP. Great remake!! Backstabber also a great song.

Under the very beautiful picture of the cover there wasn't much of the great singer she is. Her aged voice is in many tracks simply hidden by the typical hateful arrangements of the 70's.

Unexcused the absence of \\"Maria de La O\\" and \\"Luna de Espa?a\\" the best she recorded in the 70's. I do worship Sara Montiel and all her records but this one is not worth buying.

Chorzempa's tempos are sometimes half the tempo, making some of the themes difficult to follow or even recognize. The CD has excellent moments and the sound take is perfect. His choice of stops are sometimes puzzling, with almost machine-like results.

It was great to see the old shows again that you saw once as a kid, with plenty of laughs and enjoyable music-numbers. And you certainly see the old jokes with a new light as you understand them better when you're older rather when you where small. I would certainly call this a 'must have'-box."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Muppet Fans!","review":"The season one dvd set of the Muppet Show is a nostalgic dream come true for all Muppet fans, and a perfect way to introduce a new generation to the lovable antics of the Muppets from the very begining. The menu system on the set is easy to use, and the option to watch the episodes with bits of trivia and comentary that pop up on the screen adds even more replay value. The set is a must have for any family library, and it will be used over and over again. A true classic...and there are still four more seasons to look forward to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No booklet?","review":"This was a wonderful Christmas gift, I haven't seen these shows since I was little - my only complaint is that there was no booklet in the set at all.

Great for anyone in the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love the Muppet Show, and so it's great to have all of season 1 on a DVD finally. Some performers, as to be expected, are better than others (the best in the collection are Ethel Merman, Florence Henderson, Ruth Buzzi, and Vincent Price) but in general, the whole collection pleases. It's also interesting to see them work out the kinks as the show goes on. In the first few episodes, many of the sketches Henson did on Sam and Friends or the Ed Sullivan Show are repeated.The one slightly disappointing part of the set is that some sketches had to be left out because of copyright laws. The most noticeable is Vincent Price singing \\"You've Got a Friend\\". I understand why it wasn't in there, but I missed it.This would make a great gift, and is also a neccessary part of any Muppet fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CHOPPED UP MESS!!!!!!","review":"A-lot of the episodes are re-edited and some of the parts that made the episodes most memorable are gone or have different replacement scenes. I don't know why they bothered. I don't recommend this to any die hard fan they have ruined the magic. Jim Henson would not have approved of the way these were butchered. This is sad, I'm tired of buying the box sets of old TV shows and they're being butchered for politically correctness, or for copyright reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shows","review":"I remember the agony of having to wait a week ( one childs week equals about 16 adult weeks) for the next episode when I was younger, now I can watch 24 in a row and no comercials!!!

Both films are about young hustlers, a gigolo and a trophy mistress, who fall for each other in the course of helping each other ply their trades.You'd expect the French version to be more grim, realistic, and explicit than the American film, which you'd expect to be given a hollywood happy ending. You'd be exactly wrong. In reality, it's the French version that's less realistic and more hollywoodized, and the American version that's grim, overly explicit and depressing. But they're both interesting and fun in their own ways. Ashton Kutcher, who obviously has a thing for successful older women, was born to play this role, and he plays it to perfection. Well worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kutcher is Bad","review":"Ashton Kutcher should stick to playing idiots and doing moronic TV. He is not a good dramatic actor.this movie is ok to watch for the nudity and sex and that is about it. The characters are so unlikeablethat when you are suppose to actually feel for them it is impossible. Seems like Kutcher trying to breakout of his stupid doofus persona but he just can't escape that he is not a good actor.2 stars because it does have some hot naked women and some ok sex scenes almost ruined by the bigdoofus trying way to hard to be cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!","review":"I decided to save myself $200 by buying the Zen 2.0 rather than an iPod. What a mistake. I received it in mid-October. By mid-December the display screen no longer worked. Because I had memorized the menu system by that point I was still able to use the product. I went on vacation right after this happened and didn't have time to deal with getting this fixed under warranty. (So I'm not sure how helpful they are.) I continued to use the player until yesterday when it just completely died on me. That's why I decided to write this review. It's not worth the $200 I saved. It's too bulky. The software that it came with never worked properly either. It would never connect to the CDDB database to name the files so I had to do it manually until I finally got iTunes and started ripping CD's in that. What a pain...! Take a guess what I'll be buying next. I had read other reviews talking about the screen display not working but decided to take my chances. I gambled and lost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of fragile hard drive and short warranty","review":"On April 16, 2003 I wrote a 5 star review of the Zen, raving about the interface and sound.However, my unit just stopped working. I called Tech support who diagnosed it as a hard drive failure and said that since it was beyond the 3 month warranty period, I would have to return it and could expect to pay $100 for a replacement hard drive. That I'm giving it 2 stars now is a testimony to how much I liked it before its premature death.I've read the reviews of the new IPOD and it seems like they have improved the interface to allow making playlists on the fly now and, at least according to one Amazon reviewer, the hard drive is extremely durable (unlike myself, he mentioned that he'd dropped his unit numerous times and it keeps on playing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad software, awful tech support","review":"Bought this product all excited that it was cheaper than Ipod. 3 days after purchase, the unit would not power up or respond to reset buttons. I returned it to Creative ASAP. They did not test it for any problems for 4 weeks, until I threatened to demand a refund. It was returned to me the next day mysteriously and seemed to work fine. Except now there was a major software problem. The tech support does not answer emails - sometimes they even bounce back to sender. The phone techs were unhelpful, recommending that I reinstall Windows, which was not the answer I was looking for.In all, it is a very nice looking product, and the sound quality seems pretty good, but the software is a real disaster, and the tech support is worse. I've switched to IPod, and I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good","review":"I had heard some negative things about the zen jukebox before i bought it, but the price, the storage space, and slick look attracted me to buy it anyway. All of the downsides i had heard about have been put to rest. The explorer is as easy to use as any i have seen, and the lack of recording capabilities (unless you shell out another 70$ or so) couldnt matter less to me.

Well done, Creative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem software","review":"The player itself is not so bad. The unit feels reasonably durable, although the the buttons are on the side of the unit. It would make more sense if the buttons were on the front where you could see them. Of course the price is the player's main plus. The problem is that the software that comes with the unit is terrible (several other reviewers have pointed this out). When you install the software on Windows XP, XP will warn you to NOT continue the installation. The instructions that come with the player say to ignore this warning. I wonder why. Could it be that it's because the software is terrible and will destabilize your PC? That's what happened to me. I had to reinstall XP.Advice: flash memory makers are going to be releasing flash memory cards (CompactFlash, etc.) up to 4GB soon. Hold off on buying an MP3 player until then. You'll get a smaller, high-capacity MP3 player without the breakable hard disk. Look for one that comes with some decent software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I own one of these. At first it was pure love... easy transfers, auto sync btween the player and the computer. Then I loaded it on a new computer and all hell broke loose. Now everytime I load the software or try to transfer songs they are tagged with the wrong artist and who isn't even on the artist list even the preloaded songs from the player. Tech support thus far has been no help I have loaded and cleared this program more times than I can count. Now I use it with Windows Media but it cannot keep the songs in order and will not load the songs from the player to the computer like the creative software does. When it worked I loved this program and device. When it doesn't... beware. The whole thing has me thinking about dumping it and getting an iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with an IPod","review":"I bought the Nomad, thinking that I would save money and get similar quality to the Apple IPod. I couldn't have been more wrong.First off, the Creative transfer software is extremely lousy and I had to pay [money] to get a third-party solution that is only marginally better. Second, this thing is huge compared to an IPod. Third, it crashes! What good is an MP3 player that locks up on you?!? I've written to Creative many times, and all they've ever given me in return is a shrug and an \\"oh, well, better luck next time.\\" ... Pay the extra [money] for an IPod and save yourself a giant headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad software, doesn't work with USB 1.1","review":"I bought a Nomad Zen for use with my Windows 98 powered PC, which is about two years old. It's too old to use with this product, unfortunately. The PlayCenter software continually crashes, I've installed and uninstalled and been with technical support for Creative on several occasions, and after a week, I've given up.I'm sure this is a marvelous piece of equipment if you have a PC that has USB 2.0 or Firewire, but even though it says it is USB 1.1 compatible, it's not.Besides the system crashes, my Zen also experienced very odd skips in songs, plus songs would start and others would take over, and the shuffle play feature played the same 10 songs over and over, despite the fact that I had over 200 loaded on.Besides that, the PlayCenter software that comes with the Zen is barely adequate, and Creative's tech support, while trying to be helpful, ultimately isn't.I recommend checking out the Ipod instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought the Zen last week, quickly charged it, and have been enjoying it ever since. It was very easy to set up and has been very easy to transfer file to it. The software seems alright and the performance has been great. I have about 5GB already on it, and expect to put much more on it. The battery seems to last as promised. The only critique is being unable to find the FM Wired Remote for it. Everyone seems to be out of stock. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"B","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a great player for the money. I did a lot of ressearch and went back and forth between the Zen and the iPod. Now that I have it, I feel I made the right choice. Good volume levels, easy to read display, and huge memory are my favorite things about it. The software it comes with is ok, but I would urge people to download Media Jukebox to tag all of your tracks as opposed to Creative's software. The transfer rate of songs is awesome! The headphones sound great but are designed for people with small heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked OK for 4 months, then it died.....","review":"I purchased the Zen Jukebox in October 2003 because it seemed like a good deal compared to some of the other MP3 players out there. The software was a bit of a problem to use, and the controls on the unit felt cheap. I took great care of the unit - I kept it in a case, and it never took a fall. A few days ago (February 2004), I found that the jack where the headphone plugs in was loose, and I couldn't get any sound from the unit. I checked my warranty, and found it was only 3 months (shame on me for not checking the warranty before I purchased the unit). I will never purchase an item from these guys again. A 3 month warranty??? I guess they don't think much of there product either. Don't waste your money on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good, very fragile","review":"Purchased one of these after deciding the iPod was too expensive and the hard drive failed within a month. I don't think it was my fault, but I did drop it once, in its case, on a thick carpet from about two and a half feet up. I had to pay outbound shipping and after a month they sent me back a used, refurbished unit with scratches on it (mine was in perfect condition). I would recommend spending the extra money on an iPod. At least you get a one year warranty, as opposed to 90 days for the Jukebox Zen (they must know how fragile it is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealiable","review":"I bought this in the summer of 2003 and was very disappointed from the get go. i was on a long flight enjoying the player when all of a sudden it freezes. i have practically full battery and it freezes! the only way to unfreeze it is to reset it. however, the reset button hole is SO tiny, i had to use a hairpin, or a pushpin to actually reset it. this freezing happened all the time. i bought this originally because the ipod was about $200 more expensive at the time, now i wish i got the ipod. oh well now i have a flash mp3 player that i couldnt be happier with (iAudio 4 256 MB). if you arent away from your computer too long at a time, i suggest you invest your money in a flash player like the iAudio.

When I connected it Too my computer, and started running the PlayCenter software to transfer my MP3 collection to the Zen, It worked fine at first, but the Zen started to get very hot, and then when I tried to Syncronize my MP3s with the software It just Quit. Now it will not turn on or do anything. Maybe it was just a flaw in the one I got or something, but I am very angry that I only got one day to use something that I paid $230 for.

The size is good, but the iPod is significantly smaller. I carry it in my briefcase to work, so size wasn't a big deal for me. Sound quality (better than iPod) and battery life (~9 hours) are both excellent. The build quality is excellent. The menus and LCD are pretty poorly designed, but that isn't a huge bother to me. I generally just create monster playlists and let it go. The software that comes with it is TERRIBLE. Add the cost of the excellent Notmad Explorer ...) when purchasing this product.To sum it up, the iPod is definitely better/cooler, but it wasn't [that much]better. My entire music collection fits on this player, it sounds great, and it has worked flawlessly (about 6 months)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, worth the money","review":"I bought the Zen a few days ago. The player is simply amazing. Seaching for songs/albums is so quick. A few reviews said the scroll is hard to use, but it is actually very easy. The sound is very good, as well. However, when I ripped my CDs to PlayCenter, a few skips managed to make their way into all of my tracks. I am trying to find another program to rip CDs. The Zen is a great purchase, but I recommend finding different software if PlayCenter creates skips in your songs.

I was honestly surprised with the technician help and attitude. At the end, it was clear that the culprit was my letterhead paper which will have to be replaced.I'm happy with the product now, and sure that HP is there to back up it's product with even better service."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is the point?!","review":"This jerk sold me the printer with no power cord or printer cord and although its easy to find the printer cord, the power cord is IMPOSSIBLE to find.

It was sold to me for $100, with a $100 rebate, along with an Apple I bought two months ago, but it turned out not to be worth the effort of mailing in Apple's rebate form (which of course requires half a dozen little pieces of cardboard to be cut out of boxes, a notarized letter from your doctor, five forms of picture ID, etc).This printer worked nicely at first, but two months later it no longer registers as connected by USB. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps in the manual, but nothing helps. I finally gave up on it and tried to uninstall the software, and the uninstaller doesn't even work -- it just locks up and has to be force-quitted.Contrast that with the first HP printer I bought: a LaserJet 6P. After ten years, it has not failed to work once. Clearly, things are not what they once were at HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap...","review":"After only a week of operation, ours stopped feeding paper properly and would only do so with major coaxing and prayer.

Then there was a whole month where the printer stopped working entirely, because it automatically downloaded an update online and did not install it completely. After deleting the printer and reinstalling it, it STILL didn't work, and only after a month did it finally start working again. Right now it stopped working on me again; this time it's not recognizing print jobs, and the start button is blinking stupidly. I am sick of this unreliable piece of garbage.

I fanned out the papers, manually fed them in one by one, reset the printer numerous times, changed the amount of paper in the feeder, and NOTHING works!!! This is awful. I was screaming in frustration (literally). Soooooo tempted to throw the damn printer out the window, but didn't want the city to sue me for defacing the sidewalk.

Ink isn't so expensive if you buy the refurbish types or refill yourself and i have never had any problems with that. hP printers are great and i just bought another one that i loved right away.

The most serious flaw that I have found is the lack of ink in the cartridges. There is only 5 ml of ink in each cartridge. That is only 1 teaspoon of ink. This means that you will be replacing the cartridges often. And at about $35 for both cartridges, you will quickly spend more on ink than you spent on the printer.By comparison, the cartridges in the HP 1350 hold about 19 ml of ink. Nearly 4 times the amount of ink and the pair of cartridges cost about $40.

I can hear the mechanism, but it's just not picking up paper. I've tried a single sheet, 10 sheets, half capacity, and full capacity but nothing. Now I read other reviews of similar problems with the feeder either failing on first use, or failing over time. I'm never disappointed with HP with such a defective product.

Also, the printer itself always misfeeds or jams or feeds all the paper through, and you must constantly stand next to it and make sure the paper feeds correctly.

While I have always admired Jordan's game, I never knew what sort of person he was until reading Playing for Keeps.Halberstam's book is quite flattering, and he often describes Jordan as a great person. At the same time, Halberstam includes many unflattering details about Jordan's personality. This technique allows the reader to decide for himself or herself what sort of person Jordan is.After reading the Playing for Keeps, I appreciate Jordan's game more than before (he beat Utah, my favorite team, almost singlehandedly), but have a more reserved opinion of Jordan as a person. At any rate, the book is incredibly interesting and a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at Sports and the greatest athlete ever","review":"David Halberstam, a great writer, has brought to life the story of the greatest athlete of all time, Michael Jordan. From Michael's youth, when he used to compete against his brother Larry, to being cut from his high school team, through the regimentation of Dean Smith and the University of North Carolina, Mr. Halberstam goes deep into the life of Michael Jordan and helps explain how this amazing individual brought professional basketball to what it is today. A fascinating account of all aspects of sport, it is timely reading now that the lockout has ended and the NBA tries to figure out which of its wunderkinds will be the next Air Jordan. I recommend any parent with a child, boy or girl, should read this book and underline the highlites to impress upon their children of the necessity of hard work, perserverance and just being a nice guy.

This book really points out of how to win things or lose things. The author did a great job by giving examples, which I really enjoyed reading it. The book doesn't tell much about Michael's life, but it really tells how his games were like. I think this book deserves four starts on it. When I first read this book, it was very boring for me, as I read more and more, it turned out to be an excellent book.

Unfortunately, unlike in its predecessor, Mid-Flinx, we have neither in Flinx's Folly. What we do have, however, are similar plotlines:1. A bad guy keeps trying to get rid of Flinx for a very shallow reason. In Mid-Flinx the villain wanted Flinx's minidrag, Pip, in Flinx's Folly the motive is jealousy.2. A group of bad guys keep trying to get rid of Flinx for political reasons.Both storylines and their outcomes are predictable and therefore boring.

Perhaps it's just the complexity of the subject that left me a little confused about some of the principles (or my own shortcomings :)). But it seemed like some things could have been clearer.

The lemon tart in particular is a gem. If you're not afraid of recipes that sometimes call for a lot of steps, and you want to dazzle your friends or family with something extra-special, by all means get this book. The recipes are both fantastic and fool-proof -- and when was the last time you could say that about a dessert book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig In Gets It Done","review":"Dig In!: Earthdog Training Made Easy is a great resource for anyone wanting to know more about Earthdog trials and training.The author has many practical inexpensive ideas to start training at home with any age dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"The poles for this tent broke within one week of setting up inside with nothing more than normal use. We tried duct taping them which worked temporarily but the poles continued to break. We are now left with a tent without poles and no way to get replacement pieces. I would not ever buy from this manufacturer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I purchased this unit after the initial testing of several other tools.Like the Bell Quick-Tool, this one is a winner, albeit not quite at the same level of the Quick-Tool. This unit has more closed end wrenches, but that's about the only real difference. It's a bit larger and more unwieldly than the QT. I've used it on the bench for a couple of weeks to good effect. As mentioned in my other reviews, a multi-tool is not a substitute for \\"dedicated\\" tools, but these are functional and will get the job done in the field (and at the bench.)While I prefer the Quick-Tool (Bell) over this Ultra-Tool, I wouldn't (don't) hesitate to grab either one for bench or field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for casual riding","review":"This kit is OK for casual riders. I put on around 100 miles a week bycycle commuting (not counding recreational riding), and for me the tire irons and tools didn't stand up. Having a tool break when you need to change a tire in the middle of your commute to work causes harsh words to be said.Spend a few $ and ounces more to get quality tire irons, patch kit and good quality multi-tool and you'll be miles ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"not complete... even for bell products.","review":"This BELL BRAND tool has all I need to adjust my bike on the road except for one thing.... it does not have the correct size wrench to adjust a BELL BRAND bike seat. It has a 13mm and a 15mm but not the 14mm that is on the seat. You would think they would at least have their own products covered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat handy in the pocket or the bike bag, but the multitool is poorly built","review":"This is a handy set, and it's nice to have all the tools I use most often on my bike in one place. The tire patch kit is decent, and I've definitely had use for it. Unfortunately, some of the most important tools just aren't very useful.The phillips screw head is pretty solid, but the flathead screwdriver narrows too much to be of much use for most screws. Additionally, the wrenches are supposed to lock in place but if you put any pressure on them they escape the lock and fold. That means if you have a tight nut, you really can't get it loose. I end up pulling out my ratchet kit every time for serious jobs. Still, this is handy to have on the road, and every once in a while comes in real handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome to use and mediocre tool quality","review":"While having multiple tools in a compact case is a great concept; it is limited to whether it can be used effectively. When I needed to adjust my derailleur it was difficult to maneuver the tool so the allen screw could be loosened and retightened while pulling the cable that was being adjusted. The metal appears to be poor quality and the plastic tire tools are a breakage risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!","review":"This same thing is $15 at walmart.

The case provides a compact secure storage case to protect your investment. Shop around, prices vary considerably (Amazon was the lowest price I found). I am very satisfied with this well made tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this about American or French vegetable gardens?","review":"I was hoping this book would celebrate beautiful homegrown American vegetable gardens...like the kind you find by chance in a neighbor's backyard. Instead this book focused on the gardens of the rich and famous, which were mainly designed by landscape professionals, and highly influenced by the French. The pictures in this book failed to show me one vegetable garden that was truly breathtaking. Worst of all, most of the gardeners had professional assistants to maintain their gardens. This book is a waste of time and money- I absolutely hated it. Please don't waste your time or money on this book. Instead buy the House Beautiful Garden design book (on sale)...granted these gardens were also professionally designed by wealthy homeowners- they are beautiful to look at, and you can find some inspiration for your own home- plus it's much less patronizing than the Vegetable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice kettle, but it stinks.","review":"After I used it a few times the kettle started to give off a toxic chemical smell.

It does not hold enough water to fill an 8 cup french press.But the worst problem is that it spills water everywhere! No matter how many ways I tried to pour from it (fast, slow, high, low and from every conceivable angle) it would spill at least 50 percent of the water.If the water in the kettle boils for even a few minutes, the plastic handle gets very hot and you need a pot holder to hold it.I am shocked that this is Faberware -- it is literally the worst kettle I have ever used.I recommend spending the extra money on the Bodum Ottoni."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"I am happy that the items were in stock and the price was great!

I'm afraid this book was a disappointment as it showed arty photos of shabby old houses with shabby old furniture.

The reasons are obvious - mostly because they don't use batteries, but also because at 6v, they put out more light than most battery lights.Unfortunately, this Bell unit is simply made too cheaply. Probably for 50 cents more, they could have made a much better product, but it is what it is. The wires are ridiculously thin and fragile. The unit itself is puny by any standards. I think some of the folks who praised this unit are impressed with the light when they first used it, but usually within one or two weeks, something shakes loose, and the unit no longer works.Nice try with a low-cost generator light, but unfortunately, this one is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could rate this -5 stars i would","review":"This thing is crap not powerful and hard to set up.

Its perfect. While battery lightshave come a long way for bicycles, a good generator light is invaluablebecause it never runs out. As long as your moving, you can see theroad, and if you bike at night, or end up on a long ride that leavesyou in the dark, you might just want that. The downside of any generatorlight is that once you stop pedaling it stops shining, thats why youhave your back up battery light. The Bell is solidly constructed, thelight itself has a crosshatch of plastic that gives saftey from breakagefrom flying stones, and the instructions and installation are a snapfor anyone. Be safe, wear a helmet, make sure you've got lots ofreflectors, wear bright clothes...and get this light."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like","review":"It's nice soap, what else can I saybut if you insist I can make it upo, please I don't have seventeen words to compliment this item"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves residue behind","review":"Smells wonderful, however it leaves residue that takes away from this product.

My one complaint is that the map did not actually cover all of Barcelona.

The fat-free, salt-free prose relentlessly rambles on with no distinction between events of monumental importance (Bear Flag Revolt, e.g. - one page) and tedious details of Carson's children. No explanatory detail is given about saddlery,horses,firearms,clothing,etc., nor is sufficient description given to the geography of the country in which he spent so much time. Most of all, the book suffers from a lack of detailed maps. On the bright side, the book seems well researched and documented and the sources are clearly indicated. Best of all, in this era of historical demonization, there is a genuine affection and sympathy for Kit Carson, quite convincing me that he was not only a fascinating pioneer but an exemplary character."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bible book to learn Gibbs sampler and simulated annealing","review":"This is absolute a bible book for any person who want to learn Gibbs sampler and simulated annealing seriously. The format of this book, though full of mathematical equations, is very self-evident and concise. Nothing is missing and nothing is redundent. It is an enjoyable journey to follow the logic and principle in this book, with all your attention in. There are full of in-depth discussion in all aspect of the Gibbs sampler, simulated annealing, from the visiting scheme to cooling schedule, and parallel algorithms. The references are excellent too. The author seems to have read all publications till 1995 about this topic and give an excellent detailed and in-depth survey in his book. At the end of your reading, you would have love the mathematical form the author used. Without these tools, many discussions in this book will be just impossible and groundless. I personally have read this book for several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This video does a good job talking about the resurgence of the 1996 Broncos, but it doesn't really go into the late season collapse (1-3 over final 4 games including playoffs) and it virtually ignores the Jacksonville game other than a brief highlight reel.

Very enjoyable; great illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book with a great message","review":"Recently I asked a girl in the third grade class where I am student teaching to recommend me a book. She chose a Friend Like Ed because she liked the story, but she said she liked the poetry in the book even better. The story itself is relatable for anybody of any age. We've all been embarrassed by a wacky friend (or family member) and wished to free ourselves from any association with that person. In this book, Mildred is embarrassed by her best friend Ed who can recite poetry anywhere he goes and seems to have an infinite amount of odd collections. Mildred grows tired of being embarrassed by Ed and decides to become friends with a girl named Pearl that seemed normal in everyway. However, Pearl does not prove to be as good as a friend as Ed was and Mildred begins to miss Ed and his oddities.

Their thinness is an advantage if you are flagging many places in a book or document set as many can be placed without the book or pile of papers becoming bulky. Post-It makes another flag, which it calls their \\"Durable\\" flag and is heavier if you are looking for something to use as a tab.With most pens and and even with a pencil, they can be written on, which is nice. And of course, they are transparent. I have found the Post-it brand to be consistent in its quality, as opposed to other manufacturers who sometimes don't make the flag sticky enough. They come in a wide variety of colors! This review is for the single color two-pack.Recommended.****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than ordering elsewhere","review":"I gave them 4 stars because I think they are expensive but they are a big help so worth buying. The big chain stores were starting charge more than I could stand and I was comtemplating colored paper clips as a replacement. Amazon to the rescue.

The game keeps him busy as he quizzes everyone at the table on a variety of topics. He makes piles of cards with correct answers for each team he has designated, and has a ton of fun being in charge of the game (while everyone is talking and eating and throwing out answers). Having this purse friendly sized card game at hand has helped make our families weekly get together even more fun and relaxed. Two of our family members work in the therapy department of long term care centers, and have also used the game cards to quiz their patients. So other than a great item for grandmas purses, it works well in the long term care setting helping to stimulate memory and make the therapy experience enjoyable on many more levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"No removable top!","review":"I bought this item because it advertises a wide removable top for ease in cleaning. I specifically wanted a teakettle that had a wide top opening, as I make large pots of tea at once, and I wanted to be able to put the teabags directly into the kettle. There is no opening at all, other than the spout. The whole body of the teakettle is one piece. Definitely a false description either on the part of Farberware or Amazon. I am also used to Farberware items having an aluminum bottom for good heat conductivity, and the bottom of this is just thin stainless steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot thumb!","review":"Overall a perfectly fine tea kettle.

It is made of thin plastic and with my dogs did not last a week without it being torn to shreads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"These sofa covers are pretty good. We have two cats and I've noticed they don't like getting on the sofas now. They may jump around on them as they are playing around but get right off of them, so they don't lay around on them like before. I'm happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as pictured","review":"This product says it is a SOFA COVER however it isn't even in the SHAPE of a sofa. It is a piece of plastic in the shape of a rectangle. That's it. A piece of rectangular plastic that is 46W x 134L. That's it. One piece doesn't even cover the average sofa. What a disappointment. I'm just glad I ordered other items so that the shipping was free otherwise I would have been furious if I paid shipping charges besides paying the almost $4 for this item. I'm not sure why the manufacturer calls it a sofa cover. A rectangular piece of plastic does not a sofa cover make! Basically I will put it in the garage and use it someday when I need a paint cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for ......","review":"This cover is about as thin as the covering used by dry cleaners.

(No complaints about the seller. Prompt shipping with tracking number email notification.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it look","review":"As a prior review has stated it is very thin plastic.

I was expecting an actual slip cover that would stay in place and fit to the shape of my couch. Item turned out to be just a piece of plastic, that I could have purchased at any hardware store. Unfortunately, I was not able to open the package and attempt to use the \\" so-called plastic slip cover\\",until after the 14 day allowed return policy by the seller. I would never purchase an item from this company in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not perfect...","review":"I never had any of the problems with it shifting around or the bungee breaking. I used it frequently for a couple years to carry my duffle bag. As long as I made sure my bag was properly secured it worked fine. If I had to carry a duffle bag that was cram packed or a little top heavy, I would use an extra bungee cord just to be safe. In the end it's not bad for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Junk","review":"Generic Junk... Can't add panniers, doesn't hold much weight & tends to shift or turn on the seatpost.

I wish I had read the reviews before buying.It is very tight on the seat post. Definitely not quick and easy as advertised.My main issue with this item is the quick release bolt. It is in front of the seatpost right under the saddle. It is also quite large and my legs end up rubbing up against it. Lowering the rack as far as possible helps a bit, but it still in the way of my legs. For this reason and the poor reviews, I'm going to be returning it.On the pro side, it did feel very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I needed a rack to take my lunch to work and to bring home parcels from the post office. The bungie cord broke the first time I used it. The rack shifts on the bike post. I did use it once to carry a small soft-sided cooler for a long ride, but had to bring extra bungee cords, but the hooks were too big to fit around the metal posts, so it took some effort to make that work. I should've spent more money on a better rack, instead of wasting money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold out for something better!","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a decent cheap bike rack, which it is. My problem is the bungee cord broke and it won't hold One gallon of water without problems.

Hopefully that will be more sturdy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this item yesterday so I could take my work/school items on my bike with me. It took over an hour to even get the thing mounted to my bike, as the hole that the seat mount goes on is too small and doesn't bend easily. I then tried to attach a bookbag to the rack if you have anything hanging over the edges the bungies won't stay hooked. The grooves need to be more of a \\"hook\\" type for the bungy to stay. I think this is a great idea but has some major desigm flaws. You definitely need another cargo net with SMALL hooks to attach to the metal on the rack. Next time I will splurge for a more expensive model in hopes that it is a little more user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit my bike seat","review":"I would've guessed that in buying a Bell product they would have made it universally fit bikes - it doesn't.

Find another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, vintage Cook","review":"Another cracker of a thriller from Cook I was slightly confused by Yuri's motivation for his second-to-last act, but that's a minor complaint. Great ending too. But when are Jack and Laurie going to get together? I mean really get together? Mr. Cook, you've been teasing us for three straight books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but not a very serious read.","review":"Having read several of Robin Cook's books, I think this book is the most amusing one I have ever read.But I liked this book mainly because of how true it really is. Bio-terrorism is something *everyone* has to be wary of.Unfortunately, Cook gets a little too humourous in one part of the book, namely when the bad guys are trying to get Jack. The sequence of events seem like something out of Bill Fitzhugh's Pest Control, where even the impossible happens.After all, how hard can it be to catch one guy? Very hard, according to Cook.All in all, this book is one of my favourites because his other books are usually very depressing to read, usually involving one helpless individual who has uncovered a cover-up of mega-proportions.The humourous tone is a welcome change."},{"rating":"1","title":"took me the first 300 pages to get hooked","review":"this story by cook is by far his worst i could not get into the story line for the first 3/4s of the book \\"toxin\\"had me hooked after the first chapter by the time vector got interesting i had most of the outcome figured out also the charectors are getting boring jack, laurie &warren basketball ,bike riding and warren always to the rescue doesn't cut it anymore bill dean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half way through and can't finish","review":"One of the worst books I have read in a very long time. It has been difficult to get even half way through the book. From the back cover it looked like a quick interesting book for a long plane ride, but talk about predictable. Definitely not a page turner if you have any forsight or intelligence at all. Also since I haven't read his other books I found all the past references to be terribly annoying in the way they were so clumsly added. In short you will see everything happening about a chapter or more before it actually occurs. One boring book. Try Rainbox Six if you want a good one on bioterrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left wing extremist political views ruined it for me.","review":"The book had great potential but the author ruined it for me by inserting his left wing extremist political views into the story. He tried to make the reader believe that all right wing conservatives are racists, what absolute bigotry. He villified legitimate gun dealers with the false assumption that a person can hold a valid Federal Firearms License after being convicted of a drug offense, what utter nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A busy doctor writes another great novel......NOT!","review":"This is simply terrible. If this book had been submitted to a publishing house or a college freshman English instructor, for that matter, under another name it would have been laughingly returned. The dialogue is just so amateurish.Of course with Robin Cook's name on it, it will probably be turned into a \\"made for TV\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Word","review":"The mystery in Cook's writing lies less in the fiction than in readers like me who keep buying ridiculous books like Vector. Although the spectre of biological terrorism provokes valid interest, Vector provokes little more than boredom. The \\"terrorists\\" in this far-fetched goon show are so inept that few readers could imagine them succeeding. The medical examiner protagonist is believable as a pathologist but almost malignantly benign as a human being. He frequently exclaims, \\"My word!\\" as he rides his bike through a stupendously one-dimensional existence toward the novel's stupifyingly predictable conclusion. In my opinion, this is a truly bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vector Hard Cover","review":"I have read all of Robin's books. I enjoyed every one of his books except Sphinx. It was very slow to get into and took almost till the end to enjoy the story. Vector was to predictable and very slow to get into. Robin were you having writers block with this book? It took me over a month to read. Usually one of his books, I can finish in a week or shorter. My all time favorite is Acceptable Risk. Please re-read it and write one that can continue with it. This book kept my interest and yet was scared to find out what would happen next. Write an Acceptable Risk II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Politically Correct","review":"This book is kind of stifling. Cook is at his politically-correct worst here. All the blacks are saintly (even if they're violent), all the bad guys are white skinhead, nazi, right-wing extremists. Cook uses these derogatory adjectives so many times, it's nauseous. Plus, according to Cook, the skinheads have thousands of active members with a world-wide conspiracy. He maintains (as the AP also claims) Michigan is the headquarters of this KKK conspiracy. The plot of the book is pretty transparent. I mean, there's no suspense, you know who's going to win and 100% win. The bad guys are portrayed as stumble-bums lacking redeemable qualities.There are no shades of gray in this tedious text. Everything is 100% bad - white 'racists\\" or 100% good - all blacks. Most people will admit there are good and bad examples in all groups of people, but Cook is such a fearful writer, he even portrays black gang members as deprived but moral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"I'm not very knowledgeable about bioterrorism, so I am sure the inconsistencies mentioned by others are there, and this book may not deserve 4 stars. But since I don't know about such things, I have to admit I found this a good read.Most of Cook's books would be able to \\"fool\\" me, since I don't know much about medicine and diseases, but sometimes ignorance is bliss, so I enjoy Robin Cook's books (at least the ones I've read). I probably wouldn't notice inconsistencies and mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"When I select a Robin Cook book, I am not expecting great literature - just a good summer read. This book was pretty boring. The characters are very one dimensional and the technical detail gets very tedious at times. I agree with other reviewers who say that the dialogue is stilted. You never really get to know or like the main characters (the good guys)so what happens to them really doesn't matter. The bad guys are stale representations of stereotypical villains. All in all, a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his better novels","review":"This is one of the better novels by Cook. The character of Laurie is not really credible. As a doctor she must be intelligent enough to judge people - at least rudimentary. As usual Cook's men are more realistic characters. The plot is very realistic - as we know now. And this is why the ending is a little disappointing. Maybe Cook was afraid of his own courage when looking into the future. We have to be prepared. This novel is not only highly political, reality has even overtaken fiction. This is why this novel should be read by those responsible for our security. Maybe they see the nightmare that is hinted at here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something??","review":"I was so enjoying yet another Stapleton/ Montgomery mystery and enjoy it I did. However, I was very disappointed that Robin Cook did not explore the end of the relationship Laurie had with Paul Sutherland. It just petered out without an ending (ergo.. Did I miss something).I haven't felt this in your other novels.. What's up DOC?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Not Great","review":"Well, I read the book as part of a school ISU study (Indipendent Study Unit). It was own choice and I grabbed this book.The plot was simple enough...terrorist attacks because of skinheads and crazy russians. Cook took this and made it into a decent medical novel. I didn't mind the book, but agree with other reviewers that the text was too formal between the Skinheads and Yuri (the crazy Russian). Cook should have researched the topic of gang conversation before writing the book.It might have made conversations more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another haunting tale from the medical thrill master!","review":"One of the best characters I've read, Yuri Davidov (is that how you spell it?), is the centerplate of this book. He's disgruntled at the U.S.A.'s promise of prosperity, only to be turned down and lowered to cab driver. So, he decides to get back.With solid characters and page-turning suspense and action, Robin Cook has created yet another book to get your mind thinking. Despite the somewhat cliched and abrupt ending, Vector is a chilling book about what ends people will go to to get revenge, no matter who on."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's done better","review":"Definately not one of Robin Cook's better books. The events were very predictable and the plot seemed to drag. Most of his books require more thought when reading them, not this one. The whole skinheads theme was also a turn off. He was dealing with too many issues (racism, gun control, imigrants, USSR vs. Russia now, biological warfare) and didn't tie them together very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped with this while camping!!","review":"50 pages into this book I knew it wasn't worth my time, but I had nothing else to read on a camping trip so I persevered. At ~ 200 pages I again decided to stop.With the recent (Oct '01) rash of Anthrax terrorism I dug the book out and finished it, hoping for some interesting insight into the mechanics of such an act.Too bad.Mr. Cook's writing is undoubtedly the laziest, most stereotypical and simplistic I've encountered. The bouncy dialog seems lifted from a Hardy Boys installment.Everyone here is a stereotype of some sort. Cute women have \\"girlish figures\\". Bad guys consist of skin heads, disgruntled immigrant cab drivers and mysterious arms-dealing boyfriends. And guess what, the protagonist is a bike riding, hoops playing widower with a heart of gold and reckless disdain for bureaucratic red tape. Go figure!!!Only benefit to reading this book is the discovery of a useful litmus test: \\"Do you read Robin Cook?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No nails bitten here.","review":"What a total disappointment. After reading Toxin, I could hardly wait for Robin Cook's new book. This book was slow and predictable. I wouldn't recommend you wait for the paperback because I will assume most people will have better things to do with their time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"I have read all of Robin Cook's books. However off late each one is becoming more and more predictable. There is hardly anything to hold as suspense. Completing the book was just going through the motions. I would still prefer the God Player, Harmful Intent types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure, unadulterated CRAP!!","review":"Hard to believe this was written by Robin Cook. Protagonists are nothing but politically-correct nitwits, villians are one-dimensional, and plot is completely unbelievable. Entire novel is suffused with politically-correct mantras. Continues the decline in the quality of Cook's literary work. Very dissappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"utter drivel!!!!!","review":"This novel reads like my sophomoric attempts at a novel in elementary school. The story is contrived and it seems like Dr. Cook is trying too hard to make it believable. Dr. Cook has done better. This is a an attempt to draw the average masses to buy this book. Please! Aim your novels at those of us who have a higher than third grade reading level!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO LONG AND BORING","review":"i had to read this for a high school bio paper and i must say this book was extrmely boring. There were a few cook books to chose from and i must say this \\"looked\\" intresting. There is no suspence what so ever. If there was no bio weapons in the plot it would be a book about a doctors boring day job who likes a co worker, and gets aroung to playing \\"B-ball\\". The only aspect about the book that was the best was the un-predictable ending that i definatly didnt see comming. Other than that do your self a favor and dont read this book, because you will just be waisting your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Every now and then I'm taken in by the jacket blurb and buy another Robin Cook lemon. This one is as bad as the rest: wooden prose, implausible plot, unbelievable and unsympathetic characters. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...only if it's the last book on earth","review":"In the first place, it's OBVIOUS Cook doesn't live in NewYork. The names he drops! Believe me, those people did NOT have dinnerat Elio's. Also...it's as if Cook lifted pages and pages from his previous books about these less-than-scintillating characters. You'll encounter such commercials for his past works: \\"As happened in blah blah, Dr. Laurie Montgomery did blah blah blah.\\" And it couldn't be written in a more blah manner. Not a single character is remotely believable. And didn't Cook know that music has a lot to do with violence, white supremacy et al? Where has he been living? He also lifted BORING research...or his underpaid researcher lifted it, then he cut and pasted it into the manuscript. What has happened to this man? Robots R Us. Do not bother, even for a no-brainer beach book. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Dead","review":"Cook and his editors must be in a Coma. Not even the plot was original material, and the execution was extremely shallow and sloppy.Let's see, a medical examiner tracks down a madman bent on unleashing a bioweapon on New York City. The bioweapon was cooked up in a basement lab...If I were Richard Preston, author of Cobra Event, I would sue for copyright infringment. I'm glad I only read this one from the library, because I would not have wanted to pay good money for this bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook puts forth an intriguing and plausible terrorist plot.","review":"Cook is expecting the reader to overlook the subplot inconsistancies put forth i.e. running over a policeman without having a statewide manhunt or the russian's basement lab with megawatt requirements not arousing suspicion from the utilities. Then there are the interminable amount of coincidences. O.k., I'll put up with all that because the plot is so incredible the way it unfolds in the book. The anti-heroes are believable and entertaining in the way they view life with all their shortsideness and clever madness, trusting and distrusting each other simultaneously. There is part 'Keysone Cops' and serious human drama that keeps your attention to the end. The scary part of this book is that there is a plausibility that this scenerio played out in Vector could happen to an unsuspecting American city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel-one of the better ones I've read","review":"Robin Cook's new book \\"Vector\\" is a very, very interesting book. The details and descriptions it contains are really interesting. This book is very realistic and deals with a realistic threat. This book I strongly recommend to anybody who is interested in biological terrorism"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Robin Cook fans","review":"I'm a sucker for a Robin Cook novel.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish this","review":"I suppose I should have actually finished the book to review it, but hey, I know what is going to happen!This is just ridiculous. I started reading Robin Cook in the late 70's, and loved his books. The last few years though....it is like he is just trying to crank out anything, the more outlandish the better.There were too many coincidences. In a city of how many million? And it goes on and on.I hope Dr. Cook gets back to writing the way he used to. Dr. Kay Scarpetta does not need competition from Dr. Jack Stapleton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"important food for thought in today's world of terrorists","review":"This is an average Robin Cook novel, which is to say a somewhat contrived and predictable plot line, but also that Dr. Cook says important things within the context of his boox. He tries to keep it interesting, which he succeeds at here as in the others, while reminding the reader of real conditions and threats in the world. He did this with contaminated meats in \\"Toxin\\" and does it again with the terrorist threat of biological warfare here in \\"Vector.\\" I read his novels every year and am never disappointed in the lessons i come away with.

I was looking for something a little more advanced than \\"How To Write Demos in Cocoa\\" (see \\"Programming in Cocoa\\" for an introduction to writing demos in Cocoa).I am very dissapointed, plus, the writing style was annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most illuminating book on Cocoa","review":"I already understood object-oriented programming and was eager to learn about Cocoa. I read this book and the O'Reilly books. \\"Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X\\" was clearly the best. Judging from the Cocoa mailing lists, everyone seems to agree that this is the best place to start with Cocoa programming.I was worried that it might not be ready for Mac OS 10.2. A few of the screenshot are clearly dated, but overall the book is completely 10.2-compatible. Also, there was extra information at the Big Nerd Ranch website to ensure that I had no problems using the book with Mac OS 10.2.I like the clear, readable style, and I thought the material covered was truly useful. I actually emailed the author, and I found him quite pleasant and helpful. I hope he writes an advanced book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introductory tutorial","review":"I've never had the privilege of attending Aaron's highly-regarded 'Big Nerd Ranch' training program, but I have to believe that working through this book is the next best thing. The book is presented in tutorial form, with a nice flow between examples, discussion and exercises.The author doesn't hesitate to share his opinions, good or bad--particularly on subjects like Cocoa Java. The result is a frank, incisive introduction to Cocoa programming that helps beginners understand 'the right way' to do things, and will make Apple's object-oriented environment accessible to people with a wide variety of skill levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Touch of Frustration","review":"In trying to use Interface Builder (as it came with MacOS 10.0) to follow-through some of the book's early examples, the Interface Builder did not behave the way the book describes.

Made me wonder whether the book was describing a beta version of IB. I found the O'Reilly book \\"Learning Cocoa\\" more accurate in this respect.Must give it another try, one of these days. I'll update this review if I figure out what I must have missed the first two times around the block."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great.","review":"I was expecting to get a lot more out of this book then I did due to the author's background at NeXT. I found it to read very easily and explain things clearly but not things that I really wanted to know. This book should of been the first 3 chapters of a cocoa book in my opinon, and about 150 pages shorter. The author went overly into basic details, and did not provide enough tech details. Well I guess that's what I get for not buying oreilly though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skimps on details","review":"If I could I would have given this book zero stars, but at least the publisher used recycled paper. The author briefly covers Objective-C, but doesn't delve very well into the differences between Objective-C and C/C++, Java or for that matter SmallTalk (on whose syntax Objective-C is based). That is my biggest gripe. Objective-C is C in name only. There was no discussion of the pitfalls of Objective-C. I had to dig on the net to find out you can't create Objective-C objects on the stack. I would be reading the book and be thinking about how I would solve a particular problem in a different language, and there would be no discussion along those lines. You can program in Java to create a Cocoa app, and Apple provides its tutorial to get a programmer going, but the author actually tries to dissuage his readers from using Java. It doesn't even serve as any sort of proper Cocoa API reference. I guess I'll just stick with Apple's documentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to learn","review":"While I'll agree you need some programming experience to learn from this book, it says you need to know C++ or Java. I don't know either (I know VB and RealBasic) and yet am learning Cocoa very easily from this book.Like the two guys that reviewed before me, if you need your hand held to use the online documentation after the book teaches you how to put everything together for yourself (and tells you to look at the online docs) then you'll become frustrated with this book.You NEED this book if you want to learn Cocoa quickly and efficiently. I'm half way through the book and I'm very excited to use Cocoa thanks to Aaron and his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Show","review":"Good for teaching kids to love animals,Fully enjoyed when I watch it and it was recommended to me, I wont over rate it but its something to keep in mind next time you wan't to watch something different and interesting if you don't wan't your kids to be little nasties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Seal","review":"I've been looking for this movie for over 25 years!

Close your eyes to the braggadocio and you still have an interesting account of a very talented man who rode some horrific transitions in his profession, the newspaper industry. The man was known for his spark and innovation. Sadly enough, as the title states the fact, Bellows was brought into save a lot of sinking ships. Makes you wonder what he could have done if born a little earlier and paired up with a thriving paper. Ah, but I'm sure Bellows had the same ruminations. The book is a fast read and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legend in his own mind","review":"Jim Bellows certainly is a journalistic legend--at least in his own mind.

So stay away from this book, it is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beginner's view","review":"While I do not question Nick's ability to teach the game of tennis, this book was not written for beginners. In fact, it is hard to tell who it is written for since he never makes it clear. From what I can tell, the book seems to be aimed at the average coach or instructor who is looking to improve his or her teaching methods to juniors. It seems the book was written under the assumption that you already have an extremely strong foundation of the concepts and mechanics of the game, but again, it's hard to tell. I also believe the author spent way too many pages as promotional material for his prestigious tennis academy. Perhaps in five years when I have a much better understanding of the game, I will come back to Nick's book and look to improve my game."},{"rating":"1","title":"What McEnroe thiks about Bollitierri","review":"John McEnroe wrote a review for one of Bollotierri's books.

Granted, due to shadows from my house there may not be direct sunlight all day but it's enough for my neighbors lights to work and it should be enough for decent solar lights to function.One of these days I will find out what kind of lights my neighbors have and get the same ones and throw these out.

Enjolras attempts to save the overall quality of the CD, but he is not enough for me not to regret buying it.The only upside of the CD is to hear the lyrics in its original form, but the singers are frankly not doing the justice to the words.

Perhaps it was written to lend credence to the claims that the Clintons' critics are engaged in a vast right wing conspiracy of disinformation. Next year's scandal - Who paid Sheehy to botch this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE - POLITICS MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely. Although I voted for Bill Clinton twice, I didn't have a clue about Hillary. I was struck by the similarity between Hillary and Laura Schlessinger; both worked hard to please distant fathers; both evolved away from their early education and politics; both are intelligent, but brittle and don't seem particularly warm toward individuals, saving their compassion for people at large; both are highly political. As for the Clinton's marriage, Hillary certainly isn't the first wife of a cheating husband to stick with him. Seems now she is moving away from the image of \\"the Clintons\\" and toward a public persona of her very own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillary's Choice should not be your choice!","review":"A poorly written book strategically released to cash in on the Hillary Clinton phenomenon. Definitely give this work of fiction a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dishy & Satisfying","review":"The Clintons' marriage may seem to be worked-over territory. But Sheehy, drawing on interviews with hundreds of subjects -- some of whom have kept silent until now -- breaks new ground in addressing the big question: Do the Clintons love one another -- or is it just a political partnership?Her answer: Hillary is addicted to Bill. \\"He is her only rebellion,\\" writes Sheehy, \\"the one thing she can't logically explain.\\" The author charts the dog days of the Clintons' relationship, when, in the late '80s, Bill fell in love with a blonde Arkansas divorc��e and Hillary contemplated divorce. Sheehy also explores Hillary's character -- her toughness, her ambition, her willingness to blame her husband's problems on others -- without suggesting these qualities are less appealing in a woman than in a man.A woman of addictions and ambitions and an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually flawed","review":"The book reads well enough but it is so factually flawed that the Washington Post has started a \\"Gail's Goofs\\" column about this particular book listing all of the factual errors (six days running last I checked). Read Lloyd Grove's Reliable Source column in the Washington Post Style Section before you buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillary Remains Analysis-Proof","review":"It must be frustrating for anyone trying to write a book about either of the Clintons. Although Sheehy is successful in humanizing the First Lady, she was unable to reveal anything of a truly personal nature about the First Lady. The personal relationship between the Clintons is opaque to the onlooker. Because they do not tend to give out personal information, the book merely rehashes what has already been surmised about this couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"Save your money on this one. This book reads like a novel. At times I found myself wondering what was fact and what was fiction. If you want to read a good Hillary Clinton book, try 'Hell to Pay : The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton' by Barbara Olson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psyco babble","review":"The book needed to put more emphasis on actual interviews and facts than trying to express what is going on in another person's mind. Barbara Olson's book \\"Hell to Pay\\" and Peggy Noonan's book \\"The Case Against Hillary Clinton\\" were much more accurate in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio on the road Entertainment!","review":"The book on tape was just entertainment to cheer up an otherwise fairly dull Christmas auto trip from Chicago to Minneapolis..with three tapes it was long enough to have some fun on the return trip too. This will never reach the heights of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" but it may begin a journey toward underground cult status. The author, Gail Sheehy, reads her own abridged work and attempts, throughout the tape, to imitate the respective accents of the cast of characters. We howled! The story line is interesting and the time Gail must have spent to weave this tale can only be imagined. Bottom line: This is like a Suzanne or Steele novel torqued up with a good dose of freshman psychology, mixed in with a day-time soap opera and an old time radio play. It's all taken too seriously and what is suggested to be serious is just very thin opinion and conjecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"The substance of these Clinton bios is wearing thin. I was disappointed with Ms. Sheehy's book. Basically, this is a longer version of an article she wrote in the February 1999 issue of last year's Vanity Fair Magazine. You are better off saving your money and finding that very well written article. We don't find out anything extraordinary in this book other than the revelation that Hillary had a passionate relationship with a \\"dark Irish\\" Georgetown grad pre Bill Clinton. How shocking! In addition, the revelation that Bill's falling in love with one of his enamoratas (Jane Doe #1) threatened their marriage is a well known fact. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheehy Proves Her Point","review":"I don't get all the fuss about Sheehy's work being psychobabble. The writer who introduced that word to the language, R. Rosen, defines it as something very different: writing or talk that uses jargon from psychiatry of psychotherapy without particular accuracy or relevance.Ms. Sheehy almost never resorts to jargon - that's what makes her work so accessible and so useful to psychiatrists and psychotherapists themselves - including myself. Where she does use a psychiatric term, \\"dissociative identities,\\" she is quoting \\"a highly qualified mental health professional who works too close to the white house to be identified.\\" If the author had been able to name her source - let's say it was a psychiatrist at Walter Reed Hospital - it would have had more credibility. But she probably would have aliented her source, and I imagine she's too smart to betray a shrink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or your time","review":"I found this book very disappointing. Too obviously written for sensationalism and money. If you must read it, get it from the library; that's where my book is going.It is NOT a biography if it contains factual errors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just gossip","review":"This book really has nothing to do with Hillary or the Clintons -- it has everything to do with Gail Sheehy - her mean-spiritedness, her willingness to gossip, her jealousy, her arrogance, her pain. This book is not good journalism -- not recommended for anyone to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one. . . .","review":"This is the nastiest book I have ever read. Ms. Sheehy ought to be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low-Life Dish Worthy of The Enquirer Only","review":"There are some interesting interviews and selected passages in Gail Sheehy's Hillary' Choice, but on the whole, the book is a slightly more literate National Enquirer tabloid-style trashing of the First Lady and President Clinton. There are a few nods toward the Clintons' great achievements during their 8 years in the White House, but the book is written for the lowest-common denominator among those fascinated by hyperbolic, negatve gossip. The most unconscionable element to the book is its pseudo-psycholanalysis of the Clintons' respective childhood \\"traumas\\" and their relationship with one another. It's a ridiculously one-sided and negative interpretation of one of the nation's smartest, most charismatic, and most effective couples."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Hillary's Choice' is an excellent work of fiction!","review":"It seems that everyone out there wants to write a book about Hillary Clinton.

It was very hard to read thru and I began to skip pages. Don't waste your money on this one, unless you've had your head in the sand for the past 8 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I was disappointed with this book because I felt the author was unfair to my idol throughout the book.I adore people like Hillary and Rosie O'Donnell because they feel in their hearts what America is all about and the author made it seem like Hillary is not always a saint.This is a shocking revelation to me because in front of the cameras,which is all that matters,Hillary understands the pain we Americans go through every day,but the author did not do a good job expressing this.I don't know why the author who should be an expert on the subject,did not emphasize what a sincere,honest woman she is.I hate to think I've been fooled by the media all these years.The author did have some good things to say about Hillary but overall she could have been a little nicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Come On","review":"Well written, but defies logic. With all the affairs, the audio tapes of calls with Jennifer Flowers, how can anybody still believe Hillary Clinton was ignorant of his behavior? I expected more from Sheehy, something a bit closer to believability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Read","review":"As a political science professor, I have always been intrigued by how political figures develop their beliefs. I think Sheehy does a marvelous job at fusing the social, political and cultural influences that have surrounded Hillary Clinton and presents them with clarity, honesty and candor. Unlike many other political biographers, Sheehy does not pass judegement on her subject, rather she allows the reader to make their own decisions. And thanks to Sheehy's skills, those decisions will certainly be well-informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on hearsay, opinion, and \\"psycho-analysis\\"","review":"This book lacked depth and seemed to be based largely on hearsay and opinion of key people interviewed by the author. At several points, the author even asked some interviewees to comment on what they thought Hillary and/or Bill Clinton were \\"feeling.\\" There are several attempts at a \\"psychoanalysis\\" of the Clintons, which would have been fine if this was a psychology book written by a psychologist, but doesn't work here at all. With any biography, I question the level of accuracy and also realize that much needs to be based on judgement or interpretation of fact; this book did not seem to present much information based on fact but rather more on unexamined opinion. Overall, a disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-fictional account of the Clintons","review":"Read this book and you will understand why Bill and Hillary act as they do. .....

I immediately read \\"Manhattan North\\" afterwards and (thinking Mackie couldn't out do himself), loved this story even more. Sgt. Thorn Savage is back and had immersed himself into stopping the leader of a notoriously violent drug traffic industry. He turns it into more than a professional occupation, it becomes a personal vendetta. I simply could not put the book down. If it becomes a movie (and hopefully it will), I'll see it without delay.I highly recommend this book to anyone who reads detective stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mackie Tops His Own Debut With An Even Better Read!","review":"Author John Mackie was a decorated NYPD detective (he is now retired) but he is even a better writer. I thought his first book (Manhattan South) as good a detective novel as I've read but this one is even better. The Publishers Weekly review is so wrong. Mackie writes excellently about personal relationships; so much so that I actually had tears in my eyes over the tragedy in this novel. The first novel galloped along from the get-go, but this one is a slow build. I was impatient through the opening chapters but WOW! - When the action started, it was an incredible not-to-be-missed ride all the way to the last word. If you read \\"thrillers\\" at all (and even if you don't) this one will keep you turning pages. I was up 'till 3 AM; I had to find out what happened.

First of all, the entire book is based off of a .25 correlation. For anyone that knows anything about correlations, that is anything but strong. The other huge mistake the authors make is to imply causation-- increases in leadership will lead to increases in student achievement. Have you ever heard, \\"correlation does not imply causation\\"? That saying is there for a reason. The authors spend the entire book making rash, over-interpreted claims based on a correlation from a study that has more methodological flaws than can even be discussed here.

If anything, he just took what is pretty much commonly accepted into a different format and made it look new. As I was reading the book I thought, \\"Oh well, another $30 down the drain but no harm, no foul.\\", until I got to page 85 and saw the sample standards based report card. It's a teacher's nightmare and would lead to massive subjectivity (how do you assigned a % every day to every student for class participation and following rules??) being represented as objective data.

I wanted to put the movie onto my iPhone (so that I could enjoy it while out or traveling), or even as a DVD product (so that I could play it on my home theater system). Instead the 'Instant Video' copy is so heavily protected that it seems I can only enjoy the film on my PC (very uncomfortable and inconvenient way to enjoy a film).

Well, then, this book is a self-fulfilling prophesy. In the process, we get to squirm through such incessent dissing of his mother that we want to turn our heads in embarrassment; so much what-did-I-do-wrong whining about lost loves that we're inclined to \\"card\\" him to see if he's really past 15; and yet more tired and feeble attempts at what, I suppose, is to pass for \\"Southern humor.\\" If this is the best we're to expect from Blount as he flounders through middle age, he ought to confine himself to his periodic appearances with Garrison Keillor, reading jokes sent in by people who know what \\"funny\\" really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy","review":"Very sturdy & stands up to work out from my 3 grandsons.

Do not buy this book, it's better used in your fireplace for a little warmth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized and disappointing","review":"The problem with Mr. Di Salvatore's book is that it never seems to decide what it wants to be. At times, it attempts to study Ward in the context of his time--and, indeed, it spends more time on his youth in Bellefonte and his brief time at Penn State than it does with his involvement in the players' movement and his marriage to Helen Dauvray--while at other times it seems to want to break into a full-fledged novel. The chronology is equally inconsistent, and he varies between giving too little detail (e.g., the Players' League) in some areas and unconscionable amounts--there is a full section on the history of baseball that adds little or nothing to the book as a whole--in others. By failing to establish some central theme or organizing principle for the book, Mr. Di Salvatore comes perilously close to writing about nothing at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal Adventure","review":"Each time another Atlantis game is released, the version becomes more surreal than the last.

I am a fan and I loved this book. In fact, I think it is one of his best. He uses the genocide in Rwanda as a backdrop for his story of a priest with a secret. As is common with Leonard's books, you can't be sure who is good and who is bad. For some people, this may be disorienting, but I think it is what makes Elmore Leonard the best crime novelist out there. I love a book that keeps you unsure whether you really know or understand what is going on. Definitely recommmended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mindless entertainment for a day or two at the beach","review":"The most recent book of the man who wrote Get Shorty. Excellent dialogue, shallow charaters, simple plot.

I have read just about everything he has written from \\"The Big Bounce\\" onward. However I thought his \\"Shorty\\" stories were a bit weak. Too much Hollywood, not enough Detroit.\\"Pagan Babies\\" is a return to vintage Elmore Leonard. Plenty of oddly twisted criminals, weird thinking, and gallows humor. The contrast between the genocide in Africa and the petty materialism of the Americans was nicely done.Its great that Mr Leonard has returned to his roots. I hope that his next novels are set in Detroit and are full of the hoodlums his fans miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical and formula","review":"After I read this latest by Leonard I decided \\"no more\\". How anyone can think his characters are believable is beyond me. They are bland. And another thing...the author is a shamless name-dropper. He had to name everything in Royal Oak, MI. It wasn't enough to say the characters went to a comedy club...or a restaurant...Leonard had to point out and name everything. His plots are too simple. As for being humorous. There wasn't anything even mildly funny about PAGEN BABIES. Debbie's routine wasn't amusing at all. I should have listened to my husband when he said I would be wasting my time reading PAGEN BABIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is entertainment. 4 1/2 stars","review":"Storyline above.Elmore Leonard strikes again with another original novel that reaches from Genocidal Rwanda to the streets of Detroit. The novel moved at a fast pace and kept me reading into the night (as usual, for Leonard). The originality of the characters was refreshing as was the dialogue and humor. The massacres in Rwanda drew a sharp contrast compared to the activities in Detroit where most of the humor took place. I think Leonard pulled this contrast off real well and thus gave it an originality you don't often see.Truly entertainingHighly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Bust but Not Great","review":"Elmore Leonard has come to attract a certain audience and to create certain expectation. In Pagan Babies, Leonard has fallen from the lofty expectations that have established him as an icon of the action read. In this work, Leonard appears to have lost his way and seems to be operating on fumes rather than the racy and substantiative material in past works. I mean, I love novels with big breasts and sex scenes but do we need a piece of fiction that would cause a corpse to to do push-ups on a December day in Fargo? And what does that have to do with the storyline? Lamentably, Leonard has reverted to easy sleaze and the result is sex, sex, sex.For those still interested, it's a busty book with testosterone oozing from its pages, while every woman has an implant and the men seem to have no interest in moving the plot forward. In short, I think its shallow but worth a little steam. Leonard, however, seems to have little steam left."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID HE WRITE THIS IN HIS SLEEP?","review":"I had heard great things about Elmore Leonard's writing, so I thought I'd give PAGAN BABIES a try. Maybe his other books are gems, but I fear I picked a stinker with this one. The story seemed promising---Father Terry is a priest on the lam in Rwanda at the time of the Tutsi-Hutu tribal wars. But Leonard writes about the Rwandan genocide without much insight nor care about the characters. His writing didn't move me to a single emotion except maybe boredom. The prose is so dull; not a single line made me sit up and take notice, and I often felt lost in the story (in a bad way) so reading every page was a real chore. You'd have to twist my arm to read another one of his books.

All she needs is some dumb guy to fulfill her wishes. In Terry Dunn she thinks she has her intellectually challenged male. Problem is: she's wrong. Terry's not stupid.Her final plight is a real joy to us men who have watched our species canniballized in movies like BODY HEAT. What fun it is to see the tables turned on a fairly smart woman.

It doesn't meet even the most basic standards of journalism -- any freshman history student who handed in a paper so flawed and so lacking in documentation would be given a failing grade. I think the Nixon family should sue the author and publisher for slander and defamation. No one should be allowed to publish such smears without any credible verification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported \\"Revelations\\"","review":"This book is a hatchet-job, pure and simple.

Summers paints Nixon as somewhere between Vlad the Impaler and Jeffrey Dahmer, spending his entire presidency picking wings off flies. They call this kind of writing \\"one dimensional\\" and it may be fun reading, but it hardly contributes to an understanding of the whole man. It actually became silly to read, it was so biased.Most laughable was when he repeatedly painted Nixon's most enthusiastic hatchetmen, Haldeman and Ehrlichmen, as altar boys speaking during the Nixon years with such reason and later, of course, such balanced hindsight.It's a shame. Obviously, Summers did tremendous research for this book and he had the resources, therefore, to produce a credible, balanced work instead of just a blatant bloodletting.But it does sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically invented, Float story becomes fact.","review":"Both parties make up \\"stuff\\" that they float out through the media to see what the reaction is.

Unbiased works about Nixon are hard to find, and I didn't find one here. It would be refreshing to come across a text that seeks neither to vilify nor redeem Nixon's public image. Perhaps, given the damage he did to political idealism in this country, it simply isn't possible to approach him without an agenda. Or maybe we just need more time to go by before we try to digest his impact on American life."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Pop history\\" at its worst...","review":"Mr. Summers took every sleazy, secondhand rumor about President Nixon, found some peripheral reference to it amongst the many books, oral histories, and writings on the Nixon era, and threw it into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summers is a crook","review":"Summers is a sensationalist, writing purely for $.

There is so much we didn't know about the damage that was done to the office of the Presidency in order to satisfy one man's need for power. What I found most tragic was the realization that we are also not ready for the truth in this country about our leaders. A week of watching the media on this book has convinced me that we are afraid to learn from our own history--and may be doomed to repeat it in our choices at election time. A brilliant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The prosecution rests","review":"This book by Anthony Summers is a prosecution of the presidency of Richard Nixon and his subject provides him with plenty of material. I would not call it a hatchet job, but I would not call it an accurate history either. Summers is obsessive with his footnotes, but it is the context of these anecdotes that seems awry.Summers make no real attempt at balance and Nixon's achievements are sidelined in his rush for the dirt of his presidency. And there is plenty of dirt to be found. I preferred Kutler's dissection in War's of Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon to Summers' extended tabloid newspaper-style trashing.

It is just a collection of gossip with very little historical background. I mean how intersting is it to know that Nixon might have had a problem with impotence. Summers couldn't confirm it, so why even write about it in the first place. I really feel that this book was a total disgrace to Nixon. Yes, Nixon had many of faults, but he also did some good things for this country. As an avid reader of Richard Nixon biographies, this is by far the worst and least objective. It seems that Summers has a personal vendetta against Nixon. Try reading the Ambrose books on the Nixon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and well-researched","review":"Whoever claims that this book is badly researched hasn't read it! Summers has collected enough persuasive evidence in his Nixon biography to prove that this was a man that should never have become president of the United States.This book leads its readers to a more important question for today's world: is there something wrong in the way America's leader (and thus the most powerful politician in the world) is (s)elected? Events in autumn 2000 have shown that with the support of big business weak political figures can still achieve the highest office of the land.This is not to say that George Bush Jr. and Richard Nixon share the same character flaws. But if there's a message in Summers' book it is this: political funding by the big business interests must be properly regulated and restricted if a repeat of the Nixon desaster is to be avoided. Over to you, Senator Mc Cain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research","review":"A lot has been said as well as written about Richard Nixon so far, but it's the first time I read that he was on an antidepressant, called Dilantin. That's where the author's extremely poor research comes in. Either Nixon was on an antidepressant or he was on Dilantin, which is a anti-epileptic-medication, can cause depression as one of many nasty side effects. If the whole rest of the book has been researched as badly as this, then the book is not recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"yellow journalism has not died","review":"Having several other biographies of Richard Nixon, Anthony Summers' poorly written and clumsily edited tome fails to meet the competition. To those who have read this book and swallowed it as truth, all I can say is they must love fiction. Summers makes allegations and statements as fact without annotation or substantiation. He is also far too willing to take any quotation at face value. An example of the poor editing: In the early chapters, every time Dr. Hutschnecker's name is mentioned, Summers takes the pains to remind us he was Nixon's psychoanalyst - even if he had already done so on the previous page to say nothing of the previous mentions! Bottom line - Don't waste your time or money on this piece of sleazy yellow journalism. For all his flaws, Nixon will certianly survive this smear job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance of Author","review":"There's no need to spin tales to develop a serious critique of Richard Nixon, yet Anthony Summers begins and ends his own yarns from cover to cover of this poorly researched, yet convincingly written fable.From his claim that young Richard \\"devoured\\" Dale Carnegie's book \\"How To Win Friends and Influence People\\" at the age of 11 (12 years before the Carnegie book was published) to his unfounded creation of Nixon the wife beater, Summers attempts to muster belief in his myths by stating them as facts and adding twists of irony and wryness as he goes along.Add this one to your Nixon collection only to keep it complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faltaram alguns classicos, mas o CD �� bom!","review":"Gostei muito da incluso de uma verso ao vivo de Eu Sei e Daniel na Cova dos Lees, que ao vivo, �� uma das melhores do musicas do Legio.

I had an HP LaserJet before this and it most certainly did not make this noise so this is not simply a problem endemic to all laser printers.In an office setting, the squeal may not be too bothersome because of all the ambient noise but in a home office it is quite annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy set up, high quality.","review":"I opened the box, and within 2 minutes (literally) I was printing documents.

But I knew that, and already had a cable when the printer arrived. I'm happy here. I'm pretty tech savvy, but I didn't want to hassle too much. I did some simple research, this printer seemed to be the best in this price range, so I bought it. I can't imagine a reason anyone would be unhappy.

Samuel is a so so book at best.Some of the information came from sources such as the Book of five rings and Hagakure, these sources are sometimes biased and often did not refer to samurai culture but just the lives of the author. A frightening note is that the rest of the material seems ot be directly plagarized from both internet rescources, such as the Samurai Archives and material written by Dr. Stephen Turnbull. Overall I defintly cannot recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This book is horrible! I am a samurai/ninja enthusiast and have done some reading on the subjects and this book is not of much use even as an introduction, in my opinion. I believe that there are much better works out there for a beginner. To start with Fall River Press needs a better editor to clear up inaccuracies like one I noticed in the timeline in the very beginning of the book. The book then proceeds to jump around from topic to topic, era to era, \\"philosophy\\" to concrete example, with no rhyme or reason. Any explanations given for terms or concepts are simplistic at best and confusing at worst. I wish I had not wasted my money on this book, shame on me for not looking inside when I first saw it at Borders. At least I paid less for it from Amazon Marketplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine prose aside from conspiracy hints","review":"Sons and Brothers was a well written biography of the dynamic duo that occupied the White House in the sixties. Aside from brief, and not well provin conspiracy theories, it gave an excellent glimpse into the Kennedy brothers and their politics. I recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest interest in the JFK and RFK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suprising biography of two very interesting brothers.","review":"For some time now, I have been interested in the Kennedy's and the mystical life styles they lead. Sons and Brothers by Richard D. Mahoney provided great insight into the relationship between Jack and Bobby Kennedy. Not only were they brothers, but they were also great political mates. I was totally amazed at the connection between the Kennedy family and the mafia. I was also shocked at what difficulties Jackie had to go through during she and Jacks marriage. Mahoney spent a little too much time discussing Johnny Roselli and Carlo Marcello. It would have been nice if Mahoney had mentioned a little bit more about Jackie and the children. Overall, I feel that Sons and Brothers is a great book, and I highly recomend it to anyone who is interested in the Kennedy's or the presidency."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is far too much","review":"this is not a biography,it's a fiction and it's stupid, boring.the author was surely drunk when he wrote it.this book is a shame to the legacy of the kennedys.there are a few photos.buy abetter book like: rfk and his times...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lives of the REAL Kennedys still make for a great read!","review":"The media is still trying to pull rabbits out of the seawater-soaked hat of an unfortunate, but inconsequential heir. They shouldn't try, because there is still so much to learn about the people who really built the Kennedy mystique. I have a huge Kennedy library, but Mahoney, without pulling punches, shows us completely new sides of these complex political men, including the contradictions. In any case, he gives us one more reason to be sorry for this shabby age of Clintons, Quayles and Bushes. Especially, Robert Kennedy, who sort of was eclipsed by Jack back then, finally gets the thoughtful and detailed portrait he always deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Record!","review":"What a shame! One of the best Australian bands. Animal comes out then they break up.

Standout tracks \\"Want you\\", \\"The time, the place\\", \\"A little closer\\", \\"Not so blue\\". Beautiful songs. World class sounding.Patrick Robertson's voice is superb and extremely mature on this album. I have a huge respect for the band for taking their music to another level. The lyrics are astonishingly deep and emotional.This should have been a massive album for them. I saw the final show in Melbourne, Australia. It was truly great. I recall them filming the show.

Only thing good about it is the colors and the sound quality on my end. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked, but not for long","review":"This headset had fairly good reviews and the technology seemed very innovative. The Noise Shield worked as advertised, nobody ever complained about background noise. However, after only having the headset for about a year and a half the quality and fit both started deteriorating. People often complain about not being able to hear me now, and sometimes the Jawbone just stops working altogether. Also, when new the headset would stay in place fairly well. Now it slides off my jaw (slips down my ear a little) often, which adds to the problem of people not being able to hear me. It is really quite sad that such an expensive headset would start aging in such little time.I've given up on Aliph and their Jawbone and ordered a Plantronics Voyager 510. We'll see if it lasts a little longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good option","review":"Be careful. This product seems to be small, but it isn't.

I bought it to replace my $29.95 Motorola BT headset and have regretted the waste of $90+ ever since. The quality is fine, no better than the much cheaper Moto headset, but the problem is it simply won't stay in my ear. It's wonderful they included several different ear pieces and ear clips, none make much difference as far as fit goes.It's also ridiculously hard to get in your ear and nearly impossible to find the answer button.All in all a dog of a product.

The device connected with no issue to my t-mobile dash and allows full voice activated commands and dialing.Why 4 stars, 1. I do not like the propriety power cable to charge the unit with and the rubber cover that separates from the unit that covers the charging port. I applauded when most devices went to the small USB plug for charging and started to drop theses proprietary plugs thus you could use a generic car charger to charge them. 2nd I still have not found the proper fit it either hurts the back of my ear after a time, or falls out when working, this may be me though because to the benefit of the company they give several wearing options.Overall it works as advertised and the sound is impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I heard better things","review":"I was overall really disappointed in this product from multiple viewpoints.

The problems started with the first call. No matter whom I called, including my own voicemail box, my speech was cluttered and broken up. I reset the headset and even tried deleting it from my phone. So I called Jawbone. It was late evening and I was surprised they even answrered. The tech on the phone made a few suggestions, which I tried that night but still the headset was not working. I called back the next day and they offered to replace the whole thing. I sent it in on Thursday and received my new replacement (including an additonal power cord and ear attachments.)the following Monday. The new one works great. They said its guaranteed for a year regardless of the retailer.Great Customer Service!!! I highly reccommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality is great, build quality is terrible","review":"The sound quality is great. The person on the other end of the phone can't even tell that I'm using a headset. The build quality really sucks though. To charge it, I have to hold it just right when I insert the headset into the charger, otherwise the charger pulls the cover right off and won't let go without a lot of elbow grease.

This was day 1 with the headset.Audio quality is horrible, despite what some reviews might claim. The noise cancellation is ok, but not perfect. The headset feels, looks and performs poorly.

It was like pulling an arm off an android, lotsa wires and stuff you really don't want to see.

Truly bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended - Despite great sound quality, fragile earloops break with alarming regularity","review":"The sound quality is really very good, far better than the Jawbone 2. I did have the ear insert plastic break, requiring glueing. The thing that I despise about this headset is the earloops and how easily they break. You can bend them maybe a dozen times before they fatigue. Aliph has been pretty good about sending out free loops, but I am on my third pair of free ones.

I ran into this problem the very first day I used. :-( The headset is unusable now. The problem is that the end of the headset, where the charger connects, is glued to the rest of the headset. And the glue is not powerful enough to hold on against the pressure of removing the charger. Seems like a usability and/or durability flaw. I hope that the company will return or replace it.

Now I have ordered new gels (for a fraction of the cost of new jawbone earloops), and will replace my new jawbone with the older Plantronics, whose design, size and accessories suddenly look pretty awesome :-)P.S.

Technologically, this unit is almost dangerous -- one time when I pushed the volume button, my phone (Moto Pebl) crashed (I wouldn't have believed it could happen, except I was there). After getting my phone restarted, I packed up the Jawbone, and I'm now looking for another option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, useless implementation","review":"To work properly the Jawbone's sensor must be in constant contact with your cheek. That requires a really good fit. The sensor must also, obviously, be sensitive. Unfortunately, of half a dozen headsets I've used, the Jawbone is the hardest to get even a poor fit--its usual mode is falling out. And, the sensor wore out of a few months of knocking around in pockets, meaning that even if I used one hand to press the headset into (through) my face, it eventually wouldn't even then work--ruining what I first thought was finally, finally, the end of my search for a passable headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable product","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my son.

Here's my overall impressions of it:- Best sound quality for headsets out there, bar none.- Some power pin problems when connector power plug. I've had to get an RMA unit for this reason- I understand why there isnt two power on/off buttons, but I wish there was a volume up/down button. Bluetooth allows my to hide my cell phone in my pocket. The one touch volume adjustment the Jawbone has isnt enough for me, so another small beef.That being said, I'm sure they will continue to improve this product and make it better and then maybe I will give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed. Good technology but horrible fit","review":"I have to admit most of my co-workers like this headset, so I was optimistic when I bought it. I've owned several Bluetooth (2 different Motorolas, 2 different Jabras, and the Treo) and sound quality versus fit often seems to be a tradeoff. Same story here: good sound but bad fit.This does seem to have better sound quality if you place your hand over the headset and hold it into your ear. The headset will stay for a minute or two and then pop out. If I'm driving and put on glasses it will not stay in ear at all.

All attempts to get it working again failed. Just now I opened the next replacement to find it in pieces in the box--the back cover was off and the circuitry was exposed. That couldn't be fixed either. I just got off the phone with a customer service agent in India who issued a refund but could do nothing more. I have owned a half a dozen bluetooth headsets over the past few years and had ordered this one to replace a workhorse Plantronics 510 that finally wore out.

All the problems with Jawbone II exists except that manages a slightly better fit and the buttons are robust enough that you don't hang up on callers inadvertently while adjusting the headset.Still it requires constant adjustment, I have to disable Noise Shield on EVERY call, or people can't here me--no matter what-- and even then people constantly complain to me they cannot hear me even in optimal conditions. I have concluded that this campany can't produce a workable project and can't imagine how they are still in business.Unfortunately i need a headset so I am stuck with this one for now, but will be shopping to replace it in the next few weeks. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Fit Ruins This Product!","review":"The instruction manual says the earbuds should fit 'snugly' in the ear. Ha!!Unlike other bluetooth headsets, this one requires that the vibration sensor rest against your cheekbone. that contact creates a little bit of pressure/leverage that is pulling the bud out of the ear canal. everytime you move your jaw as you talk you're also helping dislodge the earbud. And the earbuds they provide are not the soft silicone kind that fit to the shape of your ear and make a great sound shield. These buds are hard plastic and the shapes not nearly as varied as they need to be in order for you to get a good variety. the tip they attach to also cannot flex. most ear canals do not go into the head at a right angle, so why does jawbone design an earbud that extends at a right angle to the device?! what's so maddening is that it's not that hard to make a good earbud. how they messed this up is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"I drive a drop top and can use the Jawbone with the top down.

Two big flaws from this device. One, the sound quality was so poor that I could not understand the person on the other end. It sounded like a cross between talking in a large, echoing bathroom and a fuzz distortion filter. Two, the mechanical design of the ear loop sucks. It easily breaks and does not flex at all.I had a couple of Motorola headsets which I lost but love the ear loop design for it was made of flexible plastic and I could move and flip it around and not worry about breaking it unlike the Jawbone. What I also loved about the Motorola devices was that I always knew when I turned it on or off from the audio feedback.

I used it for about an hour a day and the battery lasted the whole week. The noise canceling feature is top notch. I have been able to drive in my Jeep Wrangler with most of the soft top removed and still been able to converse fairly easily, something i have never been able to do before. It has some issues when wind is blowing directly across the mic, but I can live with it. While not as comfortable as my Plantronics Discovery 550, the Jawbone is easy to put on (after some practice) and comfortable enough to wear for a few hours in the car with no issues. All in all, the best headset I've ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My husband bought this headset for me at my request for Christmas. I immediately had issues with fit. I tried all the different ear loops and ear buds but couldn't find one that fit well. The ear bud seemed to push the headset away from my face and then it would eventually fall off from the weight of the headset. If the headset isn't resting against your face or \\"jawbone\\", then the person on the other end can't hear your voice very well. I am now looking for a different headset since this one is completely useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no!","review":"I have heard that the Jawbone was good, but in my opinion it was not all that.

They have a very impressive online demo, but it's not really accurate. This is actually the first headset I have had where people kept telling me they couldn't hear because of the wind noise.To top everything off, the ear claps broker while in my pocket. It's really flimsy, which you can probably tell by looking at. Don't let the term \\"Military grade\\" full you. Maybe the French military that never sees any action. Aliph doesn't list a number to call them, so I filled out a contact form about the broken ear clasp, which of course got no response.Don't buy this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise cancellation a no-show","review":"Bought this from amazon after reading all the hype. I had just previously tried the Blueant Z9 and been disappointed (it didn't cancel noise - in fact produced phantom noise of its own to the listener.)I was really hoping the Jawbone would be the killer noise reducing BT headset, but it's not cancelling noise either. And yes - I have the nub touching my cheek. My wife said she could hear all the noise in the background clearly, so I had her use it and sure enough - I could hear everything.Maybe I got a dud, but I'm so weary of trying to find a good noise cancelling BT headset that I'm not in the mood to try a replacement - it's going back pronto.

The improvement in sound quality of this one was immediately noticeable. Both I and the people I was calling could tell a difference and it was plenty loud enough.The one downside was that it took a bit of time to get used to how to clip it on to my ear quickly and easily. After I figured it out, it's the most comfortable headset I've owned. Unfortunately, the removable ear clip has just broken off. They provide four (combination of large/small, left/right), so I can use one of the others until I check with Aliph to get a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"HUGE disappointment.

Re. sound quality, the supposed noise cancellation is a joke. While I can hear everyone fine, most of my friends refuse to speak with me if I am using the headset. Durability also is an issue, in at least two ways. One, the headset comes with different ear clips, which is good because they break. Two, the charger has a nasty habit of pulling part of the headset's covering off when removed.On the positive side, when I contacted the manufacturer they were very good about sending a replacement unit, and even including extra ear clips at no cost.

Sound was very good but the fit was terrible. It actually made my ear ache if I kept it in for too long. After about 3 days, I noticed that the rubber housing around the ear piece was gone and the headset was suddenly a very, very loose fit..as in it would fall off if I tilted my head. I should have known. The rubber earpiece cover fell off the headset when I opened the package. One week in and I unplugged it from the proprietary pinned charger (ya, forget about using the chargers you already have) and the whole thing came apart in my hand. So, now I have a charger with half of the jawbone lodged in it and I'm, once again, looking for a solid, quality Bluetooth headset. Frustrating, to say the least.

Unfortunately it is fairly uncomfortable and very insecure on my ear. Even after trying every combination of ear loop and ear bud I never achieved a secure fit until I tucked the ear loop under the frame of my sunglasses. The ear loop has a spring loaded action that is designed to keep the tip of the headset (where the noise cancellation sensor is) pressed against your cheek. It does this quite well, but at the expense of pulling the earbud away from your ear and letting the headset hang quite perilously from your ear.If you absolutely need a louder headset and need to use it in loud environments and can tolerate a less-than-comfortable device, then I recommend this. Maybe you'll have a better fit exerience than I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent little headset","review":"I bought this as hopefully a better alternative to the Motorola headset.

Now for the function of the device, I have yet to have it work as advertised. Most people on the other end complain that the sound quality is horrible either with or without the sound cancellation.

Just kidding, but seriously, this earpiece sounded okay. the noise reduction was no better than any other noise reduction on a 40 or 50 dolar bluetooth earpiece. At the time I purchased it for around 80 or 90 bucks, I cant remember. The ear loops that hold it on you ear kept breaking and they are expensive in my opinion. You really had to bend them to get a good grip on your ear. This brings me to my next point, when it does fall off, your ear, which it will the ear bud piece comes off alot, so much in fact that I eventually had to use super glue to fix it. All thins considered, these complaints could happen with any other earpiece as well, only thing is other ear pieces are cheaper in price that do these things.

I typically wear the Jawbone for both legs of a 30 minute commute to work and at least half the time the Jawbone begins falling out of my ear requiring constant adjustment.

If its in your pocket, that's a problem.I contacted support twice and they told me to reset and re-pair the units, which I did. No fix. Then they told me it doesn't happen.

For starters it only charges about 1/3 of the time. Even if it charges over night and led changes color to fully charged, you go to use it in the car, and looses charge in about 5 min. Additionally, I find myself holding it in my ear just hear the other person - this with the volume all the way up. Most of the time the person I'm talking to can't hear me. I end up taking it off and just holding the phone up to my ear. REALLY a poorly made device!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jawbone returned within 48 Hours!","review":"I bought theis headset because of other reviews and a recomendation from the salesman that sold me my phone. I have owned more than 6 Bluetooth headsets and this by far has the worst audio quality of any headset I have ever owned. The first call received was while I was at A restaurant in the waiting area with lots of chatter going on between patrons. he caller commented immediatly about the noise and I could barely hear him. I made another call from my vehicle after dining, and the audio quality at the receiver's end was so poor that the person I called asked me to get off the headsset so he could understand me and even with the audio turned all the way up on my Blackberry Pearl, I could barely hear him.This unit is going back to the manufacturer buy one check it out and return it if you agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jawbone relief","review":"I have tried 3 different Bluetooth headsets for my cellphone before finally doing my research and purchasing the Jawbone. My business partner had one, I felt the sound quality was very good so after looking over the reviews, good and bad, I decided to give it a shot.I am quite pleased that I did and am very satisfied. If I had a complaint it would be that the wrap around the ear piece is a bit fragile and I have already broken one. It's good that they give you an assortment of them with the purchase, my partner has had his for over 6 months and is on his last one that came with the headset.I'm sure that there will be a better Bluetooth device someday, but for now, this is the best I've used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I had the Jawbone for a week before returning it. Despite good sound quality, the unit had very limited range and was extremely uncomfortable despite a myriad of ear pieces and hooks. Likewise, the buttons, which are hidden, aren't the easiest to use and when taken with the poor fit and range make me wonder if there's something better at the price-point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, Poor Fit, and Cheaply-Made","review":"The title says it all. Part of the housing fell off after just a few days. I am very easy on my things, so this is bad design or manufacturing (or cheap materials). It was hard to figure out which earpiece was the best. Operation of controls is okay, but not as responsive as other Bluetooth headsets. It's nice-looking and the noise reduction is a good idea, but it is overpriced and poorly executed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of tolerable","review":"I'm returning the Jawbone after one day of torturous use. I liked the design and snug, comfortable fit. Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call. I used it with the LGVX8300. I have tried and owned many bluetooth headsets (Motorola, LG, NxZen, and Jabra) and the Jawbone was rates at the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"My vote: thumbs up","review":"There seem to be polar opposite reviews on this product. It works extremely well for me. It performs as advertized and fits pretty well. My only minor issues are that the fit could be a little better (though it is fine as it is) and the buttons are indeed a bit stiff, though not unreasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad fit, worse noise reduction","review":"Not a good headset. I bought it with high hopes based on what they advertise on their website. They show a weedwacker right behind the guy on the phone. I use it in both modes and people can hear every sound in the background. My Plantronics Bluetooth was much better than this. I can't believe I paid so much for it. Jawbone must have recognized the issue too since they say their new model is better at reducing background noise. Wouldn't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"I've had the device for several weeks now. It's not exactly easy to operate. There are two buttons under one piece of plastic, and it's hard to press either of them specifically, or know which one you press, especially while wearing the device. People on the other end of the line haven't been able to detect any difference in background noise between just using the phone and using the Jawbone."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bluetooth ever!","review":"This bluetooth is so amazing that my father and my boyfriend both bought the same one once I had mine. I can talk on this in my living room with my phone in my purse in my bedroom and its still crystal clear. I can answer the phone in my car without having to turn the volume down on my stereo and all the caller will hear is my voice. People say they can hear me better when Im using this than when Im just talking into the phone. this is by far the BEST bluetooth around. Just watch the videos about it on the web. They are very accurate portrayals of the Jawbone."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO REPAIR AVAILABLE OUT OF WARRANTY","review":"NO OUT-OF-WARRANTY REPAIR AVAILABLE FOR JAWBONE. Because of the expense of this item, you would think a repair center for out-of-warranty repair would exist. My jawbone fell into water which nullifies the warranty. Requesting help through customer support repeatedly referred me to the warranty policy (which is not a help) and finally to the fact that no out-of-warranty repair exists. I liked the Jawbone's noise canceling feature, which outweighed the difficulty with fitting, the small plastic part which was lost with 24 hours and the difficulty removing from the charger. If I had realized that it could never be repaired past the 1-yr warranty, I would not have purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality, poor design. Peformance ok (I think)","review":"After a few weeks, the back of the device broke off in the charge, exposing the circuit board and preventing from charging. I super glued it back on and covered the glue mess with black marker.I ran into someone at work and asked him about his. Sure enough, he had the exact same problem (even used a marker to cover the glue marks).The other day, I drop it on the ground (not an uncommon occurrence for bluetooth headsets) and the metal ear loop snap off!This thing is a piece of junk. Even if it never broke, it's difficult to carry in a pocket due to the big ear loop. Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Level","review":"I spent many hours researching the latest and greatest of blue tooth headsets and chose this one based on perceived quality. Price was not a big issue. It is very lightweight which was great. Easy to use as well. The biggest problem was the sound level. You can hear the caller if you are in a quiet place. However, as soon as the level of noise increased in the area you are calling it becomes very difficult to hear. I think the problem is the ear piece. It does not go into the ear, but rather sits on the outside. I have a Plantronics 510 and it worked with my older phone very well. it has an earpiece that goes into the ear and you can set the volume much higher. I only switched because I was getting a lot of static in the headset with the new phone (3G technology may be the issue...I dont know). I would not recommend this headset to anyone working in a potentially noisy environement (driving with the windows open, walking outside, etc)"},{"rating":"1","title":"earloops","review":"how could a company put so much quality in the electronics and then put mickey mouse earloops with it?

My Motorola H850 is ready to give up the ghost and I was ready for a headset with a little higher audio quality. One that I could actually use while driving. I was a little worried about the previous reviews on the way the Jawbone fit your ear but I thought I would give it a try just the same. I purchased the unit and took it out to my car in the parking lot. I spent an hour trying to get this thing to stay on or in my ear. After trying every possible combination of ear buds and ear hooks, I packed everything back up and went back into the store and returned it. I could not get it to fit at all, it seemed cheap and flimsy and definitely not worth the 129.00 price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, could have a tighter fit","review":"I have been using the Jawbone for several weeks now and love it. The sound quality is fantastic, most people can't tell I'm on my cell phone.

Also, even with the phone volume cranked up and the volume on the bluetooth, the volume was soft and it was difficult to hear.Overall, I was Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but a little quirky at first","review":"Generally, it's a great product. The call quality is very good on both ends of the conversation. I've had only minor concerns such as: getting the device on my ear quickly (it takes getting used to); I wish it could be used while it's charging. But, I'd highly recommend it despite these minor issues. It has a good range with my phone (an older Nokia 6255i)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complaints when ever used!","review":"Sorry to say, I thought I was getting the Cadillac of a Blue Tooth, and it turns out to be a lemon. Everyone complains that they either get an echo or feedback, they can never hear me clearly - - that I sound muffled or distant, to the point that it's not even worth the bother to turn it on. I have to be sitting in one spot, holding the phone up to my mouth, or all I get is complaints from everyone. And blue tooth to blue tooth, forget it! Reception is terrible. Also, I have the same problem as others - the Jawbone falls out of your ear and moves around. Then everyone says \\"you keep fading in and out . . . what's wrong with your phone?\\" I waited to buy my 3rd Blue Tooth thinking that the industry has had enough time to perfect the product. Since I drive alot for my job and need a \\"hands free\\" device, I will go back to the old fashioned headset that no one could ever tell the difference whether I was hands free or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product but over-hyped","review":"I purchased the Jawbone to replace a couple of older Motorola headsets for a Moto phone. I thought the headset might perform better in a noisy environment like being in my moving convertible. It does a better job but only for noise that has a steady pattern, like the lawn mower in Aliph's videos. If you are listening to your radio and a loud song is playing, the Jawbone is only a little better than the others. Other reviewers complain about how it fits the ear and the \\"tinny\\" sound...all true. What I found is that my phone has a harder time understanding my voice commands with the Jawbone than with the Motorola headset or any other Bluetooth headset for that matter. I might be too fussy, but for 2 times the price of a comparable headset I'd at least like to to perform as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jawbone bluetooth","review":"I am dissatisfied with this product because of the flimsy ear gripper. This metallic? curved piece that fits over the ear does not hold the device tight enough next to the ear. The noise reduction technology seems to work but there is a clipped sound at the beginning of each new sound that it encounters. So if there are many new sounds that it encounters, the person that you are talking to will hear many clipped sounds.

I am extremely disappointed in this headset and I am returning it tomorrow. Not only is it uncomfortable to wear, but almost any movement of my head causes it to slide out of my ear and hang by the hook. I tried multiple combinations of the different earpieces and hooks that it comes with and none of them worked. Fancy noise-canceling and sound quality are useless when the headset wont stay in the ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"it broke a week after using it.","review":"I had to contact the company about it. IT broke the ear piece from the base a week after getting it. Upon calling the company I was informed that this product is no longer being made and that it is only in red and silver now.

I still do not have the earpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Came with three left ear hooks (two 'standard' length and one 'long' version) and only one 'long' right ear version, but the 'long' right ear version didn't fit.

Well after over a year of use, it doesn't work as advertised. It doesn't cancel out any noise and people I'm talking to can't hear me that well.The earloops are pure junk. I broke all that came with the set. Now I can't even buy replacements unless I buy direct from China. They break so easily even after I learned the proper way to put it on and take it off my ear.I wish I could return it, but after such a long time, I don't think I can.It seems that nobody can make a good noise cancelling bluetooth that fits my needs. I can't use the headphone type like my truck driver friends use since they are too large and in my opinion, in the way. Besides they cost two to three times more.The hunt goes on for the ideal bluetooth. I doubt I will ever find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get a good fit","review":"The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover, they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside, the acoustics seemed decent, but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headset for noise reduction...","review":"I bought the first Jawbone for my wife. Her mother always had difficulty hearing her on a cell phone. We no longer have a land line so cellular calls are the only way we keep in touch.This headset made the call home a much more pleasurable experience for both her and her mom.The second one was for me. When I saw how well her Jawbone worked, she bought me one as a present for my birthday.It works well for driving even with the stereo on or the window down. The max noise reduction setting tends to cause an echo at the other end. This can be a source of frustration for the party on the other end.Other than that, we love our Jawbones and recommend them to anyone that uses a wireless headset in a noisy environment.

Acceptable but mid-tier BT at best","review":"I bought the Jawbone a couple months ago with great anticipation, after reading all the hype about military grade noise reduction. So far, I am disappointed. Battery life is so-so. Odd choice of proprietary battery charger connector. But the biggest issue is the sound quality, on both ends. My trusty old Plantronics 510 may not be as pretty, but the sound quality, battery life, etc. is wayyyyy better than the Jawbone. I just picked up the new Plantronics 520, and it too is a far better alternative vs. the Jawbone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"The charger cable wouldn't stay put right out of the box .. it kept popping out of the end of the unit. I have to wrap an elastic band around it to keep it in place. I filled in the on-line request for customer service 3 times before finally getting a response. They promised to send me a new charger 4 weeks ago, and it still hasn't arrived (I'm sure it never will). At one week old, the earpiece totally detached from the unit ... so I glued it back on. Given the lousy construction and quality control, as well as the horrid customer support ... I would NEVER buy anything from this company again.Lastly .. the unit is very tinny sounding compared to the dozen or so BT units I've used over the years. Since I rarely talk on the phone while using a chainsaw or leaf blower, I care what the unit sounds like on MY end as well as the other party."},{"rating":"1","title":"caviar price, tin-can sound","review":"I had no problem getting this to fit correctly and my hopes were high because of the buzz surrounding the product. I had it all ready, paired, etc. Then I called my voicemail and I could feel the disappointment hit me. This has to have the tinniest sound I have ever heard. I have a $20 Jabra that sounds better than the jawbone. Such a shame that this is not ready for prime time (at least as far as this model is concerned)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I got this based on great reviews, and having had poor feedback from a Motorola 850 I had. I wanted to just go for \\"the best\\". Well, it looks great, but doesn't work at all if there is the slightest wind or breeze. People just can't hear me real well. The earpiece never seems to feel the same way twice, or even at best, never feels like it's on securely. The sound on my end is not that great, either, though I'm willing to trade that off if my caller says it sounds ok. Which they do. If you're in a quiet space, or in your car, they say they don't hear background noise. And, finally the fragile nature of it means it not easy to just put in your pocket or whatever if you take it off. You really have to either \\"place it\\" or put it someplace where it won't get crushed. It could be a little hardier, and the earpiece a little more positive, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and useless","review":"Since it was the most expensive headset available, I thought, OK, this is going to be good. The sales person assured me that it was the best of the best.Ouch! The noise cancellation system is actually really good, but everything else can be trashed. The piece is heavy, feels like junk, keeps on falling and hard to keep on your hear for extended period of time. The sound is just OK, not phenomenal. There are a few features that I liked such as the automatic volume adjustment, the army graded noise cancellation, but I still returned mine 10 days after purchase.I bought the new Plantronics and I am a lot happier, although not completely wowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW not in a good way","review":"Well I like many have owned many different headsets. The noise canceling on this one works for me just like advertised, I turned on a shop vac for a test called my wife tried it with the noise canceling on and off. She could not believe the difference could hardly hear the vac at all. Now as far as the fit this has to be one of the most uncomfortable headsets I have ever owned. I drive a diesel pickup and can not hear because the dang thing will not stay in my ear. Kind of defeats the purpose to hold it in place might as well just use the phone. The charging plug that fits on the headset is really snug and is hard to remove. I can see after a few months of using it something is going to give.The phone store I bought it at said they have never had any returned well they are about to; I am waiting for my Plantronics 510 to arrive today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jawbone Bluetoooth","review":"This product works ok in quiet environments but I can't recommend it for use in loud ones.

I have not had any complaints about not being able to hear me where I did with my other bluetooths. The only thing I would suggest to make it better is you can't tell if the noise sheild is on or off, everything sounds the same to you, you have to wait till some one ask what is the noise in the back ground.

Otherwise it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the technology and painful to wear","review":"Well there are several problems with this devise. One is that it is usually too loud and intense in your ear, it really hurts your ear after awhile and you can't turn the volume down. Plus I have experienced the volume automatically adjusting if the other person is quiet on the other end for a minute and then when they talk, its blaringly loud. The other is that when I used it on a road trip from Houston to Dallas, the entire right side of my face hurt the next day. It was too much. Its ok for short bursts of use, but if you plan on talking more than an hour forget it. Not for people with sensitive ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - HORRIBLE","review":"After hearing about the product's noise-canceling ability and supposed superb reviews, I decided to give this a shot when it went on sale at a nearby retail store. Looking back, it is one day that I wish I hadn't seen the sales flier.Even if you forgive the poor fit, which I was sort of able to get used to, there is no excuse for paying $100 for a bluetooth device with poor sound qualities. In addition to people telling me that my voice would start strong and fade away, people also constantly told me that they could hear their own voices repeating back to them. Needless to say, this thing is heading back to the store - military technology or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fit","review":"I have heard many positive reviews of this headset so I was very excited when I finally got a phone with bluetooth. Their main claim to fame is their sound quality and it kind of lives up to that expectation. The one thing where it falls extremely short is in the fit. No matter what I do this headset always feels like it's going to fall off of my ear. I can't seem to get a snug fit and because of this not only is it uncomfortable but it also effects the noise cancellation feature. I wish I would have returned this headset when i had the chance but now it sits mostly unused until I forget just how annoying it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best out there, but no replacement earloops available","review":"No complaints about the earpiece, I've bought several for my company.

No wonder armies shoot themselves in the foot.And no, despite the changeable earbuds, neither of us have been able to get a comfortable fit.

I find it difficult to put on my ear and uncomfortable to wear after a few hours. I do not understand the differences between the different ear hoops. It could use a sound director in the ear. I think it needs something that pushes the sound into the ear instead of just to the entry to the ear canal. The reason for this is the reduced volume of the phone instructions as compared to conversation and the difficulty to hear conversation in a noisy atmosphere which the devise was marketed for. It does meet 80% of my expectations of use in the outdoors but I would not buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"This is by far the best bluetooth headset I have owned. The people I talk to can't even tell I'm on a headset. But the whole \\"they can only hear me\\" is not true they can hear everything and the noise shield doesn't block much.

But I would recommend this bluetooth headset just don't expect to block all background noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening at best","review":"Could not resist the great price, but that is the only upside so far. In use the volume is never loud enough for noisy environments. The headset is constantly being dropped from the handset making it impossible to know whether to answer a call from the headset or the handset. After multiple emails to Aliph they finally admit that it is a know problem on some handsets and there are no plans to resolve it. I am the proud owner of a shiny new pile of e-waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aliph Jawbone Not a Good Option","review":"I bought the Aliph Jaywone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset, because on all the stores and reviews told it was the best.Sound quality sucks and if you are in a place where there is a lot of people, like and airport or office, you won't be able to hear anything.I regret I spent money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bluetooth Device (CA)","review":"In a nut shell: great bluetooth device, got one for my wife and my dad so we would have no excuse of poor hearing! Also my wife and I live in California and since the hands free law kicked in July, we've had nothing but success with Jawbone and it's noise shield feature. Only drawback would be the obvious where the wind blows and they'll ask you, \\"is it windy where you at?\\" and sometimes the range from your bluetooth to your cell phone will at times create a staticky sound. That's it. Otherwise I have advised my friends about this bluetooth being the best of the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and clunky","review":"The only good thing about this headset is the the presentation and advertisement. Although the sound quality is okay it is not as good as advertised.This headset is heavy, clunky and cheaply made. The ear loop is uncomfortable and hard to put on.

The ear loop is painful after awhile and then it breaks. None of the ear buds ever truly fit to my ear so I ended up holding the jawbone to my ear with my hand 80% of the time. I had to buy a whole kit just to get the new ear loop. Now I've just stopped wearing it. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend the Jawbone","review":"Nothing will ever be as good as actually having your cell phone at your ear, but I think the Jawbone has been the best of 3 headsets that I've owned in the past.

Cheaply made. No one could understand me. Incoming audio was difficult to understand. It kept beeping several different patterns every 20 to 30 seconds. Customer service had no idea what this was, why it was doing it or how to stop it. Although they send several different sizes of earplugs and ear holders, I couldn't find one that was comfortable or that would stay on my ear. This was the 4th or 5th headset I have tried and I just about gave up until I ran across the Motorola H710. It does it all well and I don't even know I'm wearing it. Sorry Jawbone. I just don't understand all of the glowing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jawbone Classic","review":"This is my third Jawbone - the first one did not work consistently and the second one I ran over with my car - it was working okay when it met its untimely demise. My current Jawbone has been inconsistent from the moment I got it - I can always hear the other party, but frequently they cannot hear me.

The electronics are all good but I cannot wear it for more than 1 hour a day.

They will keep your money and refuse to refund, I know this from experience...welcome to China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect Bluetooth Headset!","review":"This is the clearest sounding Bluetooth set that I've ever used. The people you're talking to wouldn't even know that you're on a Bluetooth Headset due to the excellent noise cancellation. The only downside is that the ear pieces don't fit my ear, despite all of the choices. Although this model is bigger than the new one, it's worth the lower price if you can look past the ear pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!","review":"Horrible.....Cheaply made.

There are similar cages that are $200 cheaper but this one is well-engineered, expandable, compact (low ceiling clearance), built like a tank (in china, unfortunately but it is high quality except for a couple plastic pieces). Quick disconnect helps you set up exercises quickly. Lift heavy without a partner! It can wobble a little bit but I trust it--built like a tank. Expandable lat/row is great, buying the cable crossover next. High end home gym/low end commercial.

Why Maria McKee and Lone Justice weren't superstars I'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think Back...Look forward-LONE JUSTICE stands up!","review":"This Cd was in 1985 the most powerful new band I had heard in the mid-80's. A period I consider very dry for real melody, voice and twang without Synths. Even my favorites, Dylan, Petty,and Springsteen to name a few. Were in a place of over production. This is the only really great Lone Justice release. Short lived in their originality, LONE JUSTICE the band and Disc were one of the best soon to be titled, Alt-Country items around. Los Lobos'\\"By the Light of The Moon\\" runs a close second but the fact that Maria McKee was so young (19) and this band was so raw and real, and just as good in concert. Made them a hopeful antithesis to the digital soundscape that was saturating radio at the time. I think this is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely great book","review":"I have owned an original copy of this book for years. It onced belonged to my great-grandfather.

In this case I couldn't bring myself to do that to anyone. The paper content is best off recycled in someone's paperstone counter top or as bedding for horses. I found it insulting at best and self-contradictory at worst. Its cult-like rhetoric makes it fairly obvious why this book is the foundation for organizations like Brahma Kumaris. Avoid.

There are many graphs to visually explain the patterns described and not too many difficult, complex formulas (only the necessary ones)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost","review":"This is almost a very good performance. Overall, the orchestra plays well. Overall, the direction is good. In general, it is a good European rendition. But... at times the horns drown out the crucial woodwinds. At times, the pacing is just too slow. At times there is just not enough \\"Uumph!\\" But I want to give Haitink an \\"A\\" for effort, because he is very close to having a very good performance.

He picked up these gator-picks and said that when your hands sweat, these little guys stick. So I bought them and gave it a solid try.I used it for about a half hour but never got a good grip.

It basically serves as a promotional tool for Dennis Overstreet and his Beverly Hills wine store (as well as his wine tasting buddies). It offers few areas of sound practical advice, substituting help with sales pitches and explanations why his wine store is the best. If you are looking for real wine help, the best book of all time is \\"Wine for Dummies\\" - it may sound silly, but this book covers all areas and is truly the best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow-up","review":"Great book & a continuation of the story begun in The Snow Queen.This is a character-driven book with not a lot of action. If you're looking for space adventure - look elsewhere. Having said that, the last third of this book is so suspenseful that I almost missed my stop because I was reading it on BART & got engrossed.Lots of levels and lots of layers. Ms. Vinge really loves her story and her characters and obviously had a great deal of fun creating all the different worlds and political wheels upon wheels. It was fun to visit other worlds and see what else was out there in her universe, but I think I loved most of all the bits and pieces of the people of Tiamat roaming around their planet amidst the Hegemony's rubble.Interesting, engrossing, and emotionally engaging - this whole series is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: boring","review":"Snow Queen was magnificent!Tangle Up in Blue was a solid sequel.The Summer Queen falls flat.It is long, slow, dull, uninspired, and seemingly directionless with well-known characters who no longer evoke empathy in the reader. Skip it unless you need a doorstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing characters, unpolished storyline","review":"Joan Vinge developes characters like none other, by the end of the book you are left with a \\"leaving camp\\" feeling...like you just spent a week at camp making new friends and now it's time to go. Sure other books develope one or two, but Joan has nearly a dozen going by the end that are all wonderfully done.Which has it's drawbacks, you get the feeling thoughout the read that Arienrhod is constantly being dwelled upon, and much of the 600+ pages are spent backtracking on character developments. This detracts from what could have been one of the better storylines in sci-fi, I wanted to hear more about the Sibyl net and the mers. I feel perhaps a character could have been cut, or a development cut to make way for this.At any rate, if you liked the Snow Queen then you need to be reading this, however don't expect to finish with a pleasent feeling. There are some slow parts in the beggining and middle, but once you hit the home stretch it can't be put down :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful long-awaited sequel to The Snow Queen","review":"We finally return to the incredibly complex universe and world of Tiamat. After reading The Snow Queen many years before, I was thrilled to see that Vinge had finally written a sequel. Vinge weaves a marvelously complex tapestry in this mammoth novel. The new Summer Queen must hold off the galactic powers who want to exploit her world, specifically the mers, whose blood has life-lengthening properties. What these same galactic powers don't realize is that the mers hold the key to the sibyl network on which much of Galactic civilization is founded. Destroy one and you destroy the other. A magnificent read. The publisher was incredibly foolish to allow it to go out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable Voice","review":"I have bought other meditation CDs over the years but this one is in a class by itself.

But now I find myself taking the time each day, even if just for a few minutes, using the exercises and suggestions Ms. Lang puts forward to great advantage. Creating a space. Sitting comfortably. Quieting the mind. It's so brilliantly simple that if you just skim through it you will miss the point.It's not about becoming great deep meditators.

The end result ...an excellent level of picture quality the Kodak will never attain. The features are comparable to that of Nikon and Canon at a fraction of the cost.

However, recently the camera stopped recognizing the battery. Sent it to Pentax who can repair it (new circuit board) for $250, which in my view is not worth it.

My dad left me a number of \\"K-mount compatible\\" lenses that were sears branded. Not only would none of them work on this camera one of them actually got stuck on the body of the camera and will not come off.

Mr.Merril may have some different views then others when it comes to indexing and foreign investing but explains his views honestly.This is a great book and I don\`t know why since it\`s published over a year ago that no one has reviewed it.This is a book that should be updated every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding sauce","review":"I started buying this sauce when they were selling at the craft fairs many, many years ago.

Her name was Tarnowski, and obviously had Slavic origins. Her husband, a Proesch from Mecklenburg, was a descendant of the Slavic Abotrite tribes (ca. 800). They both considered themselves German. This book explained to me the ethic confusion of areas like Poland/Prussia. It also highlighted a fact that history has witnessed with Poland: You can wipe it off the map politically, but a Polish/Prussian sensibility will remain. What can this mean for the future? I believe Prussia is, indeed, not dead. Also, that WWIII is not neccesarily the inevitible result of such a conflict. Is the extinction of Prussia another Versailles-like offense to the German people, or can accommodation be made to deflate this \\"ethnic\\" horror? I welcome response."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I've read in a long time!!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book, expecting much more after reading the glowing reviews written by other readers (you actually liked this drivel??!!). I did not find it funny, nor did I think it accurately portrayed motherhood. For one thing, I could never figure out how old the main character's daughter was supposed to be...one minute she was 6 months old, the next she's eating raw carrots and walking! What gives?! And, while I understand this is supposed to be a work of fiction, I thought the characters were all too odd and fantastical for anyone living in the real world to relate to. Who actually acts like these people or does the things they do? Nobody that I've ever met!

(I mean, mom)","review":"It took me a couple of chapters to get into this book, but by chapter three I was hooked and loving every minute of it. Karen Karbo weaves a hilarious and sometimes bittersweet and melancholy tale about motherhood, and the dynamics between men and women. She has got a rare ability with the turn of a phrase. Her characters were rich, and her plot was full - everything I appreciate in a novel that also provided smart humor and wise observations. I am looking forward to more Karen Karbo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous light tale that is laugh out loud witty","review":"A great read if you are looking for something light to read.

I am happy that Moyer Bell is reprinting them regularly - I believe one is due this spring. I don't like the Carroll & Graff reprints either because the typeset is so sloppy and blurred, it is annoying.I have always thought that Thirkell's books are great books to read on the beach, in the plane or on other occasions when you want something entertaining, light and funny. If you can't stand the silly inanity of authors like Danielle Steele, Rosamund Pilcher or Mary Higgins Clark but you want something light and entertaining to read, Thirkell is your man. (Or woman, I should say.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carroll Graff print quality is very poor.","review":"I first read Ms. Thirkell's novels in the late 70s, and was immediately entranced. It is all the more disappointing, therefore, to see these terrible Carroll Graff reprints. The type is blurred and illegible, and the whole book quality is offputting to the reader. In comparison to the Moyer Bell reprints, which, while they have an awful lot of typographical errors, are well produced paperbacks, these Carroll Graff reprints are unacceptably bad. I can't believe that the editors thought they could get away with such poor quality for readers of Thirkell, who are likely, I suspect, to be rather discriminating consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This towel is horrible and don't waste your money.

I have a rather large melon as it is and these suckers were so wide they almost appeared to be defective. However, many many reviews have confirmed my thoughts. The entire top 1/4 diameter were gaping off of my ears and head. Why they would make these without adjustments is what I couldn't wrap my head around, literally. I love the concept but they just don't cut mustard. I highly recommend trying to find a place where you can demo these before you purchase. Fees to return them are just not worth the gamble.

I'm not enough of an audio expert to give a definitive judgment on the sound. Unfortunately, they fit so poorly I find them unusable, and plan to return them. Like about 10% of the other reviewers, they're too big for me. There's NO adjustment. Unless you have a head like a Pumpkin, forget it. There's a mechanism of levers and springs that is intended to auto-adjust these, I think variations in the spring tension account for some of these fitting better than others, but that is pure speculation. Although very similar in appearance, the closed-backAudio Technica ATH-A700 Headphonesdon't seem get the complaints about ill-fit that these do. They might be a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not regret it","review":"I have Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 for about a month and quite happy with its sound quality. But it is not worth to have it with mp3 player or PCwith cheap soundcard, they will not make wonders with bad sound source.With decent CD player (I tested and use them with JVC and Sony DVD playersamplified by Kenwood or Sony stereo receivers) good quality CD's sound great, just as they should: close to a quite good speaker system. With better source the result could possibly be even better. Overall, very good cans, worth the money. They sound better than Bose Triport, though heavier. They are pretty comfortable (though not extremely light and quite large). They are not adjustable, which is an only drawback I see). So, I would rate them by 4+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely large...","review":"I purchased these headphones around Feb. of 2007. I would rate them much higher, except I really didn't get to use them very much due to their extreme size. I'm not certain if I received a defective pair, but when I opened the product and attempted to put them on my head, they were SO big that they fell off my head every time I would put them on. Since there is no manual adjustment to make the headphones fit snug to your head, they don't fit comfortably at all.The sound quality on the headphones is excellent, but the headphones themselves are poorly designed. If you like comfort, don't buy these headphones. They're NOT comfortable due to the size.However, if you're a teenager and you like listening to music with a friend while both of you have your heads side-by-side, the headphones are plenty large enough to accomidate you.

They did require a couple of weeks of daily playing, about 80 hours, to break in and get a full bass response. I listen to jazz, classical, and rock, and I have only praise for the sound accuracy, presence, soundstage - these are very high quality headphones. Bass is tight and present, and not over-abundant. My head is small, but moving the \\"wings\\" toward my forehead rather than directly on top of my head, created a comfortable and solid fit - I routinely wear them 6 to 8 hours per day while working. I listen to apple lossless files on my ipod, with a low-cost headphone amp from headroom, and the music reproduction is superb.

I wear about a 7 5/8\\" hat and these headphones fit me very well without any clamping or discomfort. There is also plenty of distance vertically (between the top of head and ears). The sound quality is also very very good. I am not an audiophile but these headphones have made me realize what I've been missing out on. Music is crystal clear, games sound amazing. I have read that the bass could use a little boost, and I agree, as they are not bass heavy headphones. It's fine with me though, because I mostly listen to heavy metal. Finally, the cord is thick and very long, and the connectors are high quality. I would highly recommend these headphones, especially for people with a large head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a really Big Head for these things.","review":"I purchased these headphones because they looked like they were built pretty good and because they were fairly cheap.

I was also persuaded by the 4 star rating, my mistake, I should have read the 1 star reviews and that might have changed my mind.

I use headphones exclusively on the PC for gaming and movies. These things have no bass, they sound small, like everything is far away and if you lean in any direction they'll fall off your head (and I have a big head). I want to feel like I'm in the action and be immersed by sound and explosions! If that's what you want too, look elsewhere. If you like to sit around and listen to classic music and hear every note, then by all means these might be the right ones for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really a AD700?","review":"I have a set of the A700 that are not open air, and thought it would be nice to reduce a bit of the pressure on the ears with these open ear ones. I can't believe these are actually considered the same model headphones. The sound is significantly better on the A700 when compared to the AD700. You will also notice that these to not pivot to fit your head as the A700 do. This causes them to feel like they are going to fall off my head when ever I move, unlike my other pair. Additionally the base response on these is non-existent compared to the A700. Even at moderate levels anyone else in the room will be able to hear what you are listening to. Over all these feel like a less responsive, sloppy fitting version of the A700. If you can handle them not being open air spend a little more and get a great value in the A700.

What I did was fold a towel in fourths and put between the cups so they would not get damaged. Then I bent the top wire inward so the cups fit flush to my head.

The bass is fine with me as its presenceis part of a perfect tonal balance. However, I take one star off because of their size (no doubt a necessary evilresulting in their superior sound) which is rather cumbersome (especially when lying down and using a pillow)and their construction which is prone to emitting slightly audible squeaks and groans (keep your head asimmobile as possible). Well worth living with those slight drawbacks in return for marvelous sound andaffordability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy headset!","review":"My friends recommended this headset to me and it is great!

Its designed to be comfortable and it does the job really well: I can't tell I have such massive over the ear headphones on. Most such headphones place all the weight on the top of your head and squeeze themselves over your ears causing discomfort. These headphones are very lite and distribute the weight evenly over your head so there is no pressure.

But other than that, they are laughably unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headphones, poor durability","review":"I've had my pair for about a month and half now, and found them to be incredibly comfortable with good sound quality. Unfortunately, the left speak came loose before the 8-week mark. These headphones are only used at a digital audio workstation and have been either in use by me sitting in a chair or resting on a desktop for their entire usage time. I have never dropped them, stood up and walked away while the phones are plugged in or any of the other common abuses of this kind of gear, so I have no explanation for their short healthy lifespan. If I send them back, I run the risk of AT not repairing them and I have to pay for shipping. So basically, I'm having a tech run a diagnostic for $25, and if the repair can't be made for $25, I'm going to buy a new pair of Sennheisers.

Since ankle weights rub on the tops of shoes and the fabric is worn down from the inside by the grittin contents [without an inner liner], the short life is almost inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesser, indeed!","review":"How someone can refer to Rape of Lucretia and Turn of the Screw (or Midsummer Night's Dream, for that matter, my personal favorite among his many operas) as lesser works of Britten's is beyond me. I guess it is just a matter of taste, but especially in these performances, those who truly love Britten could hardly do wrong. Libretti lacking, but don't let that stop you. You never know when these will go out of print again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information as always","review":"I just finished reading Small Circulation by Jwing-Ming Yang and I've been implementing the energy practices in it. It hasn't involved changing much that I hadn't already learned from Mantak Chia's work on the Microcosmic orbit. If anything, it's provided more of a concrete explanation of the energetic mechanics involved with internal energy work.What I find useful about his writing is just how much work he's done to translate documents and explain the processes described in those documents. The illustrations and instructions are straightforward and very helpful in learning how to work with the qi/chi of the body. Overall, I recommend reading this book as it will provide a thorough grounding in energy work techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless beating around the bush","review":"Probably author have much knowledge and experience but I do not understand why he spent zillions of words and endless (non consistent) repeating ... just to describe the crucial technique in practically few last pages of the book. Like he wanted to amaze somebody with the length of his book. I must proudly congratulate myself and anybody else who managed to read it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but tends to overheat paper","review":"This is generally not a bad printer however it does tend to overheat paper so that it comes out curly, which is very annoying if you print large documents or want to print high quality.The support desk said to resolve this by setting the paper type to 'transparency' for normal paper printing which indicates that this is a typical problem. It also doesnt solve it. Overall Im not very impressed with either printer or support and wouldnt get another Brother printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother Printer Nightmere","review":"Our company recently bought a refurbished Brother HL-5050 laser printer. After minimum use for only 30 days, the printer now jams constantly when we use the front loader paper extension! We were forced to buy this model printer because it was the only one certified to work with our Software on the Windows 7 platform with a 64 bit processor. We have always bought HP printers and aftwer this we will never by another Brother Printer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Vibrant","review":"This is the second Lansdale novel I've read, after the uproarious \\"Drive-In\\" which I highly recommend. Comparisons to Harper Lee notwithstanding, The Bottoms is a gripping, vibrant story of one child's journey from the world of innocence to experience through a gauntlet of racism and murder. By turns chilling, uplifting, horrifying and, finally, bittersweet, Mr. Lansdale has fashioned an excellent and moving novel. The language is colorful and assured; the setting evocative and rich. But best of all are the characters, especially Miss Maggie and Mose, who will stay with you long after you've closed this book for the last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC READ!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was great. The writing was a bit choppy (4 stars because I think this book, if not the author, could use a good editor), but maybe my version was different. I read it on an eBook.Still, as another reviewer said, the descriptions made it like I was THERE. It helps that I'm from East Texas, and I'm familiar with the Sabine River and surrounding.I FELT for the characters in this book, and it was MUCH more than just a story. It was a telling of a life, and I just wanted it to go on. I didn't want the book to end. The updates at the end were a nice touch, though.All in all, a DELICIOUS story; one DEFINITELY worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottoms is the Tops","review":"Easily one of the best book's that I have ever read. The characters are simple yet very interesting. The story hits the ground running and does not stop until the last page. A trip back into the past that erases whatever rose colored misconceptions that we may have about the past reminding us that the \\"good ole' day's\\" weren't really that good. A must read for any fan of fiction, and a great introduction to those that are unfamiliar with Joe R. Lansdale."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good starter novel if you don't know Joe","review":"This is one of those books that I lend out to people if they have never heard of an author.(yes I actually have the books returned to me) the overall story is excellent, the characters are well defined and the whole thing moves along at a nice pace. It is nice to read a detective book where all the characters are neither handsome or wealthy but have to deal with crappy day to day things like everyone else. Give it a read. If you like this move onto his Hap & Leonard series which are a hoot. Those I don't lend out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age, Lansdale style","review":"It seems like many authors that write a bunch of books end up doing a coming of age book at some point. The Bottoms is Lansdale's coming of age book. And in typical fashion for Lansdale he does it in his own way.The story follows Harry Crane, a young boy who discovers a dead body in a river. Harry's father, the local constable, starts an investigation that proceeds to change Harry's life and viewpoint of life.As with most of Lansdale's books, this one is ripe with vivid images, rich characters, unexpected violence and the unique southern charm that makes Lansdale's book his own. As a period book set during the Great Depression, it carries across a lifestyle that is hard to believe. Hard because the descriptions are so real that it is impossible to not see or imagine them, especially when compared to the modern conveniences that we have now. As is usual, I can highly recommend this book for everyone to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Contemporary Detective Novels","review":"Joe Lansdale is usually funny in his books. Not in \\"The Bottoms.\\" If you have only read \\"Mucho Mojo\\" or \\"The Drive-In\\" stories, you might not be ready for \\"The Bottoms.\\" There's a procedural nature to it reminiscent of his first book, \\"Act of Love,\\" but that's a much more straight-forward piece of fiction. \\"The Bottoms\\" is a deep, rich, thoughtful story of Depression-era Texas that happens to include the investigation of a grisly murder. \\"Crime\\" Lansdale is here, \\"horror\\" Lansdale is here, but then just \\"amazing writer\\" Lansdale is here as well. I tend to read the Edgar Award-winning books, but this is one that has stuck with me years after the fact. I re-read it on the way to a funeral recently that took me near the locations in the book. It was the greatest escape from an otherwise troubling string of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, I am a huge fan of his work and would recommend most of his stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".","review":"Landsdale has a landslide audience w/ his Hap Collins/Leonard Pine stories. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. I havent read the new \\"Captains-Outrageous\\".His 1st 5 Collins novels rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"derivative and poorly written","review":"I got a copy of this book when I read that it had won the Edgar as best mystery novel of the year but was terribly disappointed. As others have noted, borrowings from To Kill A Mockingbird are so blatant that the big surprise about the identity of the Goat Man comes as no surprise at all. And anyone with any experience at all reading mysteries will smell the kller before the halfway point of the novel. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment: The Only Mystery Is Why It Won an Edgar","review":"I will never trust the Edgar Award again after reading this derivative, predictable book. Not only is the murderer obvious from his first introduction, but it is clear who is going to be bumped off next. And although racism is clearly *the* important issue in the South, Lansdale seems rather preoccupied with describing lynching after lynching. One gets the impression that African Americans are nothing but victims in the eyes of this author. And it's positively criminal how much Lansdale lifted from Harper Lee. I'm truly baffled that this book has received so much praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this book on the basis of its award and the rave reviews I read about it here. The plot is used largely as a vehicle for making points and describing characters, who are mainly stereotypes associated with the points being made. There's little real suspense. The ending is not surprising because of the too obvious clues that precede it. The real surprises are the strange ways people behave throughout the book. I didn't think they acted in ways I could accept as believable. I tried to understand what others liked about this novel but ultimately couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually It's The Tops","review":"This is the coming of age story of Harry Crane. Harry takes us back to East Texas during The Depression when he was 11. A spate of murders have rocked Harry's small community and the bodies have been discovered down in The Bottoms.Childhood fears are confronted, as are supposed myth and legend. Racial prejudice is also at issue. Because the first victims found are black women, the investigation, conducted by Harry's father, is hampered first by indifference and then later by intolerance, with mob violence taking over at one point.Although times were tough, through the eyes of young Harry Crane, life was good, and simple pleasures, such as drinking a cold bottle of Coca-Cola, were relished. Throughout the book there remains an undercurrent of menace while revisiting the good old days. There's a killer on the loose and someone, or something, is living down in The Bottoms."},{"rating":"2","title":"For different reasons, a good read.","review":"This story has a good mystery. But more, it has some suspense and it teaches you something as well. East Texas in the 1930's before all the forests were cut down. White folks and black. The authors use of dialect is wonderful, not too much, very appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bottoms","review":"What Joe Lansdale can do with ordinary words should be illegal - The Bottoms crackles with high tension and razor sharp wit, white-knuckled suspense, and a good old fashion dose of the creeps. The Bottoms is Lansdale at his storytelling best. Gary S. Potter Author/Poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and lacks atmosphere","review":"This book didn't provide any surprises. I knew who the killer was as soon as he was introduced. The identity of the goat boy was no surprise. The little insightful talks with dad were artificially introduced and the interracial relationship seemed artifical as well. I also expected a lot more atmospheric feel to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much Like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"","review":"This is a well written, coming of age, murder mystery. No doubts about that. But it seems as if Mr. Lansdale stole many of the primary elements from Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". As a result, I was greatly disappointed at the end, after the story had taken off on such a new and fascinating tack. If you've never read \\"...Mockingbird\\", then \\"The Bottoms\\" is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical entertainment.","review":"Another of Lansdale's rural, east Texas thrillers. His depictions of our life in early 20th century southern US are both exciting, accurate & repugnant. His characters are both colorful & original.

All I can say is I don't know to whom the reviewer was listening becasue I thought this disc was just terrible. In fact, I threw the CD away after one play and kept the jewel box. That's how little talent I thought this singer had. I can think of nothing good to say about it other than I won't have to listen to it again.I have over 400 jazz CD's, so at a minimum, I'm well-versed in regards to what one should expect from a jazz vocalist (and that's how she's being presented). Unfortunately, at the present time this performer has none of the tools that are needed. I can't imagine how she got a recording contract except that she's cute- and sadly it seems like that's enough these days. Sorry folks, but that's the way I see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change of pace from Smooth Jazz!","review":"I purchased this album based on a snippet of a song I heard while browsing on Amazon. It was suggested to me based on previous purchases. I like to stretch my boundaries from time to time and Ms. Anders provided just the flavor I didn't even know I wanted. This is what I look for in music, someone not afraid to share their vision with the world. I hope she continues to make music on her terms and not the record companies' presumption of what the people want. We're not all Sheep in a pen waiting to be fed whatever slop they dish out.

I do my taxes on one computer and print the forms on another because my printer does not function properly. TurboTax will not let you do this. Once you activate the software, it is locked to that computer for printing and electronic filing. I'm sorry, I don't have the time to fight with Intuit. Note, that you must be able to connect the computer on which the software is installed to Intuit. You cannot install it on one computer and connect to Intuit via another computer or telephone line.

We live in a day where people have multi-computer households, where they rely on their work-computers being configured with the same software as their home computers.

So I'm very happy with the functionality of the software.However the copy-protection scheme that Intuit has decided to integrate into Turbo Tax 2002 is absolutely unacceptable! The C-Dilla software is nearly impossible to eliminate and makes upgrading your computer extremely inconvenient.

Early reports from some users indicate that C-Dilla has caused interference with other software and that it is inordinately difficult to get rid of, perhaps requiring a low-level hard disk format.

In 2001 I used Turbo Tax 2001 Home/Business. The software made a serious error which the IRS caught. It didn't calculate correctly and left off my eduction credit, gave two figures for my business income, and mistated my adjusted gross income. I had to verify all the incorrect information with the IRS. It took two months and many calls to the IRS to get my refund after electronically filing. Turbo Tax doesn't have a toll free number to call for help. You have to pay for assistance with their products. If you go online they have an online chat room, which gives you no help. Needless to say when I file my 2003 taxes I will go with Tax Cut by H&R; Block.Intuit has gone down the drain.

The only thing you can do on any other machine is go through the interview process. You can not see the resulting forms or print without activating. How totally useless!2) If you upgrade your hard drive (easy to do with prices falling for hard drives) or get a new machine you must buy another copy of Turbo Tax, even if you removed the first install.

Whoever this Russ Anderson character is, I hope to God he wasn't or isn't in another band because he is awful. The riffage here is sub-par, it's all played so quickly you never can get a groove going. And the solos are all shreds with no feeling in them whatsoever. The only thing this band had going for it was Paul Bostaph. Listening to this I can definitely see why Slayer got him to replace Dave Lombardo since, as I said before, these guys sound like a total Slayer ripoff.

Russ's voice is something to wrecken with and be honest with you, his voice sounds way better in concert than that of Hetfield of Metallica. I would have to argue with most people who would say that hetfield's voice is better than that of Russ.

It is so simple I can't believe I never heard of it before. You can peel 3 or 4 cloves in about 2 seconds (I'm not exagerating). I love garlic, but it appears that I'll be using it even more. I also bought the Oxo garlic press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but good garlic press","review":"This is a very simple garlic press for the kitchen. Simple take a few pieces, insert, press, and roll. In a few seconds, but have peeled garlic. This press is only for SMALL pieces at a time. Nevertheless, it is worth it if you hate peeling every little piece of garlic skin by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, effort and money","review":"If you never use more than a clove or two of garlic and really hate to get your hands dirty, this might be the gadget for you. It does work well until the interior gets messy. After 2-3 cloves get peeled, the juices cause the skins to stick to the interior walls, each other and the garlic, creating a bigger mess and preventing the peeler from working properly until it is cleaned out.I've peeled plenty of cloves of garlic before this gadget came along, and I can do it faster and with less clean-up using nothing but my hands. I don't use it anymore, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I just haven't found this to be terribly efficient.

Never, ever, ever get it wet. It will not work. Also, you must trim off both ends of the garlic, or it won't peel. And then, I still have to hand peel some of the more stubborn pieces. It's just not worth the money.

I did find much history dedicated to some of his famous paintings...and did look at his paintings via the internet while reading information held in this book.

The interesting thing about my research was that no other company's network enabled printers came close to the price for this Brother.I had an additional incentive to buy this printer: I'm using Mac OS X and wanted to take advantage of the Rendezvous feature. It worked like a dream, was remarkably easy to configure, and was network - connected within a couple of minutes.My only criticism of this printer is the noise it makes while printing. The fan and motor are a bit loud for a SOHO setting. That occurs only while you're printing however; You can configure the printer to switch to silent standby mode in just a minute or two (via rendezvous) after it's done printing.

This movie was billed as a hilarious comedy, but I only laughed once in the first half hour. The basic idea that these two pretty young women, no matter how lonely and screwed up, would instantly become attracted to/obsessed with a repulsive, obnoxious man old enough to be their father just required too great a \\"suspension of disbelief\\" for me to buy into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and creative","review":"For anyone who has read \\"Thrice Upon a Time\\" by James Hogan, you should really like this book. The story, while not a breakthrough one, is done creatively and with almost no lag time. The ending was good wrap-up that I think most people will not see coming. And if you ever wondered about the paradox of there being two of you, read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Potboiler","review":"This is an effort to write a time travel novel with causal paradoxes as a prominent part of the story. This book is an expansion of an award winning novella and the stretch marks are obvious. The quality of writing and characterization are pedestrian. Books like this can be saved by a clever plot and application of causal paradoxes but the paradoxes are predictable and the plot is marked by the sudden appearance of super powerful aliens defending the structure of space-time. This type of Deus ex Machina device is poor. The author has also a rather poor grasp of 20th century history. In this book, a key event is the destruction of the dirigible Hindenberg with the circumstances of that event influencing the survival of the Nazi regime. This is a laughable idea and a very shaky foundation for the generation of an alternative pattern of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"Will be a gift in a couple of days.

I found the Asquare made this incredibly fast, easy and accurate. It was also helpful in the layout of the jogs I designed into my deck.

Easy to put together and no guess work. As long as the lights receive about 7-8 hours of sunlight, they do stay lit for 10 hours or even longer. You can buy the same lights at Lowe's for the same price but then you have to drive there and then there's sales tax too. Highly recommended solar accent lights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright but quirky","review":"These lights are bright but have been a little quirky.

The box says \\"Grades 9+\\" and that is really where this would be appropriate. If you want something for a professional audience (like an Accounting for Non-Financial Managers class) find something else. But if your audience is High School/College students this will do well.

I also felt that, unless you had read the first book of the series, \\"The Greenway,\\" you would not have had any idea who the characters were or how they fit together. There was next to no independent character development in this book. The story does finally pull together and become quite interesting in the last third, but it took a bit of an effort to stay with it and get that far.

I love the Ozzy era Sabbath but the Dio era is what was going on when I first got into Black Sabbath and in my mind all 3 of the studio albums they made together are excellent. We could argue over which songs should be on here but who cares? All of these songs are great. Ronnie and Tony together is magic. I also like all 3 of the new songs and think \\"The Devil Cried\\" fits in with some of their other classics. I might catch some flack but I feel like the Dio version of Sabbath is one of the greatest metal bands of all time right their with Priest, Maiden, and the original Sabbath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album!!!","review":"This is a must have for any serious metal fan. The live show is awesome too, Dio delivers like he's 21 LOLGo grab it, you won't be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically a Sabbath Greatest Hits album","review":"There should be a whole album and not just three songs. On the other hand, this is better than nothing. The three new songs are not masterpieces but are much better and heavier than the new material with Ozzy's Sabbath. Ear in the Wall is the best of the new songs, followed by The Devil Cried. Get this disc and the Hammersmith one.I hope there will be a live DVD from the Radio City concert.By the way, is there going to be a Black Sabbath Tony Martin Years album? He should get credit for being in Sabbath 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album Idea, But Missing Favorites","review":"This is an awesome idea to put the best of Dio's years with Sabbath together on a collection, with addition of some unheard material. But unfortunetely, this is missing a few great songs, and in my mind, that really makes it or breaks it in a 'hits collection'. This should have expanded as a double disc set, or better yet a small box set with all the Dio/Sabbath material. This is a nice disc to have though, but honestly, it might be just better to buy the albums Sabbath and Dio were together on to encompass it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! So much great music I missed so long ago.","review":"Like one or two other reviewers I just saw Sabbath along with Megadeath (in Columbia MD) in 2007 and was thrilled and amazed. Dio's voice holds up very well live and theses songs stand out without any need to refer to Sabbath when Ozzy was there. So I ran out and bought the CD. All the songs from Heaven and Hell are terrific. Iommi and Butler perform the way that artists can only after they have spent a lifetime feeding off of each other. While my personal favorites all came from H&H.;, there are no weak links in the recording.If you are like me, and think there is no way fast/speed heavy metal can appeal to your over-40 years of age years, give this collection a listen. The lyrics are sophisticated, but not overbearing. The tunes are hammer-hard, but you might just find yourself whistling them later on."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIO/SABBATH JUST KILLS","review":"This album is the one that all the fans have wanted for a long time. Although this could have easily been a double or triple set, it at least has REMASTERS of the best old songs. Then to see this current tour and see them all performed LIVE is a wish come true. Well worth getting especially with the 3 new songs included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected","review":"I might be a rarity among fans of Black Sabbath, but I have no particular loyalty to any one era. In fact, when I first started getting into heavier music, Ozzy had already left Black Sabbath. Ronnie James Dio brought a new feeling to the band, and in my opinion the two studio albums he originally did with the band are some of their best work over the entire span of their existence. However, for me the one glaring flaw is the omission of the studio version of Children of The Sea.This compliation is great for anyone trying to learn the musical history of the Godfathers of Heavy Metal, or for anyone wanting a sample of some of Sabbath's best material."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIO! DIO! DIO!","review":"What a cool name, DIO. It actually means God in italian. Dio also invented the devil horn hand sign that most hard rock and metal fans use.Well this CD is awesome. It is filled with doom and gloom metal by none other than BLACK SABBATH. That is right, but no more Ozzy. This is Dio screaching dramatically over demolishing and ear splitting metal riffs.Dio era Black Sabbath features out of this world lyrics about the end of the world, voodoo, magical children of the sea, the devil, mystical crosses, shadows, and gothic themes that would elicit any true METAL fan's interest.This is highly recommended and please expect CLASSIC METAL. Do NOT expect the likes of System of a Down or Hatebreed. This is true classic metal at its baddest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messed Up Copy with Missing Pages","review":"Beware. This edition came with missing and mixed up pages. The back of the book highly praises the Cornell University Library (themselves) for being so good as to make this book available to the huddled reading masses but, as I received it, it was unreadable from page 193 forward. Also, the illustration in the front of the book gives away the ending of the book.

No more words for this superb film. How can the Iranian producers make excellent films with no much technical resources and with so natural actors? Congratulations !!.Don't miss it and enjoy it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iranian film","review":"One of the new Iranian cinema's most accessible films, this is actually a very worthy movie, if a bit on the sentimental side (while Iranian movies have a strongly humanistic bent, they usually reject maudlin sentimentalism). Directed by Kiarostami's disciple Majidi, this story tells the tale of a brother and a sister from a poor neighborhood in Tehran. Problem comes when the boy, through no fault of his own, loses her sister's shoes. Since their family is too poor to buy a new pair of shoes, they have to share their shoes in secret, trading them off in a rush every day. The boy eventually comes up with a plan to solve this problem: entering into a race that gives a pair of shoes as a prize to the third-placed runner. The climactic race is a bit on the sentimental side, but the movie is very much worthwhile watching. And it has some nice side plots, as when the brother goes with his father to a rich Tehran neighborhood to find work as gardeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"its the little things in life we forget...","review":"i wont recap the plot to this film since its already been shown above and by other reviewers. this film shows how things so simple and that are taken for granted by us each day, are very meaningful to people, and particularly to the kids in this film. the accomodations that have to be made for these two kids to be able to attend school and in sharing one pair of worn sneakers really humbles you. to the kids shown here, school is important but important is their recognition of those less fortunate than they are, even though its hard to imagine. a fabulous movie. i think some people may find it a slow pace from the normal western plots of movies in the u.s. but its the slow pace of the film that allows you to appreciate the lives of those shown, and the things that happen throughout the film. it really simplifies life, and makes you think. i recommend this film highly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get this movie out of my head.","review":"If I could, I would send every poverty stricken child a sneaker today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Children of Heaven is a great film!","review":"I highly recommend this film. I have seen it twice, once alone with my husband, and we loved it. The second time, we showed it to around twenty college- and grad school-age kids, and they ALL loved it too. Since then, my 69-year-old mother has seen it, and she thought it was amazing as well! One of the many things that's interesting about this film is that somehow this director makes you care intensely for the young kids in the story. There's real drama in a shoe floating down a gutter, an out-of-control bicycle, or a kids' foot race. I also like that this is the kind of film that can help people with biases (and isn't that all of us on some level?) reconsider some of our preconceived ideas: bias against all Iranians, bias again films with subtitles, bias against the poor. Recommended for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectiously and irresistibly heartwarming","review":"This film tugs at the heartstrings as well as the most manipulative and sappy American films, but it does so with such understatement and grace that it feels like snuggling up to a warm campfire with marshmallows in hand. The story is as moralistic as it is realistic, and the acting seems so refreshingly natural and unaffected. It provides an interesting glimpse into parts of Iranian family life. This film has no clear ending, it doesn't bother to tie up loose strings, but this suits the story perfectly because . . . life just goes on, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Germany","review":"Hallo, the service was perfekt, but I can not watch the film, because I am in Germany and it is another code.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting view into modern Iran...","review":"It was a very interesting film - I'm not normally a fan of international films, so the style of the director was unfamiliar to me, but it was beautifully shot. The only strike against it is the implied ending. It's as if the director is telling you, \\"You don't have to actually see the end--you know what's going to happen.\\" Didn't like that part of it--but the rest of the film still worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, universal","review":"Majid Majidi has a great facility with working with child actors and finding cinematographic details that reveal the beauty of an often cruel world in a way reminiscent of the best of Francois Truffault. This story is as revealing as his \\"The Color of Paradise\\" about family life and the constant struggles of the poor in his Persian home. The story is simple and I expected it to play on the \\"lost red shoes\\" fairy tales of Hans Christian Anderson but it did not turn into that kind of a journey in an obvious way. As with other Majidi films, we see the daily struggle and the gross inequities wrapped in a simple beauty that he skillfully captures and brings to life in this entertaining parable in which even the ultimate victory is a pyrrhic victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sweet movie","review":"I love Majid Majidi, he creates poems, not movies, yet his poems are very deep and graphic.What I love the most is to share people's lives, while in the movie you transport yourself to those exotic places and learn so much more about who iranians are and how they are, towards children for instance (so sweet and considerate) when the girl is crying at the shoe going through the water a strange man comes and tries to comfort her and helps her.Great photography, the story is sad but it depicts normal life of strugling laborers around the world.Two thumbs up film, great story that will keep your attention untill the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids all over should see this one!","review":"We loved this movie.

It's great to feel that you've seen something that actually shows real people's feelings, that doesn't condescend to overstatement to make sure the audience 'gets' it. The acting is sincere and believable. You truly feel for the tragedy a lost shoe can be in a family with no money to replace it. The struggles the young boy goes through to find it are hard for us to fathom here, where poverty doesn't look quite the same as poverty in other places.A Wonderful Film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful film","review":"I wish everyone could see this movie; it is beautifully produced and anyone seeing it will be left with compassion and understanding of life in a culture unfamiliar to most Americans.

When young Ali loses his sister Zahra's shoes through a mishap, they both go to lengths to hide the loss from their debt-plagued parents. Zahra goes to school in the morning with Ali's shoes, and rushes home to give the shoes to Ali so he can go to school. This film gives those of us who are lucky enough to live in more prosperous cultures good perspective: even one pair of shoes is of essential importance. Without this, the children cannot go to school.Ali shows amazing responsibility, blowing off playing soccer with his friends so that he can keep up his charade with Zahra. The film also has beautiful moments, such as when Ali and his father tend the garden of an older man in the rich part of town.Highly recommended: a thought-provoking view into both the world of Tehran and the world of childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas ever and then some","review":"I watched this movie just a few years ago. I didn't exhale till the credits, from the moment the shoes are lost the movie pages turn and there is no telling what will be the end.

Perhaps, we too can learn to share our shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes for a Brother and Sister","review":"Great entertainment for the entire family. The interaction between the young brother and sister is well worth watching this movie. The pair make adjustments in their daily routines (due to the loss of a tiny pair of pink shoes).

The movie will have you following along (and occasionally smiling and laughing along the way) while the pair work hard at keeping the loss of the shoes from their parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Sometimes as player it is hard to break down a skill in verbal cues in order to teach beginning players as a coach. This book is great at doing just that! I even took this book to practice and read to my girls out of it. This book introduces a skill, gives lots of pictures of a player going the skill, breaks the skill down into step-by-step actions, gives some verbal cues that you can teach with and then later remind your players with and gives some drills. Also with each skill, the book has a section on teaching beginning players and then a section on breaking bad habits.

The writer seems to know his terrain very well and writes in an easy and fascinating style. However, the book loses one star due to its terrible use of German sentences.

I know that \\"coincidences\\" and \\"contrivances\\" are necessary to any plot, this one was almost nothing but. If you like a rather brutish tale set during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and don't mind one set-up after another, you'll really like this adventure book. You will care about the characters.

Although the picture shows clamps for attaching both the top and the bottom of the rack to the bike frame, the rack only has clamps for the top of the rack. I had to fashion my own clamps out of insulated p-clamps (in the electrical department at the hardware store).

I ended up having to adapt each to the saddle stems. Each of these bikes have a thicker stem with a suspension spring in it and the U-bolt supplied by Bell wasn't big enough to accomodate. I used a plastic or nylon clamp from a reflector to make it work. If Bell included U-bolt that accomodated the larger saddle stem, I would have rated the carrier as great (five stars) because these thicker stems are common to most newer hybrid bikes that I've seen. Other than that problem, I thought the rack was pretty nice and reasonably priced.

Now, 10 years later, I can tell you that all the pans I barely used, are still fine, look good. The pans I used daily (the fry pans) are absolute messes. I cook with egg whites a lot, so I think that having something so hard to get off really had taken a toll on the pans.At $60 (the current price) I would consider how much you use cookware. I must replace my frypan now and have a \\"non-coordinated\\" set.

The tone of this book assumes the dieter has complete self-control and no emotional issues when it comes to food - and can make shifts in carb/fat/protein balance in his or her diet with no difficulties or resistance! This may be helpful to athletes who want to develop a certain physique - in my opinion, it's pretty useless information to those of us who are just trying to eat healthier and lose some weight!

There is no excuse for this atrocity--both the laserdisc and the most recent VHS release were the uncut versions, and there is no noticeable quality difference in the elements, so MGM/UA just doesn't care. I recommend boycotting this release until someone at MGM/UA gets the message. Not that I'm holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"MGM IS SOLD","review":"Sadly the original versions of this film on VHS and Laserdisc have been discarded to bring the viewing public a truncated version of Hill's HAWAII. Even minus the Overture, Intermission, and Exit musics. . .there have to be extreme edits in this version. I could argue that the mere fact that this fine film is finally available on DVD--is a plus argument--but with severe edits--it simply is not worth a buy. Hopefully a full version of this epic might finally be made available under the new owners of MGM. But my gut feeling is that we will not see the complete version until it emerges 5 years from now as a budget item in mono sound and as a standard screen sized item. Such is the respect, and business acumen of dummies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawaii LOST!","review":"As with the other reviews I have read on this DVD version, what a disappointment seeing this film has been. Waiting for years for the DVD to come out and it has lost almost 30 minutes. Missing are the Overture, Entracte and Exit Music but a very crucial confession given by Abner to Jerusha that ends Act 1. It is very unfortunate that I will have to keep the VHS tape which contains the original Widescreen version of the film.Please write to MGM and telll them how diappointed fans of this film are and encourage them to release a Special Edition of this wonderful film. I am a little worried how they will cut the soon to be released titles-Grand Prix and Ryan's Daughter. Just keep your fingers crossed that wiser minds will prevail other than those who chose to release this poor version of a great Film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I remembered.","review":"I was truly surprised at how much I remembered about this film.

Abner's character is so grim that it would be difficult to get through this story without wife Jerusha's loving influence, which is why I opted to get the MGM VHS version for viewing. Ultimately shows how brutal any revolution in religion, society, economy or politics can be. Hopefully a complete widescreen edition will come eventually to DVD or Bluray, now that the sequel The Hawaiians is now available on made to order video from at the time that this was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful epic but has no life in the actors","review":"After reading the so so book i had to see the movie. i can say it's not as good as the book and it suffers some amajor scene changes(mostley becouse the dvd is edited from it's original release).

A good sit-alone-at-home or with another girlfriend film. While it's not earthshatteringly profound, it is touching and quite funny. As a single 30-something who's seen numerous close friends get engaged and married, I can relate to Keener's character. Your relationships with your girlfriends change as you or they embark on committed relationships and this film's about finding yourself and letting go of expectations. See. .. I told you it's a chick flick. But it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Romantic Comedy","review":"A small movie but a note perfect one. Terrific acting from all 4 leads and a stellar support from Kevin Corrigan as the video guy. I found the core Heche/Keener friendship utterly believable - it's a real pity Holofcener hasn't been able to work more, she showed a great eye and ear here (if I owned a movie studio, I'd offer her a long-term contract to make one of these relatively cheap sorts of movies each year for the next five years - actors crawl over broken glass to do this sort of stuff!). Soundtrack mainly by Billy Bragg is *wonderful*. Maybe Holofcener could entice him to get back to that classic Bragg late 80's guitar sound on some new project?All told, W&T; is much better than, say _Kissing Jessica Stein_ or any of Ed Burns's rom com's: I think it's one of the 3 or 4 best rom com's of the 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking and Talking","review":"This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in some time.

I know this is an earlier film, but that woman irritates me in every single film she is in. I would give this movie 5 stars if she were not it. So, let me talk about the ones who made the movie great Catherine Keener and Liev Schreiber. Their timing together is wonderful and I was far more interested in their relationship than the one Anne Heche was in. Well, I thought Anne's fiance was very nice and well played, but she was in them and, well you get the drift. This movie is funny and very moving. I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Something Else","review":"I just saw this on the Sundance Channel and I have to say that I'd rent another movie if I were you. The characters were all pretty whiny, self-absorbed, immature and just downright unlikeable. The nerdy guy who worked as a clerk in the video store and went to slasher movie conventions seemed like the most together one of the bunch! There was zero laugh-out-loud humor in it, and whatever humor it had was subtle. Very, VERY subtle.Apart from that, whatever tugs on the emotional heartstrings you were supposed to feel for the characters was negated by the simple fact that it's hard to care about characters who are so unattractive. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Keener is funny but the movie is bland.","review":"Walking and Talking is not as funny or engaging as Friends with Money and Lovely and Amazing. Those two movies had depth and soul.Walking and Talking involves a small group of friends and their silly but mundane problems. This movie is like watching a very long episode of the TV show \\"Friends\\". Catherine Keener plays a character very similar to Phoebe. The other friends are superficial, uninteresting, and immature. Anne Heche is especially annoying as the incompetent therapist. Grade: D+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"After reading the reviews of Nicole Holofcener's movies, I thought this would be just the type of movies I would love. I purchased 3 of them and I have to say that I somewhat enjoyed them, but not excited enough about them to suggest them to family and friends. Of the 3 I purchased, \\"Walking and Talking\\", Lovely and Amazing & Friends With Money\\", I enjoyed the last one the most. I am looking to selling them after only one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Should Be Icluded With The Impact Wrench","review":"I'm giving this only one star for one simple reason. Milwaukee doesn't include it with the tool for which it is intended. You have to buy the impact wrench and case separately.

It is hard to feel empathy for Arthur, the main character in this engaging but factually inaccurate Thanksgiving tale by Daniel Pinkwater, as he bumbles his way from one disaster to another. The premise that not a single shopkeeper in the whole of Hoboken has a turkey in their freezer is, at best, far-fetched. At worst, it is factually inaccurate and a damning incitement on Pinkwater's research whilst writing this book. This reviewer knows for a fact that Sandra D's Mini Mart, 453 5th St, had a freezer full of plump gobblers last Thanksgiving, and had Arthur visited King's Super market, 1212 Hudson St, he'd have found cranberry sauce as well. I'm all for warming, cheery tales of triumph over tragedy, but when they're this sloppy with the detail, they're hard to swallow. My nephew's first comment when he read this book was \\"I done a guff\\", and, quite frankly, I think that says it all. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to the fantastic world of Pinkwater.","review":"This short tale of a kid in Hoboken is a great introduction to the fantastic world of Pinkwater, on par with his classic Fat Men From Space. Juvinile and zany, but with classic themes and deft efficiency of prose that will be appreciated outside of the targeted elementary age group. Illustrated by the author, with the same blunt and juvinile, and at once refined, efficiency of his literature"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book!","review":"We're big Daniel Pinkwater fans in the house. My husband read this one as a child, and we picked it up this summer so my son could read it (age 7). It's ridiculously silly, full of adventure, and was up to the usual Pinkwater standards.I only gave it 4 stars because my favorite Daniel Pinkwater (written under the name D. Manus Pinkwater) was Lizard Music and in my opinion, nothing ever could top that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Performances","review":"This is an unforgettable film, by great performances from Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen, Kimberly Williams, and Emilio Estevez. This timeless story is of a Vietnam veteran who has an equally difficult time adjusting to returning home as his family does. There have been many movies that depict the horror many vets and their families have had to endure. The difference, \`The War at Home' is so natural and well acted that is difficult to separate fact from fiction. You believe this is the family next door. Estevez directed as well as stared in this 1996 intense drama. For those who are sensitive to the plight of the Vietnam veteran, or this subject matter, this might be to intense. It is haunting and unforgettable. Without question an excellent movie brilliantly acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"language","review":"great actors. last scenes were overblown in my opinion. story applicable to times and understanding the Vietnam war vet's concerns were applicable. the lack of connection in the family was so vicarious and sadly so true in many homes even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"blu ray disc has defects","review":"The blu ray disc seems to be transferred poorley. Its possible I may have just got a bad disc . My copy has several instances of blocky artifacts on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Balanced And Well Thoughtout Film","review":"A very well acted, heart wrenching movie. Kathy Bates delivers yet another brilliant performance in this film proving why she is one of Hollywood BEST actors. I thought her role as the mother was one of her best roles EVER! The story line was well thoughtout and believeable which is what I look for in a film. I won't go into the details of this movie (others have) but IF you want to watch a film where the acting is top rate and the story line so good that it seems real, check this movie out. It's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emilio Does His Vietnam Movie","review":"Emilio Estevez does a fine job as both star and director of this overlooked film. His real father Martin Sheen plays his father, and watching the two together is remarkable. This movie really makes you think about what it must have been like for Vietnam vets coming home profoundly changed, to a world that didn't change along with them, and no one really understood post-traumatic stress syndrome at that time in history. And that is the legacy of Vietnam - making it home alive was not the end of the war for those who fought. If you're a vet, you'll want to see this, and you'll want your kids and parents to see it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible, wretched film.","review":"Overacted throughout by (first time?) director Estevez, this adaptation is painful viewing; not for any unpleasant insights into the Vietnam experience, but for Estevez screaming at his cowering family for two hours. By the end any sympathy we had for his returning vet is squandered---he deserves worse than what he gets. If only we'd seen something of his recovery, and his redemption. Instead we learn in voice over that he turned up dedication of the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial...probably still screaming at somebody. Bates and Sheen are great with what they are given, as is the radiant but perenially wasted Ms. Williams. A showpiece for Estevez, this film fatally overplays its hand and probably does more harm than good in generating sympathy for Vietnam vets. A mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of same with ribbons & bows","review":"The written material in this you would read in a day and it basically sums up Wilber's ideas succinctly but it is not an enjoyable read.

However, I think he has been sucked into Marketingitis. The packaging looks really nice though so nice I gave it to someone as a present.

It easily paid for itself during this project. I had lots of 8\\" tile that needed to be cut on the diagonal as this is how I laid out the floor tile. It handled this chore fairly easily. On a later project I needed a custom sized marble threshold for another bathroom. I croscut it to length then ripped it to width and even managed to put a new bevel on the ripped edge.All-in-all an amazing little tile saw for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money for light use","review":"For the non-contractor person doing most of their own tile work, this is a very good tool, particularly for thicker (1/2\\") terra cotta tiles which cut nicely (and I've never had much luck cutting the terra cottas with a score-and-crack tool). The alternative is to buy a much more expensive tile cutter or to spend a lot of time picking up a rental and returning the rental-- probably renting a cutter for a day for each room that needs to be tiled. Some of the drawbacks were listed by others; I also found the 22.5 degree mode difficult to use, and the table is plastic and tends to get scored (won't last for years and years). As a first tile cutter, or to do your own house, the price, utility, and convenience are very hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plasplugs DWW105USSP Diamond Wheel Tile Cutter","review":"It really is easy to use.

I lay it on a large piece of cardboard in my garage and toss the carboard when done.The one complaint is that the fence worked poorly from the start and eventially broke after moving it a few times. Chunks of tile were getting stuck under it and not allowing it to move or lock down. The plastic piece that locks the fence broke.

I've been searching for this movie everywhere. The library here in St. Augustine, Florida didn't have it, Netflix didn't have it but I finally decided that rental wasn't enough. So I went to good old Amazon and decided that I had to own a copy. Fortunately it was available and coincidentally it was my birthday. That's it! My birthday present.If you haven't ever seen this movie (and I have at least 8 or so times) then you must. I won't spoil it for any potential viewers, but if you like humor, food, spaghetti westerns, Japanese noodles as in ramen.... then it's a must. In fact I'm planning a noodle party for my friends.

Lots of blur in low light settings with no image stability (IS) capability. It has a built in autofocus (AF) which locks the lens from manual focus and does a poor job snapping to focus. This lens would work for someone who is using a DSLR for the first time and is looking for something cheap to throw on, but you will probably pick up on its limitations quickly.

The mix of songs is incredible, as is the high-def production. The PBS special is very insightful, and may be especially enjoyable for newer fans or people altogether unfamiliar with Phish. I found it to be much more useful as a documentary than Todd Phillips' \\"Bittersweet Motel.\\" It focuses equal attention on every member of the band, which is nice to see in place of Trey-worshipping. The cinematography is sometimes flashy, but always tasteful and useful in the purpose of presenting the music in its live element.

It is as if the widower has looked at a map, recognized the impossibility of finding his beloved in this mountainous region, and yet, he goes to look, because in the shadows the boundary between searching and finding can be perhaps blurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extended Owner's Manual","review":"This book seems to be an expanded version of the owner's manual for the D70. It could be that my expectations for this book were unrealistic; however, I found little in this book that was not already covered in the owner's manual that comes with the camera. The book is relatively devoid of examples as well as photos. For someone who is a novice, there are very few step by step instructions. The explanations of the technical workings of the camera are good; however, for those who are looking for tips and insight into how to take photos in specific circumstances with the D70, this book seems to fall short. If you are someone who has lost their owner's manual and want a good (or better) replacement, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This book has very little that a careful reading of the Nikon manual doesn't provide. Some very useful items about the D70 are hard to find - i.e. the index is incomplete. An example is the cabability to set the file number sequense. While there is a specific bold heading on the topic in the text, there is no index item. One has to dig through 25 pages of the \\"Set Up\\" index item to find it. Also, physically the book is inferior (that's being polite). After only 5 months of ownership, the book is literally falling apart because the publisher used an cheap/inferior binding process. I now have 4 groups of pages that have fallen from the binding. That makes it useless as a field manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manual Rehashed","review":"This book is nothing more than a rehash of the manual that comes with the camera. In fact, it's worse in many ways, since the concise and carefully formatted presentation of information in the manual is replaced by extended and sloppily arranged discussions of the same content, which makes it harder follow and much less helpful as a reference. Additionally the physical form of the book -- a stiff but cheaply bound paperback -- makes it less convenient to travel with and harder to keep open for reference while working the camera.(A further note: the book you get will not be the one depicted here. Mine was a D70 only book. No mention of the D70s at all.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"In spite of the several negative reviews I read here (mainly saying this book contains only that which is found in the product manual) I appreciated the subject matter being presented in a very consecutive and logical manner - so much better than the product manual.

For a beginning amateur the book is nothing more than poorly done rehash of the owner's manual and just as difficult to understand. The type and layout of information is amateurish, jerky and abbreviated as though the author is trying to save on words and the publisher trying to save on paper. Where's the good editor? There are no clear explanations for a neophyte who is unfamiliar with photographic lingo and techniques. I put the book away at the bottom of a drawer.

The standout tracks here are the standoffish \\"That's All\\", the tough-love approach of \\"Taking It All Too Hard\\" and the soulful \\"It's Gonna Get Better\\". \\"Silver Rainbow\\" features nicely crafted musicianship between Banks, Collins, and Mike Rutherford as well. \\"Shapes\\" is a nice embodiment of songs for any Genesis fan to have in their collection, which makes it a must-have CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't pay much attention to the stars, but my review","review":"Genesis' self-titles album isn't necessarily the band at their best, but it still offers some great songs. Unusual to Genesis formula, this album didn't work well as an album as a whole. The band did not seem to connect with a good overlying theme to their 1983 effort, as the last three tracks, in significance, seem to wander off the record, making me wonder if this album should have been an EP. If anything, get it for Mama, a classic Genesis song and my favourite music video of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This CD is ranked #2 on my all time Genesis. Especially the songs like 1# Mama and #2 Thats all and my fav of this CD #5 Illegal Alien. This is a great CD and people who don't have this Cd you'r missing a whole lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello, Pop Stardom","review":"It took five studio albums for Phil Collins to complete the transformation of Genesis from a Peter Gabriel-led murky sounding art rock band to a group of video star mega-hit meisters. \\"Genesis\\" marked the completion of that transformation. \\"Mama,\\" and \\"That's All\\" were huge radio hits, and the \\"Illegal Alien\\" video, with its silly south-of-the-border images, became a fixture in the MTV rotation. \\"Taking it All Too Hard,\\" and \\"It's Gonna Get Better\\" are nice ballads, while the two \\"Home By the Sea\\" songs are attempted throwbacks to the band's art rock roots that just can't avoid having pop undertones to them.Overall, \\"Genesis\\" is a decent album, albiet one likely to disappoint the fans of the Peter Gabriel years. By this point, Genesis had left the thinking to Gabriel and decided to dominate the pop charts instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Out there.","review":"This album is excellant, starting off with the loud, almost punkish \\"Mama\\", then going to its complete opposite---\\"That's All\\", whihc is kinda catchy! \\"Home by the Sea\\" is simply awesome. It's the best song on this album. \\"Illegal Alein\\" is like Genesis being blink-182, but i'm not complaining. \\"Taking It All Too Hard\\" is sweet and meant to be played with the rocking \\"Just a Job To Do\\". Then the second best song on the album---\\"Silver Rainbow\\" (but don't ask me what the lyrics mean, I don't know.), and the good closer \\"It's Gonna Get Better\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best...but close!","review":"This album is excellant, starting off with the hard rock \\"Mama\\" (though I preferred the \\"Hits\\" edition of this song), then going to its complete opposite---\\"That's All\\", which shows that they can write good bad songs! \\"Home by the Sea\\" is simply awesome. It's the best song on this album by far. \\"Illeagal Alein\\" is excellant! It's very funny. \\"Taking It All Too Hard\\" is sweet and meant to be played with the rocking \\"Just a Job To Do\\". Then the second best song on the album---\\"Silver Rainbow\\", and the good closer \\"It's Gonna Get Better\\". Buy it, but don't judge it by \\"That's All\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album represents the great \\"new Genesis\\"","review":"I can understand that it was pretty hard for most of the fans of the \\"old Genesis\\" when Gabriel and Hackett left, but I think it's not fair to dislike the 80's Genesis with a brilliant Phil Collins just because of that. Every music fan should admit that \\"Genesis\\" represents a great piece of rock music of the 80\`s. This album finally revealed the new style that made Genesis one of most successful and popular rock groups in history. It was this cd that made me become a Genesis fan. In my opinion, the follow-up album \\"Invisible Touch\\", in spite of the great title song and the awesome \\"Land of Confusion\\", could not surpass the brilliance of this album. And then, \\"We Can\`t Dance\\" from the early 90\`s disappointed me a little bit. The classical Genesis sound is almost lost on that one. Still, I love Genesis for their great 80\`s music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubling Reviews Above","review":"\\"The lighter side of deportation?\\"...I guess the only thing more insensitive than the above-mentioned quote is the fact that a band of this stature and success had to pick on people in desperate circumstances. There are a few things to like about this album but with women of color depicted as prostitutes in the Mama video and accusations that an illegal alien would sell his own sister for work blots it all out for me. Listen to the Lamb or \\"Supper's Ready\\" from the Seconds Out live album - that's greatness. This is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Usual Trio Garbage","review":"With the exception of the interesting Mama and two prog rock numbers Home By The Sea and Second Home By The Sea Genesis is a terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest sell out in rock and roll history","review":"This is literally like Pink Floyd mutating into backstreet boys before your very eyes. If you are a phil collins fan of god awful pop whines help yourself. If you are a fan of the real Genesis i.e With Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett buy 'Selling England by the pound' or 'Foxtrot' among others. When gabriel and Hackett left they should have changed their name because this album amongst their others couldnt be further to what genesis are/were really about. They have ruined their legacy as one of the most artistical, innovative and influential bands ever. They left their adoring cult fan base from the 70's abandoned, betrayed, bitter and disgusted. Why o why did Phil Collins ever stand in front of a microphone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Genesis","review":"Does a Real Genesis Fan exist, Peter Gabriel established a new and unique sound along with a good fan base. Phil Collins took Genesis and made them an AM hit. A true Genesis fan will stick with \\"Selling....\\" before any of the Genesis II stockade. I miss the true Genesis sound, avoid the stockade unless Your just \\"another\\" Phil Collins groupie, his songs have no Story, just the same lyrics over and over. This album is a prime example, how many times can You say \\"Home by the sea\\" before it becomes repititous. This is the Phil Collins Band, not Genesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of a 24 years old album","review":"I was once a huge Genesis fan, of course, I know the Gabriel era, which produce creative albums. Then the band took a strong turn and became a pop band. Even with this turn, I still appreciate their music. To me, it is two bands, maybe they should have change their name at the same time they changed their musical style. I have seen them in concert for this tour, I know the album since it went on the market. Twenty three years later, I have to admit that I only still like three songs out of nine, hence the low rating. The album is not bad, but the only one I want to hear again are Home by the sea-Second home by the sea and It's gonna get better. We have heard too much Mama and That's all. Illegal Alien is not the kind of piece Genesis is supposed to be limited to, they can do a lot better than this. The rest is so-so...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Genesis","review":"This is an older CD, but one of the best. Genesis back then was at its best and this CD is testament to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got a name, I got a number ....","review":"I will admit ... I am not a Peter Gabriel era Genesis fan ... I do like some of his solo work, but their material with him reminded me considerably of stuff that Yes & ELP put out at that time. This album is a complete masterpiece, however. Every song on this album is a complete winner.I do not consider Taking It All Too Hard a snooze as it was put by somebody else. Of course, my favorite will be Just A Job to Do. This combined with the Abacab & Invisible Touch albums will give you basically all the Genesis that you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably the worst album of their career","review":"Genesis were, with their eponymous album, at the very bottom of their creative ability. Songs like Illegal Alien, Just a Job to do or That's All demonstrate that there were not enough juice in their inspirational well. Even the best of the album (the Home by the Sea suite) ranks just O.K. in Genesis' standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster effort with mostly fillers and sub-par material","review":"This is easily Genesis worst album (Calling all Stations aside). Aside from the classics \\"Mama\\" and \\"Home by the sea\\" and the tolerable top 40 tune \\"That's all\\", the rest is plain garbage. \\"Illegal Alien\\" is horrible and takes way too long, the song doesn't know when to stop, the other songs are sub-par efforts and were obviously meant as fillers. The drum machine destroys \\"silver rainbow\\" and \\"Second home by the sea\\" completely.Suggestion: get \\"Hits\\" or \\"Way we walk 1\\" for \\"Mama\\" and \\"That's All\\" and \\"Way we walk 2\\" for the quintessential \\"Home by the sea\\" (12 minute live version). And be proud of yourself you steered away from this very mediocre effort"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pics, Misleading Picture.","review":"Normally for a product I actually like I would leave 5 stars, unfortunately the picture is misleading. Dont get me wrong, the pics are fantastic for picking. Sadly the ones I received were not mixed color at all, they were only purple. Theyre kind of hard on the eyes but that doesnt matter one bit. If youre going to be selling a product at least make buyers aware that they are receiving 6 purple, non multicolored items.On to the review. They are great for speedy picking on a guitar, the indentation are designed to fit any fingers comfortably, they dont really produce a lovely tune when strumming though; it sounds a bit \\"metally\\". I guess it mostly depends on your guitar though, I tried these pics on multiple guitars in my household and on each guitar the sound produced was different.If you are thinking of buying these make sure you dont mind having purple pics. LOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Vendor Experience","review":"My review does not speak to the stubby picks themselves but to the vendor. Although I paid for and was supposed to be sent a bag of six, I was sent a bag with only five and a hole in the bag where the sixth one was removed. It is not worth my time and money to return to get the sixth pick, but I can put in a review saying so. Therefore, whether you select these picks or not, I would recommend using a different vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"i dont know why everyone thinks thinks that these are so good.

They're much faster, they pluck strings more consistently, and its much easier to execute pinch harmonics with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great product for many reasons","review":"This guitar pick, when held properly, is slippery, does not fit your fingers correctly, and is easily nicked by guitar strings. The worst part about this is the nicking, because once it is nicked your stings can get caught in it and break. Don't worry, this was not some freak accident, it happened with almost every pick that came in this package.I understand that the pick is designed to be easier to hold, but \\"stubby\\" is not that great. \\"Textured\\" would have been much better.I would say that one pro is how solid it \\"feels\\", but because the guitar pick is easily blemished by electric and acoustic strings, it would be inappropriate to call this product \\"solid\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for fast picking, but dull sound","review":"Picks are a personal thing, and no one pick suits every situation. The big stubby is a very comfortable pick that will stay firmly in place in your hand. The fact that it's not flat but slightly rounded makes it great for fast picking. But it's sound is duller than a flat pick and less percussive, and for me that's a deal breaker. (I'm talking about acoustic picking. Maybe it's fine for electric.) And I don't like it at all for strumming, both because of the dullness and the lack of feel. So I bought a pack of these, which I almost never use and will give away to curious friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grip and OK sound -- but don't expect to receive the color pictured.","review":"I like the grip on these picks, and the sound quality isn't bad -- but nor is it worth this price for everyday strumming. Also, don't expect to receive picks that are any shade of white or blue, as pictured -- I received transparent purple picks that weren't at all easy on the eye. If you want a thick pick that produces sound similar to the Big Stubby and has a good grip, I'd recommend 1.14mm Everly Star Grip Picks instead. Obviously not as thick of the 2mm Big Stubby, but then again -- the 2mm is excessive for most picking needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I'm amazed at the difference these make!","review":"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that, but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment. We'll be buying these for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picks; improve your technique!","review":"I'd like to preface this review by saying: 'I think purple is a pretty alright (cool) color'. These guys look sharp and feel great in the hand. When playing, the picks show no noticeable flex; this is awesome for developing good technique and control. With these picks, the musician is given much more control in general, especially in regard to dynamics. I certainly feel that these picks have helped to isolate some of my own technical flaws, allowing me to slowly correct bad habits. Hope this helps, thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable DVD","review":"This came and is formatted for European DVDs and I can't watch it.

The results are impressive, especially the final shout \\"Calla la vida\\". Don't miss the hits \\"Algo mas\\", \\"Hablemos de Algo\\", \\"Todo por Nada\\", \\"Quien\\" and \\"Sin Remedio\\" which are the best tracks of this album.

I was happy with the simple rubber knee pads I have except that they wore out too quickly. I bought the Fluid Forms 1003F Patella Ts thinking that the fluid patella pad would be comfortable and thinking they would wear well. What I found was the straps were uncomfortably bulky when my knee was fully bent, which is how I am quite alot, and would probably strain my knee if I wore them all day. Which is unfortunate as straps do not get the wear and tear to necessitate being so bulky especially with TWO of them.

I got them because the in-ear headsets block out at least 25db and some up to 35db. This is great for sound but bad if you want to hear what is going on around you.Also, these things are a work of art. Every one that looks at them smiles and want to touch them. They way they fit is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion of Clip-on/earbud Hybrid Headphones","review":"Sound great, a little tricky to get around my ears and in place. These headphones really need a carrying case of some kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Dry, and Disorganized","review":"This book provides an overview of Latin American History with an emphasis on economic and political trends. There is absolutely no reason for anyone today to read this book as its style and focus are completely outdated. The author also yields to the temptation with Latin American history to cluster all countries into a chronological account. The result here is disorganization and an unfocused text. Most texts written more recently realize the importance of clear organization and outlined topics as key components of an educational text. Unless you would like to intentionally make the learning process difficult for yourself, do yourself a favor and find an author who actually knows how to hold a students interest and convey history in a more informative and educational way."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Yup some people find it boring, but I loved this movie since I watched in the theater.It is an intimate drama that portrays the caotic lives of an actress and an English writter. Roller coaster of emotions during a party makes you understand and know what the characters are all about.One of the few movies that has an accurate extasy performance, we never know what to expect untill the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Miss---Simply Dreadful","review":"Hubby and I unite on this one, calling it the worst movie we've seen all year, or in the bottom 3 films. What is it about? The most unlikable characters imaginable, all who work in the film industry. Featuring one obnoxious, self indulgent character after another, they all proceed to wallow together and snipe at one another in a \\"celebration\\" of the lead couple's Anniversary. That every one of these people only has others hang around him or her to advance \\"the\\" film career is hardly a revelation. I couldn't stand being around any of them for over a minute. Ironically, we like most of the actors seen here in other films, Leigh, Klein, Paltrow, et al, and conclude that being in this film was an enormous lapse of judgment on all their parts. OTOH, if this was letting their hair down and showing us what they are really like in their private Hollywood lives, I feel sorry for all of them. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Name actors. Lame plot","review":"This movie wastes alot of talented actors. Jennifer Jason Leigh drags the movie down just like her character does in the story line. The scene of all these lame brain Hollywood types on Estacy is just sad. Too much drama and BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Cummings and Leigh try their hand at directing and screen writing with mostly awful results. This movie may have some of the worst line readings in movie history. Cummings is horrifying awful and Leigh seems to be sleepwalking through her part. Ironically, this is exactly what her character is accused of doing in her current movie.The real question here is why should we care? This is a bunch a spoiled, selfish, shallow, good-looking people behaving badly AND getting paid for it. The melodrama that arises from the petty concerns of these characters is shameful.If you want to see a movie about a party in which people with oversize egos behave like children, rent Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. It's time better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Revolution","review":"Anniversary Part is written and directed by both Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh.This movie looks at 24 hours in the life of a couple (Cumming, Leigh) who have been separated for a year, but come back together in time for their Sixth Anniversary Party which goes awry when one of the gifts leads the party guests to an adult-oriented version of \\"Truth and Dare\\"...In addition to Leigh and Cummings whom also star, the cast includes Jennifer Beals, Phoebe Cates, Kevin Kline, Gwyneth Paltrow, Parker Posey and John C. Reilly.One of the interesting notes about the film is that it is filmed in digital video. For those who wants to see a strong cast in a different kind of filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"A nice movie, not great but certainly watchable.The story is about Sally and Joe's marriage, and whether it can survive. It's apparent from the beginning that whatever they may think, the marriage isn't likely to last. For one thing, Joe isn't really committed--he's distracted by anyone \\"intoxicating\\" or new who floats by. And Sally knows she is on shaky ground, an \\"aging\\" actress in a town full of young ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring, So Dumb","review":"What was the point of this film? There is no lesson learned, no story to tell, no entertainment factor even associated with it. I guess it was an excuse for Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming to try to prove that they have no imagination and get their Hollywood buddies together for 2 hours of nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"why is it?","review":"That people who are'nt actors or studying acting feel qualified to critic other people's professional acting? Have you ever wondered this. This is an ACTTORS MOVIE. IT is made bya cors' for actors'. If your not an actor, then the Anniversay is not for you!!! We watched this in my acting class and my acting teacher said we should study the acting in it. So if you're not going to be willing to do THE WORK to become an actor, then you shouldnt say negative things about this movies acting.ITS NOT FOR YOU OK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor, skip this dud","review":"This is one party I'm glad I wasn't invited to. Celebrity couple Joe (novelist and now director) and Sally Therrian (actress) throw a party to celebrate their 6th anniversary. It's been a rocky marriage with jealousy and petty squabbling. They throw a party with \\"close\\" friends, neighbors they are feuding with and a up and coming actress that Sally feels her career threated with. It gets messy as the night goes along and lots is said and done because they are tripping on Ecstasy.Another the-world-spins-around-me movie. I don't know which would be worse, to have be surrounded by people like them or to be them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some funny parts but overall boring","review":"I viewed this film about 3 weeks ago, and I was very dissapointed. I thought it was going to be atleast somewhat interesting, but it was slow-moving and had a very simple not so good plot. All it was, was people taking drugs, women walking around topless, and couples splittng up.....that pretty much sums it up. I definately do not reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal waste of talent","review":"Well, this has to be one of the most excruciating films ever made with such a top-drawer ensemble cast. The story is hackneyed and pointless, the characters are not only gratingly irritating but, more problematic, uninteresting, and the film becomes more and more painful as it progresses. With so many fine actors involved, you keep expecting something of value to transpire - but, before you waste two precious hours of your life watching this dreck, let me assure you that it never happens. The only amazing part is that somehow Cumming and Leigh concoct an ending that is even more contrived and ridiculous than the rest of the film. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, if this is how these people really live, I'd rather not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"The first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other, and, as such, is unavoidably boring. The second third of the movie features a game of charades, which is embarrassing. The final third of the movie, though often self-indulgently mediocre, does possess some tension and drama, though it's largely derived from people's being mean to each other. Not my idea of a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vanity project","review":"This is definitely more interesting than a lot of the mass-market Hollywood pap that makes it into multiplexes, but that's not saying a whole lot. Basically, the plot and (mostly improvised, I think) dialogue are nothing spectacular. The actors work really hard to try to seem \\"natural,\\" as if they're filming a reality show instead of a movie, but none of them quite succeed. Gwyneth Paltrow in particular is very annoying as the film's airheaded \\"perfect\\" girl, and Phoebe Cates is quite a scenery-chewer--it's as if she's trying to make up for all the years she spent doing no acting whatsoever. Parker Posey's talents are completely wasted here. I'm a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, but this is a self-indulgent, forgettable film that never lives up to its potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn yawn...","review":"There wasn't a single character in the movie that I fell in love with. Well, maybe the dog. Way over the top and yet boring, yawn, snoozer."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as going to an AA meeting","review":"This movie so reminded me of how messy things get when there are booze and pills. Among other things it perfectly captured what happens to already stroked egos when inhibitions are removed. The last scene showing the morning after- when the main characters affect a sort of reconciliation after being incredibly nasty to each other the night before-is a place I'm glad I'm don't go to anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beaches","review":"Love this movie. Very emotional. I owned it on VHS and eventually I played it so often I ended up replacing it on DVD. I always thought Bette Midler had a great voice, but the story very much outwayed any singing. I cry a little everytime I watch it. It will always be a part of my movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"Well this finally cam out on Blu-ray talk about a disappointment,They didn't even try to improve the picture it is like they blew the picture up and they put it on the disc,So if you really want this my advice would be to just get or keep the special ed dvd,it is just like the blu ray.

I laughed and cried through the whole move. I think that many people, not only women being a \\"chick flick\\", but everyone can relate to having a best friend and the times you go through with them.

She meets Hillary Whitney(Barbara Hershey)under the boardwalk, and when Hillary see's CC sing, she can't believe it.They are seperated completely from eachother at both ends of the country, but through the letters they write to eachother, it seems that a friendship can grow even stronger.Through fights of Jealousy, Marriages, Divorces, Deaths, and everyday things, the friendship still lingers between them. If you liked the movie, try the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Beautiful, Amazing, Captivating, Extraordinary Brilliant Movie","review":"This is my all time favorite movie of all time! The first time I saw this movie I was eleven years old and still at the age of 29 I love it the same. I can laugh, cry, think, smile, frown at certain scenes throughout this movie. If you have not yet seen this movie, what are you waiting for? This is definitely a must-see and I highly recommend anyone that loves a good drama, tear-jerker movie to see this one but even with the tears, there is bliss that overcomes it. I love Beaches, and so will you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You've Ever Had A Best Friend..........","review":"This is the best movie I've ever seen about friendship. The relationshship spans decades and the direction and acting are outstanding. It is unfathomable to me that Bette Midler not only did not win the Oscar for this unbeliveable performance, she wasn't even nominated! It is said, and this instance would seem to bear this out, that the voting members of the academy are too old to appreciate contemporary cinema. It has happened many times.If you have a best friend, invite them over this winter, build a fire, put on this blu ray and laugh and cry together. What a film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beaches is still amazing!","review":"I bought this on DVD since my VHS version is almost completely worn out. My roommate had never seen it, so I wanted her to see it without all the lines from my old tape. Still love it just as much as I did the first time I saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most memorable movie you'll ever see","review":"I have seen this movie many times, and I've gotta say that it's one of my very favorites. It is, however, very heartrending, and if you don't like sad movies, then I would recommend a different movie because this movie just absolutely PULLS at your heart. Obviously, it is a story about friendship and the continuous struggles which come from it. This beautiful movie profiles two remarkable women--masterfully portrayed by Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey--who survive some heavy-duty problems in their friendship and come out of it together. Clearly, they would not have gotten anywhere in this relationship if they hadn't held their heads up and pushed through it, which shows that even the strongest friendships require courage all the way through. Basically, \\"Beaches\\" is just a great movie that gives the word \\"friendship\\" a whole new meaning. Watch it now, and be prepared to cry buckets and learn a whole lot about what true friendship is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blake Houston LOVED it!","review":"I watched this movie with my wife and actually shed a tear.

We got one but it wasn't good at all.It follows two girls who meet one the beach one day and they become friends for life. It skips about ten years when there in there early twentys and they are still friends. A little strange but still the same they are still friends. They meet in New York where Midler is a struggling actress. Midler invites the other one to life with her, which she does. It goes on trough love, sadness, death and many things that would make a good movie, but in here it was just too much.It is over two ours and gets very boring. I found a lot of scenes twored the end that just drag the movie on. It gets VERY boring VERY fast. Midler caries the story on her shoulders and she just plays it her usual happy-go-lucky character she always plays. If you want a good chick flick see it but if you want a RELLY good movie, don't. It isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a gift","review":"My wife likes Bette Midler, I do not.She wanted this movie for Christmas, so I bought it.She asked me to watch it with her.I told her if she wanted anymore Bette Midler movies for Christmas, then my Christmas gift would be having someone else watch them with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOUR HEARTACHES BEST FRIEND","review":"THIS IS INCREDIBLE - THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SPACE HERE TO GIVE IT THE TRUE CREDIT IT DESERVES.

So, when I heard it, I bought it so I'd finally have it in my collection.When I bought it, I figured there would be other good songs on the CD based on the one track that I liked. Unfortunately, none of the other tracks are anything like \\"Fire Water Burn\\". The CD is not terrible. It's got a lot of good rock and it's a little jazzy.

Sarah gave good information about the Feng Shui philosophy but when trying to include the depths of various conections she falls short. For example,in the appendixes under explaining palmistry, she mentions that \\"if you have a scar above the nose and between the eyes, this indicates death, accident, or illness at age forty.\\" I find this an extremely irresponsible thing to say. She never explains further nor says what to do if you happen to have such a scar. Both my husband and I have such a scar. We have 3 small children and turn 40 in the year 2000.

Use it after bathing and you will see a total difference in the way your skin feels. The scent is light (I really don't notice it at all)but if you prefer unscented-Neutrogena does sell an unscented version.

It's hard to believe that this is the 50th box set from Trojan. Made up of songs from the late sixties to the late seventies,there is a broad spectrum of artists. Fifty tracks by fifty artists means many different musical styles. Songs like Suffer Me Not to Rose Garden to It's Your Thing to Ain't That Peculiar are just some of the things you'll hear. The arrangements range from typical small groups to highly arranged horn backing. Should this be your first purchase? Probably not. This is aimed a bit toward long-time Trojan/reggae listeners. That said,there is still a lot to recommend here. The overall feel of this set is one of generalities,not one area of reggae music that other box sets fulfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot be used","review":"there is not a way to attach an average bike to this machine. i tried tech support and they suggested that i return the product. i wish that there was a list of bikes that could be compatiable.what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time consuming","review":"It took calls to Bell customer service, who said that an older bike couldn't use the trainer without a quick release back tire, to find out that they really didn't know what they were talking about.When I was ready to return the trainer, a neighbor who knows about bikes came by and put it on for me.

I simply overpowered this trainer. Other reviews said to tighten the trainer more than recommended to get additional resistance, but it really didn't make a difference.This may be okay if you are feather light and using a road bike with tall gears, but for my 180# frame on a mountain bike, it simply did not provide enough resistance.

I returned this unit and purchased an Ascent unit from Nashbar, $10 more, but a lot better built with 3 resistance levels(that actually work).I give Amazon a 5 star on this transaction.

It did not generate any noticable resistance. I had to switch to the highest gear combination and still not enough. It did generate lots of vibration and noise. I suppose one could increase resistance by tightening the roller onto the bike tire...but that can tear up your tire pretty quickly.I am not big on indoor trainers but I had used a Cycle-ops fluid trainer before, and that gave far better resistance and was much quieter. This is a low end trainer. If I were buying another one (I sold mine), I would look for one with a bigger/stronger resistance mechanism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased Customer","review":"Overall, I am pleased with the product.

Only problem was that the black handle that is used to adjust the resistance against the tire broke. It cracked right in two and broke off from the screw before the assembly was even against the tire. Luckily the screw has an allen wrench hole at the end so it can still be used. As far as noise goes, it really wasn't that noisy. The amount of noise will depend on what kind of tire you have. Knobby mountain bike tires will be much louder than smooth road bike tires. Mine are hybrid tires for street riding so the noise was about on par with a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but like others suggest a bit loud...","review":"The trainer is pretty good.

There is no way to adjust resistance except changing gears on your bike. Even at the highest gear, I don't think this approximates the difficulty of biking on flat ground. What's worse is that the product is so loud you will likely find it unusable. Even at slow speeds I need to wear ear plugs. At moderate speeds it sounds like a lawnmower. I can't recommend this product to anyone, and I don't understand how it received the positive reviews it has garnered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Put my Canondale 26\\" on this rack and it works as advertised. It's a little loud, but most of that is due to the tire/tread I have...I'm looking at replacing the back tire with a treadless one made for this type of trainer. You do not have to replace the axle if you have a quick release already...mine fit right in. Setup took about 5 minutes from the box to pedaling. There is no tension adjustment on-the-fly, you have to stop, get off, and adjust the knob against the tire. You can still cycle through the gears on your bike to adjust difficulty. This is probably why it's a lot less expensive. Overall, very good workout, great price...no frills, but it works fine. Construction materials are very solid. Definite recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real trainer","review":"I'm a competitive cyclist and borrowed this trainer from a friend to use during the winter and wow....this thing is terrible. Yes, it is cheap, and yes, it allows you to bike inside, however, forget this thing if you are looking for a workout. There is no resistance and the only way to work up a sweat is to crank the roller tight on the tire but get ready for burning rubber and dramatically decreased tire life. Spend a few more dollars and get a real trainer. The frame is also flimsy, be careful getting out of the saddle for sprints: I've dropped the wheel out of the clamps on several occasions because the lateral flex of the frame is so bad. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Noisy!","review":"I have been using by Bell Motivator for about a month now and while it does produce a bit of noise, the cause is the rear bike tire tread NOT the trainer. My tire tread is fairly smooth and hence, little noise. A mountain bike tread would produce a lot of noise. If it really bothers you, buy a tread-less rear tire to reduce the noise level when your bike is used as a trainer.The wheel at the back of the trainer provides adjustable resistance level and I must say that a 20-minute workout with this trainer, makes me sweat as much as my normal 45 minute outdoor workout! I'd recommend this trainer to anyone who wants to keep up their biking routine, during the cold, rainy and snowy days of fall and winter (at least here in the NorthEast!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"This is exactly what I had hoped it would be. It is NOT as noisy as others have stated. It is easy to set up, is already assembled right out of the box.

You may want to get a block for the front tire, so you don't feel like you're going downhill, unless you don't mind. I just put a block of wood under mine, which works great. This is an excellent product, and I recommend it to every bike rider. It sure beats buying one of those \\"exercise bikes,\\" that take hours to put together, and make more noise than a busted chain saw. This thing takes up no more space than your bike already does, is quiet, and low priced. \\"Brilliant!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bell Motivator Mag Indoor Bike Trainer","review":"Great product! It was a snap to hook up except the tension knob was broken right out of the box (Bell replaced it within 10 days at no charge & no hassle).

I have knobby MTB tires as of now. (Still waiting for my new pair of slicks 26 x 1.25 Panaracer from [...]). This means, my place sounds like there is either a lawnmower or a motorcycle inside when I do my training. I'm hoping the slick will minimize this noise. I played loud jazz music the whole time when I tested mine. But I knew this when I purchased the product. The price is great for the price conscious of buyers. Training to bike for long distances can start adding to one's equipment expenses. This one does the job for me at a very good price. It was very easy to install. Yes, some parts have a bit of compromise like there were some plastic components that I still fear would not hold my bike for long. I will update my review in case there is anything new for me. Bottomline, I recommend this trainer. Shipped and delivered super fast too, with the free shipping and all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"Purchased this item for my daughter's boyfriend. He wanted to something to use for indoor training during winter months. He's using it every day and it appears to be working well for him.

If you don't really want a workout than this is the trainer for you. There is virtually no resistance. I have a 27 speed road bike and I had to run my bike in the highest gear there was which made the magnetic unit whine and vibrate terribly. I rode for an hour and hardly broke into a sweat.

The website description of \\"progressive magnetic resistance smoothly increases as the speed increases\\" is not true. There is not enough resistance to start with and it doesn't increase with speed. Forget standing on the pedals (I weight 160#). My buddies have units that have a resistance control and this one doesn't. They told me definitely not to bulge the tire by tightening the tension roller or you will get flat spots on your tires. Spend the money on a trainer with a resistance control than on buying replacement tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Say It Doesn't Fit All Bikes","review":"I bought this trainer for my son who has tons of energy and who lives in a place that gets cold and inhospitable to biking outside in the winter.

And it doesn't say that anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy!","review":"Unfortunately, the product did not explain in detail how theproduct worked and it turns out that our bke did not fit properly.

To feel any significant resistance i have to be in my highest gears, and have a cadence of over 100. At that point the trainer makes a very loud whine.Long story short, if you are an experianced cyclist looking for something cheap, dont get this, because in a week youll be wanting something better, but if your someone that just wants to turn over their legs pretty easily for a low price, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and clunky Taiwanese junk","review":"Not a quality item. I do not recommend this trainer unless you are, as I was, just looking for a cheap stationary trainer to try out the idea of riding a bike inside. If you are sure you want to train indoors, go ahead and buy a decent one that produces less noise and vibration.

I've got a road bike with fairly smooth tires on it, but for me noise is not a problem with it. Setup is very easy, though the spare axle provided with the unit is not needed and they don't really tell you this. I've used it twice for ~45 minutes and had no issues. It does pick the rear wheel up maybe 4 or 5 inches, so I'd definitely recommend getting a riser block for the front wheel, otherwise you'll be in a rather awkward position.Build quality seems pretty good, it feels good and solid and the bike doesn't rock around in it at all. Machining on the flywheel and the roller looks excellent. An all around good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little trainer","review":"Works like a charm, couldn't ask for anything better.

Ideally, I'd probably have to move this to the basement or use it on a concrete floor (ie: garage).Pros:-Sturdy-No assembly requiredCons:-Loud"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I got this trainer after reading the reviews. Most were positive with only a few complaints about not having enough resistence. I figured since I was going to use a mountain bike and I am not a hard core cyclist it would be enough. I was wrong. I am young, 24, and in good shape so this was simply not enough to provide a decent work out. This would be enough if you are over the hill and needing something cheap and live by the rule, any work out is better than no work out (which I agree with). The noise was bad but not unbearable. I had to put the TV on full volume in order to hear it though.

First the pros: Amazon shipped it quick and packed safely. Very easy to set up and I was riding quickly. CONS: Virtually no resistance, even in the highest gear (21). The resistance knob has a threaded rod that rests inside an indentation on the frame. Cranking down on the knob causes the threaded rod to walk out of this indentation...bad design. And I did not distort the tire when cranking up the resistance. I ended up using a piece of wire to hold the rod in place. NOISY, I tried knobby tires and regular, same result. Bottom line: Don't buy this.....save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great excersize machine","review":"I personally enjoy my trainer, but it is a little noisy, I changed the off-road tire, to a cruiser tire, and even though it's not as nobby the new tire still makes some noise, and I am in an apartment complex, so I excersize mid day, just so I do not disturb the neighbors.It really is a great tool, but a little noisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy, easy set up","review":"This is an excellent product. The build quality is solid and the ease of set up is fantastic - just place the bike and tighten the bolts. There is nothing to assemble on the unit, or disassemble on the bike. Yes, there is some noise associated with its use, but that is the case for all products of its kind. There are a couple things that can be done to mitigate the noise issue. First is use street tires, not nobby off road mountain bike tires. Second, use more tension so the roller is more firmly pressing on the tire and then use a lower gear so that the roller does not spin as fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trainer","review":"This is a great first trainer.

The structure itself is strong, does not look cheap and no assembling required. I wish the rotator was adjustable to set a stronger resistance but the price on those models are more than double.Some people reviews say it is a bit noisy but since I have mine in the living room and I use it while watching TV it makes very easy to ignore the noise. Specially if watching American Funniest Videos at night! =)It works for those days it is too dark/cold/hot to go bike outside. It definely has helped to increase my biking resistance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier to use than I thought","review":"This product was extremely easy to set up as well as to use. There is no assembly required - five minutes from opening the box to riding your bike!! One recommendation I would make to all users is that the trainer works best with road tires. The treads on trail tires create a loud sound and vibration while spinning. It still works fine, but the sound and vibration get a little annoying after awhile. Overall I was impressed with this trainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bike Trainer","review":"I am not enthusiastic bike rider.

I did not use the central axle that is provided with the package.The rack itself supports my bike's axle nicely so didn't see why I would need the extra axle.I also don't mind the noise, kind of see it as part of the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISY!","review":"This is a decent product, fairly sturdy in construction, cheap, and requires no assembly. That being said - it is way, way too loud to be enjoyable for me. I live in a small apt, so I worry about the noise the neighbors have to hear. If neighbor noise is not an issue for you, might be ok. But even without considering the neighbors, this thing is so loud that i can't hear the tv or stereo while riding. Just not a pleasant experience. Also, I found that the level of resistance was insufficient at any gear - it is possible that with some adjustment it would be better, but I haven't gotten that to happen. Also - you will definitely need to purchase a stabilizer for the front wheel - and I recommend getting a good one that is heavy enough to actually stabilize the bike. Last thought - though it requires no assembly, attaching the bike can be kind of tough, and you will likely need a partner to hold the bike while you do so. Another negative for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps me off the roads","review":"It's been so good to me. It's such a life saver. It keeps me warm and indoors and off the streets. Um... I don't know what to write... it works!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy, too little resistance","review":"I returned this item and was unfortunately charge a large s&h; fee to return it.Problems:1) Even on the highest gear with ha mountain bike, there was way too little resistance to get a workout. If I use street bike tires, it's as if I'm just moving my feet (practically no workout). I might as well just lift the bike in the air and put weights on my feet.2) With mountain bike tires, it's unbearably noisy. It's worse than putting an index card near the tire (like kids to to make a motorcycle noise). The noise is so unbearable, I can't peddle faster (not because of the resistance), peddling faster causes pain to the ears.For the cost of one of these trainers, you should really just pay a bit more for an exercise bike. Unless you're a hardcore biker that *needs* to train on the bike s/he will be racing in. Unfortunately exercise bikes tend to have a smaller radius than a normal bike, which is why I thought this would be a good idea--I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"I bought this item so I could continue riding my bike through the tough Chicago winters.

Before long, I also got the same type of visit from several other neighbors. After about a week, this item went into storage. I probably should just sell it, because as long as I live in this condo, I won't be able to use it, because of the noise.The item works well, it's just extremely loud.

These pieces of steel are razor sharp,seriously, and they protrude, making them a serious hazard. I was lucky. Someone else will not be. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

The construction of the trainer feels sturdy and well built. I would be surprised if I didn't get a hundred or more hours out of this.Also want to say, very impressed with Amazon's delivery service.

The only way to keep the knee pads up is to strap them on very tight, causing enough discomfort behind my knees that I have to loosen the straps. When I kneel down, most of the time the pads shift over to the side leaving my knees exposed. Add to this the fact that the pads are almost three times heavier than my old knee pads, and the spandex material really makes me sweat. I know that good quality tools and equipment usually costs more, and I have no problem spending money on products I use daily in my business.

The entire premise of this pad is flawed in that the gel packet is not fixed inside of the cap allowing it to move out of place and then the packet itself has little channels in it so the gel stuff moves away from the point of greatest load where you need the protection most. After about five minutes on your knees, the gel has oozed off to the side, the neoprene (completely stretched out after two weeks use) has allowed the exterior plastic cap to slide over as well, and your knee is wedged against the edge of the plastic cap. I had very high hopes and was terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patella Pain Pads","review":"I am an avid weekend carpenter and like to wear knee protection to help save wear and tear on my knees. I recently wore out a $17 pair of basic knee pads from my local supply store. I had heard about these Patella pads and thought I'd give them a try. They are pricey, but if comfortable, that would be OK. I have to tell you that these pads have a serious design flaw. The gel pads do not stay in position during use. The strap system they have looks great with nice velcro strips, but they are not effective in holding the pads in place. Plus, the abrasion on the back of your legs is more painful that not wearing knee pads at all. Save some cash and buy the G3 Ultra gel pads, or the basic $17 ones from HD, both are far better than these Patella pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but the best you'll find","review":"I've been an electrician for more than 20 years, and have the shredded knee cartilage to prove it.

To keep them up without interrupting circulation, you need to take some care in strapping them on: follow the instructions, and watch out for wrinkles in your pant legs.

If I wear them over jeans, they slide everywhere, unless I cinch them down to the point of the pad becoming a torniquet. If I wear them when I have shorts on, its like having two sheets of 60 grit sandpaper rubbing against the back of my knee all day.

For those unfamiliar, HDCDs play the music back at 20 bit resolution instead of CDs 16 bit resolution when the player can support it (check your owners manual). The increase in digital data is audible. Her voice sounds rich and the instruments really come alive. This album is beautiful in its spaciousness and the increase in fidelity only adds to that. If you can imagine, the sounds is actually more relaxing than the CD version. Oddly, the HDCD designation appears nowhere on the this site or on the packaging. I guess it is an easter egg.

Although I sympathise with the emotional connection of audiences with characters that look like them, I do feel that 'It's A Wonderful Life' was a universal story and that 'The Preacher's Wife' was just a black version of it that didn't improve upon the story. It was an enjoyable film to watch, but one couldn't help being overwhelmed with the tones of 'It's A Wonderful Life' ringing in the distance.There were, however, some redeemable qualities to it. It teamed up Whitney Houston with Denzel, as well as Gregory Hines as supporting artist and Courtney B.

Also it is just my wife and myself and these were not sitting in water or abused.Besides not being dishwasher safe the finish seems very poor. I thought I was getting a decent brand but this is not the old Oneida that we grew up with as kids where the silverware took a licking and looked great (or at least didn't rust).Cost cutting and exporting jobs overseas is clearly apparent in the lousy quality.

The inclusion of obscure unknown artists, inplace of major players is a waste of time and money.I suggest saving your money on this DVD, and getting something else.

The holes are small and uniformly drilled. It does not play according to any type of scale that I recognize although it is possible to adjust the pitch of the notes by changing your breath pressure or fingering to try to approach a scale. The lower notes are especially prone to pitch variation due to pressure changes. The biggest problem with this is the tone. The instrument is much quieter than a recorder or a penny whistle.

Bette kinda steals the show as the rich, stuck up wife who is rather standoffish as she seems as if she's better than others in her own mind.

It's definitly real.","review":"I don't know what you guys are talking about this book being fake sounding and none of this could ever happen, but it could. Just take a look around your local high school or even middle school, it's happening right before your very eyes, you are just missing it. I even know people with a similar story. How is this fake at all ? It inspires many people and teaches them about the world that drugs really is, not what it just seems to be. If you think this is fake fine, but read it anyways. It will teach you something you probably never knew before and will teacher teenagers all over about things that may seem great until looked at thoroughly. Nothing is as good as it seems and that is perceived in this book quite clearly, and should be a required read for people of all ages. I strongly reccomend it not only as a person who has read it and it helped me through some times, but as someone who wants to help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problems in Go Ask Alice","review":"Alice never really liked her life, and decided to enter the world of drugs. In the book Go Ask Alice written by an anonymous author. Alice does some really bad things. Also Alice falls for this boy but all he does is cause her way more trouble. Alice meets a new friend \\"Chris\\" and they decide to get away from drugs and move far away from home. They now live in a \\"rat hole\\" as Alice would call it, and they are barely cutting it on the money.I wouldn't really say that I like Alice. The things that she does make me think of her in a different point of view. I would never do the things she does.Alice undergoes a huge change during this story; she goes from kind of a good girl, to hating her life, to doing horrible things.Go Ask Alice is more of an adult or older teen book, and I wouldn't recommend it to younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is full of truth","review":"I have read this book well over 5 times. Every time it gets better and better. I can ralate to a lot of what Alice went through.(drugs etc...) She reveals the raw truth about drugs and how they can screw with your life. I often think of what she could have been and would have done if she hadn't died in that way. I am so curious to know how her death really happened. Someone out there knows. I think this book will open peoples eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Ask Alice is one of the most boring books I've ever read","review":"Go Ask Alice is a diary written by a teenager, who gets involved with drugs and the anxiety that comes along with it. This book did not appeal to me very much, the book was boring and some of the plot repeated itself; she tries drugs, swears she won't do it again, then gets on drugs again, then swears to not do it again, very boring. This book seemed very unrealistic, how in the world do a 15 year old and a 16 year old manage to get an apartment, open and work in their own boutique shop?I don't recommend this book to anyone; it is a very boring book, also very unrealistic. You'll want to put the book down within the first few pages, even watching paint dry has even more action and interest than reading Go Ask Alice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I read this book over ten years ago (in sixth grade) after it was recommended by fellow students and a teacher. From what I remember, it was a cult favorite written to us in an unbiased way. I feel that it was effective to read it as a child/preteen for it wasn't just words coming from an adult lecturing us; it was like Alice was our *friend*, not just explaining how drugs ruined her life, but *showing* us in a non-degrading manner. She is honest. I highly recommend this book to any teenager. And as far as fifteen year olds being a little too naive about drugs, that is untrue. There are many kids (like myself) who knew nothing and were afraid to ask due to the boundaries set by our parents. So read Go Ask Alice and be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"When I was younger my mother would never let me read this book. I guess its because of the drugs and other things involved. Its a great book and I think teens should read it. I could not put it down once I picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and easy read","review":"I read this book in less than 3 hours. It was an easy read, yet well enjoyed. At the beginning of the first page I felt as if I was Alice's best friend, or better yet, Alice herself. The entries made me feel like I was experiencing was she was going through, and it really made me look at all the things I don't have to go through every day.This was a nice book to if you'd like to read about some of the teenage lives going on around you.The ending was shocking, and it just shows how much she needed her diary to keep her well."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a page turner","review":"This journal is absolutely amazing.You end up feeling like you are her diary- who she is confiding in and you wish you could reply to her. This was an emotional roller coaster and eventhough it ends on such a twisted, sad note, it left an impression greater than any other fictional story could. No person should leave this book untouched. I strongly believe there is something for everyone to get out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"This bookfirst caught my eye when they had my name on it. Alice. So i picked up the book and read the back of it. It was very interesting, i thought, to read about a girls life intangled with drugs. I wondered how it would be like, and that is why i chose to read this book.When i read it at first, I thought her life woul end right then and there! With sucha scary life, i doubt she would continue on living. The really interesting part is how she describes how it feels like when she is drugged. The scariest part was when she was overdosed with a \\"bummer\\" and started hallucinating and injured herself in the process.The book gives a good view of the character, what she has been through and no detail is missed. It gives you a thorough mind of how drugs can ruin your life, and many kids who read it will figure out the message that drugs is really bad. I hope this book influences kids to not take drugs. This book is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book could be a LIFE-SAVER!","review":"go ask alice...the diary of a drug-user, and probably one of the most scariest book i have ever read--it breaks the rules, shatters the real world and tells you in a real honest message that this world is not what we think it is. go ask alice is not only a diary, but a groundbreaking documentary on the real world...an artifact of horrifying reality, and the provocative meaning of using drugs. go ask alice is not only a life-saver, but a book written that goes at full-force, and doesn't foreshadow, a book that read to its fullest. one of the best books ever released. you want some drugs? GO ASK ALICE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is truly touching.","review":"This book is truly touching as it shows the reality of what it's like to take drugs.

I am a 14 year old who was assigned this book and couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sure fire tear jerker.","review":"I like this book. Written by a young girl who is shy and unsure, it documents her gradual decline into thee world of LSD and pot. It isn't as good as The Basketball Diaries by Jim Carroll, but only because she is a little boring, and her life before the drugs really isn't interesting. If you read it, you will like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"go ask who?","review":"I used to like this book when I thought it was the real diary of a teenage girl who used drugs. Then I found out it was actually written by Beatrice Sparks who has written lots of \\"anonymous\\" teen diaries. It's not bad to write an anti drug story but tell it like it is. Don't degrade your readers by lying to them.

While this may sound abrasive, I find that people who felt that way were captured by the typical \\"I feel sorry for people like that and I'm a humanitarian.\\" The book was full of whining and unrealistic details. I say unrealistic because it has been revealed that Go Ask Alice is actually a book written by Beatrice Sparks. This book is for the reader intrested in something short but very deep. Everything is mostly straight forward but parts of the story can become very confusing. I did not like the book, but that doesn't mean I'm not a humanitarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember What The Door Mouse Said","review":"I've just read this book and I'd like to say that I relate to Alice very much. Not that I'm a big drug addict or anything, but that I'm a teenager. I think alot of teenagers feel the same way as Alice and that we all have the oppurtunity to slip into a world of drugs. Some of us more than others and I know I've certainly had the chance and I hope that I never submit to these temptations. The world of durgs that Alice has fallen into is very real to me, I could see myself standing in the shadows with Alice. Usually when I read a book I can envision the room, the people, and every minut detail, but for this book I couldn't. In those respects I didn't feel it deserved five stars. Personally I love to read and feel that every book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling a kinship to Alice","review":"I've read this book many times. I thought it was well written and she had a talent for writing. It's too bad she never knew that. I could relate to this young girl as she never really fit in--even in her own family. It must of been devastating to her poarents to read her diary and realized that she wanted to confide in them but they wouldn't listen. I hope this book makes people think twice about giving people drugs without their knowledge. I felt so sorry for her. She never had a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ask Alice","review":"Go Ask Alice is happy and sad, funny and serious, and comforting and scary at the same time.

After that it is all up and down. She runs away two times and when she comes back, with the help of her family, she gets off them. But somehow she is back on them when she runs away again. This story takes place in a variety of locations like San Francisco and Berkeley. This nonfiction is an exciting, quick book that I think everyone should read, only if you're over 13 though, due to some strong language and lots of drug reference, it's more for the mature reader.

Thank you for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"This book is nothing but stupid anti-drug fiction.

Is crack cocaine the same as caffeine?Because something is classified as a 'drug', does that make it unsuitable as a medicine? Are there any beneficial qualities to marijuana? No, just what the government tells us to believe.

I recomend it to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drug War Hype","review":"This is an entertaining bit of fluff designed to frighten teens. Anybody who believes that this is really a diary written by a drug addict would have to be incredibly naive. It is clearly scripted, with limited credibility, and leads young readers into false assumptions about drugs. The book is potentially damaging because as soon as adolescents uncover one of its lies, they begin to doubt everything it contains. Yes, drug addiction is nasty and harsh, but this is not how it happens. Check out 'Permanent Midnight' or 'Junky' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storytime!","review":"This book is definitely entertaining, but is a work of fiction. And, while I thought this was a very good story, I was curious about a couple of things. Part of the \\"diary\\" was said to be written on scraps of paper, paper bags, etc. How interesting that a drug-addicted runaway managed to keep track of all those bits and pieces! In addition, how many young teenagers would use the word \\"echelon\\"? So I award this work one star due to deception, and very bold deception at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake!","review":"When I first bought this book,I loved it.I cried at the end for poor Alice.My feelings have changed since I found out that it was not written by a teenage girl who died of an od back in the 60's ,but by a middle aged therapist.

I was expecting something so much better based on the reviews I had heard about it throughout the years. It is not well-written in the slightest, and also completely fictitious, by the way. I found it extremely tedious, uninteresting, and wildly unrealistic. In fact, I actually had to skim the last 50 or so pages just to be done with this ridiculous book. Besides the fact that it claims to be something it's not (a real diary of some teen drug addict), it's just not even a good book on its own merit. Please, please don't waste your time. Read something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for all Teens!","review":"This book was so good and had me reading it without putting it down.

You should definatly read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was excellent! Definately a reader...","review":"I thought this book was great.

I am A teenager, like Alice in this book. As I read it I was able to relate to so much of what she was saying. This book really showed me what it's like to do drugs, and truthfully, it turned me off of the idea. Alice's life seemed so perfect and normal, untill she started \\"shooting up\\". She was hurt mentaly and physicaly. This book was a true eye-opener for me, It has helped me be able to say \\"no\\".

I checked out this book from my school's library for my book report on whether or not said book of my choosing is considered seriously literature. Spoiler alert: It's not. At all. I don't understand why this novel is on the banned books list; or rather it's there because it's just that terrible of a novel? I may come off as harsh, but I have never read a book this bad since Twilight. And that, my friends, is saying something.People, if you're checking out whether or not to read this book, click on the 1-star reviews and read those first. It seems those people are the only ones that realise what a sham this book is.

Drugs are bad and that is all that was really said for many years, but this books show's you the effects and dangers that go along with them.

Yes it's realistic for that time period, but not for now. This book is about a girl who is so stupid she barely realizes what she is doing. She does drugs, has sex when she's \\"trippin\\" ... She is completely uneducated about drugs, and for me her stupidity was annoying. I would rather read information about kids on drugs in our world today, because it would seem more realistic. I love to read, and I have to say this is one of the few books I had some real difficulty getting through because of how idiotic Alice was. Overall, I just want to say that if you read often and are used to main characters whith intelligance who live in a time period closer to ours then don't read this book. However is you like sad stories and stupidity doesn't annoy you, this book is one I think you would find enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake!","review":"I read this book a few years ago and loved it. As someone who had some very troubled childhood years, I identified with the character. Now I have learned that this book is not an anonymous diary of a teenage girl.

It won't, and even worse, it isn't real. It is not a real diary, it was created to scare people off drugs.

It is a great read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Journey","review":"My daughter read this book as one of a selection of books to read for a school book report. I looked at it with dismay- the sex, the drugs, the emotional turmoil of it all, worried me. Then I observed as my daughter drank it all in. She was totally involved, she asked questions, reasoned through the problems Alice experienced, and laughed and cried with her exploits. At the end of the book she had learned, experienced and wondered at it all.

Anyone with a basic knowledge of drugs knows the following:1-Smoking pot is not addictive in the sense that you'll be selling yourself to get it.2-Acid is not addictive3-you cannot OD on pot and acidso essentially this book was written by a religous loony tune who not only never did drugs in her life, bot also feels that it's ok to LIE to your kids about drug use, like they LIE about how jerking off will make you blind...it's just as stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved this book.

I highly reccomend this book, for parents of teens, for teens, for children, for anyone looking to see the truth behind drug use. There has to be some way for everyone in America to read this book. If you are thinking of buying it....do so. If you can't afford to buy it, go to your local library and check it out. It will be well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ask Alice","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Many emotions that this girl feels are very easy to relate to my own life because these are so true of what a teenager feels. Being a teen myself, I related to the young girl. It was intersting reading about her life, and her experiences and how she handled these hard times. By reading this story, you are living this girls life. These diary entries are so vivid and detailed. You feel her pain and understand how she is feeling, but on a mental level it is hard to read the reality of this girls life, and to see what reality does to her. Through her experiences I have learned no matter how much support you get, YOU need to fix your life because no one else can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teenagers struggle with life","review":"Go Ask Alice is a book about a teen struggling with drug abuse and pressure from friends.

Alice has problems with her family and friends, which many people do. I think this is a book that many readers might be able to relate to because it deals with many of life?s problems. Also it is very interesting to read about all the things this one girl went through in only two years. This book provides a good message about teen drug use and has a powerful message as to what can happen from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a good book, read Go Ask Alice","review":"This was one book that was hard to put down. It showed a girls life of drugs, sex and teenage problems through her eyes. This book has made me think twice aobut drugs and sex. And it should make you think twice too. Alice started out as a \\"normal\\" teenager then turned to a drug addict and then to a straight-edge teenager. Through out her whole experience she became wiser. She was no longer nieve but smart. Each and every experience had a lesson for her to learn. And we learned those lessons right along with as we read the book. This was a book to learn lessons from and share them with our friends. So if you want a big that you won't be able to put down til your finished, read Go Ask Alice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book inspires me because it made me think twice.It's about a young girl who tells about her life in a dairy how she was raped,did drugs,and lived in the streets and how she survived.This is a very emtional book but great it almost brougt tears to my eyes.I thought this book is great. It's a great book because I know someone who can relate to this book and I highly recommend this book to her because it might change her mind about things."},{"rating":"2","title":"As compelling as it was thirty years ago","review":"This book first came out thirty years ago and twenty years ago was when I first read it.

I give it a very high recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best ever","review":"I have just finished this book and I found it totally insperational.

I really am not a person who enjoys reading that much, but every so often I find a book that I absolutley love-and this is one of them...it has to be one of my favorites! It's especially good to read because this could really happen...I'm about her age and I know people who are kind of like that-and it's really good to read this so you can see what happens to people like this-it's so really it's scary...it was very emotional for me...I strongly recommend this book-in fact I recommended it to many of my friends...This is definately a book you have to read sometime in your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"!!! URGHHH !!!","review":"\\"Go Ask Alice\\" is a book about a girl who does drugs and pays for her actions in the end. I suppose that this COULD be an alright cautionary tale to those who do drugs or those who are being pressured to do drugs, but I mean, C'MON, PEOPLE!!! It doesn't take a genius to figure out that this was a load of bull by a shrink who was probably crazy herself. Dr. S. often controdicts herself from page to page. 'Alice' will be all like, \\"I hate drugs\\" and then she'll be smoking who-knows-what out back within the hour.

Now I find out that it is just pure propaganda. Curses on you, Dr. Sparks! btw, I smoked a few joints in college and have enjoyed a productive, happy life in which I vote Republican, drive my children to ballet lessons, have a satisfying and exciting professional career, a blissful marriage (to a guy who ate a few wacky brownies in his day) and am in fabulous health without an acid trip, needle mark, or destroyed nose cartilege to my name."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't written by a teenager at all","review":"It's an open secret that this book wasn't written by a teenage girl at all -- it's thinly-veiled propaganda that purports to be a picture of the adolescent experience.

If you search far and long enough, you will find many of these \\"real-life dramas\\" written by \\"anonymous\\" victims. There is one story in particular that deals with satanic worship and follows the \\"Go Ask Alice\\" formula exactly. They are practically the same book, just replace every drug reference in Alice with \\"Satan\\", \\"Dark Lord\\", or \\"His Hoofed Highness\\", and you have another inspiring tale of a teen engaged in a life or death battle to overcome that which is immoral (I think this \\"victim\\" goes by the name of Stan).The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that the \\"Anonymous\\" author of Go Ask Alice is indeed a 70-year-old man with no writing skills whatsoever, living in Texas on a government pension, and with a history of drug-use that is limited to his twice-daily dose of Lipitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda!","review":"This book was obviously written to scare kids away from drugs.

It kept me reading it which is usually a challenge. I however did not enjoy it. Reading about a girl who gets hooked on drugs and is dumb about it all is not interesting to me. I did cry though once while reading it. I also wonder what she thinks about people reading her diary. I know i would never want people to read my diary after i die even if it is to inform the public about how things really are.

Anyone can read this book, but it is more directed towards the teenage youth especially teenage girls. There are definitely some interesting parts in this book, but more then anything is it confusing. As a guy I didn't really like this book because it's not something I relate to. Some things I did understand and then there are just things in this book that you think the writer might not understand. If you proceed to read this book your feelings toward the book will change as you move along through it. I recommend this book to teenage girls because they can understand the author of the diary more then a guy would, however this book might scare all teenage kids about drugs.

This girl's life was amazing and throughout the book I kept routing for her to get off the drugs and turn her life around because I know that she really wanted to. All through the book she kept saying how she wanted to do good and didn't need the drugs, but every time she would get off them she would get right back on. I know that when I am fifteen I will never be able to do the things that she did. She ran away for months at a time to completely different states. She was so independent and able to make her own decisions with out the help of others. She was really impressive. Although I really enjoyed the entire book I was disappointed in the ending.

I read this book as a Jr High School kid... scare me off drugs? Hardly. What it did was reinforce the common belief held by kids in my class that adults lie. They lie a lot. Rather shameful that this book was ever included as official school assigned reading. \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\"... there's a REAL diary for you. \\"Are you there God? It's me Margaret\\"... there's a BETTER work of fiction for kids to read.

I did not enjoy the book for two reasons:1- Too depressing2- Too annoyingExplination- Go Ask Alice was depressing because of the many rollercoaster rides she takes you through. The book was annoying because Alice plays a helpless girl that lets the world stomp on her and than expect the world to know what she's thinking.Bottom Line- Go Ask Alice gets 1 star from me mainly because the predictability of it- every time you turn the page- more complaining. I understand that the book is based on a real girls troubles and her real diary- however, the reading process is one that should be joyful, suspenseful, and wonderful- not depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Too True","review":"I am not one who sits down to read often and when I do read it takes me a few weeks to finish a book!

The subject has so many personalitlies throughout this book and dose things that she would never do at the beginning or throughout, drugs or no drugs. It sounds like someones trying to stamp into your head that drugs can ruin your life, and this is what they do. Sometimes there is no real reason for the main charecter to be doing whatever. An interesting read, but not to factual. There are better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I remember my friends reading this in high school and insisting that I had to as well. My initial thoughts were that it was a little strange how this girl could be so strung out on drugs but kept on faithfully recording everything in her diary. My next thought was that there probably wasn't an Alice and that a grown up had written it in order to scare young girls away from drugs. Well, now I've found out that my instincts were right. The preachy tone of this book just reminds me of driver's ed videos and those cheesy anti-marijuana pictures in the seventies. Wanting to let kids know about the dangers of drugs is an honorable mission, but to do it in such a manipulative way is really inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is fake","review":"This book is fake. Fake, fake, fake. Check it out on Snopes.com (the urban legend debunking website) if you don't believe me.

The reason I enjoyed it the most was because I liked the topic it was based on; it just reminded me of things that go on in this world still today. I think this book was a non-fiction book because it was this girl's own personal diary. It was all in her own words and all of it was how she felt about drugs, people, and life. In this book you also never find out the girl's name. But she was smart when she was in school; she had friends on and off, and I think she was only using drugs to fit in with her friends. The worst parts in the book, besides what happens at the end, is when she is in a asylum. While she was there she was really freaking out; she was seeing bugs that were eating at her body. They ate out all the skin on her hands (so she says)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book everyone should read","review":"I started reading Go Ask Alice in reading class because I thought it sounded interesting.I read it in about a week and a half because it was so good.

The girl in this exciting story informs you on how she got into her bad habits. In the book Go Ask Alice, you find out that people judge you by who you hang out with and what you do. You also learn that peer pressure has a big influence on yourself.My personal opinion on this book is that it is an execellent, but I think u need to be mature enough to handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didnt like it","review":"Me personaly I didnt like it.

So I bought the book and started reading it. I was quite caught up in it at first, then it all when downhill just like Alice. Yes she was tricked her first time, but she was ready and willing her second and third and fourth. I felt no sorrow for her at all, she knew what she was getting into when she resorted back to her old ways. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.

It is a very emotial diary of a teenager whos life pretty much ends when she does drugs. Being a teenage my self this book made me relieve all the bad stuff that can happen if you do drugs. I mean, I knew what happens when you do drugs, becuase we learn about it in school. But this book touched me on a more personal note. It made me feel like Alice was someone i knew doing drugs and ruining their life. It steers me way away from ever even thinking about doing drugs. They are stupid and a bad thing.

Go ask Alice is not so much of a book, but a diary she writes in about her life. Alice talks about her life and beyond. Her life starts out great, but she gets turned around and starts hanging out with people that do drugs. She gets addicted and starts experimenting with more drugs (LSD) and becomes careless about her life. Flaunting her body off and has been doing immoral behavior. She tries to quit but she is just too addictive to them. She finds her self-growing away from her family as time goes on. Traveling to big cities, she rides with truck drivers to get where she wants to go, and living in run downed apartments. Alice then starts to get her life back on track, but then something happens.

It's not written by some brilliant writer but merely a 15 y/o girl writing her most personal and intimate thoughts in her diary. It goes through her most terribly painful and wonderfully joyful experiences as a teenager. This girl goes through some of the worst things imaginable that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I definately think that parents of adolescents should read this book and if they think thier children are mature enough to handle it, encourage their children to read it too. This book opened to my eyes, not only to the world of teenage drug use but to the teenagers thoughts, and to the addiction. I will never forget this book as long as I live and I definately reccomend it to anyone with an open mind looking to be truely touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a very interesting genre of book.

I wouldn't have questioned it when I was younger, but as an older \\"wiser\\", more experienced person...I do have my doubts. The argument that the book is fictional is that it brings out just about every drug stereotype we've all heard before, the sexual abuse and promiscuity, the evil-druggie friends that torment her when she's off drugs, the gateway she follows into other drugs, etc... However, we could also argue that these stereotypes weren't just pulled out of thin air, they really do happen. It is quite possible that \\"Alice\\" did exist and did write this beautiful yet tragic and heart-wrenching journal of her young life. Does it really matter? Not to me. It's a TRUE TO LIFE tale, and that's all that really needs to be known."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that will truly go to the heart!","review":"After reading this book I saw what drugs REALLY do to your life.

Drugs aren't just something teachers don't want you to do, it's something YOU don't want to do. This book showed the struggle Alice experienced, the pain and suffering. You don't just take drugs and, boom, you die. There's an in between that's true Hell. I recommend this book to all teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book will make you think before doing things.","review":"I read this book twice and i am 14 years old.

One day she goes over a girl's house and the girls friends spike her drink with LSD. This is the first time she's ever done any kind of drug and it is scary but yet exciting to her. After she has done this, she wants to try weed. Then, her whole future goes down hill from here on.. She goes from being homeless, raped, and mentally abused and has to deal with deaths in her family all at the same time. She even ends up in an institution but that's all I'm going to give away.

It is a true story and sad to say a lot of teenagers can relate to this book in so many ways. Most all teenagers feel like they have noone to turn to noone who cares and nothing matters anymore so they go down the wrong road. In this book alice tried drugs unwillingy; from there on it went down hill she started doing this she would never do selling drugs haveing sex for drugs running away from home. When things started to get better for her they actually just got worse so end the end she went crazy and I will let you read the book to fiqure it out.

Don't think you the only one out there, a young girl by the name of Alice can relate. She's growing up in a rocky house hold with no one to talk to but her diary. She's experiencing things she's never been interested in and finding herself in some trouble. This is a great book to read to realize your not the only one out there dealing hard everyday problems. I just hope that after you read this book you decide to deal with these problems in a much smarter way than Alice."},{"rating":"2","title":"You cannot ask Alice anymore...","review":"Go Ask Alice is a book that I believe that all teenagers can at somepoint relate to. I am sure that many teenagers have tried or will at some point try drugs. This story is about a troubled girl, who at somepoint realized that she needed help, but she may have been too late. She starts out as a totally inocent child, but then she gets int trouble with boys, and she has to leave her hometown, which she may have been happy about at the time, but maybe not in the long run. She meets people that do drugs and drink acohol, but she thinks she would never get into that, but then a thing called peer pressure kicked in"},{"rating":"2","title":"Added to collection years later...","review":"I read this book when I was in the 5th grade and I believe it changed my life (accelerating me on a path I was destined to go on anyway) and so now at the age of 26 I remembered that book and thought to myself, \\"I want to add that book to my current collection because it was so significant in my life at one time.\\"I don't know if I recommend it to young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"A great read for those interested in learning how dabbling around in drugs can lead to destruction in life.That being said, this is a personal favorite which I have read multiple times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whether fact or fiction...","review":"It is still a great book that all teens should read.Personally, if it was fiction,I have no problem with the author lying to me about that because it makes the story all the better.

Being 14 and reading this book that totally relates to kids my age really overcame my fear of turning out like this girl did.

Once I started the book, I would not have finished it except it was one of our book club selections. It is a painful read - not because of the supposed trials and tribulations of a troubled teenager, but because it is an obvious fraud. I knew every word I was reading was a lie. It is an absolute insult to think anyone could honestly believe this was written by a 15 year old. Maybe unknowing adults in the 1970's would have believed there was some authenticity to the chain of events, but I think most adults would have been able to recognize the writing style is not that of a 15 year old. The words used; the expressions used; none of it is from the perspective of a 15 year old. I would think, almost 40 years later, this book would be sold for what it really is - a lousy work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, just as I enjoy reading a lot of other books but it was completely unrealistic. I mean, what kind of stoners would torment and pick on someone like that? It's absurd. Seriously, have you ever met a mean stoner??? Tell the truth. They're not bad people. I know this from first hand experience. All of the stoners I've met are really nice, sharing, loving, and caring. And that's kind of dumb that the author said it was based on a real diary when that was a lie! Oh yea, I'll just make up this story about a girl who does drugs then realizes drugs are bad - then all the kids will stop doing drugs, right? I think not. Liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book should not be read a factual history of one teenager's personal experience with drugs and a runaway lifestyle, as it presented. It is a fictional account written by an adult who imagines what Alice's life must be like. Yes some parts may be believable, but most passages seem too shallow and stereotypical to be real. It is badly written and overly preachy. I was at many of the geographical locations mentioned by Alice during the time of her supposed travels. Most of the specific places she describes are fictional and never existed. If you want books with real teen experience go find the books of S. E. Hinton. I would not purchase this book for teens. To recommend this book would be a diservice to intelligent young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"really annoying book","review":"I had to read this for school,and I dont believe a single word of this \\"real diary\\" The girl is just too clueless but knows too much at the same time. I am a teenager and I know how a teenager thinks. The main proof that this can't be true is that she writes in her diary when she's supposed to be drugged and dellusional. In these parts you see how her morals change but somehow she stays perfectly rational. She doesnt act like a real teenager,or like a real person for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and heart wrenching.","review":"This was hard to put down.

It send us into the life of a young teenager's journey into the drug world, which is portrayed as being quit terrifying. The only thing is that it says that it is edited by Beatrice Sparks. Know, this obviously means copying Alice's journal into a book form, writing dates, and figuring out what fuzzy words are, but what else could it mean? Could it mean that she added in some extra-anti drug statements, just to justify her point of, \\"Drugs are bad?\\" This question remains unclear, but other than that it is still a fantastic book describing the horrors of a (fictional or non-fictional) young girl and her tragic life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen here- I don't like this editor!","review":"I've read this story. Several times. And I take it as a good piece of fiction. Note the word fiction. I read another book, Jay's Journal, edited by the same person. I noticed repititions of lines and story patterns. I noticed the same basic message. This writing is manipulative. Perhaps these journals once existed. Perhaps not. But I believe that Sparks's editing was flawed. She used others' words to bring across her own point, and twisted them in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please! Don't waste time or money on this book...","review":"because it might have BEEN something special if read by an 11 year old, but anyone over that age or anyone who has had any experience with substances will find this book laughable.It's certainly not an accurate portrayal of LSD or Pot use... it's more like a desperate anti-drug commercial written by someone with little if any real-life experience with the drugs that are mentioned in the book.The author (certainly NOT Alice!) should have done some real-life research before making a fool of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, Lies, and Lies","review":"I had to read this book for a project.

Go read it for yourself and see. Sorry I'm not including the link- that's against the review guidelines. Anyway- Snopes is a great site for getting to the root of urban legends like this one. They have researched this book, and found that just as we all suspect (25-30 years later) that it is a bogus diary written by someone who wants to keep kids off drugs and is willing to lie to do so.As said earlier- their heart is probably in the right place, but this is not an accurate portrayal of drug use- either at the time it was written or now."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE UP!!

DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I read this book in college for a children's lit class. I was not impressed. It is a melodramatic look at the evils of drugs. It reads like a bad after school special, created to frighten teenagers and warn them never to experiment with drugs of any kind. Also, despite the lore following this novel, it was not written by a teenager. Read the novel if must, but there are definitely better books out there about drug usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ask Alice Review","review":"Go Ask Alice is about a normal girl whose life gets out of control after taking drugs. She starts small and tells herself that she won't do any more but she can't stop. I liked this book because of the realism of the plot. I liked how it was very personal and showed all her thoughts. I think making it a diary made the book a lot better described I liked how each day showed something else happening.I recommend this book to people in highschool who are thinking about experimenting with drugs. This book shows why you shouldn't even get into small drugs. Even though you say you won't get into any more drugs your mind won't be the same on drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake!","review":"i thought this was a good book when i was 14 or so, when i still had the nievete to think that this was a true diary....now i have re-read the book and did some research online, where i found out that this book consists of excerpts of psychology sessions, actual diary entries of an unknown number of teens, and is completely made up in places. please. if you have ever done drugs as a teenager, you know that this is one pretentious piece. When i read it last year just for old times sake, i laughed through almost the whole thing! its so stereotypical that you have to laugh, and i understand how kids especially get trapped into propaganda of this caliber. so take this FICTIOUS NOVEL with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an outstanding book","review":"This book was unbelivable. It is a wonderful book for readers of all ages. It really wakes you up to the fact of drug abuse with teenagers. I am 13 and this book made me realize the reality of using drugs. I feel that every teenager should read this book because it is an amazing book that will teach teenagers like myself about using drugs and how it can ruin you life. \\"Alice\\" was a young goody girl just like many of us think we are but she started to hang out with the wrong crowd and got into drugs. I've read this book so many times and it really helped me in making decisions about using drugs. Yeah, parent's tell thier children everyday that drugs are bad and that we shouldn't use them.

LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER TEENS, SHE ALSO FEELS NOBODY UNDERSTANDS OR HAS AS MANY PROBLEMS AS SHE DOES. AT THAT AGE TEENS ARE SO VULNERABLE AND PARENTS SEEM TO BE THE LEAST TO UNDERSTAND.

But over all it is a book that I'd reccommend all adolecents to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opening","review":"This book is a piece of reality.

The story..well actually i should call it a Diary, is about a girl named Alice that goes through some major changes in her life. She goes from a lonely girl, to a total druggie. She is into drugs throughout the whole diary. She explains every single detail through out everyday. This book has totally changed my mind on ever doing any hard core drugs.

This book is the entire reason why, even though I am surrounded everyday of my life by friends who regularly take drugs, I have always had the strength to say no. This book taught me at just the right age to be stubborn, and to hold my beliefs. When I started university, I couldn't have been more shocked at how many people, well educated and hard working, take drugs, and how many are my closest friends. For all those parents out there, this book will prove that even the most shy,innocent of people can be hooked. Do not believe your child is different. I am always proud to say that I have never taken any drugs and never will. I am sadly in a minority. I have this book to thank. It caught me before my friends did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"Do you wanna know why drugs are bad? Read this book.

Before you knew it she had fallen down the rabbit hole and was running away from home and using drugs more and more frequently.

She keeps herself a journal of everything that she was thinking all of the time. I liked the book because it had a lot of detail of how she was feeling at every moment. Overall, this book is very good but I did not like how it was very repetitive at times. I suggest that this book should be for the age of twelve years old and up. There might be a lot of drugs in this book but I think that twelve would even be a decent age to show the kids that drugs are bad and can hurt your life dramatically. I think that I would make the characters in this book have more of a part other than the main character. I highly suggest this book and I hope that you think about it for it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ask Jenna","review":"Go Ask Alice was one of the best books I have ever read. There were good parts and bad parts but it was all around a well written book. I am very interested in drugs so I found it intriguing. The book kept my attention very well and was never boring. Although, I wish it would have been longer. It was humorous to read how girls wrote back then, very preppy and proper. It was a good writing style and I enjoyed reading it. The way it was written was easy to read but also said a lot. I believe this book was totally rad grandpa."},{"rating":"1","title":"An obvious fabrication","review":"Ok, so I read this as a young teen in the mid 70s. At the time, I remember thinking it was such a frightening and realistic account of a young teen's descent into drugs. Albiet, by the time I was a young teen myself and read this for the first time, the 60s tumultuous LSD phase wasn't nearly as prevalent. Nonetheless, I was riveted. I recently found this book in my old stash of books and thought I'd re-read it. At age 44, my take on it is completely different. It doesn't take one long into the book to realize this is most definitely not written by a teenaged girl. The language isn't realistic and the diary seems so fabricated...to the point where I couldn't believe I had actually fallen for it way back when. The book seems silly to me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good leason for people to learn at a young age","review":"Like i said in the title, I really truely think that everyone should read this book.

I gave this book four stars because when i started reading it i just couldn't stop, i just had to know what happened to this pour innocent girl. Well, maybe she's not so innocent, but i surley felt bed for her. This book gives you a view of the life of a Drug addict, and how she accidently did drugs in a dangourous party game with her \\"friends\\", lead her in to the streets, and crimes, of the world. The only reason that keep me away from giving it a 5 star is because it was a very sad book, and i'm not one for those kind of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont like this book","review":"In the book Go Ask Alice there were a lot of different things about the book that I liked and that I didn't like. For some reason or another I mostly disliked this book, it was a disgusting book from the very beginning. I truly felt that this was by far the worst book that I have ever read. It was to drawn out and didn't seem real. Also, throughout the book she kept trying to convince herself that she doesn't have a problem and that got annoying. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and think that this book shouldn't be read at school due to its horrible aspects. If I could change things about this book I would pretty much change the entire thing. The story just dragged on and the ending was a horrible idea. This book is more for females because they seem to enjoy this type more. They would most likely be around fifteen to seventeen years old.

This book went into great detail and it was very surprising because I didn't think/know how horrendous and intense a drug life could be. I would recommend this book to people about thirteen and older for many reasons.

But when i was 19 i found out that 'anonymous' was not a runaway hippie girl but Beatrice Sparks, an author who has written several books like this, i felt betrayed. Knowing that this book was a novel rather than an autobiography would not have made it any less powerful, but the feeling of being betrayed and lied to truly makes me wonder if anything in that book was true. Has Beatrice even been to San Francisco? has she ever tried drugs? how does she know how they feel? or is she just a propagandist with an anti-drug/anti-homosexual agenda?

It is quite obviously fictional and not very good fiction at that.I think the purpose of this book is meant to scare people into never trying drugs. The narrarator of this diary had her life ruined by them, the book says. It's like Beatrice Sparks is saying, \\"Use LSD and you might end up in a mental home like this girl. Smoke pot and you might get so wasted you end up in another state without remembering how you got there, just like this girl.\\" That is total bull.

It helped me understand the hardships children and young adults go through and just how easy it is to fall into the drug world.Reading it has reminded me just how lucky I am and the importance of having a good, loving family.It's a great book and it makes me mad to know that it has been banned inside a lot of high schools; if these kids read anything, they should read books like this so they don't fall down the same road as the unnamed, main character.When reading this, keep in mind that it truly isn't written by an anonymously by a girl who went through the situation, it was written by Beatrice Sparks, a psychologist; it doesn't really change the affect the book has on its reader but I do feel that prospective readers deserve to know that the diary isn't a true diary from a troubled teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short","review":"I read this book a short time ago. To be honest, I wasn't impressed at all by it. The way the person spoke seemed to me as if she was perfectly \\"there\\" all the time and not under the influence of drugs. The descriptions of the feelings, I don't personally believe they achieve their truest form. I don't know but even being 14 when I read it, it didn't really impress at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"truth is important; this book is a hoax","review":"This book is a hoax. I knew it even when I read it as a teen. Another reviewer had a good point, that it may have been based on a real diary but was extremely heavily re-written. especially all the anti-drug parts. Even as a teen, it seemed too cliched, predictable, far-fetched and preachy. too much of a neatly-crafted cautionary tale.Truth is important. Lying to people for any purpose is reprehensible, even with the best of intentions at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"i dont care if this book is a hoax.... it's just so amazing, to hear a story about somebody who ruined her life, and then got on the right track after a tragic accident. i think the ending is really abrupt, which caused me to think it is maybe fake. but the story is really good, i couldn't put it down. fake or not, it's great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe","review":"Did the publisher pull this right out of a diary? I swear, the language and text are so dull, blunt, and repetative that it makes \\"Alice's\\" problems with drugs and social issues hard to relate to and understand. I became quite restless after the 3rd chapter or so, and just continued reading it so I could relate to and have a background on this so-called \\"teenage classic\\". If Everyman's Library ever put this book into their series, I swear, it's the end of great literature and influences.Personally, I enjoyed The Bell Jar much more. More intense, and a true novel of elegance and class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me See A Whole New World","review":"Go Ask Alice was a very good book, it made me really understand a-lot.

You really must read this book, it will change your life as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in a teenage world","review":"This book takes your body into a new state of mind. Every teenager goes through up's and down's throughout life, and this book shows you just that. Alice, who is barely fifteen years old get's caught up in a crowd, and her life is suddenly turned upside down. When Faced with drugs Alice will have to make some very important decisions knowing what could possibly be the biggest mistake of her life. Amazing, eye opening book for adults and teens. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandys Review for English","review":"In the book Go Ask Alice a young teenage girl turns to drugs after having a rough time with life...Go Ask Alice was a very powerful and emotional book. This poor girl lives in a world where she wants nothing more then to be accepted and for some reason she cant get it. In the outcome she turns to drugs. It puts you right in her shoes and shows exactly how she felt. It felt as though you were right there going through this experience or knew the person that was going through it. Being in high school doesn't make you understand the book more; any age person could understand this or relate to it. Having a friend taken from me from drugs made this book even more powerful. I cried so many times during this book, I would recommend it to anyone, even someone who doesn't like to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"I read this book for English class when I was 15. It's amazing! It definitely is a good read and worth the money. No moral preaching here, just what happened to Alice."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most important book I ever read","review":"I read this book when I was in 6th grade ( I am now 41 years old.) This book made such an impact on me as a teenager that I never did drugs growing up, or in my life. I now am buying the book for my kids hoping it will influence their decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it needs to do","review":"This is not a book for people to get some brain expansive vocabulary like one would recieve from an epic poem, nor is it ment to be criticed as to it's authenticity. It is intended to help young people both relate and be warned of what can and does happen. For that I give it five stars. I do not give it five stars because I believe that it is solely the writing of a young girl, nor because I believe it will increase anyones SAT scores. Instead, I give it five stars because I believe it does what it was intended to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ask Amy about Alyce","review":"This was a good book! I really liked it! It was very real, sad, happy, crazy, and just totally emotional. It's a real page turner, since this book was a diary. I could barely put it down, because it seemed like at evey page a new event would happen, and change the whole coarse of the story. Sometimes big events just come out of no where, but if you keep reading you'll eventually get caught back up in her life. You should really check it out, you'll learn about lifes problems with friends, family, drugs, happiness, etc. and how hard it can be for some people. So, thats why I really liked it.....you probably would too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have teeenage children, this book is a must!!!","review":"I first read this book at age 15 in high school. It's the diary of a girl who suffered drug addiction. It's so real. She goes from everyday average girl that I could totally relate to, to a full fledged drug addict. It shows you how trying something only once can lead to a lifetime of misery and addiction. I wont give away what happens, but it's mindblowing. Teenage girls or maybe even boys should all read this. It's GREAT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"This book is an unrealistic account of a teenage girl's descent into the nightmare of drug addiction. When I read this book back in the eighties it was touted as a true story; an actual girl's diary. It' not; it's a NOVEL, told in diary form. As long as readers are made aware of this fact, then it's okay. The one star review is in relation to two things: the original deception where readers were led to believe this story was real and the fact that no teenage girl would write like this! It's completely absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seventies Classic","review":"It's been a long time since I read this book, but it's impact was so long lasting that I can still remember the feelings it created in me at the time. I remember one of my friends was reading in the eighth grade. I saw the title and the cover and I had to read it too. I remember identifying with the feelings of adolescence that the author talked about, and I remember the sense of foreboding about her descent into madness and addiction. These dangers and pitfalls that exist in the road to adulthood are more relevant now than ever. The late seventies were a cake-walk by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll think twice about doing drugs.","review":"This is a sad, sad book.It talks about Alice, and she goes through all these changes. One day she's doing drugs, the next she's not.I feel sorry for Alice. I know they're are more 'Alices' out there that need help. I can only hope they find this book. I found myself hoping and praying for Alice throughout the book.But whether or not your doing or thinking about drugs, it's a must-read.The only thing is some descriptions leave me with gory images in my mind.So maybe read it when you're 12 and up. Unless you think you can handle it.But trust me, this book is intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book at least once","review":"I found this book in my library when I was in the eight grade. I read it all in one sitting and then read it again. I was shocked & saddened, but given hope. Go Ask Alice was exactly what I needed to read when I was down in the dumps. Whenever I thought my life was hell, I could look back to this girl's life and tell myself that at least it wasn't that bad. At least I had something left. Now that I'm a Christian, I have faith that God will always pull me through, but in Junior High and High school, I read this book so many times, just to help me get by. Even though this girl's life was so bad, her death resulted in helping so many teenagers everywhere. She is a testimony to me, and I hope someday, my life can be as helpful to someone else who needs to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this book was the best of the best!","review":"This book is a book that applies to everyone..whether it be adults, teenagers, boys, girls, drug users, or nondrug users. The reality of the novel hit me as I read, and I was overwhelmed by the fact that this had actually happened, and is still happening. As a teenage, I loved how the author told her story \\"straight up\\", without trying to make a sordid story better or language cleaner. This is a book that everyone should have a chance to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreamely Good! An Open your eyes book! Drugs not answer!","review":"I love this book! I have read it twice and it really makes me realize that because of drugs this beautiful girl died at such a stupid cost! Every one should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very real/Very sad.","review":"Terrifying! A real life diary of a 14 year old girl who becomes innocently mixed up in the drug world and can't escape. I read this knowing I'd hate it and I wasn't disappointed. The disturbing thing about this story, besides the detailed descriptions of how she feels before, during and after drug trips, is the way Alice talks about herself. Her insecurity rules her life, from food to friends to clothes. The childlike tone makes it even worse. I understand why this book was/is so controversial, but I also understand that it was important that it be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"a girl with a drug abuse","review":"nice book for teenagers who are trying to use drugs and find out the harm of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is \\"OK\\" and somewhat informational.","review":"I think that the book \\"Go Ask Alice\\" is an informing book. It informs young people about the consequences of running away, doing drugs, and selling drugs. The book is an a diary format so the reader does not know every detail about the characters or all that goes on in her life. I think that any high school teenager should read this book especially if you're around drugs or are thinking about running away. Some things I do not like about the book are that the author is anonymous. I like to know the author's name and gender. The author never really tells the main character's name or what she looks like. It just makes you curious about exactly what is going on in the character's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"In the book Go Ask Alice by anonyms is an addicting book about an addicting problem. The character \\"Alice\\" wants to fit in so badly she would even try to fit in with teenagers who do drugs. She hangs out with the popular kids who spike her drink with LSD. And this shows her life threw a war zone. During the 1960-1970 when drugs were high in demand Alice lets drugs take over her life. Everything becomes secondary. You see what makes some one who is addicted to drugs what makes them come back for more. The book Go Ask Alice is a clever book. This non-fiction book takes you inside a druggies mind. This is a good read for any age. It not a difficult read. It's a pretty thin book. This book is non-fiction book and this is a diary of a teenage girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Teen/Pre-Teen should read this book!!","review":"Everyone is familiar with the book \\"Go Ask Alice\\" either by reading it or by reading customer reviews, and seeing it online. But what is this book really about? Go Ask Alice is about the main characters drug-addiction and struggle to become pure of drugs again. I highly recomend this book and all of the diaries edited by Beatrice Sparks. This book, makes you never want to take drugs and make the right decisions about them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love it?","review":"I can't imagine how anyone could read this book and not love it. I think it could only be a man who wouldn't like this book. I still have my mom's copy of this book from when she was a teenager. It has been passed from one girl to another through two generations and when my daughter is old enough, she'll read it too. The book is wonderful insight on how a young woman of the time could feel inside. How drugs could take over a girl from the right side of the tracks and how the parents never even really noticed. This book used to be required reading in most high schools and I think it still should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK","review":"when i read this book i felt as if i knew alice. it was such a great book i read it 4 times and i recommend it to all of my friends-------------- im 15...so its weird to see shes around my age group and to see what she had to go through"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop reading it!","review":"\\"Go Ask Alice\\" was an awesome book. It talks about a girl who started taking drugs at the age of 15. She had gone to this party and all they were doing were drugs. This is all how things started. Every since then, her life has taken a major turn. She met a new girl and started hanging out with her a lot. They both got into so really bad drugs and this is how Alice became addicted. She isn't the same old Alice that everyone knew anymore. I like reading this book because it was a diary. I think when people write books on just a diary,it's very interesting. It tells Alice's life, day by day. I recommend this book to pretty much everyone. It teaches people what can happen if you do drugs. This book has given me an understanding about what drugs can do to you and it's scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: Wow.","review":"I can't believe I just read such an amazing book. It's a book that all teenagers should read. I'm 16 and I'm not one to read a book for fun. I can't lie, this book was for school, but I read it in one day. And I never do that voluntarily.

It was about a girl that would do drugs and became addicted to drugs. I actually learned not to do drugs because they can get you in the hospital. At first when I started to read the book I thought that she was a girl that didn't do drugs or anything. She would always hang around with people who did drugs. All of you out there who do drugs should stop because they can lead to death. If you do drugs you should stop and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ask Alice, a very interesting book.","review":"Go Ask Alice was a good book. In the beginning, Alice seems like a normal girl, but then she wants to fit in and she uses drugs. She starts dealing them in school and goes to parties where everyone uses drugs. The book is the diary that she writes in through her life. Alice does some things that are not that smart.If you or anyone you know is uses drugs, they should read this book.

I am fourteen years old and read this book for the first time when I was in third grade. I have read it so many times that I am now onto my third copy because I ruined th bindings on my other copies. This is somewhat embarrassing but it had never occured to me before that this book might be a work of fiction. Although it may not be true this book has given me more perspective on drug use then any health class.

There was no Alice.If you don't believe me, just go to your library and ask the librarian for the book, she'll take you straight to the FICTION section. HELLO!!!!!!This book is silly (...)! Don't believe it. It's laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ispiration!","review":"This is a good book to first read when you're in early teens, and go back ten years later, read it all over again, and see how much your perception of Alice and her misadventures have changed! I must say the second time around is not as mysterious as the first, but nevertheless, Alice still lived in a dark world with very strange experiences. Unlike some other books out there, this is about an addicted girl that desperately WANTS to get clean and be a good girl, but she just can't seem to get out of the trap. The era she lives in matches up to the types and abundance of drugs being used by young adolescents, but still may be applied to today. And no matter how deranged the secrets revealed throughout the book, the ending still ultimately comes as a shock. I couldn't put it down once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Raw, Alice will haunt you","review":"Go Ask Alice is perhaps one of the most disturbing, harrowing, shocking, and down right depressing books avaliable for young adults. It details one teen's spiral into the world of drugs, a world that eventually consumes her.I think that anyone curious about experimenting with mind altering substances should be strapped to a chair and forced to read this book. Alice is much more personal than all of the statistics we are constantly bombarded with about teen drug abuse. It gives teens a person, an image, that they can equate with the dangers of drug abuse, and that is more powerful than any facts that are presented to us by teachers and parents and television commercials. Alice speaks to all, and her message is clear.I would advise this to teens and parents alike, because not only is it amazing and raw, it is also true. Alice's story will change your life forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a negative-5-star rating? No? Crap.","review":"Bullcrap on anybody who says this is powerful and moving.

This is where her life begins. At the party they play a game called \\"button button who's got the button\\" and it turns out that her drink was spiked with LSD. she describes how she feels and what her subconcious was telling her. she says that she knew it was wrong but it felt so good that she didn't feel guilt at all. after that incident her life becomes much different and over time as you read you see and feel her changing.

Do not read this under any circumstance! It took only an evening to read and I want that evening of my life back. The blurb says this book is \\"based\\" on the diary of a 15-year-old girl, which is in my opinion an obvious gimmick and hoax. The whole \\"harrowing progression into the mad world of addiction\\" is a severe cliche. It follows the formula of a made-for-TV movie or an afterschool special. Don't get me wrong, there are some realistic touches, and in general it's a well-constructed piece of (...) It has the opposite intended effect--I think it's this kind of piece that turns kids ON to drugs...at least the ones intelligent enough not to be condescended to."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's All a Lie","review":"This book is horrible. It's not written by a real teenager and neither are any of the other journals in this series. It's an obviously fake cautionary tale written by someone who doesn't seem to know a lot about drugs or drug use, as none of the situations described seem believable in the least. This book is an overly formulaic look at the worst-case scenario of drug use, much like one would see in a bad TV movie. Even when I first read it at 15, I didn't believe a word of it. If the publishers would lie to you about the author, how could you believe anything else in the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OPEN MIND TO THE REAL LIFE OF DRUGS","review":"Go ask Alice is a book about a girl who enterd the world of drugs.This story is based on a true story,it takes place at a school but is not mentiond in the book.Alice is first convinced to do drugs when her boy friend gives her some.Then her world is turned up side down.Alice then becomes sort of an out cast in her own family not just at school.Since her dad traveld they moved to a new town which was also not mentiond.Then Alice started gaining a eating dis order and got adicted to drugs again.like the others in the world she died of a drug over dose and no one really knows the real cause of her death.In my opinion i will never do drugs and you shouldent either.BY:Lauren Matthews"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ask Alice","review":"The book Go ask Alice is a wonderful teen book.

For a while in this book things were good, she felt good and was having a good time. Thats why this book shouldn't be put down and left alone when it is halfway done!

Re-reading it confirmed my teenage assessment that it is laughable trash. It is not just factually innacurate, but steps well over the line into truly ridiculous, and blatantly obvious, propaganda.I did find a use for the book. I use it to teach my students to identify and dissect this type of material for what it is.

The name of the main character is unknown but is referred to as Alice. The main points of the book in my opinion were, how one crazy party with a lot of drugs can ruin your life and also that you family no matter what will be there for you. No matter how messed up \\"Alice\\" got her family still loved her and helped her out. The things I didn't like in the book were the sudden and odd ending. The ending gave me mixed feeling about the entire book because I was enjoying it so much and then it just abruptly came to a halt. I also didn't like how unrealistic it sounded even though it's a true story, no one really knows what is actually factual. Overall I still really enjoyed \\"Go Ask Alice\\" and would recomend it to people who enjoy real storys and are teen's or older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening view of the inside life of Alice","review":"I read this book a couple years ago, yet I still remember the graphic details in my mind of this book. I remember how well it portrayed the pathetic and drug-filled life of Alice.

I felt sadness, relief, and confusion. This is an excellent book for teens and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book any one can relate to","review":"I started reading this book at a friends house, little did i know when i picked it up I was going to take it home and cherish it forever.

It's like Jacqueline Sussann ghostwriting Judy Blume. As we follow the narrator's perilous slide into drugs, her recovery, her next perilous slide, her next recovery and so on, I'm left wondering how anyone can believe this ridiculous nonsense. As camp, it's kind of fun, but I'd have to be pretty deep into some wonky religion before I believed that any of these goings-on are even plausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAKE!","review":"This \\"diary\\" was amazing when i read it.

From anywhere, of any style.High praise indeed, but they have released 6 wonderful and addictive albums blending traditional rock music with electronica, all under the umbrella of great song writing.Cold Feeling is initially oddly retro, inviting comparison with 80's british bands, but with repeated listenings fits more comfortably with the rest of their decidedly modern sound.I don't think the word \\"underground\\" in their name is accidental, as they are unashamedly highbrow which is a wonderful thing in a volume-driven world.And incidentally, they are fabulous live so do yourself a favour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Outing","review":"The Underground Lover's sixth album continues their high standard of albums. A much trimmer band these days, with just Glenn Bennie and Vincent Giarrusso forming the crux of the band. However the additions of Merida Sussex on voacls for\\"You Put Me in your Movie\\" and \\"Towards the Sky\\" are reminiscent of the vocal qualities that were added by Phillipa Nihill.This albums is generally in the same continium as their previous album \\"Ways T'Burn\\", a dark and sometimes brooding album. Stand out tracks include \\"Cold Feeling\\", \\"Infinite Finite\\" and \\"Worrier God\\". I love the inclusion of Graham Lee's steel guitar on these tracks.The Underground Lover's have never yet failed to excite me with their releases, and this album is no exception. The cover art is also exceptional. as is the idea of the cover being 4 individual cards rather than a conventional cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAD IDEA!.... GONE REALLY REALLY WRONG!","review":"'Before The Devil Knows You're Dead' will make you think twice about doing something you know is bad, but you do it anyway! With a premise that shows how wrong a seemingly easy solution can go horribly wrong this film pulls no punches! An engrossing story of two brothers in desperate need of cash, decide to pull off a robbery!....that's as far as I'll go with the plot. What happens next is absolutely tragic.The story is told flash back and flash forward style, which works well in story for the most part. Although, I did feel the film dragged needlessly in the middle sometimes because they didn't reveal enough new information during some flashback/forward segments. This didn't hurt the overall experience, but with a little more information, it would have really pulled me in. Regardless, it's a very solid film with solid performances. The ending was abrupt and left a couple of important loose ends. For those small grievances I deduct 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Star Story with 2 Star Acting","review":"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a depressing but well conceived story saddled with hugely overwrought acting by two main characters. From the overbearing bombastics of Philip Seymour Hoffman to the seething bug-catching stares of Albert Finney, this is one huge opportunity wasted. Hawke and Tomei do their best to rein in the proceedings, providing a quiet, suffering dignity to their tortured souls, but the excesses of the former just about kills the momentum generated by the story.By the time the last scene rolls around we want to take the pillow to both Finney and Hoffman. And Lumet for his jump-time storytelling technique. Tragic waste of a great opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"THREE WORDS--Philip Seymour Hoffman!!

BUT WATCHING HOFFMAN PLAY EVIL IS TRUE MASTER AT WORK...HE WILL GO INTO HISTORY AS THE BEST ACTOR OF OUR TIME. WHEN YOU SEE THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE GETTING A CLASSIC CAPER FILM GOES WRONG, BRILLIANT ACTING WITH A WONDERFUL CAST BUT MOST OF ALL YOU WILL HAVE A CLASSIC GEM OF A FILM THAT IS TRULY WORTH SEEING ...WHY HOFFMAN WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR THIS MOVIE INSTEAD OF CHARLIE WILSON WAR IS BEYOND ME BUT FOR THE MOST PART IF I WAS IN THE A OSCAR VOTER I WOULD PICK A GREAT ACTOR LIKE HOFFMAN FOR ANOTHER GREAT OSCAR PERFORMANCE...IT WAS BETTER THAN CAPOTE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for Fast Forward should've been the title!","review":"Too make this short and bittersweet: Before the Devil Knows Your Dead is virtually unwatchable. Lumet relied on a lazy and tiresome series of flashbacks (think Vantage Point which does the same and is equally unwatchable) to tell the most depressing and unrealistic story I've ever been asked to suspend my disbelief for. The flashbacks are the laziest and most annoying way to try and narrate a story and it winds up being tedium instead of building drama. I will forget this garbage and instead remember Lumet for his earlier masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, insistent, and hard to sit through","review":"This was painful, and surprisingly so because it seems to have all the elements of being wonderful: an interesting plot, complex characters, clever director, and very talented actors. As soon as it was over, however, I was angry at having been duped into watching it. It (the film) is so aware of those surefire elements I named a moment ago, that it seemed fine with the fact that the scenes weren't going right, it wasn't believable, and it was hard for the audience to like or care about any of the characters. All in all, a waste of time and painfully so. I gave it two stars only because it was better than I would have done, were I a director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this movie to be very disappointing. I thought at one time that Phillip Seymore Hoffman could not make a bad movie or have a bad performance. This movie just did nothing for me and I found it boring as hell. Ethan Hawke has not grown as all as an actor and I think he is pretty poor. Marisa Tomei was naked in the movie, that is the best I can say for it and I find her to be a poor actress as well.

The eerie part is that it seemed so real ... one gets lost inside this movie quickly. Not a fun film as it descends from one bad move to deeper darker situations. So many mediocre movies being touted today and yet smaller films like this are totally ignored. I call this excellent film making and it is my favorite film from 2007. So where are the nominations? Again, excellent direction, cast efforts and riveting tale of just how wrong things can go."},{"rating":"2","title":"desperate betrayal","review":"Don't let the sex scene in the beginning of the movie put you off...I see it as betrayal in its most basest form [we just don't know it yet]. We're looking at their character defects; the director is showing us \\"how low you can sink in life\\" without spelling it out. However, before long, we learn that an affair is nothing compared to what happens next. Too many people here, in my opinion, have told the story, which is unfortunate. I will say that betrayal is the theme of the movie, and there isn't a worse betrayal orchestrated than by family. That's where the lessons are; it matters not who else \\"screws\\" you, but if it's family, then expect the darkest kind of misery. The audience sees an intimate view of ego, low self esteem, greed, jealousy, true love, and morality. All the characters, male and female, give excellent performances, and I too wish this film had received more exposure. Anyone connected with this film should be proud of their work, and I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the Devil Knows Your're Dead","review":"The work of Sidney Lumet is just fantastic.

The basic story, which is sliced into many erratic time sequences, is about a manipulative man who convinces his weaker brother to help him help rob a jewelry store. Things go wrong and keep going wrong as the story descends into hopeless despair. You end up liking no one and caring about no one. If you're like me, you reach a point where you just get up and turn it off. If I'm going to watch a mega-downer it had better have some purpose to it.

Yes -- the production and direction were great. Yes - the movie was suspenseful. But these things cannot redeem the awful story the film portrays. I watched the entire 2 hours wanting something very miserable to happen to the two very miserable brothers. What loathsome creatures. No one except the mother and the father (for the most part) were sympathetic characters. The women who hung out with these guys needed medication and therapy. Perhaps the people who love this movie need the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awesome...","review":"Wasn't the best movie, wasn't aweful. It was very long, didn't think it would end.

While I love Sidney Lumet - when people describe this as a dark film - that is a complete understatement! Even Albert Finney (the true victim in this film) is totally unlikeable. As for the two brothers - I have long wondered what ANYONE could ever see in Ethan Hawke - he is so hideous to look at! I would rather look at Phillip Seymour Hoffman naked anyday- and believe me that is not a sight I ever want to see again, either. The acting and directing was first rate but all of the characters were so utterly devoid of any shred of decency - it was sooooooo dark and when it was over I just sat there wondering why I watched the whole thing. Don't bother - but if you have to rent it DON'T be stupid enough to buy it at ANY price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, depressing, un-redeeming, and unfulfilling","review":"This movie just drags on and on, getting more depressing as it goes. Neither of the main characters have enough socially redeeming qualities to get you to buy in and cheer them on.

I can't get my 2 hours back, but I can save you the fate that befell me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost","review":"Except for the final 30 seconds, it was a great movie. And it makes you feel good too, because most families are somewhat dysfunctional and this one lowers the bar so much that you might feel good about your own.

Watch it, but shut it off before the last 30 seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a simple plan goes terribly wrong","review":"If you enjoy movies involving robbery, schemes, and family betrayal...you'll love this one.

Guy Ritchie should take some direction from this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this Instead of Cassandra's Dream","review":"What happens when two veteran directors make two similarly themed movies, each focusing on two brothers planning the perfect crime? Predictably, in each case, it all goes horribly wrong. However, only in Sidney Lumet's \\"Before the Devil Knows Your Dead,\\" is that a good thing. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke (along with Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei) make Lumet's botched robbery caper consistently intriguing and suspenseful. In the case of Woody Allen's \\"Cassandra's Dream,\\" the brothers-in-crime story is botched in every way imaginable -- with a disastrous script and wooden performances by Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell. The plots and the packaging are similar. But one you will remember. The other you'll want to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Disjointed: I Enjoyed It","review":"This movie is a dark and strange and very good. I can see why it was never popular - it is a little too dark and disturbing because it is easy to imagine something like this happening.The flash forward and flash backs - or maybe it is one or the other and not both - but there are enough of them that it takes some paying attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic","review":"Great movie, though tragic. This is a tale of how wrong things can go to the extreme. A completely engaging movie, with fine performances all the way around. It's heartbreaking to watch the world of these characters spiral out of control, and that's what makes it so dark, and yet so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so naive ...","review":"So, if you like, you may call me prude or old-fashioned or overly-sensitive ... but I was unprepared for and quite horrified by the opening scene of this movie, which made me do a triple take to see if I had accidentally ordered a porno. I'm not sure if I don't understand rating systems, or if they just weren't explicit enough to warn a viewer like me about the visual I had to pour bleach into my eyes to get rid of. :DI realize it was a suspense movie about a crime ... but there was a little too much sex, violence, and language for my personal taste. Just not my cup o' tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, dark and hopeless","review":"While I normally like Lumet's work, this movie was utterly without any sense of hope. As such, it was an exercise in depression. Hawke and Hoffman's characters were without any meaningful redeeming virtues. This was apparently supposed to convey a sense of realism, but it comes across as \\"reality\\" TV. If you want to be depressed, watch this film. If you're seeking to be entertained, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rental","review":"Never knew it was a rental. Good price and keeping it but disappointed. Make sure to not make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mining The Depths Of Stupidity","review":"Listen, Man. This sure had all the indicators of a promising few hours, with the cast and director having proved themselves through the years. It's impossible to feel any sympathy for any of the characters in this film, 'cuz they're all either too selfish or stupid to exist. Good acting? Sure, but to what end? The movie jumps back & forth in a very distracting manner, and Hawke's character is darn dumb I wanted to rip him outta the TV and strangle him. Believability is shot early on in this lame attempt at suspense. Several loose ends, but really it don't matter, because at least the agony is over. Marisa's lovely presence is the only reason I sat through it to the end. Lame, lame, lame otherwise. Wanna sey Hoffman in something worthwhile, get Love Liza or Owning Mahoney. Avoid this stinkbomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Was Dead","review":"I lost interest so early in the film. There was lots of jumping around, and back and forth in time which wasn't really hard to follow -- but it seemed excessive. The premise of the film seemed interesting, but the followthrough was so far off the mark -- like perhaps a high school kid wrote the script. Too many odd characters when they were not necessary. The redeeming 2 stars I gave this were for the ending. While there is one aspect of the film that just leaves you hanging... \\"like, hey -- so what about him? what happens to him?\\" There is one very suprising incident to close out the story that I did not see coming.

The ideas conveyed in this book about a cat being the perfect \\"purrveyor\\" (pun intended) of balance and energy is extremely intriguing.Along with informative and insightful content, the pictures add a beautiful element.

Ever.","review":"Captain Ron has always made me laugh out loud. It's hard not to. I usually don't enjoy Kurt Russell films; however, this movie is probably his best. Martin Short is such a great comedian. He earns some of the biggest laughs. Together, a great vacation movie is made. Captain Ron is very wild and has very clever dialogue. Martin's character inherits a boat, except he has to take the family and sail it from an island to Miami. They have a local sailor, Kurt russell, help them sail it. But, things go wrong, and lots of adventures begin. A funny, clever comedy, with very scenic and beautiful locations. Buy this movie right now, and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD runs aground","review":"This DVD stinks. You would think after 10 years they could come up with at least a couple of more things to put on the DVD. There is the movie, scene selections, and that's it! Not even the trailer is on this DVD, which is interesting. I lived in Malaysia for a while (I was living on sailboats at the time :) and I rented a movie there that had a trailer for Captain Ron. Of the 4 scenes that were in that trailer 3 of them were not in the VHS version of Captain Ron that I bought about 8 years ago, and they are not in this DVD version either. Were they in the movie when it was in the theaters? This DVD fails to answer the burning question: What happened to the dinghy??

It just struck me that one of the silliest ideas in the movie involves the guerillas that they all meet on an island. Captain Ron warns M.S.'s character to watch out for them. Captain Ron ends up smoothing over the rough edges of such an encounter. What's being suggested by that, without saying it, is that the family is sailing under the helmsmanship of Captain Ron, who is, himself, on the sly with these island rebels. He seems so nonchalant about that. It's really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Captain Ron\\" - A cult classic","review":"\\"Captain Ron\\" is a classic comedy that has cruisers falling off their bunks every time it is viewed.

Kurt Russel and Martin Short strut their comedic stuff in a screw-ball tour-de-force. This movie is the stuff that great careers are made of, a cinematic triumph for Russel, Short, and director, Thom Eberhardt.The great thing about Captain Ron is that it not only manages to be funny, but maintains high cinematic standards: The exotic settings, energy-charged music, and acting make this a movie that deserves to be counted among the funniest of the 90's.Own your copy today on DVD or VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Irresistable","review":"After having worn down my VHS version until it turned black and white, and in the face of my useless email campaign to the producer of Captain Ron to turn it into a DVD, my only regret is that I did not preorder the DVD and have it the first weekend.

To read the synopsis of the book here or read other reviews, you may be thinking: Powers can't pull this off. He's got too many themes, too many things going on. But somehow from the Fisher King and Bugsy Segal and tarot cards and chaos theory and TS Eliot and so much more he fashions something new, something whole.Here the realistic, dark, somewhat noir feel, not quite Raymond Chandler, gets mixed up with the urban fantasy feel of, say, Charles de Lint. Unlike de Lint's work, though, Powers doesn't run off to fairy land. The book stays rooted in its modern American West setting. His characters are realistic and complex. The events, while filled with that fantastic and that phantasmogoric, flow naturally, building and building the trap in which our anti-hero finds himself trapped, playing poker for his life.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Mythology","review":"One of my favorite Tim Powers books and the first of the Fault Lines trilogy. If you are interested in the intersection of archetypes and mythology in an American context, but also looking for an entertaining read, this a great book. Not as historically intricate as some of the other \\"secret histories\\" by Powers or other authors, but with compelling characters and a substantial plot. The next two books (or combined version Fault Lines) do not seem to be available on Kindle as yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing magic into everyday!!","review":"An interesting tale that uses Tarot images to sanctify everyday aspects of existence. Powers offers an emotionally rich plotline which he fleshes out into grand themes of loss, redemption, and the meaning of family.Although he delves into the darker side of human relationships, Powers manages to deliver an exciting upbeat tale which kept my attention to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I loved Anubis Gates and several other Tim Powers novels. This book seemed to be a perfect combination for me: Powers + mystique of cards + seedy underbelly of Las Vegas... but unfortunately it failed to impress.I bought this book when it first came out. The first time I read it I felt it dragged on and didn't deliver to my expectations. Because I wanted to dive into the other 2 books of the loosely connected trilogy (Expiration date & Earthquake weather), I thought I'd give it another chance. I'm sorry to say, that it still left me wanting more. Not much really happens, especially compared to the brilliant plots of other Powers novels.Some reviewers commented about needing a sense of humor to read this.

Disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"After reading the other reviews posted here, I feel like I must have read a different book than the other reviewers. Ridiculous, stereotypical characters; one of the principal \\"bad guys\\" eats only raw, recently living food, including, at one point, the carcass of his recently killed doberman.

The vocalist is horrendous. He has been compared to Geddy Lee by many, but Geddy's voice has a LOT more soul, timbre, and smoothness. Comparisons to Dream Theater have also been made as well, but C&C's chord progressions and guitar work sound purposeless and disjointed, and DO have elements of the lousy 'Emo rock' genre. The fact that many here bring this up must mean many of us hear it. I applaud bands that try to 'push or break the musical envelope', but unfortunately, C&C's sound comes across as confused with no real musical direction. You can play with fervor and conviction, as these guys do, BUT if the music sounds forced and boring, there's nothing you can do to 'connect' with some listeners. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but different","review":"I had heard one song from this group on XM radio. Thanks to this site, I was able to hear some of the other tracks. I liked what I heard so I got it. I'm one of those types of people that hate to buy a album (yes, I still call them that) with only one or maybe two good songs on them. This album didn't disappoint. After doing some research, I learned more. The name of the group is taken after a fictional story. The songs are all written around the lives and deaths of these characters. Hence, my title. The lyrics are, lets say different. I guess if your into lyrics, you'll have to do some homework to get the full context of their messages. Great PR work. If you like Rush, DreamTheater and Yngie all in one, this album is for you. Great feel, great riffs and catchy choruses that will stay in your mind for a while. Hard to believe these guys are only a quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coheed & Cambria's Best Release Yet!","review":"When a band you love is signed from an underground label to a huge mainstream recording label you expect the music to suffer as commercialism becomes involved.

The album contains a wide range of songs from epic journeys such as \\"Welcome Home\\" to beautiful ballads like \\"Wake Up\\" & then close the album with a weird & dark jam session in \\"The Final Cut.\\" This album is also a concept album with unique sound effect reminiscent of old scool Pink Floyd.

The lyrics and dark, catchy and twisted as usual. The progress rock vibe is here in full effect. You can hear alot of influences. If you wanna go real old school, I am gonna have to say that The Willing Well II:From Fear through the eyes of madness bears a VERY eerie resemblance to Genesis' 1974 track The Colony of Slippermen on The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. But anway. This is a truly amazing rock album that jumps from, hardrock, metal, pop, indie and prog in a truly silky smooth fashion. It is a true masterpiece and any true music lover will have this and the rest of Coheed's albums in their collection. Stand out tracks include, the whole album, but personal favourites are Ten Speed, Crossing the Frame and The Suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"apollo","review":"I got to tell you I,m 38 and this is the first album I,ve bought by c@c and this kicks ass. but i,m a dream theater john patrucci tea party etc; kinda guy.but this album just sticks for some reason.by the way that jane dude or chick that said gnr was the best band ever.I've seen them in concert with appatite and they royaly sucked.slash is the only one with cred.there is no coparison.they truly suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I have been an avid Coheed listener since Second Stage Turbine Blade.

Since \\"Silent Earth\\" Co&Ca have definatly grew as a band (which in there case seemed nearly impossible). The lyrics are absolutly mind blowing and the fact that almost every song has a guitar solo just gives all this MTV approved music a huge middle finger. The one thing I would like to know is the story line of this disc (since there whole collection is based off a huge story). All I know is that if your sceptical on buying this disc you are completly insane (or you are partial to the stylings of Fall Out Boy).

I've never been able to get my hands on the books, but from what I've heard it follows along with the music. That's a really neat idea because it brings the music to another level. Anyway, if you like heavy music with interesting sounds and lyrics definitely give CoCa a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coheed learn and improve.","review":"This album is top quality stuff. Coheed show off their extensive talent here, recapturing the esscence of some of the greatest rock bands there are, for example Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.Welcome Home is heavily influenced by Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir.\\" Play them side by side, and you can hear the resemblance. However, Coheed have greatly improved on Kashmir, with a more varied rhythm, and more dynamic vocals and guitar. Essentially, Kashmir has been rebuilt from the ground up, into a true masterpiece.The Willing Well is a 30 minute music suite that completely shows off Coheed's creativity. Forget symmetry, forget radio length songs, this is pure rock.5-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their Master of Puppets","review":"This is their perfect album.

O and i dont know if it was just a best buy thing, but it came with another cd with 4 live songs from their concert at the avalon in L.A. which, coincidentally i was at. it has Welcome Home, Blood Red Summer, In Keeping Secrets, and The Final Cut which is the last song on the new album and is very \\"Pink Floydish\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bad.....horrible singer","review":"Why do they ruin decent music with such girly sounding singing?

This kid needed some love when he was younger. Anyway, I really dont care about the stupid story, I care about the music, you can sing about the muppets for all I care as long as it sounds good. The last CD sounded original and rocked hard. this CD is boring, each song sounds the same, none of them really get going. Skip this one and hope the band quits writing lyrics and starts writing songs again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Playthrough album","review":"It is far to common these days to buy an album and the only song you listen to is the title track, this is not the case with this one, from start to finish its an amazing cd, deffinatly my favorite coheed cd to date, was concerend with all the hype around welcome home whether or not the rest of the album could live up to that, i must say after 5-6 playthroughs i can almost gurentee that you will have picked our 1-3 songs that you prefer to Welcome Home, for me personally The Writing Writer, Wake Up, and The Suffering seal the deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I guess I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but after hearing The Suffering on the radio, I picked it up anyway.

Unfortunately, I cannot even muster up enough passion to diss Coheed and Cambria to the level they deserve. You see, it's pretty bad when you find music to be so retch inducing that you don't even care enough to properly convey in words just how bad it really is.That's how devoid of feeling Coheed and Cambria have left me. Their music is so bad that I can't even summon the requisite passion to properly insult them."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end of something big.","review":"I remember picking up Second Stage Turbine Blade back in August of 2002, and my life changed forever.

Don't buy this album, instead pick up Second Stage, it's still a one of a kind today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I've never listened to this band before but when I heard \\"Welcome Home\\" on the radio, I decided to give'em a shot. The album is lousy. They do have some Dream Theater sound infused in the mix but at least Dream Theater's GOOD! To me, C&C's disc sounds alot like Alien Ant Farm bullsh*t. AVOID!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and unoriginal","review":"My roommate has unfortunately forced me to listen to these no talent losers for the past month :( The song \\"Welcome Home\\" is a cheap rip-off of Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\", just they twisted it into something sounding ugly and disgusting. Play both songs side-by-side if you need proof these guys are losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than i could ever imagine","review":"my friends are really in to them so there must be something i am missing. their guitarist sound like cheap randy rhodes copys. Claudio has to to be gay. alot of the songs just sound like fillers and aren't rememberable. If you want to listen to a great band listen to guns n' roses, aerosmith, and alice cooper. Even fallout boy is better then coheed and they suck too."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"i saw the hosers in concert and they wish they were the best band on equal vision record(Bear VS Shark). They are a Mars Volta Rip-off band that wish they were half as talented. this singer sounds like he's \\"trying\\" to sing in that tone and isnt naturaly gifted enough to pull it off. Look, any butthole with synth can make a well rounded album, but jesus christ dont make it so bluntly obvious that someone is holding your hand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated emo garbage","review":"There is so much bad emo music out there, and this band certainly would fall under that category. The only real good emo bands are Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and AFI, although I don't even count them as emo. Coheed & Cambria has everything going wrong for them. They have bad songwriting, a singer who sounds like a girl, and worthless chord progressions. I don't see why anyone would like this band, they're just as bad as Hawthorne Heights, Cartel, Saves the Day, Anberlin, Emery, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus; the list goes on and on. But Coheed & Cambria is without a doubt the worst emo band out there, and in fact the worst band ever! OH, and what do you know, they have the worst album ever entitled In Keeping of Secrets 3. Their only even close to decent album is the Second Stage Turning Blade, the rest have no appeal whatsoever. This band needs to break up now."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CRAP EVER","review":"This is the worst display of emo crap ever.

My elderly, housebound neighbors were allowing invasive Ailanthus (aka Tree of Heaven, aka Stink Tree) to grow next to their fence. You can't cut them down because that makes more shoots sprout up. I sprayed a 15-20 foot weed tree on the leaves and trunk with two hoses full every day for a week, then waited. After 4-6 weeks it was dead, dead, dead.

We are still setting it up for him- but he enjoys racing the megablock cars as well as all his matchbox cars down the ramps. Especially long tracks can be built by keeping the lid on top of the box- and building down off of that. However,we and both our friends who have this say the same thing- they didn't include enough tracks or ramp supports! We have all used our other megablocks to prop up ramps and make more than one ramp usable at a time. A little skimpy."},{"rating":"2","title":"needs more pieces","review":"I agree with the previous two reviews. It definitely needs more pieces. My son loves this thing!

We thought that since he loves cars he would like having a track to play with them on. He also loves Mega Blocks so what a great idea when I found the Fast Trax toy. My son LOVES it and plays with it alot but just like all the other reviews it needs more trax. We also got him the garage but my husband took the trax from it and added it to the Fast Trax. Mega Blocks really needs to sell more trax to this toy. But overall it is very sturdy and my son loves it. The cars are really cool too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracks are too narrow.","review":"This seems like a great toy overall and my 3 year old son really enjoys it. However, on his set the tracks and ramps are too narrow for the cars, so he has to push them to get them to move at all. Since the other reviewers didn't seem to have this problem I would still recommend the toy, but suggest you save your receipt just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two year-old twins LOVE this book","review":"I'm so glad Amazon carries it; we've checked it out several times from the library and my twins love it every time.

They are honestly not worth the price of a Whopper with cheese. 3.5 star movie, 0 star DVD.It makes you wonder who's in charge of creating these DVDs at the major studios...this is just pathetic.Amazon also needs to clearly mark this DVD as 1.33:1 aspect ratio!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks!","review":"if you're an 80's child like me, you need to get this one! It's up there with all of the John Hughes classics, and until now, hasn't been available on DVD for a decent price.

However, it still has not materialized. The logic apparently is that \\"family\\" films should be released in fullscreen.

Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson were perfectly cast, and the desert setting,(Tuscon, Arizona)put the icing on the cake. What was really nice about this movie was the fact that nudity and foul language were not needed to get the point across. I did a little research and realized that Dempsey was in his early twenties, maybe 21, when he filmed this movie, while Amanda Peterson was 5 years younger.If you have a soul, this movie will touch you in some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO widescreen???

Boy sees a way to get popular girl to date him, it goes good, it falls apart, it all comes back together...CLASSIC!!!! This movie is awesome in every sense of the word.

Ronald has a scheme to get himself into the \\"A\\" crowd, when he pays the head cheerleader to act like his girlfriend. The story is very good with many lessons learned. It is very family friendly, and I have seen it a good 25-30 times and still don't get board. There are not enough good family friendly movies out there but this is one of them. Buy and enjoy over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pick-me-up!","review":"When I was in high school (in the late 80's), this movie was part of a weekly ritual. About once a week, my sister and I would rush home from school and pop in our copy of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" to the video player. We knew every word, and all the dialogue -- even the corny stuff -- resonated with our high school existance. The movie became our cure-all for the symptoms of being a teenager. Rainy outside? Pop in CBML. Being ignored by your crush? Watch CBML. Bad grade on your mid-term? CBML will make it better.I can't tell you why this movie is better than all the other teen flicks of the 80's ... it just is. Like so many other reviewers here, let me say -- please re-release this video!

This is a classic from the 80s and I still enjoy it today. It's even fun to laugh at what we used to wear and what our hair looked like back then.

There is more to the story being told than money cant buy you love. I think a deeper message to this story is no matter how life changes and the world around you changes dont get caught up in all. Stay who you are and true to yourself and everything will work out in the end. On another note Im very happy that Buena Vista Home Entertainment is finally going to put this movie out on DVD this summer. So to all of you Can't Buy Me Love fans out there lets hope they include some special features. I myself would love to hear a commentary from Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson and some deleated scenes.

Hopefully with Eisner on the way out, maybe, just maybe the House of Mouse Dynasty will start producing DVD's the way we want them.

It is a nice professional weight pan. The ridges in the pan seem to really help in keeping foods from sticking, although I do have problems with eggs sticking if a small amount of butter is not used. I like the smooth curving sides of the pan it makes for easier stirring of the contents. The constructing of the pan is first rate and it takes so little heat that cooking is a breeze. The only flaw that this pan has is that it does not come with a lid.However I also have an 8-inch Analon Egg Poacher and that lid fits perfectly. Other 8-inch saucepan or stockpot lids from Anolon do not fit because of the curved sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best skillet I have ever had","review":"Decided after 2 yr I would get another one of these terrific pans only to find they are not available at this time I am now 87 years old and have every pan imaginable not old ones either but nothing can compare to this small pan.

Czech Republic is a lovely place, and Prague is so full of history that everywhere you look, you can imagine Mozart in the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"The plot is predictable but the story is so well told that it is genuinely moving. I won't retell it as others have done so. I just want to agree with the many others that, in spite of what could be a cloying, overly sentimental story, this escaped that and delivered something worthwhile. Some have said that this isn't the best of Czech cinema and I have to agree. But this is still lovely and worth seeing. The actors are great, especially the child who plays Kolya. Again, this could be cringe-worthy but he is wonderful.My only tiny complaint is the fact that the writer, who also plays the 55 year old lead, has written the character as irresistable to beautiful women, including a very young student! I suppose he has the right to do this...it's his film and his son directed it. :-)The shots of Prague are wonderful and add a lot to the enjoyment of the film. The lead character was supposed to be suffering financially but he sure had a wonderful tower apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An art work","review":"Let me put it this way...If there is one DVD I would gift my friends then it would be this one.Those who cannot see the wonderful humor and the beautiful bonding between the characters probably not suitable for watching movie of this quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm & Charimg","review":"In 1988 Louka, a free spirited musician, is offered a proposal to fake a marriage in order help a young Russian woman stay in Czechoslovakia. This is an offer that Louka cannot refuse, since he is in debt and needs a car. He goes ahead and marries the young woman who has a five year old son named Kolya. Consequently, she flees out of Eastern Communist Europe with a visa that is only allowed to Czechoslovakian citizens. Unwillingly Louka is left with Kolya, but he is forced to take care of him as the Communist government is investigating the marriage. Kolya is a warm and charming drama that softens the hardest of hearts as the audience views the traumatic experiences and love that the film depicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too adorable","review":"This movie was very touching. I loved the suspense of not knowing what will happen to the man or the boy. Very well acted, especially by the little boy. You just want to pinch his cheeks.

This one is very easy to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language is not Russian (as stated by amazon) but Chezh.

But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Colossal Disappointment","review":"After 35 minutes, I told my wife that, except for the scenery and the music, this could be a Hollywood movie. It tries to evolve beyond that, and it's watchable enough, but it never reaches the ranks of being memorable, much less literature. Once it reaches the requisite length, it introduces a political event that I guess we can't call \\"deus ex machina\\" because it actually happened. But that's how they end the story and go home. But in the end, we've got crusty codger, cute kid, bonding, blah blah blah. I know the Czechs have better movies. Why aren't we seeing them? It's a sad day when any European nation neglects its rich cultural heritage to try copying the literary equivalent of Big Macs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from reality","review":"The film fails to represent the role played by the Communist regime of 1980s Czechya.

Zdenak Sverak does a wonderful job as the slightly curmudgeonly cellist, and Andrej Chalimon is perfect as the young Kolya of the title. The film slowly yet marvelously follows the development of the relationship between the two characters. The music that follows the scenes is wonderfully written, I highly recommend that fans of the movie buy the soundtrack as well. This is my favorite film of all time, American- or foreign-made, and one that nobody should miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felker TS-40 Rubi Tile Cutter","review":"This is one of the best tile cutters out there.

I was thrilled when I found it because most of Milwaukee's cases today are the plastic style which don't give you much room for extras. When I got it, it looked perfect. Its dimensions are 14-1/2 x 12 x 4-3/4\\". The grinder fits in angled, and slightly offset in order to accommodate the side handle, and there's plenty of extra storage space for anything you have. I put my grinder and accessories in the case, everything looked perfect... that is, until I tried to close the cover. The edge of the side handle sticks up about 1/2\\" too high and there's no way to close it with the handle attached. I contacted Milwaukee who told me that I would have to remove the handle to store the tool, which is not very practical, especially since the case looks to be offset in order to accommodate the side handle. If the case was 1/2\\" taller, it would fit perfectly. Doesn't make any sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angle grinder case review","review":"This is an excellent heavy-duty steel case that fits the magnum grinder. Like other reviews I read before I bought this case, the grinder does fit a little snug, but the rubber cushion compresses and that is what holds the tool tightly so that it has no chance of rattling around or getting damaged. Plus, there is extra room for other grinding disks and the wrench."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"I love this book. It has great ideas for sushi, using American products.

Discussion then follows regarding the founding of the Mars Society and their ongoing projects of developing and installing Mars analog scientific stations on Earth. International scientists volunteer their time and talents to do real science in the field under conditions analogous to working on Mars. This book is well written and reads like an adventure novel.

La Marisol, traviesa, inquieta, y sonriente: La Pepa, profunda, conmovedora y segura de sus inquietudes sociales, culturales y profesionales. Es Pepa Flores el sin��nimo de un coraz��n que canta al ritmo de una voz aterciopelada. Es sin duda, la gran ausente en los escenarios y producciones actuales. Respetamos su desici��n y aplaudimos su breve regreso junto a la cantautora Aurora Guirado. Bravo por ella, como Marisol o Pepa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mejor, ?IMPOSIBLE!","review":"Este doble cd recoge 40 de las canciones m��s emblem��ticas de la superestrella espa?ola Marisol.

Obviously, othewise why would anyone spend sixty plus dollars to buy a combination square. Because it's from Starrett, I know it's right! If you want to build furniture, you really needed this. Had that proven to me more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better","review":"What can you say, except it's made by Starrett. They are expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, BUT ...","review":"The quality is top-notch, the kind that commands admiration. BUT: I'm disappointed that the movement is not smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original length? Doubtful.","review":"I have a sinking feeling that Matecumbe's long-overdue arrival to DVD is not without flaw. The running length says 107 minutes but the theatrical version clocked in at 117 min. The original 1985 VHS ran at 107 min. but the 1997 VHS re-release restored the film to its original length. Because the title now falls under the \\"Wonderful World of Disney\\" banner, it looks like the disc is the shorter broadcast version, unfortunately. Very disappointing, for this is one Disney title I've been waiting years for to come to DVD. Oh well. I've still got my 117-min. VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly suprised when it arrived. It comes with a nice wooden foam-lined case, and an extra battery. It has a nice operational feel to it, not like a cheap set of plastic calipers. Only caveat is the digital display part and battery holder are plastic, and probably would crack if dropped. The rest is stainless steel, and overall I would say it's a great set of digital calipers for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've had these calipers for years now, calibrating is very easy and battery life is excellent. I love the wooden case it comes with and the padding within help keep the calipers dry and damage free. I'd definately recommend this tool to anyone looking for a decent digital caliper."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"I've had this set of calipers for about 6 years now and saw that I hadn't written a review. I only use them occasionally, but I'm only on my second battery and it is plenty accurate for measuring thickness and depth for my wood projects. They are easy to zero and auto-off means I don't kill the battery accidentally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I find it funny that her ex-husband allegedly trashed her last year. I can't give her book much credence either since she was never seen in public with Diana and only wrote this AFTER Diana was dead. Why not before?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we believe this woman?","review":"\\"Lady\\" Campbell seems to be promoting herself as a \\"friend\\" of the Princess of Wales. I find it very interesting that this is all coming out now after the Princess is no longer here to defend herself or to state whether this information is factual or not. There were many aspects of this book that were just a little hard to believe. This woman has made a living out of trashing the Princess and seems to have come into her own since her death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana's Life","review":"I really don't know why some people consider this woman to be a saint. I really think she was probably a caring, giving personbut lets face it , she was human. How many girls in their teensdream about marrying someone famous? Alot I'm sure. In her caseher wish came true and I don't think she was ready for it. Nobody is really at fault here. Lady Campbell is simply writingabout what what other people told her. Prince Charles was probably under pressure to marry and like alot of girls at 19she was probably INFATUATED not IN LOVE. It's very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage written by supposed \\"insider\\"","review":"I have nothing but contempt for this woman. I don't even believe that she ever met the late Princess. I've seen her on TV and Campbell is as ugly on the outside as she is on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Trash","review":"I was required (really!) to read this book for a graduate class. This book is full of nothing but jealous ramblings. Lady Campbell seems to be dredging the bottom of the proverbial lake to find the nastiest details possible about Diana. Her personal comments dispersed throughout the book are not only unprofessional in the writing sense but also unnecessary. The storyline gets very confusing at times, jumping from one subject to another - a hard read. True, Diana was a spoiled brat, but let the woman rest in peace! Lady Campbell is no lady!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Unreal\\" Princess Diana","review":"The motivation for writing this book is to make Prince Charles a palatable figure. Everything that went wrong in the Wales' marriage is Diana's fault. The author glorifies people like Nicholas Sommes -- he was brilliant to discover that Diana had personality disorders. Poor Charles was only trying to define love when he said that he did not know what love is.No good purpose is served by this book. The general public has no need to know the details Princess' private life. The so-called author has a need to delve into Diana's sex life too and makes judgments about her.The author also thinks she knows more about Diana's relationship with her mother than Diana did.The author touts herself as a lady. Not in my estimation. She does not mourn Diana's loss as stated on the jacket. Shame on the pain she has caused Diana's sons and supporters by this piece of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view of the Princess","review":"I am enjoying this book and appreciate that it is more about the younger Diana than other books I haveread. And it reveals more about the Prince and Princess life together in ways I haven't read in otherbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST","review":"Not many people give a \\"ho hum\\" about Quantum Physics.

She was not the brightest person when it came to bowling equipment but whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"Mr. Hagerty, who wrote the prior review of this book, was kinder than I can be. I read David Eisenhower's Foreward and recalled what a fine writer he is - as is his father, John Eisenhower. Unfortunately, Mr. Humes has done a remarkably poor job of telling the story of the Churchill - Eisenhower relationship. I first became uneasy while reading Humes' own acknowledgments, replete with what appeared to be mere namedropping than acknowledgment of assistance in preparing the book. In fact, it appears more likely that the author simply put the thing together relying on faulty memory rather than on independent sources.I cannot recommend this for anyone who wants to know something about either Churchill or Eisenhower. The factual errors are so many as to make one wonder how the thing got published. I found myself wondering about factual statements I knew to be correct because of all the errors. For the casual historian, this book could in fact prove to be misleading. To be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love to read anything about Churchill and this book promised a treat, however it was a tremendous disappointment. About 2/3 of the book consists of alternating chapters on each man rather than on their relationship and what it meant for the outcome of the war. The book was superficial and didn't come even close to what the title promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I bought six of these binders for my middle school children.

I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone whose knowledge about this underrated president is minimal but wishes to learn more; for those who already know a great deal about him, I would recommend those books that explore the details of his life, character, and administration (like the biographies by Allan Nevins or Rexford Tugwell).

Lots of interesting background and detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"These Schlesinger books are good reads on the presidents. This one was no exception.

I bought it because it was a complete package (scope, eyepieces, \\"go to\\" computer, and full-sized tripod). It performs well and lives up to the hype on the box. The \\"go to\\" feature really works - the sought after object is almost always somewhere in the low power field of view. The only flaw is the battery pack, which seems like an afterthought and is always getting tangled.

I would also recommend a better power source (AC/power-tank) and a slightly higher power eyepiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Telescope","review":"I bought this telescope as an entry into astronomy to learn a bit more with actual viewing, but not to spend too much money in case I found I was not really interested. I liked being able to buy it with free shipping within the US. I have only used it a few times due to overcast weather, but have seen the Moon, Jupiter and it's moons, Uranus and three Messier objects. The Messier objects were only visible as dim clouds due to there being too much light from street lighting. I used the computerized guidance system and it works as advertized and was able to slew onto the Messier objects. I think it has filled the purpose and is a good platform for understanding the problems of astronomical observing, in case I want to get deeper into it. I took a picture of the Moon with a regular digital camera and was surprised at how well it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hand Controller is a joke.","review":"I've owned this telescope for years, and for most of those years its been sitting in my closet collecting dust because it simply refuses to align. I've done everything to align this thing, and finally after years of this abuse, I've given up and called Tech Support which is another joke.

Because there were positives, I decided to risk buying it. In my experience, this is a complete waste of money. A few days after it was hooked up, I was still catching mice with conventional spring traps. Lately there have been no signs, so I thought maybe it was working. However, last night I left a ripe pear on the kitchen counter, only FOUR FEET from the PestContro II in the kitchen outlet, and a mouse bit into the pear. As far as I am concerned this is completely worthless and I wish I could get my money back.

Assembly seemed to be easy, except the lower shelf cam lock screws are showing (1/4 inch) even after tightening the cam locks. Also had issues with inserting the drawer due to the screw not being long enough for the knob. Called Customer Service and all they said was to submit the Control No. on the form submitted with the box along with my issues. I will add that the shipment was very timely - only a few days after submission which was nice. Not sure if they will send 4 additional legs or different size cam lock screws, but I am having an open house less than 2 weeks and wanted this fixed by then. It seems once you purchase online, you are at their mercy for getting the product fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little table","review":"Excellent price. Easy to put together.

Gil Smolin must live a diverse and interesting life to write with such imagination and believability. He displays a first-hand level of medical expertise and scientific knowledge that is readily apparent. He is thus able to present a plot that is not only compelling but highly credible.

Great characters, whom I would love to meet, great story, how did Smolin ever think this out, solid science, and fabulous scenery. There's not a respite in the whole book especially the last third.

He played the fiddle from his hip and Diggy Lo had the crowd jumpin, as far as one could \\"jump\\" in the Ed Sullivan theater. 40 years on, the music is still as infectous. I caught a few of his live cuts on YouTube and I got up and started \\"jumpin\\".

This is the first book I've ever read from this series and it will be my last. I can only assume that the script writers for the TV series were better writers than Ralph McInerny. The plot is mildly intriguing, but the characters are cardboard, the dialog is embarrassingly wooden, the humor forced, and the action scenes awkward. I gave it two stars rather than one because, as I said, the plot was reasonably interesting, if a bit clunky.Not recommended.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I just returned from a 10 day trip to Rio and the surrounding areas and was profoundly disappointed by the guide book for the following reasons: 1) No useful maps (do you really want to carry around multiple guide books?); 2) Totally out of date (I tried virtually every club/bar listed and wasted much time on wild-goose chases); 3) No useful info on hotels (doubt the author stayed in any of them or even visited them); 4) Restaurants recommended were all disappointments (if they were still extant)and 5)Assumes reader knows Portugese and is familiar with how to get around.If you plan to visit (and you should because it's truly a wonderful country) invest a few weeks in Brazilian Portugese lessons. Surprisingly few people in and around Rio speak English (even in the service sector) and if you have a basic understanding of the language your trip will be a thousand times better.

The Schick injector bladesare incredibly sharp, and you can end up with a deep cut, quick, if you press, instead of letting the blade do the work.My first cut never touched my skin, but took a huge patch of hair off my arm that hasn't grown back yet.Be careful.

Quality wise it's somewhat better built than the similar Meade scopes, with fewer plastic pieces.You can buy smaller scopes with automation, but when shopping atthe inexpensive end of the market, it's better to put your money into optics instead of automation.

Wilcox writes beautiful songs that sound great accompanied by a solo guitar or with a band, making this collection quite versatile. In addition, he is known for altered tunings (including open C, open G, DADGAD, dropped D, and some I wouldn't know how to name) and capo placement that make learning the songs from the recordings extremely difficult for the nonprofessional player. As far as I can tell the tab is quite accurate, and the songs are well chosen from those albums--you'll probably find your favorite here.

This book differs from a lot of Ms Hill's other books in that in Amorelle's loneliness she accepts the care and physical attentions of a hansome gentleman, he is as usual absolutely controlling and unreasonable when she comes to her senses but the book is one of Ms Hill's later books and displays humor and is in my opinion a worthwhile read.

After David Hewson's truly dreadful 'Lucifer's Shadow', also set in the city, this was a relatively pallatable novel. But it has some serious failings. Firstly Zen doesn't really exhibit the attitudes and sensibilities of an Italian police officer, but rather that of a well-educated middle class Englishman - i.e. what the author is. This becomes more and more obvious as the story goes on. The second big problem is the way the plot simply fizzles out. There are few, if any, real surprises or revelations, which is rather a let down. Also, like other British authors before him, Dibdin cannot resist reminding us at every turn how mysterious Venice is: the fogs, the creepy narrow streets, the smelly canals and crumbling palazzos, etc etc etc. The trouble is, it's all too familiar. We've all seen it, or at least seen the movies set there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent View of Venice, Lousy Plot","review":"I love books by Pears, Swan, Reverte, and Hill, and wanted to add Dibdin to my list. But somehow this book did not quite live up to those expectations. I thought Dibdin did a fine job of recreating Venice for the reader (although one more reference to Zen having some type of coffee and grappa...). However, I never found myself caring one way or the other about the so-called mystery. At one point he solves the \\"ghost\\" story, only to be told to forget it by the offended party. The various plot lines were as various and meandering as the canals of Venice, which were all wound up into what amounts to too neat an ending. I may read another Zen mystery but not for awhile, and not until I'm at a loss for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Loss","review":"Dire, cliche-ridden crime 'thriller'. Silly, contrived plot. Venice feels about 10 blocks wide with characters bumping into each other. Dead Lagoon almost works as a parody with its mad spinster, bent cops, dodgy politicians, nazi past, beautiful love foil and terrible prose style weighed by comically bad metaphor and simile.In the three Dibdin novels I've read there is always a climatic chase scene at the end. Unfortunately the 'big chase' here is just tendious and the outcome contrived.There are some passages which made me giggle as they were so badly written. Zen's reaction to a night of passion for instance. Or when a character blows a puff of smoke (there is a lot of gung ho smoking in this novel by the way) and makes a non-smoking sign gently spin.This mess doesn't so much as come to an end but collapse in a heap with a particularly risible final paragraph.Try Dibdin's Last Sherlock Holmes Story instead. It is infinitely superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Lagoon -- Dead Book","review":"This is the first Dibdin/Zen book I've tried and I found it wanting. I didn't feel I got to know Zen like I got to know Brunetti in Donna Leon's supberb Venice books. Maybe he's just not as likeable as Brunetti. And I found the plot someone artificial. And, as another reviewer noted, Dibdin's Venice must be awfully small because Zen keeps running into people he knows. I guess, in a nutshell, the plot didn't reach out and grab me. All in all, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I'm a new reader of Michael Dibdin and am already hooked. Aurelio Zen is a thinking person's detective and a modern Italian version of the world-weary, incorruptible, and cynical hardboiled detectives of the 1930s. The mystery itself is compelling, with a ghost story as the key to intricate, overlapping conspiracies. But the glory of the book is its Venetian topography, along with its insights into Zen's psychological terrain and finely-honed sense of justice. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEAD LAGOON","review":"My introduction to Michael Dibdin and Aurelio Zen was a welcome one. I'm always in search for detectives with the intelligence and depth of personality evident in Colin Dexter's Chief Inspector Morse. Zen was not a disappointment and I'm waiting anxiously for several other Dibdin titles that I've recently ordered or won at auction. DEAD LAGOON, if you've been to Venice, is a wonderful flashback to the mood of that city with its many twists and turns of canals, streets and dark alleys. The only comparable for capturing Venice that I've read (or seen in a movie version) is Daphne Du Maurier's DON'T LOOK NOW. A great read - not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"miniature print","review":"The print in this book is so small that it is impossible to read without getting a headache.

He captures the aura, the people, and the police department. The plot is interesting, and the characters are well fleshed out.It makes a nice little get-away to the real Venice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen in Venice","review":"I was quite interested in reading this book because I have enjoyed the PBS series. In addition, though most of the novels take place in Rome, the setting for this one is in Venice, Zen's hometown. I'd just returned from visiting Venice, so it had added appeal to me. The Zen of the novel is physically different from the Zen of the television series. While Zen is tall and oldish in the book, Zen in the series is an Italian hunk. Aside from that disparity, however, this novel is, like the show, most interesting with a multi-faceted plot peopled by characters that are realistic. The story has a grittiness to it that probes well below a tourist's view of Venice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot, like Venice, takes many interesting twists & turns","review":"I was looking for an \\"atmospheric\\" book to read while I was in Venice. By luck, I found Dead Lagoon and I feel my choice couldn't have been better. The main character, Aurelio Zen, is like the city herself - gritty, complex, flawed but still fascinating. I also found myself thinking that I don't like a lot of things about this guy. But like a car crash on the side of the road, I found it impossible to look away. I had to see how things worked themselves out. I especially enjoyed the way the politics of Italian bureaucracy colors nearly every one of his moves - it's almost like it's another character. I admit reading it from a hotel room on the Grand Canal has probably influenced my review, but I still recommend it because talented writers like Dibdin need to be encouraged to keep working at their craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Venetian mystery for readers who hate whodunits","review":"Michael Dibdin isn't just a winner of the Crime Writers Association's Gold Dagger award--he's also one of today's most literate writers in any genre. DEAD LAGOON is an evocative, stylishly written mystery novel that captures the spirit and mood of Venice in the 1990s. Even if you don't normally read mysteries, DEAD LAGOON deserves a spot on your Venice reading list.Durant Imboden, Venice for Visitors, http://govenice.miningco.co"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Support.","review":"THE STRUCTURE OF ENGLISH FOR READERS, WRITERS, AND TEACHERS is a textbook that we used in my grammatical ananlysis class. The book is written in a style that is very informal and general, which is much different than many other textbooks, especially those relating to linguistics and grammar. Nevertheless, the book does lack a great deal of substance and therefore doesn't work well on it's own. On the other hand, the book contains a great many helpful exercises prinkled throughout each chapter instead of just at the end of the chapter. The book also does a really good job of explaining and illustrating the auxiliary class that has developed in the English language. With that said, though THE STRUCTURE OF ENGLISH FOR READERS, WRITERS, AND TEACHERS doesn't stand on it's own very well, it makes a very useful supplementary book to other grammatical textbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Metal Record!","review":"This band was one of a kind, saw them several times on tour with Motorhead, Anthrax, Manowar, Imortal, etc. They actually wrote songs that you could remember instead of just trying to sound as heavy as possible.

The sound quality is excellent and the different channels all have independently-adjustable volume. They do lack a mute switch for the microphone which is a big oversight. Also the headphones exert a lot of inward pressure on your head which makes it hurt to wear them for longer than a couple of hours.The real problem though is the build quality: after about 3 or 4 months the foam ear covering on the right side became completely detached and there's no easy way to reattach it. Fortunately because of that inward pressure it did stay in place. After about 10 months the plastic above one of the headphones cracked, exposing a very small and fragile-looking wire that will probably fail in a few more months.

It would be difficult to read this book and not relate to each character and the variety of baggage that effects day to day life. Anna Jeffrey did an outstanding job of making the reader become not just a reader, but a part of the story. Her descriptions make both Idaho and Texas come alive. The other characters in the book somehow seemed just as real and important as Luke and Dahlia. (I would definitely like to meet Piggy!!)

This is one of the best DVD music performance videos that I own. Although not in a \\"HD\\" format such as blu-ray, it is a very detailed recording visually and in a widescreen format.

Eisenhower was a great wartime commander. He led men into battle and exercised diplomacy in his wartime alliance. He was a so-so president who did some memorable things. Ike started the intrastate highway system, warned against the military-industrial complex, toppled two legitimate governments (Iran, Guatemala) and came close to a nuclear test ban treaty. He was a man many Americans treated as a father figure. He won two terms as President. Many people would have voted him a third term if the law allowed it. He was against the Brown vs. Board of Education decision but used the military to back up the judiciary.Wicker spent a week with Eisenhower in 1962. Even though his admiration of President and General Eisenhower in there, his book is a fair accessment of this great American. Eisenhower may not have been a great President, but he was far better than most of our chief executives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin and poor entry in this otherwise decent series","review":"I have read several of the books in the American President series and have discovered that generally speaking, the lesser known President's seem to get the best coverage but with this book Tom Wicker seems to be just lazing his way through Dwight Eisenhower's life. It is obvious that he doesn't have a great opinion of his and one finds that he can't list a single accomplishment of the Eisenhower administration that he reacts to positively.Sadly, this is a by the numbers biography and it pales compared to Stephen Ambrose's work and the work of a number of other fine authors.

How Schlesinger, at his advanced age is able to edit anything other than the minced food at the home is beyone me. Avoid anything associated with him at all possible costs!!!

Tom Wicker is a journalist, not a historian, and it shows. He merely presents a narrative chronology of Eisenhower's presidency, devoting only a few paragraphs to his life before he entered the Oval Office. In what is essentially a long magazine article, you never learn a thing about Eisenhower as a person, and Eisenhower emerges as a two-dimensional figure, not the fascinating man that he was. Worst of all, Wicker is so one-sided in his coverage, he tries to find fault in even Eisenhower's unmitigated successes. This ends up simply a book-length critique. It is blinkered and one-sided, with no sense of perspective or context. There are many better biogrpahies of Eisenhower available.

So few people today posses the patience to stick with such a wordy narrative, in which the author prefers to tell (and my, does she tell well!)insted of show. I read this book in about twice the amount of time it would take with a novel of one of Hazzard's peers. But what a joy the additional time was comprised of. Being able to close my eyes after reading passages and smile at the word play within. What a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total bust for me","review":"Not very well done not interesting.

But it was all downhill from there--75% of my book club did not care for the book and wondered how it won any awards. I started virtual highlighting the worst examples of Hazzard's unnecessarily wordy style. And I stopped looking up all the definitions, as I'd never get through a page. Not to mention my book clubbers were appalled at the age difference of the lovers. Big no."},{"rating":"1","title":"my literary reaction","review":"In the penumbrous, shadowy twilight, reading, alone. I come upon this passage - page 107 paragraph 9. The phrase \\" Pattie's pusillanimous plait\\". Tentative fingers play upon winter-scorched lips. The book is flung across the room. Discarded. Alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"Shirley Hazzard owes me $24.00 for this book. Her pompous writing style obscures the basic plot to the point that I wanted to scream out loud. You feel nothing for the characters, mostly because their speech and thoughts are so affected that you cannot believe that they are human beings. The dialogue and speech is completely inappropriate for the time. She seems to forget that this novel was not set in Victorian England. Here's an example: \\"There was also fascism, rife in city and countryside. At night, young men held the gladiatorial battles of an unequal civil war.\\" Personally, I cannot imagine an modern person speaking like this.To be fair, maybe it gets better in the end, but I couldn't finish it. It was supposed to be my entertainment on a cross-country flight. I ended up reading the airline magazine instead. At least the magazine wasn't supposed to be an award winning piece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this was a painful experience","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. The author's wordiness is very hard to sift through and the plot is very much lacking interest. None of the characters are developed very well and in reading this, I often found myself in a state of confusion. It took deep concentration to finish each page and after reading some of the other reviews which suggest re-reading the book, I cannot imagine being able to get through the book a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Over-Written, and Pointless!","review":"This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly the Most Boring Book in History","review":"As an avid reader, I followed the excellent reviews and accolades this book received and looked forward to getting to it.

I say don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever!","review":"I couldn't get through this book. I tried hard but had to put it down halfway thru. I was going to take it back to the bookstore for a full refund but I thought perhaps it was me so I lent the book out. It was returned to me partially unread as they couldn't make sense of it either. How can a book like this be an award winner? Wow....really bad. You would go along reading and you didn't know what was going on.Don't waste your money.

An outstanding novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I simply can't understand why this book was a National Book Award winner. True, the writer is masterful at description, but the dialog is so stilted, so pretentious, that it mars what few assets the book possesses.

I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful purple prose","review":"I was relieved to see all the bad reviews of this book here on Amazon. I bought it in the airport on the strength of the National Book Award and the fact that she used to hang out with Graham Greene. I was so angry after about 20 pages that if I had been at home and not on a plane I would have ripped the book up and stomped on it.The other reviewers do a good job at conveying the agony of reading Hazzard's prose: \\"stilted\\" is an understatement.If you want WWII upper-class English-Army-officer fiction conveyed in beautifully refined prose, read or re-read the war novels of Anthony Powell and Evelyn Waugh instead of this pretentious boring malarkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Shirley Hazzard has written a book that will stay with the reader throughout time. You will ache for the characters. You will feel like you are taken to another time and place. The power of the storytelling will leave you wishing for more, wishing the book would never ever end. When it does, read it again and again. It's a treasure. Thank you Shirley Hazzard for Leith, Helen and Peter. The time I spent reading your book is among the best I have ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"A challenge just to finish","review":"I too, read the reviews and decided to give this one a shot. I enjoyed Hazzard's writing style, but the crawling story line was terribly dull and did not go very far. I could care less about the characters and their encounters throughout the book.

The story bounces all over the place, never seems to have a consistent theme and finally, turns out to be just plain boring. I'll give the author some credit; the imagery is nice and having traveled to many of the same locations in Asia myself, I enjoyed her descriptions of those places set in a bygone era. Unfortunately, the budding story of a war hero's longing for a very young girl (he refers to her as the \\"Changeling\\") made the guy come off looking like a pedophile.

That is smaller than most hammers. Even the handle is a little hard to get a grip on. It's also impossible to tell how slim the head is from the pics. It looks like a bulky hatchet, but it is actually VERY thin. I didn't realize it would be so small. If space or weight is a concern, this is a nice hatchet. If you need something to put out a little work, try something else. I'm still a little upset at how small it is, but the weight is in the description, so I guess it's my own fault for not noticing.

I prefer the S.D. green for acoustic guitar and red for electric. When not using just my fingers, I also like a rubberized pick for ukulele and sometimes for acoustic or bass.I bought the Dunlop Jazz III picks as an Amazon (filleritem.com) filler item. It takes a small adjustment to adapt to their smaller size but I find that I do prefer their sound (or dampened pick noise) for jazzy Strat playing in my DACFGC tuning more than Snarling Dogs.I guess that the black color is popular but it is harder to see if you drop it.

I am frankly happier with that because things like that invariably fall off and wind up in the \\"fix it later\\" drawer. I would recommend shoes and dont even think of rocking this thing in on a sidewalk or driveway or you are going to chew up the wheels. but for doing laps around the kitchen or empty garage, it's brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy I ever bought","review":"This is the best toy I've ever bought... by far. It is so well constructed. I got it as a gift for my daughter's first birthday, but I gave it to her early. She has been pushing it around since she was 11 months old. I bought the large after reading the reviews, and although she cannot touch the ground yet...it won't be long. I am happy I got the large because I think she will get more use out of it in years to come. For now, she just pushes it all over the house. We have long carpeting and she has no trouble with it at all. I love that it is easily turned around...I don't have to get her out of tight spots, she can do it herself. We had a wooden Melissa and Doug push toy, but she could not turn it around. So someone had to be at each end, and she'd go in a straight line back and forth. With this one, she can go every which way. I wish we'd had it sooner, I think she might have even walked earlier. Well worth every penny!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"This was a little smaller than I anticipated, so I was glad I purchased the large size.

They come in 2 sizes, but we bought the smaller one for her. She loves it. At first, she just pushed it around and now she rides it everywhere. When she's 3, we may get the larger one for her.It's a sturdy toy, does not break. Comfortable with the foam filled \\"bug\\" part and the double wheels swivel easily as well as go any direction she steers it. This toy is not tippy - it is very stable and strong. It has a wood base under the seat part. It is well-made and adorable. I highly recommend it. Great construction and design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute as a bug!","review":"I purchased both the large mouse and large ladybug. I was very pleased with how well built they are.

However, I'm glad I saw a picture someone posted of their 11 month old son on the small wheely bug because that ultimately gave me the best information about scale.My daughter got this when she was 9 months old. She is a shorty at 27\\", and the small fit her perfectly. She has great balance and loves ride on toys. The comment about a baby small enough to fit the small wheely bug is probably too small for the toy is nonsense. It depends on your child. My daughter absolutely loves this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy for little ones","review":"My daughter is really enjoying riding the Wheely Bug, Lady Bird. It is small enough for her to comfortably ride upon while we push her, but she cannot yet use her feet to push it herself. I think she will also enjoy standing behind it and pushing it. The cover on the bug is made of a soft but durable and wipable vinyl type material. The base of the bug is made of sturdy wood and the wheels are basic casters which we've been able to use on all the floor surfaces in our home. In all it is a very well made toy and should be fun for my daughter to use for some months to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger Then Expected","review":"We bought this for our sons first birthday. He is extremely tall for his age, so I chose to buy the large one. BUT he looks like a tiny tiny person on the large one. His toes are the only things that touch the floor. He will be able to ride it for years to come! My husband even took it through the kitchen for a spin, so it is very durable. It also rolls very well on carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and sturdy","review":"Very cute. My one year old grandson is still too little to ride on this toy but he likes to push it around. The small does appear quite small but it is so sturdy that it will for sure last a long time. The older kids at the birthday party (ages 5-8) played on it for some time. I think the free moving wheels make it fun enough to make up for small size. I have not seen the larger size but I am very happy with the small size. And the provider was very prompt in shipping. Good experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute, not as large as I expected.","review":"I have very tall children. My 9 month old baby is wearing 2T clothes and they fit...so I purchased the large size. His feet don't hit the ground, but he has to bend over to hold the handle bars, and especially when he stands to push it, he practically has to bend in half. I can't imagine how small the small size must be. Everything about this toy is just about perfect except for the height of the handlebars. I would like them to be about 4 inches higher. I think they would still be comfortable for most babies, I've noticed in most of the pictures, the babies hands are reaching pretty far down to grab the bar, so I don't think it's just because my baby is tall. I LOVE that the wheels turn so easily. They toy is much lighter weight than I expected, which is nice. It's still heavy enough to keep baby from getting ahead of himself. All in all, I love this and would recommend it. It's attractive and fun. Four stars only for handlebar height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Toy","review":"I bought this item for my daughter's first birthday in a large size. It is a little big for her but she enjoys being pushed on it, playing wih the antennas, and pushing it around the house. However I think that she prefers her sister's rid-on toy because it has music and makes sounds. I am hoping that as she gets bigger she will play with the wheely bug more. In the meantime, my 4-year old is making use of it when the 1-year old isn't playing with it. Very cute toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheely Bee","review":"Awesome.

From the moment he got it he sat on it and tried to go. He is now over 2 and still LOVES it he rides it all the time, now he goes much much faster, he makes it turn really fast and lifts his feet up, he stops about an inch short of the wall, it just amazes me how good he is at controlling it. I think it is a WONDERFUL toy, he learned how to get around without hitting things, and it has been great for him. I hope he can ride it a little longer, it is kind of small now but he doesn't seem to mind. Maybe I will get him a bigger one when he turns 3, but for now I can't say enough great things about the wheely bug!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are \\"wheely\\" fun!!!!","review":"I bought two used Wheely bugs in Feb of '09. One large bee and one small ladybug. My boys are 2 and 4 and fight over the small one.It looks small for my 4 year old but he loves it and is able to move and groove just fine with it.Both boys say it goes the fastest :-) While the large one is nice it doesn't seem to really be as easy to use and my 4 year old is not a tiny child! He wears a 5t in clothing and a size 13 shoe if that helps for sizing info.Yes,his legs do look a bit like a grasshooper when he is on the small one but he vastly prefers it.I would totally buy one of these again at retail.I actually am today!

After back pain pushing her around I saw this and ordered the ladybug. It is just like the picture- very stable and the perfect size. She squealed and hopped right on and started scooting around. Still get to push her on the ride-on (Speed) but this is great. I don't know how much larger the other size is, but this was very manageable for her (just tall of average for her age).It is also very durable in construction (the antennae haven't come off yet or even stretched in spite of her best efforts) and it rides smoothly. I think it will last through several childhoods beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy 2 year old toddler","review":"Very well constructed, sturdy and my son can easily get off without any help, this is his first ride around car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers","review":"My 16 month old son loves this ride on toy.

It's adorable. There's no question about that. However, she's very big for her age (in both weight and height) and I found that she didn't fit on it at all. When she first received it, she amused herself by pushing it around the room. But when she got a little better with her walking and tried to ride it she would tip it every time she climbed on. The wheels are also so loose that this became a speed machine on our hardwood floors and I was constantly concerned for her safety. Overall, I don't feel that the price is worth the limited amount of time a child will have to play for this toy.

We tried to get her to sit on it several times but she looked perplexed and would just push it away. We suspect that perhaps it was too small, however she is only 15 mo. and isn't an especially tall child. We ended up with a $23 plastic ride along by Fisher Price which she adores.

If there was a book. It was beautiful, with incredible performances by Joe Flanigan and William Hall Jr (who have great chemistry together), but with only one viewing under my belt, I feel like I missed something (or several somethings) that would have made watching it a truly profound experience. There's a tangible atmosphere to the whole film that creates a timeless place that's apart from the rest of the world, but left me feeling incomplete. I'll go back and watch it again and see if I can figure out what I've missed ... so I give it 4 stars because I think it's a better movie than what I saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flounders in The Shallows","review":"This movie starts out with an interesting premise and good intentions, but something, nope, a lot, is missing. Joe Flannigan is always a treat, although he is still maturing as an actor. William Hall Jr. is a good actor, but did not have the Morgan Freeman gravitas to pull off this role. Nor was his character well written. He is the clearest-headed alcoholic ever seen on the screen. All of the principals are about the same age and that's a problem. The Harry character is just too young and so is everyone else who is supposed to be his peer. They didn't even try makeup to suggest age. The surrealism of this community acting bee consistently undermines any tension. I kept expecting Dorothy and Toto to show up. Every character except for the two leads is about as cardboard cut out as they come. The narration is too much by half. I hope the good people of Bainbridge Island (where this was filmed) can forget this and move on with their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"MovieBuff","review":"Well this must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting was poor, the plot just didn't go anywhere, and the characters didn't develop into anybody I felt compelled to admire or even like. By the end, I was almost hoping the building would just burn down, and everyone would go away. I guess mainly because the 2 lead actors (awful, awful dry acting by the younger guy) just had no heart. Most of my family left, I stayed hoping for some redeeming feature, but it only got worse. The script could have been written by a 12 year old. It could have had much more potential. It was rather very disjointed.I'll give 1 star for the photography - beautiful in parts, but perhaps a bit too arty - perhaps the cameraman decided to just do some nice shots as the whole plot was a mess anyway, LOL.Save your money and time and watch 'My Fair lady' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Pantene Smells Terrible","review":"I could not agree more with the two previous posts.

There are killers, Indians, Texas Rangers and accidents along the way. Very well constructed with just the right amount of humor to move the story along at an enjoyable pace.

He spends all his free time in the basement working on his experiments with plants.I bought these episodes on VHS back in the 90s and it is nice to finally own them on DVD.

Replaces all your other spring-type clamps in one unit. Holds just about any 4 inch or less wood joint together plenty tight for gluing. Quick and easy to adjust.

Suggest the 4 inch rather than 3 inch size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic design - useful size","review":"These little bowls nest perfectly.

Two average scoops look quite generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"INACCURATE ITEM DESCRIPTION","review":"The item is not correctly described. It actually includes four blades, all 7-1/4 in diameter. There are no 7 in blades included.I have an old Craftsman circular saw that takes 7 in. blades (7-1/4 in blades are to large) and had expected to use two of the blades in that saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"good combo kit","review":"Good for the money. You get a little bit of everything in this kit. I bought this kit mainly for the masonry cut off blade. It worked great, and It's a good deal b/c it/s 1/4\\" thick and not 1/8\\" like most masonry cut off blades. The variety of the other blades is great too. The variety of this set makes your saw more versatile...all for under $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blades","review":"I have many Skil products. I bought a skil saw along with this blade set. The blades give you a wide range of cutting surfaces in a single case. It's nice to put all of the blades into my tool bag and not worry about dinging up the blades or any other tools. It's a great set to take anywhere to allow you to cut multiple surfaces. The blades are made well for the price. You can't go wrong buying this set. It's always nice to have a blade in case you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used three of the four blades and they are good value","review":"All four of the blades were 7 1/4. I used three of them on several small projects and they did the job with no grumbles.I especially like the carry case as it is always a pain to know where to store, later how to find, blades in the past. I expect this storage will also reduce rusting as they are stored in their own pouch not touching other metal inside the case. It is a good solution and the case will handle a few more blades easily.You get what you pay for here. If you have a big plywood job, something more robust would be needed. But, a basic set of blades for the little jobs one has around the house this will cut most anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Description","review":"This review ONLY addresses the DESCRIPTION. The blades might be great. I have not used them yet. The product description states 7\\" & 7 1/4\\". However, the package only contains 7 1/4\\" blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"did the job","review":"Can't beat the price. I used the smaller blade to cut 2x4's and used the masonry blade to cut stucco on the outside of my house, but when it got to the metal wire in the wall the blade got chewed up a little, I should have transitioned to the metal cutting blade. If your going to cut a lot of stucco then buy a diamond blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product. great price","review":"Well made -- its Skil. Very good selection of blades. Great holder.

I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Kitties love it","review":"Nice way to contain the food and water in one spot. My cats would push their old bowls all over the kitchen. They seem to like the height of the platform. I like the height also as it is easier for me, a wheelchair user, to reach and remove the water dish for cleaning and refilling. It is a decent looking addition to the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect!","review":"It's difficult to find a raised dish for our dog. She's medium build, and it seemed like all we could find in stores were made for tiny dogs or giant ones. This one is excellent though, and easy to put together but very sturdy. It looks a lot nicer than the wire ones too. I'm glad we got this one. Our dog loves it, and so do we. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good.","review":"It works fine, but the silver sides fall out.

She eats just one bowl at a time so it works out. Keep little crumbs from getting on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowls too small","review":"We wanted a tall feeding system because we have a very large dog. Having a large dog means he eats a lot. The bowls that came with this were half the size of the ones we were using. It is just not what we needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After owning this feeder for about two years, I'm sorry to say that it turned out to be a disappointment. While the height of the stand is perfect for my two dogs, the bowls are way too small, so I have had to place larger bowls that barely fit on top of the existing holes which makes for a very cramped space for two dogs. But the most disappointing thing is that the black plastic has become covered with white crud (not sure what it is) around the bowl area. It looks embarrassingly bad and unsanitary, and I am unable to get it off even with a brillo pad. I am now in the market for a new feeder. Maybe the lighter colored one does not have this problem. I cannot recommend this feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"These are perfect for my two Chihuahuas who are 5lbs and 8lbs. Very glad i bought these. Keeps a lot of food and water from spilling onto the floor. Highly recommended. And i don't know if this has anything to do with being ergonomic, but it seems like my dogs have had less stomach aches after using these bowls. I think from them sitting up higher it helps them digest food better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food Stand","review":"I had ordered this food stand for our dogs but when it arrived realized it was just too small for them. I didn't review the dimensions closely and ended up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4\\" elevated pet bowls","review":"This 4\\" elevated feeding bowl looks very nice in my kitchen. My Boston Terrier puppy can barely reach into it but she is growing so I think the size will be perfect for her in a few months.The unit seems sturdy and looks very nice. I will say though that on each side it has a wood panel that gives it a nice appeal and I do like the way it looks. However one of the panels, a longer one, does not stay up as it keeps sliding down to the bottom of the legs. I have tried sliding it back up but it will not hold on its own. I did jam some electrical tape to help hold that panel up and hopefully it will stay. I keep that side pointed to a wall now just in case.Compared to other elevated feeding bowls I have seen I still like this item over many that I have seen. Plus Amazon has a great price. Very sturdy, practical and looks very nice. Panel not fit right is the only reason I did not rate five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the little wooden pannels.","review":"The bowls are the perfect size for my cat and I love the black. My problem is with the \\"reversible stainless steel-looking panels\\". First, they look nothing like stainless steel and are hideous. Second, they won't stay in place! The damn things keep sliding down, it's getting on my nerves. Why do they even bother having them on there? Why not just have the black plastic piece cover more instead of these stupid wooden things?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"This product is a very good purchase.

Very sharp lens with good color rendition; an excellent all around lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good commentary by a revered professor","review":"Dr. Sperry's insights, particularly into Isaiah are really great. I would have given this review 5 stars except for some problems with the Kindle transcribing. In several places parts of a word, or entire words are either not present or consist of weird characters leaving the reader to guess at what the word was. I particularly appreciated his insights into Hosea and whether or not the Lord had commanded Hosea to marry a harlot."},{"rating":"2","title":"First class \\"who done it\\"","review":"I enjoyed this mystery, a first class \\"who done it\\" novel. The author displays obvious knowledge of the field of psychology as well as police procedures and practices, strengths she leverages to make this book into a realistic, interesting and exciting read. A very well-written book that flows logically and keeps the readers' interest. For clarification purposes, it should be stated that although this book has a transsexual person as the main focal point, there's not much character development or insight generated about this person. Therefore, this book fits more into the genre of detective stories than transgender fiction. So if you're looking for transgender fiction, you get only a smidgen here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands the Heal","review":"Just finished \\"Hands that Heal\\" as always Echo's books are great.

It's as if the author forgot an ingredient in the recipe and decided to add it in during the soap making instructions. After encountering this problem twice I decided to quit reading.I have decided to return my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Rubbish!!","review":"I have been buying the Penguin Atlas books for almost two decades and I love them. This is an astounding dissapointment. It has the same colorful and pleasing format as the others. However, the statistics in this atlas are terrible. If you read the small print you find out that many of the maps are based on \\"internet surveys\\". For statistical purposes this is one step above pure fabrication. Furthermore, the bias in this book is so thick that I would call it propaganda. The slant in favor of homosexuality and against assigned gener roles in traditional societies is overwhelming. It so happens that I am on the same side, but in a statistical atlas I would prefer, at least, the pretense of impartiality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a hoax","review":"Should be no star.

Not being purist in that regard, even were I to have found the director straying from the original, it would not bother me so long as the result is entertaining. This was quite entertaining with the humor delivered without blatant clowning and the arias sung engagingly and to good effect. Certainly one is able to grasp each of the central characters and take pleasure in their devious maneuvering to obtain their objectives. If you are the average viewer, I am confident that you will be gratified by this offering.And, oh that Handel music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Noel Rosa than you ever imagined","review":"If you really, really, really love Noel Rosa - and you should, because he's Noel Coward, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, and a few others all wrapped up in one small tubercular 28 year old guy who lived briefly and brilliantly in Rio caf�� and samba society in the 30s - then you need this collection. All of his songs are here, and many of them are worth hearing in the original recordings. But - and here's the problem - it's a lot of money for some recordings from the 30s. If you're just coming to Noel Rosa, try the Lumiere songbook which gives a great intro to his work.However, if you really, really love Noel Rosa, then you gotta own this one. All kinds of music you never heard before - and the lyrics are consistently funny, sad, romantic, witty; the music is consistently fine. Sometime, someone outside Brasil will find out about Noel Rosa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a single fact","review":"the terrorist organization of MKO pays people to write false stories about them.... this book is one of them.

Unfortunately, this is greatly exagerated. The unit is incapable of finding joists (I have tried it in 5 different houses) and it's powerline detection has an accuracy of give and take 5 inches (with currently available technology this is a joke).

When you place it against the wall, if it is placed wrong, that is if you are already on top of the Stud, all the LEDs begin to flash-Like and idiot indicator. This tells you to try anotother place on the wall where there is no stud. When you find that place you know it, because the unit calabrates itself by lighting up the green LED. From that point you can begin scannning. It will find the beginning edge and the ending edge. Soooo Easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older Home?

I think the manufacturer should have been a lot more up front with this information. To find out this important limitation you have to buy it and then read the small print at the end of the instructions.You'd think something that could scan through concrete could handle lath and plaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs glasses","review":"It works! The only problem is that it needs glasses because in an open wall test we found that it found the stud sometimes one inch before it started and stopped seeing it one inch after it stopped.

My old Zircon was more precise and so was the newer Pro SL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tends to be inaccurate...","review":"I have tried using this unit for almost a yearbut I have finally given-up.

Yes, it has a concealed carry pocket, but who needs it? You can take the vest off and beat your assailant with it like a flail.I will say it is well made, but I sold mine and might consider getting the 5.11 taclite version of this vest made of lighter weight ripstop nylon. Or maybe a fishing vest instead, as I never used the concealed carry pockets anyways (4 o'clock IWB is more convenient and accessible everywhere but in the car)."},{"rating":"2","title":"5.11 Tactical Vest - A real winner","review":"I was looking for something in a vest that would be durable and could withstand years of heavy wear and tear.

It's super sturdy and is of great quality. The rocking legs feature is a must for a fussy baby. Or you can pop out the wheels and it will remain stationary. The storage basket is large and is a great place to store your diapers and wipes. There is even enough room to store a few blankets and other essentials. The fabric is wonderful and the inner bassinet liner is so soft and thick, not thin and cheap like some other bassinet models I looked at. The only draw back is the mattress. It's not very thick, only 1 inch, I believe, so I bought a thicker bassinet mattress and it fit wonderfully in this. I bought a 2 inch thick, 15 inch by 33 inch mattress from Babies R Us, for anyone who would like to replace the mattress. The mattress sheet that comes with this bassinet will not fit a new mattress.

It's also fairly terse, the bulk of it being made up of photographs.For someone like me who is more interested in flat water, slow rivers, protected marine waterways, and coastal swamps this book is nearly useless.
