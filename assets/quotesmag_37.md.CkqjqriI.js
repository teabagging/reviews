And then on top of it, all of the lucy episodes are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be In Compact Box Set Like Star Trek Next Gen.","review":"It's totally unreasonable that the studio is only putting 4 episodes per DVD. One of the things great about DVD is that it took less shelf space than bulky VHS tapes. I bought the box set of the first season of Star Trek The Next Generation. It contains 7 DVD's and takes up LESS than 2 inches wide of shelf space, plus it's nice and organized. All the Lucy fans I know would have paid a premium price for it released in the same format as I just described. Now most of them will be thinking why bother to replace my Columbia House VHS collection when this is going to take up almost as much room. Like an earlier reviewer wrote, if they could do it with The Simpsons First Season, why couldn't they do it with I Love Lucy first season!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take that Minnie Ha-ha!","review":"All I have to say is IT's ABOUT TIME, Lucy episodes have come on DVD. I really do love all the episodes, BUT I was disappointed that they put only 4 episodes on the DVD and the Volume one and two they jack you because they use the Pilot and episode 6 as two different episodes,(they one in the same). They could of been more generous on giving you more episodes per volume. All and All I hope they put more on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love lucy Season one vol 1 dvd","review":"If you love lucy now you will like her more on dvd.the lost pilot picture was not the greatest lucy and rikki were at there best . girls what to go to a nightclub look really clear like you were right there with lucy on the set the rest of the disc is about the same picture wise i loved every minute of this disc it worth every penny to get . it has my five stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much going on","review":"I have had to use this text for my politics of russia course and this is one of the most worst written text I have ever read in my politcal science career. The author continously flip flops between time. He starts in the 80s, goes into now and then flop back to 80s without note. this text is poorly written for those who have no general of idea of Russia. I could hardly read two pages without getting annoyed and bored with the text. The chapters are so jammed packed with information that seems to have such poor organization. Now I see why not too many people have choosen this course, mostly because this text was assigned to it. I have had to read, then reread each chapter just to get a touch of what Remington talked about but to no avail, I was completly bored with the book. After the first 5 pages of each chapter, the pages just seemed to run together. (This is my opinion, no one else to which we are all entitled to our own.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool with Bad Manuals","review":"First of all this as an exceptional tool. I am a joinery novice but am now creating professional dovetail joints without problems. I have two comments that I think would be important to new users.1. The setup directions are very confusing. Incra includes directions for every jig variation and accessory variation all within the product manual. I actually had 4 (yes four!) different documents that I was being refered between and still couldn't find the exact document for my fence - until a change page fell out of one of the docs. I think that officially makes 5 separate docs. I guess Incra changes their products often and doesn't recreate assembly manuals.2. Setup is everything. If you get the router bit depth and find the board center accurately, you're home free. I've started using a dial indicator and caliper. It may seem like an overkill but the extra time upfront allows me to create near perfect joints all day long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a great device. It protects my bumper, the wall in front of the car and an occasional argument with my wife about our parking skills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy a few feet of string and a ping pong ball","review":"I bought this because I thought it was a clever idea, inexpensive and was easily movable for different vehicles. Like so much junk made in China these days, it's a good idea ruined by poor quality. My problem was that the lights refused to come on unless the pole was bent nearly horizontal. Pointless, since I would have to be drunk to drive that far over it, and I couldn't see the lights anyway because they'd be blocked by the hood. As the other reviewer said, you don't really need the lights because it jiggles when you bump it, but I can achieve that with a length of string and a ping pong ball hanging from the ceiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Useful I bought 3","review":"Originally I thought this as a gift and thought it looked cheap and wouldn't be seen over the hood of an SUV. I was pleasantly surprised, and have since bought 2 more. The cross stand keeps the stop sign stationary, as long as you roll into it slowly. I can clearly see the flashing stop sign over the hood of my Expedition. It serves it's purpose and is a really good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected","review":"I wasnt expecting much for the low price and that is exactly what I received. The sign works as advertised, it blinks for about 30 seconds when it is moved. You may want to put some adhesive under it because it moves very easily when parking. Overall worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to know where you're parking","review":"Bought two of these...one for each car in our garage and they work great. Would be nice if there were rubber feet or something to keep them from moving around on the floor. But as long as you approach it slowly, it works great to help you park in just the right spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and works great","review":"My SUV is only two feet shorter than our garage, which means that I have to pull as far forward as possible. This device works great and makes it easy to pull in to within a foot of the garage wall. Without the stop sign, I didn't always pull in far enough and had to restart the car to move forward an inch. Definitely recommend for anyone who has a tight fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Experience","review":"Product took three weeks for delivery. When it arrived the package appeared to be damaged and two parts were missing. The vendor could not replacement the parts nor the product in its entirety. The vendor referred me to the manufacturer for the parts. I have tried for over a month to obtain the missing parts with no luck. The only good aspcet of the whole unfornuate venture was that the vendor did credit my account for the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great attention Getter!!","review":"Love the garage park assistance. My husband parks where I want him to now. Very cute item in the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.","review":"Works well - I have a small 1 car garage and a long car, so it helps me park the car in the right spot. It's inexpensive. The base is quite light, but I haven't had a problem with it moving backward when I park - but then I stop when I barely it it. So, take that into account. It is MUCH better than a model by Emerson which is less expensive - that model falls over with the slightest touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I bought this for my grandmother so she would know when to stop when parking her car in the garage. The stop sign is a bit little for her to see and the bumper has to really rock that pole in order for the lights to flash on it. I noticed that it doesn't flash all the time, however she knows when to stop when it moves so it is working for her so I gave it 4 stars. I swear this came over night I could not beleive how fast the shipping was. All in all I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Exactly what I needed to make sure the car is pulled up as far as possible in the garage so we can still get around with the door closed. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper Better Product Available","review":"This product works OK but [...] sells one that is $[...] cheaper and better built. Also the base of this product is too light, necessitating taping it to the garage floor so that it doesn't move when the car touches it. The Emerson product sold by Solutions works the same way but is much better built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This thing is really a piece of junk. First of all I bought two, and everything I am about to say applied to both of them.1. The light does not flash when I hit it with my car (maybe 5% of the time).2. It is extremely cheap and can break so easily.3. The stand consists of two pieces that do not properly lock into each other, so when you are moving it, it pretty much falls apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!!!","review":"Do not hesitate to purchase if you have issues parking your vehicle in your garage.The only negative is that the base is not weighted down but easily remedied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I wanted","review":"Bought this for my mother and it works perfectly, though she moved it away and doesn't use it. I think it got in the way of her walking in front of the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"I've had this for a few months and it's incredibly functional. A simple concept that does exactly what it was meant to do. There are no quirks nor is there anything that I would change about it to make it better. I bought 2 and it made my life easier. No more getting out of my car to see if I clears the garage door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We have a tiny garage that is not very deep. We have to pull in far enough for the garage door to close, but not so far that we bump the raised curb in front. This product works exactly as advertised, and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop signs","review":"these little signs are a life saver and a marriage saver. My sister bought them this summer. I saw them and had to have them. My husband and I have lived in our house for 14 years and it has been an on going complaint with him of me parking to close to a storage cabinet, and the side door. these signs are the perfect marriage saver. I was either going to killed him or divorce him. but now there is love again for another 32 years. also another sister saw them and bought a pair also. the greatest thing since slice bread. but that is just for is week until I find somethink new on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Park & Place","review":"After a couple of weeks of usage, I have found this product to be fairly reliable. The light signal behind the stop sign senses changes in acceleration and not contact, so it will not go off when it is tipped gradually. Regardless of whether or not the light goes off, the bending of the pole provides an obvious visual marker of when to stop. In terms of construction, there are some imperfections in the molding but the components are sturdy and the base is heavy enough to prevent slipping on a smooth surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality","review":"The base is too lightweight; the wind has knocked this over when garage is opened on windy days, and it falls over every time it's lightly bumped by a vehicle. This is too short to use with a pickup or SUV, even with it sitting on a raised step. This might work with a small car in an area with no wind, but don't bump it."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"you get what ya pay for, this is a cheap piece of junk,light worked two times,even with several battery changes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Finally something that works. Tennis balls, tire stops and laser beams all require some sort of adjustment or mounting and they always seem to get in the way when not in use. This thing you just plant it in front of the object you wish not to run into and that's that. No fuss and you can always move it out of the way when working on your car then place it back when done. Even if the battery dies you just watch for any movement of the stop sign then stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap; Electronics Don't Work as Advertised","review":"I removed the plastic tab to test the stop sign, but it failed to light up. I started to unscrew the battery compartment and it suddenly worked, but would not stop working. Again, playing with the screws on the battery compartment, it turned off. Bumping into the sign with my car a few times yielding \\"hit and miss\\" results (yes...pun intended). The couple of times the sign did light up, it tended to flash endlessly. As others have mentioned, you don't really need the flashing sign to let you know you hit the post. In hindsight, I should have just done the old \\"tennis ball on a rope\\" trick. I hope this product was NOT made in the U.S., as it would be too depressing to think we lack the brain power to design and manufacture such a basic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes a big bump to light up","review":"There are several things I don't like: you must forcibly bump it to get the light to flash; secondly, it uses hearing aid batteries, instead of using greater capacity batteries. If you need to park your car as close as possible to the wall leaving the minimum of walking space in front of the parked car, you're screwed because the device will be in the way of walking in front of the vehicle, not to mention having to strongly hit the thing to get it to blink. So I'm trashing the product; instead I'll use a ceiling mounted device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and works as advertised....","review":"Like my review title says, what more can you ask for? Cheap item that works exactly as advertised? Well...just buy it if you need it.No need to hang those tennis balls from the roof.Pros:1) Reliable2) Durable3) It just plain works.Cons:1) The base connects with two poles with the alert plate/brains on the top pole. The connector for the two poles are not as tight/sturdy as I would like it to be designed.2) I wish the lights blink a little slower when hit and also they put in a few more LED lights to make it more visible in strong light. Blinking and lights up at a slower/longer user controllable interval should help legibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"The Park N Place is an inexpensive, convenient way to mark the spot to stop a car in a garage. It couldn't be easier to move around to accomodate different vehicle makes/models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great parking aid","review":"Never worry again about driving into the garage wall, water heater, air conditioner, or whatever else your thoughtful builder may have placed in your garage. Just take it out of the box, snap it together, and place it wherever you want to stop the car. It blinks to let you know when you are perfectly parked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"A few pieces of lightweight plastic pushedtogether.

I wonder why it took so many years for me to find this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"The item will light up when it is moved a certain amount. However, in tight spaces where it is critical that it alerts you as soon as your bumper touches it, it does not perform as advertised. It will generally alert you when it is moved abruptly or at least 4-5 inches. The old \\"ball and string\\" is more precise than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and customer service","review":"I ordered two Park N Place. After assembly, one of them worked with a blinking light when bumped as advertised and one didn't. I e-mailed Park N Place customer service and informed them that one did not work. They e-mailed me back the same day and said they would send me a replacement. I have never received the replacement nor heard from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the Job","review":"Bought two of these for our cars and they work great. The only thing that would make them better is make the base heavier. When the cars touched them they moved. We solved this by putting weights on the bottom and pipe foam on the rod to protect the car. They both work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinking Stop Light Would not Turn Off","review":"I was very disapointed with this. I put it together and pulled the tab to conect thebattery and the stop light would not stop blinking. With the stop light continuallyblinking it defeats the purpose. I returned it. I assume it was defective. I read the reviews on it before I bought it and it sounded like it was a great product. What I don't understand is that once the batteries are put in, the lights start blinking. How can they not blink with the batteries in. It is impossible for them to go off and then go on when the pedestal is tapped with the front of your vehicle. I am preplexed as to how this product can possibly do what it says."},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly disappointing","review":"The product arrived quickly and was easily put together. The light that was supposed to light up when touched did not work. I filed a complaint and it was answered very quickly. A replacement was shipped which works for the time being. For the cost i guess this is what you get. It now is serving the purpose but I am concerned it will not hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made product","review":"The rod base is nade of cheap plastic and your car bumper touchs it the base will move or fall. in conclusion, this product is unreliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps guide the car inside the garage","review":"Assembly and installation is very easy, just put the unit down where you want to stop the car.

I would suggest that anyone wanting to understand the issues of the day provide themselves with this background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively, Frank and Entertaining","review":"Maurizio Viroli is a professor of politics at Princeton and i had the chance to take a class with him last year in which we read Machiavelli's 'The Prince' and his 'Discourses.'Viroli brings the same charm, wit, and enthusiasm to this book as he did to that class. The words and the language Viroli has mastered are clearly those of an Italian--and in fact, this trivial insight provides much of the liveliness of the book.Viroli traces the life of 'Il Machia' from his boyhood to his death at an old age. Through this political life, we see the rise and fall of the republic of Florence that Machiavelli was so keen on preserving, and some of the fascinating characters in Florentine history like Duke Valentino.We also get an original glimpse into Machiavelli's love life (Viroli thankfully refuses to censor the more carnal but revealing phrases in Machiavelli's correspondence), and philosophy of life itself.Overall, a fast-paced, generally pleasing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read and Excellent Intro to \\"Machia's\\" Life","review":"Every now and then you read a book that brings its subject to life. Having studied Machiavelli from his writings, it helps to now know of his charms. This book contributed to my understanding of his works but more importantly to the background and history of his conversations. A good, quick read... Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing revisionism","review":"This biography presents the full Machiavelli, not just the cynical philosopher of politics. The reader discovers many other facets of his sometimes lusty, sometimes ironic, sometimes mischevious personality. The book places Machiavelli in the context of local events current to his time. We can see how he was influenced by, and tried to influence, the politics of his day. Above all, this book conveys Machiavelli as a writer, more effective in offering advice than he was at managing events. Viroli's brief essays at the beginnings of some of his chapters are elegant works in themselves. A plan of Renaissance Florence would have been a useful addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting perspective","review":"I love K&N filters and have trusted many expensive and some highly modified cars to them. These work great on my slightly modified 02 Camaro. Many see Machiavelli as a cold hearted bastard that taught people to be liars and dictators. This puts his life and works in a new perspective. Who would have known that Machiavelli was the life of the party at one point? If you want to get to know one of the greatest minds this world has ever seen a little better you need to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unknown Hero","review":"I have been very lucky now to purchase this album from amazon.com and now own 2 of Jimmy's cds. This guy has such talent and is very special indeed, the reason being Jimmy has undergo so many operations, than some of you have had dinners, and the courage and musical ability shines through in his music. This album is his 3rd and he specializes in Warm pop rock music, in the line of Bryan Adams. The songs are very thoughtfully written lyrically, and the sound quality and all instruments played brilliant throughtout. I love songs like Fresh and Blood and Same Old Look.

It did cool the room but after 2 hours of unbelievable noise (was installed properly), I left the room to sweat elsewhere.

Secondly, you have to be a little creative on you hang this on the windows, because the pictures are often unclear as which direction a hasp or other part should be facing. Thirdly, after finally installing this on my window, I plug it in and turned the knob to \\"On.\\" Guess what? The knob broke! This could be part of a bad batch and maybe the rest of them don't have defective knobs, but the poorly written instructions offer no excuse.

Not a bad choice,really. In my opinion, it's going to take Publishing Muscleto turn this into a successful series. None of the charactersare fully developed and the story suffers for it. It couldhave been a 4 star novel but the author probably feels that'crime fiction' is beneath him. Well, if the author is whothat Baltimore web site said he is--then crime fiction isactually a step up, IMO. Just google Michael Crow+pseudonymand click on the Baltimore 'city paper' and see who this authormay be.

Think of Slayers as something along the lines of the Three Stooges meet Lord of the Rings.However, CPM messed up massively on the Japanese audio. One track is phase-inverted. On a mono setup, you get basically no audio. Stereo systems sound \\"funny,\\" lacking highs and lows and pretty much any sense of direction (in addition to being very quiet). ProLogic receivers will throw everything to the back speakers. This is the same set of problems that showed up with Rurouni Kenshin disc 1, except that, unlike Media Blasters, CPM is calling this a \\"non-issue\\" and not offering any fixes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SERIOUS defect in these discs!","review":"A defect in the Japanese language track has resulted in phase-inverted audio.

Tenchi I've watched a dozen times, Cowboy Bebop a good 20 times and the rest of my anime are always in my DVD player. This one? Not so much.

That's all I have to say about it. The series TRIES to be funny and fails miserably. It's japanese cartoon slapstick at it's worst, the whole things' humor revolves around facial distortion and being loud and rude.

Not only that, but they continue to sell them as if nothing is wrong. There is also about a minute of footage that was inadvertently cut from the end of the last episode. Please avoid this set for now until a fixed version is made. For those looking to get their Slayers fix, check out the \\"Book of Spells\\" and \\"The Motion Picture\\" DVDs.

A little bit Erma Brombeck and a little bit Robert Benchley, Dr. Alice writes short pithy essays on the extraordinarily funny absurdity of very ordinary life. Fantasy and reality intertwine seamlessly (that's the Benchley touch). For instance, the near-calamatous peeing incident with her toddler on the way to Hawaii probably did happen; the inflatable Titanic II marital aid in Dr. Alice's bedroom probably didn't. That doesn't matter.

Consumes a lot of pages and gets unwieldy at times. But it captures truth. Truth about being an immigrant and about being an immigrant's son.

It seems when you want to open a legal document which you have spent hours creating, you can't open without first changing the printer settings. If you do, it defaults to letter size and changes all of your fonts to smaller sizes. When you have worked for hours on a design, you don't want to have to go back in to correct all of these changes. I have written several times to the company and gotten no response, so evidentally their customer service is as useless as their product.

However, this is no good if you can't access it (see first sentence above). I think I found a fix on their website, but, holy cow, there's like 200 steps to it.

Some of the familiar western cliches are at work here, such as greedy white men trading whiskey to the Indians for gold, which predictably leads to hostilities. A broken peace treaty, the murder of Indians and treachery and mistrust on both sides results in a full scale Indian attack on the fort at the finale. Douglas romances pretty Sioux maiden Elsa Martinelli during the train's westward trek which gets him into a heap of trouble. Walter Matthau and Lon Chaney Jr. are the heavies whose lust for gold puts the settlers and the soldiers at the fort in harm's way. Franz Waxman's wistful score is a fine accompaniment to a very good western story."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Either the original or transfer was terribly faulty but picture was poor.

This album is culled from their 2 Epic releases, and a nice cross-section of songs it is. Some highlights are: Jenny-Lynne; Golden Rainbow; Dealin' with the Devil; as well as their 2 big hits.The liner notes mention that when they toured, that alot of concert goers were dissappointed that they didn't sound like their record. (No horns or string section when they were live, I guess.) And while I've gotta admit that they do sound fuller on the songs with these additions, this is still a good overall collection of what pop music sounded like in a time where it mattered more on WHAT you sounded like, as opposed to WHAT you looked like, or how well you could dance in your video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an upbeat book regarding MS!","review":"A gutsy, funny, sensitive young woman takes readers to Alaska where we learn to love the great state and Janet.

Even though its just an EP I liked it a little bit more than \\"A litte bit of somethin.\\" This one's a little bit more upbeat and funky. Its good music to write to, or listen to on the train/bus, or jog/skate to, or wash the dishes, or sew or whatever. It has a good moving quality too it. Its motivating but not imposing.My favorite track is \\"organism\\". I use to listen to that one over and over. It has a really good mid tempo heavy beat and this indecipherable but soulful male vocal and a good bass line. It bumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"A wonderful collection from one of the '70s most gifted songwriters...I would've given this cd 5 stars, but for Heaven's sake, where is \\"99 miles from L.A.\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Listen to album","review":"Albert Hammond is virtually unknown, but many of his songs are known well. This album contains over 20 of his best, including the entire contents of his first two albums, and a few from his third. Pop fans will love every minute like I did. This album is pure melody, and contains songs that can relax as well as make you think. As someone who mostly listens to top 100 alternative these days, I can say that I like a variety of music, and that includes Albert Hammond. I only wish some of his later classics were included on this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"make that nail gun smoking hot.","review":"This is great, holds enought nails to make my belt heavy.There are more nails right there when you need em so you can stay up that ladder and keep that gun working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for under 15$","review":"This pouch fits on your tool belt and surprisingly, is comfortable.Holds about ten clips of 3 1'4\\" framing nails.

It is a collection of most of his hits, probably at the height of his career. Both the sound and video is high quality and his voice is wonderfully clear. Denver doesn't interact too much with the audience, mainly because of the language difference where the concert was held I assume, so it is mainly him and his band moving on with one song after another. But that doesn't detract from hearing Denver's wonderful voice and he is well-supported by his band and back-up singers.If you like John Denver, this DVD is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Denver Rocky Mountain High Live in Japan","review":"I just loved this DVD.

Her songs lack the more pop-like sounds from Britney Spears, but never mind comparisons. The songs on the album are quite good. While the ballads are somewhat cheesy, Simpson gives her all, and the songs turn out beautiful. \\"Irresistible\\" is pure ear candy, and it is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Much Better","review":"I bought this CD with the anticipation that Jessica was finally going to come out of Mariah's shadow and give us some better lyrics and stronger singing. However, \\"Iresistible\\" does not come close. I listened to the album from beginning to end, but I found the material very weak, especially the uptempo songs. She's very adept, I must say, at the ballads; I really like \\"There You Were\\" and \\"His Eye is On the Sparrow.\\" And overall, the album just didn't give Jessica her own sound. The lyrics and music wasn't her style. I think it was a good effort, so I gave her two stars. But I really think she needs to think hard for her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"another winner from jess","review":"jessica simpson makes a tryumphant return with her sophmore album \\"irresistible\\". the single (by the same name) is also buring up the charts. unlike her 1999 debut \\"sweet kisses\\" which was loaded with ballads, \\"irresistible\\" moves a bit into new territory with a more r&b, upbeat pop sound. jessica still serves up some sweet ballads though.. such as the awesome duet \\"there you were\\" featuring marc anthony and \\"for your love\\" which echos the same drama of \\"i wanna love you forever\\". the album is straight forward pop/r&b but jessica's passionate voice intesensifies each track to it's full potential. this is one of the best pop cd's to come out in a long time. perfect for summer! faves are: \\"irresistible\\", \\"a little bit\\", \\"forever in your eyes\\", \\"there you were\\", \\"what's it gonna be\\", \\"hot like fire\\", \\"for your love\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRRESISTIBLE TO THROW IT DOWN THW GARBAGE!","review":"What A bad album!, BUY MANDY MOORE'S self titled one, its' way superior, this album only included the well produced \\"Irresistible\\", wich is great and close to classic, but the other tracks are pure fillers!. If there's only another worth saving track is \\"Forever In Your Eyes\\" that should have come the second single, not the dicusting \\"A Little Bit\\", \\"Where Your Are\\" duet with Marc Anthony is worth listen to it too, the other tracks sound like drop outs of \\"Samantha Mumba\\" or \\"Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls\\" so wrong so bad, but after all I think the cover photo is ok!, like a \\"Maxim or Cosmopolitan cover\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica Simpson There's Something Missing...","review":"After watching Jessica Simpson on MTV I realized that she's as fragile as delicate china. She couldn't even mop her floor if it wasn't for her nanny. After listening to her album I realize that she couldn't write a hit song if it wasn't for a skilled producer and enhancements from today's latest studio trickery. On MTV she's kind of replaced the Osbournes as Americas favorite celebrity to laugh at. At least the Osbournes started out genuine and then became a parody of them selves. ON top of that we all know Ozzy has taken way too many drugs so he may not know any better. For Jessica she was pretty much hatched of the big time star making machine as a parody of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it less, I would","review":"C'mon folks, you know better than to waste your hard earned money on tripe like this.

I bet you haven't listened to your old Debbie Gibson cds for years. Am I right? Of course I am.Go get the new U2, or R.E.M., or Radiohead, or Paul Simon, or Aimee Mann or something. That stuff lasts.

The first single irresistable is simply awful and that new image of hers please how much peroxide went into her hair and who told the girl to start dancing? She does have the pipes like Christinia and Carey but they all have one thing in common not a drop of soul to thir voices it's said if one of these girls ever covered \\"Natural Woman' they wouldn't understand the angst to pull it off and that's why songs such as \\"For your love\\" and \\"To fall in love again\\" lack spirit please this cookie sutter sound is trite and patheitic if Jessica just went and found new produces who can work around her limitaions she could turn out a solid material but for now this cd is a coaster for drinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch as I resist it","review":"Female artists used to make GOOD music, for proof get some Joni Mitchell, Pretenders (lead singer Chrissie Hynde is a woman), Aretha Franklin or Supremes. But these days, it's a joke, just an excuse for the woman in question to make her music \\"sexy\\". However, these pop stars fail miserably, because they exaggerate it so badly. Compare it to Chrissie Hynde. She was tough, independant, and respectable. Sex worked into her lyrics, sure, but it wasn't her entire persona, she didn't devote her music to selling her sexuality. Jessica Simpson, and most other female artists today, do. More proof that music has been dead since Kurt Cobain killed himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica Simpson Is Not Irresistable","review":"Okay, does the world really need any more blonde chicks trying to prove they can sing?

Jessica may have a nice voice, but none of her songs are worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"No matter what you do, DO NOT buy this item. I criticize it for being boring, unworthy of your money or time, and I highly demand to know why Jessica Simpson is making music. I bought this cd for Irresistable and found out that it was a waste. Think about it, you can't understand what she's saying, and further more who would want to? If you like good music, I reccomend N'sync and Britney Spears. just don't be fooled by Irresistable."},{"rating":"2","title":"In One Word - Irresistible","review":"This is something else.

Although I just love all of the songs and i can't say enough about how much i LOVE it. I would recommend this to anyone who loved the first C.D. and likes singers who can actually sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad..","review":"Although I'm a fan of Jessica's, this album was a complete disappointment. I was hoping that her sophomore release would be a bit more.. how should I put this?- ground-breaking. Honestly, Jessica CAN sing. The problem isn't her voice, though- it's the material she's being given/choosing to perform. Truthfully, the only reason why my copy of 'Irresistible' is still in one piece is because of the duet with Marc Anthony. Aside from that, and perhaps \\"When You Told Me You Loved Me\\"- which actually IS a beautiful song- I have no reason to listen to this CD. The music itself makes it sound like Jessica- or her producers- are trying too hard. She's got potential, and certainly everyone was hoping for good things from this album, but it'll take a lot to redeem her career and reputation from this major let-down in sales, chart status, and promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pressure Took Its Toll","review":"This album is absolutely generic sounding with no personality and spark whatsoever. I don't believe that she is happy with the image that her record company is forcing her to potray, and deep inside, I bet she's not too happy with this album, either. She has talent but she needs to stand up for herself and not allow herself to be bullied by record company execs into being something that she is not. I wish her well and hope that she is able to hold onto who she really is. I gave the album two stars because Jessica's voice is good. Its too bad that she wastes it on flaky songs with absolutely no substance forced upon her by dirty old men w/ nothing but money on their minds. If you want some good R&B tinged pop, try some Destiny's Child or better yet, Deborah Gibson's M.Y.O.B. (Deborah is a new opening act for Nsync and her album is the best pop album I have heard in years...check it out!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"JESSICA SIMPSON THE NEW BRITNEY SPEARS?????????","review":"Ok, maybe it's just me or I haven't read other people's reviews but 'A Little Bit' sounds identical to Britney Spears! I mean if they were to both sing this song I wouldn't be able to tell which one was singing! I think that this is an improvment, because before she sang songs high and breathy, her voice wasen't strong enough to do that. But it's strong enough for this! I think she needs to fine her own voice, first she imitates Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera very badly, then it's Britney Spears!

This girl is not superficial!","review":"A couple days ago I picked up Jessica Simpson's sophomore effort & was extremely pleased. This girl can actually sing compared to the other pop princesses. Although it is pop, it is a great change from Simpson's debut album, Sweet Kisses. Some of my favorite tracks are the title \\"Irresistible\\", \\"Hot Like Fire\\", \\"Imagination\\", \\"A Little Bit\\" & \\"What's It Gonna Be\\". If you are looking for pure ballads, you can still purchase this CD. There are about 5 of Jessica's signature songs & they please the ears with great delight. I recommend this CD to any pop fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica is 'irresistible' to me!","review":"I think this album definately matches up to 'Sweet Kisses' and it might even be better than that.When I first heard 'Irresistible', I thought I would check out the album because that song is awesome, so I did and I was very satisfied. Jessica is indeed talented and this album shows that. She has a great voice. This album should be praised, not criticized. Go Jessica!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD!","review":"Jessica's best album yet! I enjoyed every one of the songs on this album. The \\"bad ones\\" even grew on me and end up enjoying them. My favorite is \\"Forever in your eyes\\" and \\"To fall in love again.\\" On an interview, Jessica said that Nick wrote those two songs.\\"There You Were\\" is such a powerful/emotional song and I hope they come out with a music video for that one.I'm 23 and I love musicals and pretty voices. Jessica Simpson is definitely one of them. Britney & Christina has their own unique style/voice, so that works for them (please don't compare them w/ Jessica.) Jessica is like a vocalist. She's awesome. She does best with ballads though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first!!","review":"Jessica Simpson's Irresistable cd, released in June of 2001, is a great cd. On this cd, there is more of a pop/R&B sound that sounds alot better than the purely bubblegom pop of her first cd. However, the ballads on her first cd, Sweet Kisses, were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love this cd! It's an improvement from her last one. Jessica's wonderful voice is so strong and powerful. I like every track on here, but my favorites are: 'Irresistibe, Just A Little Bit, What's It Gonna Be, I Never, and Imagination'(which is a cute song with a good beat.) 'There You Were' is a beautiful ballad and Jessica sings it so well with Marc Anthony. 'For Your Love' is beautiful, and Jessica sings it with such grace and emotion(she's good on the high notes!) This is a great cd(one that I'd recommend.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Resistible","review":"Jessica Simpson has proven with her follow up CD to \\"Sweet Kisses\\" that she's determined to fit the mold fellow pop queens Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera created before her.One look at the cover, and most people ask themselves, \\"is that Britney Spears?\\" Simpson has managed to take every cliched sound in pop music along with recycled lyrics to create \\"Irrisitible\\". It's a disappointment becuase it not only masks her vocal abilities but it clearly shows she is a victim of the mass media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistible","review":"This follow-up album to \\"Sweet Kisses\\" tries hard to follow the steps of the said first album but falls a little bit short. Still, there are some songs that are really good. The title track \\"Irresistible\\" is really good, as well as \\"There You Were\\", a duet with Marc Anthony. Other really good songs are \\"Forever in Your Eyes\\", \\"When You Told Me You Loved Me\\", \\"To Fall In Love Again\\", and \\"His Eye is On the Sparrow\\".

In my opinion, she improved on this album. Maybe she did shed the clothes & increase the sexual content to sell out, but her new beats and frisky lyrics are alot better than her cheese puff first singles. \\"Irresistible\\" is really catchy & I love \\"A Little Bit\\", \\"Forever In Your Eyes\\", \\"What's It Gonna Be\\", and \\"Hot Like Fire\\".

Oh, no, this is Jessica's 'evolution' of sorts, into the land of ... pop. Yes, folks, this little virgin, or shall I say the record executives, decided to come out with a more sex pot image. Did this help her sales? Thankfully, no.I admit, the woman has a good voice, but she's incapable of releasing music that's worth listening to. I can't begin to describe how mundane this album is...it's truly a waste of time and finances.Did she blatantly copy Britney's already ridiculously unoriginal style? Yes.Did she trade in her morals for record sales? Yes, fortunately, this album was less successful than her debut.Is she ahead of the teeny bopper pact (including Britney, Nsync, Mandy Moore, etc.)? No. She's incapable of releasing anything that will capture the attention of anyone who does not suffer from major hearing loss..."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's irrestible","review":"This is an awesome CD!!

Gone are the effortlessly powerhouse notes, and in their place is a collection of pop drivel that sounds like material gathered up from Britney's reject pile. When I reviewed \\"Sweet Kisses,\\" I went on and on about how different Simpson was and what an extraordinary talent she has. It's not evident on this album, which is watered-down, boring, unimaginative, and like everything else released by a pop act that's under 20. Here, Simpson sound like a slightly more talented Spears, and the tracks are all bland and unoriginal. I truly am disillusioned. I don't know whether \\"Irresistable\\" is a case of the sophomore jinx, or if Simpson has sold out her talent in favor of a more sexed-up image and larger sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-have for all Jess' fans","review":"This is a great album. Although Jessica has changed her image from an innocent Christian girl to a sexier singer (in Irresistible), I still love her. This album shows a more mature side of Ms Simpson with a lot of mid and up-tempo songs that you can dance along. Unfortunately for her, it was release during the \\"black period\\" Sept. the 11th so the sales were poor. Anyway, if you are a Jess' fan, buy this one immediately ! It's worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to sing along to!","review":"I thought this CD was better than her new \\"In This Skin\\" CD. The songs were very catchy, upbeat, and fun on \\"Irresistable\\" whereas in her new CD they sounded more soft and laid back. Her voice was strong and clear and showcased her range much better than her breathy sound on In This Skin. I listen to this CD whenever I want to get pumped up as it lifts my spirits and puts me in a good mood. It's very fun to sing along to, especially tracks 1, 2, 5 and 7. I definitely recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica is soo IRESISTIBLE!","review":"Jessica has changed her music alot since her debut ablum \\"Sweet Kisses.\\" \\"Irresistible\\" has more pop dance music.

Trust me this CD is DA BOMB!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"After having this cd for a while (I was given as present with sweet kisses, after giving the impression that i liked her music *sarcasm*). I can't understand why anyone would buy this out of their own choice. The problem is generally everything. This Jessica CAN NOT sing. It is like having to listen to my dog howling at opera music. But I would rather listen to my dog. The songs are beyond bland. Your basic pop music where everything sounds the same and bland. Sweet kisses was the first - Both are truly awful and not worth giving more than a star, however this one is slightly better song-wise. But still not recommended unless you are a teen pop fan. Which I am certainly not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and Diverse","review":"Everyone else is comparing this to her first album and should not. She has taken her talent to other levels and shows how diverse her voice truely is. The title track is awsome as well as just about every other song. Each is different and shows off her gift. One of the main reasons I bought the CD is because she closes it out with one of my favorite songs, \\"His eye is on the Sparrow.\\" All I can say is this song alone is worth the purchase of this CD. God truely gave her a gift, she's just giving him thanks! Buy it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica's Best Yet","review":"This is definetly Jessica at her best! Irresistable is a great mix of power-house ballads, beat infused R&B sounds, and the presence of pop! Jessica is more then just a mear Christina nock-off she is the next chart-topping DIVA. This is a CD any R&B and Pop/Rock music lover needs to have. \\"When You Told Me You Loved Me\\" I believe is Jessica's best track and shows her true potential and soul. The rest of the album is great and the Duet with Mark Anthony is a definite hit waiting to happen. Buy this album today! Jessica Truly Shines!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT...","review":"I have nothing against Jessica Simpson...all in all I think she's one talented singer but this album is a total crap! she could have put her talent to more better use..I'm sure she could do better than this.

Its obvious failure was to give Jessica a sexier look to compete with Britney and Christina. Didn't work. The songs lack the excitement of the debut or her latest \\"In This Skin.\\" The title song and her duet with Mark Anthony were both good. But Jessica takes it to church with her soulful \\"His Eye Is On The Sparrow!\\" Very uplifting and spirtually moving! But those three strong ones are better than the other songs. Jessica just didn't find the right material to match with her voice 3 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistable To Me","review":"It took me a while to get around to getting this cd but now I have it and I think it's great she has definantly moved up the tempo compared to her last cd... She has a great balance of upbeat songs and ballads deffinantly not filler on this cd They all have great lyrics and each song seems to stand out in its own way. \\"Irrisistable\\" is a great track to start off the cd and \\"A Little Bit\\" is a great following song....\\"Hot Like Fire\\" as soon as I heard this song I loved it it has a great beat. The tracks \\"Imagination\\" and \\"Eyes Like a Sparrow\\" take a little time to grow on you, in my oppinion that's why I gave this cd 4 stars. It's a CD worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"IRRESISTIBLE","review":"Jessica Simpson just has an amazing voice! This album is lovely. It will take your breath away. so what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next album, Jess","review":"This cd sounds like it was written by a twelve year old. Come on Jessica! I wish that she would create her own path in the music industry instead of just trying to imitate and become Britney. One Britney is enough. Jessica has such a beautiful voice that I am sad to see it go to waste on an album like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica Simpson Is Not Irrisistable","review":"Okay, does the world really need any more blonde chicks trying to prove they can sing? Britney & Christina are enough, and they're too much. Stop trying to be like Debbie Gibson & Tiffany of the 80's. Jessica may have a nice voice, but none of her songs are worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out Simpson","review":"Jessica Simpson, the only teen act who can actually give Christina Aguilera a run for her money with vocal talent seems lost, pumping out Mandy and Britney-esque songs on this new album. After hearing her live talent, which inspired me to buy her first album, I was sadly disapointed with this latest effort. Not because the songs aren't catchy or radio-friendly, but because again she doesn't get the chance to express her full talent. This girl can actually sing but is held to pre-recorded phone conversations (sound familiar all you Britney fans?) and R&B-flavored flops. The one redeeming factor for this album is that, overall, it -is- better than her first."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Never...","review":"..heard such a good album by a pop singer. Jessica leads the pack of teen pop singers with her current album, Irresistable. The tracks are more uptempo and contemporary R&B sounding. There are the signature ballads we come to expect from Jessica. It's everything you would want in a Jessica Simpson album and more. It's even better than her past album Sweet Kisses. This is a more mature Jessica, and she's switched it up a bit. The upbeat tracks are great, especially the title track (which is far better than that awful remix on the radio with Lil Bow Wow), Hot Like Fire, I Never and What's It Gonna Be. The ballads are beautiful, especially To Fall In Love Again, For Your Love and There You Were (with Marc Anthony). The final track is the gospel tinged His Eye Is On The Sparrow. Overall this is a great album by a very talented girl, Jessica Simpson. It's addictive to listen to and a fun album overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but 'irresistible'","review":"While Jessica Simpson's voice has been comapred to Mariah's, that statement remains unproven since Jessica has a long way to go before her songs take to a more decent turn along with her horrible vocals.The only reason why I considered buying this CD was because of the song \\"Irresistible\\" which sounded irresistible after listening to it for a few times, but it soon became \\"resistible\\" after listening to her horrible vocals on the other tracks. Too high pitched and too annoying. Not only does Jessica Simpson's vocals hurt to listen to, but so do the horrible melodies on each of the songs. The only really decent songs that I would favor on this CD would be \\"A Little Bit\\" and \\"Irresistible\\".Until Jessica Simpson's annoying voice it tamed and she finds better ballads to sing, only then will I be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kidding!","review":"YOU MEAN PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUY THIS GARBAGE?!?!????

I was expecting more on this one because it's her second one. I liked her first CD better than this one but I am also sick of that one. I sold this one because it was just a waste of money to me to have even bought it in the first place. The songs just don't have any real depth to them--they don't really sing about anything deep nor do they have a very clear theme.Also her voice is just not wide in octave range.And what's up with the picture on the cover of the CD with Jessica lifting up her shirt and touching her stomach???Britney wanna-bee???"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Trust me you DO NOT want to own this CD! I mean, seriously how fake can you get? First let me comment on something that doesn't really have to do with her voice but how ugh she is! I mean she is really annoying, she starts wearing tight leather and stuff and being all slutty when she acted all sweet and innocent before! She's going way down hill! I mean she changed her voice completely, and she's obviously become really fake, 'cause she wants more cash! I mean a lot of people are in it for the dough, but at least they're original, I mean she just copies everyone she can! Just one question I gotta ask you Jessica, you said you were dumping your boyfriend to focus on your carrer, What carrer?????????????????????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage!","review":"Jessica Simpson's second album Irresistible is an awful and over-produced pop album. There are only 2 good tracks, What's It Gonna Be and For Your Love. The rest of the album is silly and soulless. This album flopped and it's not hard to see why. Leave this one in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO!","review":"Seriously now, some people just can't stand not being britney (uhm Jessica) But after a while it just gets pathetic, sad and desperate! I mean dying your hair to look like her hair. Changing to outfits almost identical to britney's, changing your voice which obviously shows that you're not a true musical artist, you just do whatever it takes to get in the top 10! And oh guess what I just realized Jessica just happens to fit into all of these categorys, why isn't that a strange coinsedence? I certainly think so! I mean, Britney is ok, but there are a lot of people who can't stand her so if they ever hear or see Jessica they'll be throwing garbage cans at her, even the people who think Britney's ok, will really hate someone that trys to be the Pop Princess! Beacuase the'yre probably loyal fans or whatever or they'll just get sick of it! Sorry Jessica, but either way they'll really hate you a lot! You just don't have what it takes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica's Take My breath Away","review":"Jessica Simpson is both a fine singer and actress,however, she does not compare with the originals like Berlin or Catherin Bach.Which she copied in Take My Breath Away and Dukes of Hazard.Kip_Tyler2"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Sure this girl could be put alongside Mandy Moore and of course Britney Spears because why? because she sings pop!but ok I admit, she can sing yeah she can but since her first album she's gone way over pop and is trying to be r&b...;she has been brainwashed... she's a britney spears clone... I know that she is better than that and she could be more successful if she kept to herself and stayed away from being someone else.. buy this cd for the voice not the music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sophmore effort!!","review":"Jessica's sophmore effort is very good, but over production kind of loses it's appeal about mid-way through. There are some beautiful ballads that Ms. Simpson is well known for, and I'd have to say, my favorites are \\"There You Were,\\" and \\"To Fall In Love Again.\\" There are upbeat songs like the R&B like \\"Irresistible,\\" and \\"A Little Bit.\\" Honestly, I don't know how \\"A Little Bit\\" wasn't a hit, it has one of the most catchiest choruses. Then there is a Britney-style pop song \\"What's It Gonna Be.\\" I would've thought Jessica would've steered away from anything that would be branded \\"Britney,\\" but oh well, I guess one has to experiment. Overall, I don't think this album would appeal to everyone, really only just Britney and Jessica fans. Her debut album is the real winner, check that one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica Simpson's \\"Irresistible!\\"","review":"Jessica Simpson's second Album, \\"Irresistible\\", is definetely a keeper and one worth having. On this one, Jessica REALLY went for a more mature \\"Grown up\\" attitude and she has some good songs. I think the money i paid was worth it, but i think that this album wasn't as good as the first... if you are trying to decide if you will like it, buy it, you will! You will be dancing and singing along to it for hours... Anyway, I really enjoy it... U Will Too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have recommended for 25 years","review":"I have been recommending this book since its first edition, published in 1976. Part 1, which runs 40 or 50 pages or so, is the best short course in clear, effective writing I have ever seen. The book is worth the price just for those pages alone. The book has grown larger with each edition, but those first chapters remain unsurpassed. Supplement it with Strunk & White's The Elements of Style (or vice versa)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's keep to writing, not politics.","review":"Zinsser was a professor at Yale during the sixties and sadly it shows. Throughout this book he constantly illustrates writing points he is trying to make by using political anecdotes, all of which presume the reader shares his liberal bias.In a section on eloquence he writes, \\"The cadences of Jefferson, Lincoln, Curchill, Roosevelt and Adlai Stevenson came rolling down to me. (The cadences of Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan did not.)\\" OK. I'll spot him Ike and Nixon. But Reagan? He earned the title \\"The Great Communicator\\" and was teamed with a truly eloquent and gifted speechwriter, Peggy Noonan.In the following paragraph he cites Mario Cuomo and Jesse Jackson as two who have restored his faith in the nobility of language as a means of addressing the populace. Cuomo maybe, but Jackson?This book is dated and tiresome. Save your money and time and instead read something truly useful such as \\"When Words Collide\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing Potboiler","review":"Learn to eliminate excess verbiage, and continue learning the English language and other topics also.There, I have saved you the price of this book. As others have pointed out, the writer is a coach or cheerleader and as such may be quite effective. However, I got the impression he was a bit of a hack himself, in a position for many years such that he was paid whether he wrote well or badly. I suspect those days are gone.I lost most of my confidence in him gradually except when he began to enthuse about his \\"Webster's Dictionary\\" which I know as a generic term, i.e., nearly useless. There is no \\"Webster's\\" company, it has become a generic term for a large number of INFERIOR dictionaries. It is bad advice, and that is when I lost the big chunk of any remaining confidence in the value of his book.Much of it would be useful, in lieu of any other instruction, for a high school student or college freshman. There are better books to recommend, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Writing Well","review":"It's amazing how Zinsser uses what he is writing about while he is writing about it.

Such an offense as elevating Adlai Stevensen to the level of Jefferson and Churchill (!) while simultaneously diminishing Reagan cannot pass unnoticed by the reader. If you can manage to set aside this bile as it bubbles up, you'll find the book worthwhile. If you cannot, you will be enraged at the hypocrisy demonstrated by this otherwise competent writer. Zinsser's editor should have clipped him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Book","review":"How Zinsser can call himself a writer is beyond me. This book is filled with hostility, arrogance, and hypocrisy. All of the points Zinsser makes about being an effective writer are contradicted at some point throughout the book, either directly via a comment, or through his own writing style.'Part-time' writers are trivialized and all forms of writing except that which Zinsser purports to practice are criticized.This book is nothing more than a blatant attempt at self-aggrandization.If you're truly interested in being a writer, ignore all of the nonsensical garbage Zinsser writes. Trust me, I've been a newspaper editor for 25 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attacks Richard Feynman's writing","review":"Zinsser may know writing technique but his content is sometimes totally off-base.His attacks on Richard Feynman's books are totally ludicrous. Those books are suppose to be tongue-in-cheek humorous books.

But I never will read them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better!","review":"This is an excellent book in almost every respect, except for his occasional digressions to preach political correctness with reference to gender issues. He doesnt like masculine pronouns because females are equal yadda, yadda, yadda; and his female readers scolded him about his insensitivity to their pain. You will want to break out in song when you come upon them: \\"Anything you can do, I can do better! I can do anything better than you!\\" I suspect it has to do with what Mencken called being \\"Chalky Pedagogues.\\" Yo! Zinsser! Lighten up!

I must admit that, as a big Korn/Limp Bixkit?Rob Zombie fan, the music somewhat irritated me and it took a while for the band to grow on me. Unfortunately, \\"Fight Songs\\" is not the Old 97's I grew to love while listening to \\"Too Far to Care,\\" \\"Hitchike to Rhome,\\" or \\"Wreck Your Life.\\" Where is the twang? This album is just far too radio-friendly to convince me that the band made an all-out emotional effort while writing it. \\"Lonely Holiday\\" is definitely no \\"Salome,\\" and \\"Murder...\\" pales in comparison with \\"Barrier Reef\\" and \\"Over the Cliff.\\" It's still a good album, just not as good as it could have been. Where are the Old 97's that changed the way I look at music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"cohesive inter-mix of lyrics and sonics","review":"More varied in song styles but less powerful as a whole than the previous \\"Too far to Care\\", with more of a 'someting for everyone approach'. You don't realize just how 'twangy' their earlier efforts were until you go back and listen to them after \\"Fight Song\\". Again the lyrics are the strong-point, but they are braced within some first-rate tunes-manship. Another good selling point is the relative lack of weak songs on the CD: a lot of listening value is here. This CD is a fine effort, but the live shows are not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-country fan's fave country album","review":"Alright... for those of you none country fans, you have no excuse!

While I didn't find any, I still think this CD is a great collection. Some fans will say the group has \\"sold out\\" to the label this time, but, even though a bit more mainstream, Fight Songs still offers up the same proof as its predecessors: these guys are incredible songwriters. And I'm sure it will grow on me more with each playing, same as Wreck Your Life and Too Far to Care."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DAMN SHAME","review":"Call me an old-fashioned old 97's fan but I like scrappy, twangy, and raw. It's a damn shame when good guys go soft. I love Chris Isaak, but I don't expect to hear his pretty style from these guys. Dull, ininspired, and like a million other bands.

I heard the band play a few of these songs in concert back in January. I thought they were excellent. But somebody thought it was a brilliant idea to overproduce the songs, tone down the instruments, and soften Rhett's voice. While the songwriting remains strong, the production is too much.

There's nothing distinctive here, and there's probably 1000's of bands out there that sound just like this. On the first listen I found myself wanting the disc to end so that I could hear Jack Logan's new Buzz Me In (a great album) that was next in my changer.

And I know that Neil Finn is a fan as well, and I trust his opinion a lot more than the sour grapes I've seen here from fair-weather fans and musicians alike. Anyway, the album is great! Yes it's different, yes it's more \\"produced,\\" yes it's not as yowly or twangy. But so what? Why can't an artist try different things?

He doesn't get his point across, if there is a point, at all. It took me several days just to read chapter two. It was all to choppy, technical, confusing, and as I said before, done right boring. I do not recommend this book to anyone unless they are insane or wanting to become insane. It would take an absolutely crazy athiest type of person to read this book. Two thumbs and two big toes down. Zero stars (that's not an option) in this girls opinion.

I especially liked a Demon Haunted World, and Contact, and in flipping through Cosmos that looks very interesting too. This book is thought provoking, but is very technical because of the topic presented. It's not for everyone. But considering the complexity of human intelligence, it is pretty graspable. The critisism for this book would have to be that it is over 25 years old and dated and that he was much younger and i believe that as he got older his writing style changed and grew and his writing became less technical and easier to grasp but still intelligently written. Its amazing to read this book right after one of his later books and see the difference. He was a brilliant man."},{"rating":"2","title":"blew my mind...","review":"wow.

By identifying the same elements -- happy home in the valley, dangerous climb to the heights, two child-deaths, etc. -- in each of Ibsen's works, Hurt reveals autobiographical elements imbedded in symbolic structures. For example, Hedda Gabler contains two \\"child-deaths,\\" Lovborg's manuscript and Hedda's unwanted pregnancy. While occasionally struggling with his examples, Hurt succeeds in removing Ibsen from a mere front-runner in chamber theatre to a significant psychological observer of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something","review":"I've listened to the album twice now, and had to turn it off both times because I thought it was so horrible.

It's emotionally moving and yet also playful and fun. Great CD! A definate recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, if you have to, steal this album! It's that good!","review":"This record is truly a masterpiece. Although a relatively new Ben Folds Five listener, I have found this album stunning. I feel the band has matured with this album. There is, as they say on the interview included, real meaning behind all the songs (except perhaps Your Redneck Past), and I think eveyone can relate to all the songs. But leaving the meaning behind, just listen to the music for itself! It's so cleverly done, with little twists that anyone with less talent could ruin. I can't believe these guys aren't more popular; they're probably my favourite band ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"New age Ben Folds Five","review":"This isn't the best of Ben Folds Five that I've heard, and although it's stil way superior, I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a long time Ben Folds Five fan.

Ben has such a beautiful, clear voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fave CDs of all time.","review":"I have been a fan for quite a while, but I never expected this greatness to come from them. There are so many feelings throughout the CD. From the semi-happiness of Narcolepsy, Army, and Lullabye to the most sorrowful depths of human emotions like in Magic and Hospital Song. Speaking of Magic, it has now become my favorite song. (My old fave was Alice Childress). Songs like Jane help me get through those tough days where you feel like everyone's against me. This is a great CD for any occasion and I would encourage anyone out there who is thinking of buying this CD to go ahead and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't deliver the same punch anymore ...","review":"This CD is an innovative piece of work, but doesn't quite hold up to the first 2 BF5 albums, which I wholeheartedly gave 5 stars. The songs are less energetic and the music does not evoke the same force enough to stir the numb. There is an effort to sound melodic in a post-classical way, but the notes are repetitive and relatively simplistic, compare, say, to \\"Philosophy\\". Tracks 2-4 are compelling reasons to get this in the collection, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bold new step for Ben Folds Five...","review":"Surrounded by lavish and complicated strings and brass, Folds whips off another batch of catchy songs. More subdued, perhaps, but beneath the richer production, the trio are still there. We're hit right away with the incredible \\"Narcolepsy\\"...a 5+ minute collage of musical variety. From the soft, to genuine BFF-driven energy. On the way through, we experience drummer Jesse's well-realized \\"Magic\\"; classic Folds fare, \\"Army\\" and \\"Your Redneck Past\\", all on the way to the wonderful and vibrant finale, \\"Lullabye\\". Touted by some as a complete turn, by others a more mature outing, and still just a better \\"What- ever And Ever Amen\\", one thing remains the same, BFF is still one of the most talented and original bands out there. Though some may miss pure candy-coated pop bliss, this bold step has payed off in what is a grand and magnificant album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best discs in my collection...","review":"There are relatively few discs I own that constantly find their way back into my player again and again (or nowadays, my IPOD's Most Played playlist); The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner is one of these, however. It holds such a huge place in the soundtrack of my life; I actually envy those of you who have not listened to it before, because you are in for an incredible journey....Buy this..Now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Five - A Slight Step Down But Still Good","review":"Ben Folds Five delivers again with another collection of outstanding piano based songs. I have seen different interpretations of the \\"concept\\" behind this album and I am still not sure that I see exactly what it is supposed to be. Is the main character Ben himself or just someone made up in his mind? The songs are mostly introspective and deal with regret, loss and life choices. Although there are a few upbeat moments most of this album explores self examination through review of ones actions. Overall I don't think that this album is nearly as strong as \\"Whatever Amen\\", but it has its moments. \\"Narcolepsy\\", \\"Don't Change Your Plans\\", \\"Mess\\", \\"Army\\", \\"Your Redneck Past\\" are all very good and resonate with what is best about this band. Tight concise piano fronted music and intelligent lyrics. \\"Mesner\\" would end up being the last album from the original Ben Folds Five band. The members would go their separate ways after this one with Folds going solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different But Excellent","review":"If you are looking for a rehash of Whatever and Ever or the debut Ben Folds album, you are going to be disappointed. BF's first two albums highlighted BF's physical acrobatic piano skills (quite effectively). In Reinhold, BF has matured somewhat and his musical skill is now manifested itself not so much in the staggering tickling of the ivories but the composition and mood of the music. The entire album is substantially more polished and produced than previous albums but songs like Your Redneck Past will remind you why you liked BF so much. If you are a fan already, listen a few times. It will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound!!","review":"This CD is very different from BFF's previous works. It's a bit calmer, less angry. It seems to me, that Ben Folds and his band have lost their angry spunk and it has been replaced with great song writing and melancholic tunes. It's a great thinking CD and everyone go out and buy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad knock-off of seventies rock and nineties grunge","review":"Ben Folds seems to have overstepped his bounds once too often, and this album greatly emphasizes this point. Folds is minimally talented, as is his band, but on their previous recordings, they seemed to understand that they were a band lucky to have a contract. With Messner, however, they've attempted to present a massive tour-de-force, yet end up sounding like a drunken garage band. I would recommend this album to BFF completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought about the Army, however...","review":"My wife owns the Live CD and Rockin' the Suburbs. Both are excellent Ben Folds CDs. He plays fun piano based songs with clever, interesting lyrics. I got this CD because I like his live version of Army and wanted to have the studio version.However, Army is almost the only good thing on this CD. I also like Redneck Past. After that, I haven't found anything all that exciting. So my advice is to get Rockin and Live and skip this one. Sorry Ben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music weak voice","review":"I bought this cd based on the reviews on amazon.com. I must say that Ben Folds has an ear for melodious songs, it is only a pity that is voice is so shallow and weak. Maybe it would be better to hire a good singer who can bring more emotion into the music. The opening song narcolepsic can be skipped. It is just bombastic noise. The rest of the songs are very good. Hence 4 stars. Maybe Ben should listen to Linus of Hollywood who has a similar voice but makes far better use of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointing","review":"Given that I only have one other album by Ben Folds -- Whatever and Ever Amen -- I can't write a review as someone that is all-knowing about this group. The best explanation that I have for rating Reinhold so low is that I see is as an incredible drop-off from Whatever. Whatever is melodic, flowing, somewhat raw, and if you have ever been in love, can be incredibly intense. Reinhold is disjointed, quirky in a bad way (I consider, say, Beck, to be quirky in a GOOD way), and overproduced. I don't know what else to say. That being said, this is only MY humble opinion, and I am definately comparing this album to one a hold a high affinity for. If I heard Reinhold without ever hearing anything else by Ben Folds, I might even rate it three stars. Either way, this guy is gifted as hell, so don't take my word as Final."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I love Ben's work... .except for this. It is easily my least favorite of all of his albums. Why?? Gees... where do I start. Suffice to say that the album is depressing and generally difficult to listen to. In my opinion, Ben is best when he \\"kicks it up a notch\\". This needs to be kicked... about 3 notches. I bought it on the strength of \\"Army\\" and my love for their previous works. I guess I should have did a little more research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabees","review":"I bought this, I admit, for the title, only to have it turn out that these guys didn't know Reinhold Messner, but used the name for fake IDs. That's consistent with the sound of the album, which sounds like a bunch of suburban white guys who would like to be musicians, but um, aren't. (They remind me of Social Distortion, with a lighter sound.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT !","review":"I wish I could return this CD....I think \\"Brick\\" was a fluke....Sorry guys, but I think this CD Isn't worth the plastic it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Ok","review":"The only songs that I think are good are Army, Your Redneck Past, and Jane. The other songs are not bad, but just kind of there. They have no bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Are they good, well yes they are. TUBORM is a truly great album. I thought it would be all syrupy and sugar-coated, but instead BFF made me cry. The only thing stopping me from giving TUBORM full marks is that I've never given any album 5 stars and I never will. But if I were to, them stars would go to BFF."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Epic Album","review":"I decided to give a review and show respect for such an amazing trio - especially after recently hearing of their break up. Ben Folds Five was one of the most innovative bands in modern music. The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner starts out as a thrilling, epic album with the breath-taking \\"Narcolepsy\\". And it only gets better from there. The thrashing drums, rhythmic bass and of course, the awesome paino all shine through on this album. The mood for this album is very mellow with a peak of hardness at tracks 6 and 7 (\\"Army\\" and \\"Your Redneck Past\\"). The album closes with less than a bang with \\"Lullaby\\", me personal favorite on the album. Get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious, yet still catchy","review":"I agree with Chris Savory below--the beginning portion of this album is extraordinary! I'm reminded a lot of Chicago (album 8) and some Pink Floyd in a lot of the production and keyboard lines. The orchestration is great, and for you musicians out there, the outro chord of \\"Don't Change Your Plans\\" is the most ambitious chord change I can recall. Not much in here that will have people on their car radios singing along, but it's a great album slightly bogged down by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you","review":"I already had \\"Whatever and Ever Amen\\", and the friend who hooked me onto that suggested I buy \\"The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner\\". I did, and was sorry immediately. I hated the cd at first! I had liked the small band sound of the previous album, and didn't like the showy sound of \\"Narcolepsy\\". However, I kept listening to it, and eventually it grew on me. If you don't like the album when you first hear it, give it a chance. It really has potential, and I think it's a great sound for BFF."},{"rating":"2","title":"In which the Angry Young Man emulates Bacharach","review":"As someone who was blown away by the brash, youthful exuberance of WHATEVER AND EVER AMEN, I had high expectations for this CD. It fulfilled them -- but in a way I didn't expect.On this album Ben Folds' songwriting is more restrained and mature. The result is stunning -- this is a collection of truly wonderful pop songs, showing more Bacharach than Billy Joel. Like his role model Joe Jackson, Folds is not content to sit in once place, producing the same music album after album. The first four cuts of this CD prove beyond a doubt that this is a songwriter who is going to have a great career.REINHOLD MESSNER is a dazzling career move for Folds. It may cost him a few listeners who expected more WHATEVER AND EVER angry young man antics. But it will seal his reputation among those who saw through the anger to the real talent that lies beneath.This is a five-star album. The only reason I gave it four is because at 40:37, it's too short. Nothing's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting...","review":"This was hardly the album most BFF fans expected upon its release in 1999, myself included. Looking back, it wasn't the radical departure most fans claimed it was. Ben's tender side had always popped up here and there on his previous albums. It just came through most prominently on this one. This a seemless collection of haunting lyrics and gorgeous melodies that begs to be played from start to finish.BFF called it quits shortly after they released this. I saw one of their last shows at the University of Vermont's Patrick Gym in April of 2000 and it remains one of the very best concerts I've ever seen. They should have released a full live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Fine Piece of Music","review":"I have looked forward to purchasing this CD since January. I just purchased it today. I assure you, it was not in vain. The CD is quite a bit different than its predecessors. It's somewhat hard to explain, perhaps due to a lack of words to describe the altercation from the previous CDs. I would HIGHLY recomend this CD to anyone who wants to hear a general good CD or if you're a Ben Folds Five fan (such as myself) , than get this CD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BFF adds several new wrinkles, and the result is great music","review":"BFF has created another wonderful batch of songs, though I wish there were a few more on the album. They added considerable polish to their manic piano riffs. Those who loved \\"Song for the Dumped\\" and \\"Kate\\" will find fewer songs like those two on this album; in other words, if you only like BFF in hyper-angst mode, you may not like this album as much. Nonetheless, there are plenty of great toe-tapping songs. In Forever and Ever Amen, BFF took shots primarily at other people, while in this album there is far greater self-examination. BFF has expanded its horizons and may lose some of its casual fans because of that. But in the end its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment","review":"I never expected to give a rating of 2 to this excellent group, but this album totally lost me. I liked their earlier material because it was different - we haven't had an intense rocking piano player since Jerry Lee Lewis and Joe Jackson. Sadly, the new album drifts for the most part into Elton John territory, albeit with better (and depressing) lyrics. Maybe it will grow on me, I don't know. I liked \\"Army\\" and \\"Your Redneck Past\\" , and the way they experiment on tracks like \\"Regrets\\" is rather interesting, but all in all it was still a disappointment coming from such a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben and the boys get depressing","review":"Well I bought this album expecting more of the usual happy-go-lucky songs and clever lyrics. What I got was a slow, often boring CD of soft rock and pop. I acknowledge that they're trying to broaden their horizons, but to me they're spreading themselves thin. First off, all of the horns and strings REALLY take away from the three singular talents that make up this band. Second, I've been a serious fan since I saw them in concert the first time. Their brand of toe-tapping, in-your-face fun had me hooked. I guess I'll have to bring a box of kleenex to the next show. In short (too late), I want to feel good, not feel bad for Ben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear of looking dumb","review":"To tell the truth, although I liked this album, some of it really turned me off. The first 6 songs, and the last one, though, made this album way worth it. During those middle, songs, I really kind of miss the piano-bas-guitar, sweetly harmonized angst. YOUR REDNECK PAST is the worst example of this-it sounds like he's trying too hard. I don't know, maybe since I'm such a fan I expect too much, but some of the songs are too strained, and the strings are alittle repetitous. But the 1-6 and 11 make this album worth ten of any other. When this band is on, and they pretty much are, they blow me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistry, shmartistry...","review":"This is the kind of album that makes critics happy and lets fans down. Critics get bored easily and so they need fresh and weird stuff to listen to - this album has lots of it. But much of what I loved about their first few albums is not really here in this one - it's gone, hidden, missing, it's I don't know... matured. Okay. It's great to hear Ben Folds evolve and develop his songwriting skills, but please, just toss in some catchy tunes for the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"ben folds five","review":"this cd is great ben folds is a genuis and i think everyone should buy this cd its highly recomended no matter what music you like i listin to punk and this is one of my favorite cds what does that show you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A giant leap foward, and why not!","review":"If I could give this album 4.5 stars, that is what I would give it. It is so near to perfection that I can only fault it on 2 things: 'Don't Change Your Plans' started life as a much longer piece of music that was edited to hell and back by the producer (Caleb Southern). While this is not nescessarily a bad thing, there are a few edits that he didn't get quite right. There's one annoying jump in the track right near the end which spoils the beauty of the song (and it is a beautiful song). The other fault I find is the song 'Your Redneck Past'. It's been plastered with bad synth effects and I find it difficult to listen to.However, except for those two minor points, I find the rest of the album to be a fantastic song cycle. There is much of interest on this album, (not least of which is an answerphone message from Bens Dad:-)Buy this album, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds brings new meaning to the word \\"Music\\"","review":"The album \\"The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner\\" gives new meaning to the word \\"Music\\". Ben Folds has done wonderful things with the piano for this record, form the slow crooning tune of \\"Magic\\" to to the hilarity of \\"Your Redneck Past\\". This album reassures the belief that there really are MUSICIANS in this world that aren't interested only in Classical music. The themes in the album are apparent to the trained ear. Chuck Berry used the same Chord progressions in about 3 songs, and changed the words, but Ben Folds tastefully re- uses the little interludes in completely different contexts. This album is a must for anyone who can handle this sophisticated music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Grows up","review":"Picture Burt Bacarach as a smart butt 20 something and you have Ben Folds. I have been a fan for a while and with his new CD I believe that I will be a fan for quite some time. With the new CD he trys to push himself in a more adult manor while still trying to hold onto his immature past (musically speaking). He really has put together a great album, but an album that might alienate some of his casual fans, fans searching for angst ridden anthems such as \\"Song for the Dumped\\" and \\"200 solemn faces\\" will find this CD hard to swallow, its not like his old stuff, its more polished and sounds like somewhat of a concept album, but it is great and worth the effort to buy it and listen. Good Job, I look forward to the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds needs a hug","review":"This album immediately struck me as an album made by an artist who is sick of hiding behind his mask of humor, yet it is a mask he sometimes enjoys wearing. This CD strikes me as depressing in a Pink Floyd kind of way: good music, but with a melancholic tone that can't be denied. This CD adds a new dimension to Folds' music, and for those who enjoyed \\"Evaporated\\" off of \\"Whatever and Ever, Amen\\", this is right up your alley, a dark alley though it may be. And there's nobody else in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben's been doing a lot of thinking","review":"Yes, this is a concept album. If that turns you off I really feel sorry for you. You would be missing an instant classic. The second you hear the first few notes of \\"Narcolepsy\\" you'll know this isn't your usual Ben Folds. Sure, there's the same old sweet melodies that seem to drip from Ben's fingers, but this time you actually feel the music. The smooth violins and cello's complete the feel, and suddenly you are pulled in. Like Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", there is no hope for this album to become a huge sucess because there are only one or two radio songs, \\"Army\\" and \\"Don't Change Your Plans\\". But don't let the radio decide what is or isn't good music for you. This album is too beautiful for the radio. My only advice is to sit back and enjoy the album. It's like dream you'll never want to wake up from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic....","review":"I just purchased this album, and I can't stop listening to it. I understand why there are mixed views about it - the music is different in that it's not as \\"hard\\" rocking and aggressive as in Ben Folds Five's previous albums. But the similarity lies in the composition and creativity in the lyrics, arranging, and heartfelt execution. I find this album quite uplifting and I just love it to pieces!

As I said, I wish I had a work like this for my area !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real journal","review":"I always use a travel journal when I go to Europe. I like to try new ones for every trip. This journal looked so cute & trendy. When i got it.... i realize that it is all it is. Not very functional. It pretty much is just colored paper without any writing lines on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first book in the series","review":"I like this new series by Kevin J. Anderson. I enjoyed the first book of the series. The second book of the series is even better and moves at a better pace than the first one did. I enjoy his characterizations and descriptions. He writes just the right amount to give a clear picture without becoming tedious.Personally, I want to see more from Jess Tamblyn's POV but I'm not the author so I'll just have to like what I get. :)Very original plot and creation of tension between races! Recommended to anyone who is looking for good scifi/fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so patronizing?","review":"Normally, this is the type of sci-fi that I like - a broad opera covering many events that lead up to a grand conclusion. However, Anderson's writing style makes getting through these books a chore, with only paragraphs here and there that bring it to life and make it worthwhile. It seems like every time he describes anything he has to lug out the thesaurus and ensure to include at least three adjectives. In addition, you are constantly reminded in depth of events that took place just a few chapters back. Overall, I get the sense that Anderson doesn't think too highly of his audience - that or he's shooting for the wrong audience altogther. The dialogue is trite and unrealistic - no one that I know speaks like his characters, especially when they are relating to intimate friends. I kept reading for the story line, but I have to admit, I put this book and the previous down a few times, promising that I wasn't going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of an excellent series","review":"Anderson has built quite an interesting universe. However, while much is revealed in this second book of the series, bring so many plot threads together, much still remains to be resolved at the end of this book. I was going to wait for the third book to come out in paperback, but I'm not sure I can hold off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking through the ordinary","review":"LastEXILE: Breakthrough is definitely the true breaking point of the series, although the auction for Exile and the race in the third DVD began setting the scene up. Breakthrough includes episodes 13 through 16.13. ISOLATED PAWN - Claus and Tatiana are left alone on a desert wasteland, and struggle to find the survivors of the Sylvana.14. ETUDE LAVIE - Basically a complete flashback of Claus and Lavie's pasts. Includes the beautiful song 'Skywriting.'15. FAIRY CHESS - Claus and Tatiana return to the Sylvana, although the situation there has changed...16. BREAKTHROUGH - The war between Dysis and Anatore reaches a climax, and the Guild begins to play a more major role.I can only recommend this amazing DVD to all of you. If you've been following the series up to now, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"i could not belive how unbelivibly good this show is! when i fist watched last exile all i could say was wow! and it hasn't disapointed me yet. last exile has some of the best animation i've ever seen! and the whole plot is amazing! a real masterpiece. this show is one that almost anyone could enjoy, especialy if you are a fan of war flicks of any kind. when i finished watching V4 breakthrough all i could think was \\"more, i must have more!\\" and i can't wait for V5 to come out. i think i have to take a little time to mention the characters who are all so wonderfully perfect in personaliy and aimimation that i can truthfully say that GONZO has realy outdone itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The white cover of this cushion is impractical - my cushion fell on the floor, and the dog thought it would make a marvelous bed to sleep on. She drooled on it, and got a stain on the cover. The cover is very, very difficult to remove and I haven't dared try to do so as I'm not entirely certain if I can get it back on if I do remove it to wash it.The cushion itself was too firm for me. I would return it back to Amazon, but due to my dog leaving a stain on the cover, I can't. I guess it will at least make a good dog bed, since my dog seems to like sleeping on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"The first two weeks was great.

It's difficult to judge the dimensions of the hole and that's the entire problem for the purpose suggested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews","review":"This product is great for the first few days, especially when I was using it before I had removed it from the plastic wrap it was encased in. Soon after removal, and normal use, it has lost its shape and does not provide the same comforting cushion it did in the first couple of days. I am currently not able to get relief by using it and am searching for a replacement because it no longer relieves the discomfort experienced around my tailbone.It may be a magic foam but the only magical thing about it is how fast it lost its resilient ability to cushion the body.If you only need comfort for a couple days, buy this. If you're looking for a longer term solution, you might consider something else. I'm giving this two stars because it did do the job for the first several days of use so will provide someone with temporary relief if they have the money to spend on replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief From Bed Sores","review":"A family member is bedridden with terminal cancer and developed painful bed sores. I bought several of these so we could rotate them and wash the covers. They have been the most effective method we've tried. We also used a smaller one under the pillow and it keeps her head in a more comfortable position. The product has given her great relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I am giving this two stars because maybe it would work well for someone weighing under a hundred pounds. For me, at twice that, the cushion is about as useless as it could get. I may as well be sitting on an empty pillow case, as it compresses down to nothing the moment I sit on it. The cushion is beyond soft, it is virtually non-existent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"This pillow is great.

I LOVED this album when it came out and never forgot it.

That was very short lived. In a matter of just two weeks, I had two piston assemblys break, then after replacing that, the handle broke completely in two! This pump was not abused or misused at all. My daughter was weaning at the time so it was only used 2-3 times per day for maybe a month and that's pushing it. Very disappointing product. Would not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible pump - don't waste your money","review":"This pump was terrible. I am a first time mom, and I hated this pump. I bought it thinking that the convenience of pumping into bags and putting them straight into the freezer then popping them straight into a bottle would be great. But the pump doesn't actually pump. It does on occasion, but not enough to efficiently pump at all. There are a lot of very small pieces that you have to take off every time you pump to clean it too. It was also noisy (rackety). I couldn't pump in the same room as my baby, it would wake him up every time. I suggest to get any other pump that you are comfortable with (I went with a nice yellow one) and then get the breast milk storage kit if you still want to pump into the liners, The kit has attachments that fit nearly all breast pumps and you can still pump into liners with any other pump. This pump was a total waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best effort.","review":"I ordered this because we have enjoyed Hayseed Dixie, but this is not their best effort. It seemed forced.

It seems as though some record companies will only put out the radio play music and not what the fans like most from these bands. Get It On was and still is the best Pacific Gas & Electric album, seems as though the small Orange label owners should try to pull thier heads out of thier a-- and put the master tape on disc. But this review is about these two albums right? Buy this Cd, it kicks and this band was one of the best at that time, Charlie was a great vocalist and God rest his soul.."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"Apart from the Allman Brothers, who are in a league of their own, I can think of only two American 'white' Blues acts that can match PG&E for the sheer quality of their output: Canned Heat and The Siegel-Schwall Band. 'Are you ready' is to my ears the best of the three albums released by the band, and this is one Cd that should be in everybody' s collection, I reckon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leupold PRW high scope mount","review":"Very hefty and sturdy product. Made of steel, not aluminum. Gives a nice tactical look to the scope. Only quirk is you have to snap the top ring quite forcefully to the bottom mount in order to install it. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, there are no scratches from this process. Once installed, the scope is very easy to rotate or adjust. Highly recommended.My set up: Nikon P-22 (2-7X)scope mated to Sig-522 Swat Commando. The high ring gives perfect mounting height and eye relief. This ring is probably an over-kill for a 22-LR set up. But, it exudes quality and should last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Crawford Film","review":"Joan Crawford plays Edith Whitehead, the worn-down wife of an oil worker who walks out on him after the accidental death of their only child. As another reviewer has noted, this film is an interesting hybrid--both a woman's film and a film noir. It's a woman's film in the way she goes from rags to riches and changes her identity to that of Ethel Forbes, a wealthy socialite. It's noir in the sense that she accomplishes this by becoming a tough-talking gangster's moll. But she's not as smart as she thinks she is and her luck turns bad. In the vocabulary of women's films, she has to punished for daring to abandon her husband. But female viewers got to vicariously see her wear a lot of terrific clothes and get treated (at least temporarily) like a queen. Crawford acts well in this film, with a great supporting cast. A well-crafted and unjustly neglected film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even think of self publishing without this book!","review":"The publishing world is a jungle.

It is incredibly slow - to the point where it cannot be used and it looks like there was zero QA done before the product was shipped.I have been a long time fan of Franklin products. From the old days of using the paper planners to the first gen of electronic Franklin Planner for the Palm Pilot. I loved the task manager, quick prioitizing and planning tools etc. They made my life so easy. But this latest product is just plain junk. I have tried and tried to make this product work over many painful months with several chat sessions with tech support. But it is just too painful - and so so slow. I have now given up and am moving on.My advice:To customers: Do not buy this product!To FranklinCovey: Take this product off the market. It is killing your fine reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I really like the approach to planning and prioritizing that Franklincovey have embedded in their planplus for Outlook. Unfortunately, this software is completely unusable if your goal is to be productive. I'm running outlook 2007 and Vista Ultimate, and planplus crashes almost every time I look at the calendar, or if I add a task. Sometimes I wait it out and occassionally 10 min later outlook unfreezes.Don't waste hours of you life with this poorly developed and horribly tested application - it is the #1 \\"loss of productivity\\" solution. In Covey-speak, this is a quadrant 4 activity - not urgent and not important. Don't waste your time trying this out just to come to the same conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Franklin Covey!","review":"First review I have ever posted. I have used PlanPlus for Outlook for years, prior versions were a little buggy and I just made do without synching the Covey data to my Palms over the years. So I thought the new version 4.0 would fix all this. After 6 hours of work on my part, I have given up and reverted to version 3.0. Version 4.0 is so full of bugs that you are constantly interrupted with weird error messages, and it seems to make a worse hash of synching to Palm devices than the previous ones. It is hard to beleive that a reputable firm like FC would release this, and even worse, once you look at how long people have been criticizing the product on various web sites, even more amazing that they haven't bothered to release an amended version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly terrible","review":"This software is a mess.

For example, there's a story about a girl who survived a tornado, a girl pitching in to make the hospital she's so often in better for children, and so many more!

It's a fairly easy song and anyone can sing along to it, but only you can give it that certain style and finesse that makes it a number one hit on the charts.

When a keeper makes a mistake in technique and there are many they don't correct it.It is designed to give you a set number of drills that is it. The drills are very basic.

The plot is mundane, but what makes this video terrible is the injection of 1980 US cultural values into a 1950 story. The clothes worn by the heroine are repulsively ugly. They make an average shaped woman look deformed with a flat chest and a back with projections that most women would be happy to have in front. Notice the turned up collars which were just as ugly then as they are now. The hero is not convincing as a technology nerd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ominous","review":"All Drum 'N' Bass causes some tension in the listener due to the structure of the breakbeats, but Source Direct have given that tension a horrific twist. This is one of the darkest albums in a predominately heavy genre I have heard in a long time. From the brooding bassline of \\"Call & Response\\", the ominous chords in \\"Technical Warfare\\", the sporadic Hardstep of \\"Love & Hate\\", and the samples used in \\"Concealed Identity\\" all help create some of the most spine tingling soundscapes in recent memory. The only track that I felt detracted from the feel of the album was \\"Dubstar\\" with its Atari sounding video game noises randomly thrown in. It feels as though this album was constructed with the same care given to many concept albums, but that is not the case. Exorcise the Demons is a collection of all the Source Direct material that was only released on vinyl over the last 2 years.

The darkest Drum N' Bass I have heard to date, but not the best. There is seclusion in every track that is making minds waiting for the next break to be even blood-flowing than the other. \\"Technical Warfare\\" boosts the mind-frame for chopped movements to be made by robots that animate through my mind, but \\"Love And Hate\\" is the worse Drum N' Bass jam I have heard in my life. This album needs some ingredients to be as potent as other Drum N' Bassers making their chic beats. Social brain-storming on this album is not worth the nerve to burn. I have heard better and I have heard worse. This album sits in my case collecting dust and who knows what to film it's cause of ignorance from my music machine. Take my advice.

However, this is one album too avoid. For one, two tracks (\\"Call and Response\\" and \\"Capital D\\") can be found on Controlled Developments. For another, the beats are way, way too slow and simple. They're not deceptively simple, they're just simple. The production values are high -- Source Direct loves those clean, crisp breakbeats. But the rhythmic structure is just too bland. And the songs aren't pulled together in any kind of theme. Controlled Developments is the much better album (the songs are more inspired, there's much better bass, and there aren't any repeats)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite grower","review":"I bought this CD right when it came out, liking Source Direct's earlier stuff. I was originally a bit disappointed, if only because it repeated two tracks from their earlier releases, and because it didn't seem all that special. But after repeated listening, the tracks really grow on you, with their great rhythm parts, always weaving around the eery bass-line melodies, and the \\"special effects\\" puncutuating everything. That may sound awfully eclectic, and Source Direct is certainly not for those who have never listened to any jungle before.

I've used the ICEPad constantly during that time, mostly as a heat shield while using the computer in my lap, but also as a desk stand while travelling with the computer.The one Achilles heel of the stand is that with long-term use the glue (some sort of rubber cement) binding the rubber pads to the plastic frame gets loosened by heat and/or friction, and pads start coming loose. This is more of a nuisance than a fatal flaw, and considering the amount of use I've given the device and how long it took for this to start happening, it's a minor issue.

In essence, the figure cannot grip anything. I do like the web slinging action, though. Overall, the figure could be more poseable than what it is. The neck isn't jointed very well. The legs and arms seem stiff. The removeable mask is a great idea, but does not cover the entire head in the back, which makes it look stupid. It is also difficult to correctly place it on the head. The outfit is quite nice. These concerns are minimal and probably even nitpicking. This is due to the recent well-articulated figure explosion out of Japan (i.e.: Dragon & Hot Toys).

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"APB","review":"The letters of this review stand for Annoying, Pointless and Boring which about summarizes my thoughts on this movie. Anyone who gives this clunker more than one star had to have had a financial stake in it. Cillian Murphy in his \\"Emma\\" persona looks like Michael Jackson before his demise and Susan Sarandon looks puffy and ancient. The plot is slow and tedious and is devoid of any tension or surprises and any references to \\"Psycho\\" are way off base!

Especially enjoy the cracked pepper because, while the flavor is subtle, it is distinctly a fresh ground flavor.My only criticism has to do with packaging. Not sure the extra outer cellophane is really necessary ... but I'll leave that to the experts who have been successfully making these crackers for ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Shady, Amazon","review":"No, I love these crackers. I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet. Just not too bad at allEXCEPTThe order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special. In the end, the loser is me. When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others: Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.Shame on you, Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"AND IBE GOING OOH!

It was the second that I've read from Coben. I finished it in two days. It kept me up all night, and you'd never suspect the way it ends. This book is definitely worth reading. You won't be disappointed. It is fast paced all the way through. Warning: You will become OBSESSED."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the usual harlan coben","review":"this story is a little bit different from the usual witty, fast paced books from harlan coben.the story starts off well, intriguing; but it gently slows down a little bit with some character building. before one gets bored though, the pace picks up again; all the way til the last page, with some twists and turns in between. you are kept wondering what would happen next, and your guess can never be correct.this book has a few of the trade mark harlan coben storyline. the main man on a quest, gets help from some friends who are very smart/well equipped. however, it lacks the usaul witty remarks that makes his other stories such excellent works.the story is well written and as usual, i finished the book before i realised i was near the end. an exciting and worthy read but not the best work by this excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Book with Lackluster Ending","review":"Tell No One was the only other Coben book I had read and it was a page turner. I expected the same for this one, but probably ended up enjoying this one more because the suspense kept up to the very end. It did get slow at points, and the finish was a little weak, but overall this was a solid mystery that will keep you looking forward to picking it back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable.","review":"First, I find it unbelievable that so many readers have praise for this book. I enjoy Coben enormously and have tremendous respect for his work but this book reads as though he was being paid by the word and plot twist. Everyone has a friend who takes forever to get to the point, right? - who goes off on tangents or repeats or adds needless details. This is the book version.Second, the plot of this book is literally unbelievable. Once I got to the end and realized all the time I had wasted, I wished I had grabbed my \\"second chance\\" and put it aside early on.Do yourself a favor. Read another reviewer's comments titled: Spoilers/Time Savers. The author nails all of the ridiculous flaws. This will save you a lot of time and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO SECOND CHANCE","review":"No Second Chance was the second Harlan Coben book that I've read. I gave it four stars, only because in my opinion it was second to Tell No One, but still a darn good read. The who, I thought, was obvious early on, but the why kept me guessing to the end. No Second Chance was a riveting mystery that kept me turning pages, and I look forward to reading more of Harlan Coben's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starting","review":"The book attracted me to buy is fallen on the first sentence. It is attractive and make me want to see the story. It's my first time to have Coben's novel and I think I'll pay attention to his novel again. I lived in Hong Kong and English is not my mother language. However, I'm easily to read the book as Coben uses the simple words to make me more interesting to continue to read the book. Unlike Stephen King, who usually uses a lot of words to describe the situation. The book let me a lot of confidence to read the English book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coben does it again!","review":"Coben does have a formula and his writing at times can be a bit sketchy. But who cares. When a new one comes out I need to clear my schedule! I have to read it in one sitting because I can't put it down. No Second Chance was no exception. It was one fantastic twist after another! It is almost impossible to predict the ending of this book! If you have never read Coben then this is a great book to start with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A One Page Hooker","review":"This book had me hooked after one page. I love this author. I may have burned a thing or two while cooking dinner as I was so engrossed in this book while cooking dinner, my attention was on the word instead of the food. The ending was a little anti climactic compared to the rest of the book, but was a great fun page turner. Wish I had this on my last flight. It would have seemed like minutes. Give me more Harlan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite roller coaster ride","review":"okay. yes i am only twelve. what do i know about suspense and thrillers? Probably not that much right. But this review aimz towards kids my age, kids who want to taste a new genre. First of all i gotta say this Harlan Coben author, has a way of keeping you up at night reading page after page until once u kno it u finished the book. Thats what he did to me haha. Coben has a way of weaving polt twists in and out of the book so Imaginatively,that it left me thinking this has to be as good as it gets. The way he uses these plot twists to make the reader stop and rethink a reasonable theory about what really happened when Marc Seidman and his wife were shot, is amazing. in conclusion this book is like riding the best rollercoaster in six flags, with alot of loops and a good finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to this author's standard and a bad narration to boot","review":"This book-on-tape has a potentially interesting plot, but it is deeply buried beneath two layers of dullness: its lead character and the narrator. The lead character is in the category of teenagers in horror movies, i.e., doing stuff so stupid that you want to yell out to stop them. (E.g., how many times can someone talk to the FBI against their lawyer's clear advice and still be surprised that it doesn't work out? Or is it possible that a young surgeon knows less about DNA than the average TV viewer?) It's so implausible that my disbelief became unsuspended.Moreover the narrator who recorded it settles into an annoying sing-song that leaves all sentences sounding sort of alike and that has little variation from character to character. It's hard to listen to.I miss this author's great lead character, Myron Bolitar (who is funny and smart), but I'll settle for a lot less. This is just not anywhere near satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops: a character glitch","review":"Only a few weeks ago I discovered the author, Coben. I read each new book in less than a day and loved how the characters rang true and believable. Then the woman in this book appeared. Do any of you readers agree with me that there is a loose thread at this book's end that must be attended to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Bad Made-for-TV Movie","review":"I started rolling my eyes after the first 20 pages or so; the constant references to daddy's total infatuation with his sweet little baby made me a little nauseous, like when you eat too much cotton candy. And like every similar book or movie ever made, where a kid gets 'napped, you just KNOW the parent will do any number of stupid moves against police/friends/lawyer [pick one] advice. [YAWN]. I didn't waste any more time at that point; I didn't even bother to read the last chapter. Back to the library.

Glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast-paced but prepare to suspend ALL disbelief","review":"The strength of this novel is that it is an extremely quick read with a compelling plot. Unfortunately it falls prey to one of my biggest pet peeves with thrillers -- the main character does things no one would ever do, just to further the plot. SEMI-SPOILER: This might not be an issue with you if you can imagine a stranger from your past saying \\"you know who shot you, don't you\\" and you responding along the lines of being faintly puzzled and letting them wander out of your house without asking them for a clarification, even though you have no idea who did the deed and the answer to this question could help you unravel the mystery and possibly find your child. Just absurd. The ending makes only slightly more sense, and the author left some pretty thick loose ends just blowing in the wind. It was a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours, but I'm happy I picked it up at a garage sale, and I won't hesitate to send it on its way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Page Turner, but implausible ending","review":"I am on a marathon of Coben's book - I like the ride, his books are hard to put down, they get you caught up quickly. I think this one and Just One Look have one thing in common. They have a lot of bad things happening, including the violence, for not \\"enough of a believable reason\\" if you may. In other words, the means doesn't justify the end. But that is fiction, and he is good at it. You don't know this until the end however, and getting there is mesmerizing, so if you like the ride, then this is for you. There's lots going on and it is not boring.I will still keep reading him. I have liked Tell No One so far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2, but that wasn't an option :-)","review":"What more can I say about Harlan Coben? He is my favorite suspense writer. I read historical fiction usually, but this is my modern day author that I have to throw in once a month because he is so great and the modern who-done-it books are a much needed break in between my lighter fluffier romantic books. However, don't read two Coben books in a row. You need to read one at a time and savor the wonderfully written thrillers. I keep every Coben book I've bought because I just know I'll read them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MAN KNOWS HOW TO KEEP YOU UP ALL NIGHT","review":"I read this book with trepidation. Recently having read my first Harlan Coben book Tell No One and recommending it to everyone, I feared my initial enthusiasm might be in vain. My worry was unfounded. Again Mr. Coben proves he knows how to grab you and not let go until the rollercoaster ride has mercifully ended. What a storyteller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly as Good as Coben's Others","review":"This book simply does not compare to the other Coben books that I have read. The main character is annoying. How many times can one character make reference to the fact that he is a plastic surgeon? The ending is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Friend of Coben","review":"I must be the only person to submit a review not a friend or cousin of the author. The book, truly, is awful. One of the most feckless, feeble efforts at a thriller I've endured in a long while. My best Coben immitation: \\"The book weighed like a rock. The plot moved like a panther. The characters jumped from the page like Carl Lewis.\\" I saw him on \\"Today\\" and bought the book. What a mistake. I should have known. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor ending","review":"I would not recommend this book if you've read 'Gone For Good'. They're both filled with twists and surprises that makes them thrilling and enjoyable. But the ending of this one is a disappointment. I felt that it's Coben's poor shot at trying to make the mystery unravel with a bang. It did not make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is one of the greatest writers of suspense that I have ever read.. His books uses English and not the vulgar street language that most writers are using because they have nothing to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Coben","review":"HC amazes me with in depth knowledge of subject matter.

Has it ever happen to you that you feel something, toward your family, your girlfriend/boyfriend, society, nature, etc. and you just dont know how to put it in words.This contemporary mistery book has action and describes feelings in a way that strikes you and makes you say: This is soooo true! Although you do know is in a fiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering and dull","review":"This book spends way too much time chasing its own tail. The writing is overly expository and bland with characters that don't act up to the things attributed to them. The premise was good, some of the plot points are good, No Second Chance just suffers from lack of passion both in the storyline and in characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Read From Master Storyteller","review":"There haven't been very many books that have made me experience so many emotions at once! This morning I opened this book, and 4 hours later I finished it. This book actually made me cry a couple of times! The main characters are as interesting as Myron Bolitar and friends, and the ending will shock as well as satisfy! Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Thriller","review":"I can't say any more than everyone else has already said except that this was another excellent read by this author. You cannot go wrong with Harlen Coben. If you are fortunate enough to get your hands on this book, enjoy. It is definitely well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan Coban-No Second Chance","review":"Harlan Coben is one of the best writers I have come across. He explains things that make you feel that you are there. He does not use words that you have to look up. His books are exciting and easy to read. This is about the fifth book I had read by him and by far one of the best. If you want to read a book that is hard to put down, I would recommend No Second Chance by Harlan Coben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on the edge of your seat!","review":"This was my second Harlan Coben novel. The first one was The Woods, which I enjoyed very much. No Second Chance is a little \\"busier\\" then The Woods. There are a lot of people to keep track of & quite a lot of twist & turns. This, however, makes for a very exciting story. There are a few spots that are too unbelievable to ignore, and this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather then 5. The characters are all likeable, the plot is interesting, very little if anything is predictable and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Overall, this is a great book & perfect for a summer beach read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beach Read!","review":"This is the second book of Harlan Coben's that I've read. Both have proved to be fast reads that keep you guessing. This one grabs you right out of the gate and doesn't let up until the end. Well written, superbly plotted. A VERY ENJOYABLE READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast \\"whodunit\\"","review":"I'm very picky about my books, and not since Sydney Sheldon's early books have I found an author who has entertained me enough to call myself a loyal fan. I have a very busy life and it usually takes me at least three weeks to finish a book of this size and print, but I finished this one in five days. I found myself carrying it with me constantly - reading it at the airport, at stop lights (bad, I know), in doctor's offices - basiclaly any chance I could find. Its an absolute pageturner that leaves you dying to know who did it. Contrary to some of the other readers comments, I don't think Coben was desparate in the end to wrap it up. Instead, I think he knew from the beginning how and who would be the \\"bad guy\\" in the end - otherwise, how would I have figured out who did it seven chapters from the ending? Don't let me scare you though, I'm really good at solving mysteries. If you haven't bought it already - go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"could not put it down!","review":"Having read and enjoyed several of his books in the past, when I saw this one in the store I picked it up. Once I got home, I started to read and could not put it down until I finished it! A non stop page turner! Terrific twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat.Anytime I see books by Harlan Coban, I will pick them up. I have thoroughly enjoyed every one I have read. They are books I can pass on to friends and family with great pleasure, knowing the will enjoy them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!","review":"My definition of a great book is one that you literally cannot put down, and NO SECOND CHANCE is definitely that! Once you start the book you will not want to stop, luckily I had the chance to read it all in one day. What a blast! Harlan Coben is a great thriller writer. He gives you interesting characters with interesting jobs and then makes wild things happen. I highly recommend this book! Mr. Coben is on his book tour now, see him if you can. He is warm, friendly, and deserves all the accolades he receives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange ending","review":"I do for the most part love Harlan Coben books, and this one kept me entertained and guessing as far as the plot. But, as in Hold Tight, the characters are not believable and they change at the drop of a hat to fit the needs of the plot. The ending, while certainly unexpected, wasn't plausible. I can't figure out why this one and Hold Tight don't read like Harlan Coben books and characters? Two that I didn't like, though, out of so many that I did, means I'll still be reading his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but completely derails at the end","review":"Coben can really write but that makes the disappointment all the worse when he runs off the rails at the end. Many authors can paint themselves into a corner with a complex plot; all you really ask for is a half-way reasonable explanation as they bring it home. No Second Chance ends on a cheap note when Coben changes a character completely just to wrap up the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family Tree Upgrade","review":"I was using the older version and found this version a nice upgrade.

You would think that a movie about hustlers on the streets of Vegas would be gritty and sexy. Well, there's no sex in the movie and the story isn't very gritty, or interesting for that matter. The commentary by the director is kind of nice. Hearing the stories behind the making of this low-budget film is interesting, but his attempt to justify the killing off of the main gay character is flimsy ... I'd only reccomend this movie if you're a DIE HARD fan of Jordan Brower, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, or Darryl Hannah. Otherwise I suggest you skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Speedway Junkie\\" Fine Attempt at a Dangerous Subject","review":"The performances in \\"Speedway Junkie\\" ranged from good to excel-lent. Nothing to complain about there.The story was surprisingly warm for a tale about male prosti-tutes. The relationship between a gay street hustler and a neophyte whose dream is to race stock cars starts with the usualshock and disgust and develops into a caring, trusting friendship. Problems with housing, food, and crime threaten fromevery turn.Not a great film, but an enlightening one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical outcome","review":"I wanted to like this movie. And I did like the actors and the technical aspects, but the story...the story is typical Hollywood.I always ask myself after seeing a movie, \\"what have I gained by watching this movie?' I also asked myself \\"what did the characters gain from living out the story in the movie?\\"My answer to both questions is pretty much the same. Johnny, the boy who wants to be a racecar driver, would have been better off if he never stopped in Las Vegas. Johnny makes it to North Carolina despite the people and experiences of Las Vegas...and that's a miracle. I'm all for new and unusual experiences, but this movie and it's story is best viewed once and forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical inane movie that barely entertains","review":"Skip this movie if you're looking for characters with depth and a film that doesn't delve into the stereotypical \\"young kids hate older guys\\" kind of fare. So much of this movie grated me I found it tough to watch the whole thing. The fact that the ending is predictable doesn't help redeem it in the end. This movie accomplishes nothing and only gets 2 stars because the dialogue between the gay and straight guy was fairly believable. Other than this, this is a can miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche and depressing","review":"So this movie really has little going for it unless you count the features of the male leads. Seriously, most of the situtations and plot points are totally cliche and the ending is uncessarily cruel to gay viewers. The fact that any feelings of love in this drama are not returned by one character make it a film that teases the gay audience and eventually slams them. Best avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?

I wouldn't recommend this and I am sorry that I spent my money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skirting the issue","review":"This is so typical of American film making. Giving the viewer a glimpse into a really horrid world, and then glossing over the subject. Please please if you are the least bit interested in this subject, look at Mandragora instead. I can imagine a teenager looking at this film and thinking its okay to go on the streets, but the reality is so far away.The acting and film making attributes were extremely good, but skirting the issue makes it a flop. My private Idaho was better, but bite the bullet and get Mandragora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses it's mark by a longshot.......","review":"This movie is not that good. There are plenty of reviews that describe perfectly where this movie fails and where it succeeds.Unfortunately; it fails more often than not.There are good performances mixed with bad performances- cliches mixed with some truth- and a weak script with a few high points.Overall, the film just isn't edgy or honest enough. The characters and performances (with the exception of Jordon Brower) just arent fleshed out realistically ...and others are just downright annoying.One review states that this movie should be watched with the directors commentary on. I think I may give that a try....since I've already suffered through the film itself.For everyone else out considering this movie....\\"SpeedWay Junkie\\" is worth passing on more than it is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction or non-fiction. \\"You sure, you sure?\\"","review":"I stayed up past midnight to finish the book.

How strange to feel and see it again through your sharp squid eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Laugh or To Cry?","review":"Never have I read a book that was capable of making me laugh and cry so much in one sitting as Blu's Hanging. As one who reads much literature voraciously, Blu's Hanging gets my highest marks for accurate portayal of the crisis of being humyn. This book is not all rosy and joy, but instead a realistic journey of growing up poor in Hawai'i and the inherent challenges involved. Not for the weak minded, I recommend this book to everyone who wants to be drawn into a world of Hawai'i the touristry industry would rather not have us know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching yet wonderful portrayl of local life in Hilo","review":"Heads by Harry made me cry with homesickness for the beautiful Big Island, \\"local kine\\" food and the sound of pidgin English.

Thank you Ms Yamanaka for presenting life in Hawaii in such an earthy, moving and realistic way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Score, Fantastic Show","review":"Parade did not deserve to close as soon as it did. Fortunately, RCA has released an incredibly well-produced cast recording that really captures the depth and complexity of the show. Buy it NOW. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible!!!!","review":"I recently purchased the recording of PARADE, and several listens later, came to the conclusion, that if there is any justice at all in this world, Jason Robert Brown will win the Tony Award for Best New Musical Score! It is an incredibly powerful score, full of emotion and depth. What a far cry from what Broadway has been subjected to so far this year! I became a huge fan of the composer, Jason Robert Brown, after hearing his score for, SONGS FOR A NEW WORLD. PARADE made me conclude, that he is definitely musical theater's best hope for shows that contain sweeping scores and insightful lyrics. If you haven't purchased this yet - what are you waiting for!!!Best Wishes, Steven"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD TOTALLY ROCKS","review":"I saw the second to last performance of \\"Parade,\\" and I loved it, though the couple sitting next to me who left at intermission certainly didn't. The music is so powerful and moving, and I cannot understand the criticism Brown's score has recieved. If this show definately deserves the Best Score Tony, as well as \\"Best Musical,\\" though I have not seen it's major competition, \\"Fosse.\\" Also, I hope that Brent Carver beats Martin Short for the Actor prize, because Carver's performance was about acting, not stand-up comedy like Short's (though I thought Short was wonderful). Trust me: BY THIS CD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A major new addition to the musical theater. The score (by Jason Robert Brown) is a beauty and the performances are superb. Do not hesitate, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Accessible Work","review":"I will have to disagree with some of the other reviewers who say that this music only works after being listened to numerous times. In fact, unlike many other modern musicals (which I love also but DID have this problem with), the music hit me from the very first time I listened to it, making it only the second show (alongside Les Mis) in which that has ever happened to me. Now it is true that on subsequent listenings you can discover lots of complexity in the music, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and melodic during the first listening. In most of the great musicals of the past, even, we didn't discover all that the music had to offer the first time around (Sweeney Todd comes to mind), but that didn't mean we didn't enjoy it. Parade a wonderful show, and one thing I do agree with other reviewers on is that I'll be waiting eagerly for Brown's next work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At Long Last!!","review":"After seeing the show four times during it's sadly short Broadway run, I was very literally counting down the days until I could own the disc. I threw a little party on the day of it's release...and truly I still consider every listining of this sensational CD to be a celebration of the unparalleled talents of composer Jason Robert Brown, stars Carolee Carmello and Brent Carver and orchestrater Don Sebesky. A very important addition to any true music lovers collection...\\"Pray to Heaven, Pray to Zeus...there's a genius on the loose\\"...and his name is Jason Robert Brown!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Broadway Debut","review":"If you you know Jason Robert Brown it's probably from The Last Five Years or Songs for a New World. What you may not realize is that Parade is his Broadway Debut. Songs was open before this, but not on Broadway. As his debut, this is an amazing piece of work. The music is stunning and powerful, complex but extremely pleasing. The emotion that all of Browns music is able to convey is never missing from this score. The singers are generally good, the story is enjoyable and you don't need a synopsis to get the gist of it. Prince actually approached Brown with the idea for an American Opera, so most of the story takes place on this CD. Brown's Ensemble numbers are as good as the solo heart rippers, and the ever stunning duets (that you will find in ALL his scores.) This is a CD for Brown fans, Broadway collectors, and even older listeners. I strongly suggest you get this CD. Fav Song: \\"It's Hard to Speak My Heart.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry folks, but I didn't like it","review":"Despite all these really enthusiastic reviews by other listeners, I have to admit: I hate Parade! Sorry folks, but that Dixie sound gets on my nerves, really. But I have to admit that I am not quite fond of Sondheim, mentioned by some of you, either. I prefer this classic style like Les Mis etc. or music out of the pop sector (I loved 'A new brain'!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down, Downer, Downest","review":"Two of the best recent new musicals were Ragtime and Passion. Neither were musical comedies. Both were seriously themed, with very few light moments. Both were saved by the immense skill of the composer, lyricist and librettist. Parade was also created by skilled artists, but believe me, Berlin,Kern and Gershwin couldn't brighten up this downer. They say Olivier could read you phone book and make it interesting. He was smart enought to never try. Why intelligent professionals thought they could make a musical out of a lynching is a mystery to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull dull dull","review":"the only thing more painful then listening to this tedious score, was actually sitting in the beaumont. seeing a photo of leo frank had more impact than the two and a half hours spent in the theater. five minutes after seeing it i couldn't recall one note. i think if something is perceived as noble it is said to great. the nasty little secret about this show is that people really didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Broadway scores in years!","review":"Parade, written by a new playwright/songwriter, just 28 years old, is a sophisticated, engrossing recording. The Broadway show, which deals with a sad period in this country's history, received somewhat disappointing reviews, unjustified in this writer's perspective. More importantly, the soundtrack reflects a depth of musical sophistication which other writers of pseudo-operas wish they could achieve. The music is powerful and moving, and warrants careful attention. It grows, rather than becomes tired, with repeated listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful wonderful score","review":"I bought this CD several years ago. I still listen to it today on a regular basis. The score is wonderful, haunting, memorable. One of my all time favorites. Plus, the performers are great. My only complaint is a personal one in that I had tickets to this show but had to give them to friends when a busines trip conflicted with the date. I kick myself that I almost saw this show but never did. The score is a hanuting reminder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parade","review":"An awesome, powerful recording :It brought tears to my eyes and it is devestating in its impact. My only criticism is that the liner notes, of all things , could me more informative since so few of us have had the opportunity to see the actual show. That minor point aside, this is a breath taking piece of theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Great Songs","review":"After several listens of Parade, I became hooked. About 30 or so listenings later, there are some songs I prefer to skip over (I Am Trying to Remember, Big News, Rumblin' and a Rollin' and Blues: Feel the Rain Fall, in particular). Others I prefer to repeat (too numerous to mention, but \\"It Don't Make Sense\\" deserves a special mention - Kirk McDonald is fantastic, I think he's taking the role of Armand in the Scarlet Pimpernel). \\"This is Not Over Yet\\" is also amazing, but I though Brent Carver's performance of it at the Tony's was odd, to say the least (some bizzare body gestures/ movements)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that \\"Parade\\" had passed us by. . .","review":"I bought the CD 3 days after the Tony Awards and falling head over heels for the song \\"This is Not Over Yet.\\" I believe that this has to be the best addition to my cast collection. I could not put the libretto down or turn the CD off. It is so hauntingly beautiful. \\"The Factory Girls/Come on Up to My Office\\" sequence is the most chilling thing I have ever heard. It sends chills down my spine. The Broadway community should be ashamed that such a fime work ever fell through their fingers. Everyone should try something new and \\"Parade\\" is definetly a modern work. I am glad it is going on tour. Hopefully Carolee Carmello will sign my CD booklet when she comes w/ \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" in Aug. to Dallas."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've done better","review":"This album, as it did when it first was released, sounds like everyone involved with it was taking too much Valium. Ron Elliott was a very competent guitarist and writer, but his better writing days were well behind him by the time this album appeared. Sal Valentino's voice became very nasal and lacked inspiration or energy, and that's why the album didn't make it, not because of some injustice by the original issuers, Warner Brothers. It is interesting for fans of the group, and the period, however. It's just not their best work. That happened in 1965...."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The\\" Beau Brummels","review":"Play it to death, in the car and at home.Smooth, would only scratch the surface of this group.

There are only a couple of locales that are used, one is what appears to be somebody's back yard that they made into a dirt jumping course. There's that and some hucking off of the same sort of cliff, a little bit of technical downhill, and alot of urban trials, lots of jumping down stairs.If you want to see a well balanced video, get either the latest in the New World Disorder or Kranked series. This was a bigger disapointment than Star Wars:Episode 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"L-A-M-E, weak, generally not very good","review":"Let's see, a couple of riders in a couple of places doing a couple of things, that about sums it up. All of the different forms of riding seem to be done at the exact same places, there's a dirt jump course in somebody's back yard (I'm not kidding) some guys hucking off of the same sort of cliffs, Evil Dave breaking a dual crown fork after not making a MX-assisted jump, and the most promising part is camera work on a technical downhill section, but the camera moves away instead of with the riders so the effect seems wasted.This movie (unless you just LOVE urban trials) is a definate DO NOT buy. The music is sub par, riding is the same thing over and over, one shot is a jump normal speed, the next shot (no, I'm not kidding) is the same jump in slow motion. Krispy needs to give these guys the slip because he's more talented than this movie shows.Fat Tire Fury is still my favorite MTB movie, best riding, best locations, best music."},{"rating":"2","title":"still high up there","review":"another jewel is coming out under the tekbilek music jem factory. this time its a bit more pensive you need a bit more patience very much fun to listen - however i miss the golden touch of Ara Dinkjian"},{"rating":"2","title":"The music is lovely","review":"I heard this cd in a coffee house some time ago and enjoyed it so much, I asked the waitress the name of the artist.

He makes music that is so wonderful to anyone to listen regardless from what region in the world the listener from. Unfortunately, this CD contains too many songs with lyrics. I enjoy the sound of relaxing and touching music, but when I hear lyrics that I don't understand, I try to ignore or just skip it. This CD I ended up listening to one piece only over and over \\"One Truth\\". It does have lyric, but in English and it is worth buying the CD.

This cable was intended to connect an extra HDMI input to the receiver (very infrequent). It has now died completely after about 8 months of negligible use.

Well it has good graphics and resolution. I didn't think I would think much about it when I got one butfrankly when I turned it on I though,\\"Hey this thing really looks great, it has great resolution for such a small screen.\\" It only has one major problem.

Fuchsia was an interesting choice for Nintendo, in which to produce a system. No little boy wanted the Fuchsia one, and the little girls were hesitant as well. However, when all the other colors were bought out, this was an attractive option to the kids who wanted a GBA right then.It's not a bad color, and some people love pink. Buy this for those people.

The Game Boy line now has thousands of titles and peripherals to choose from thanks to the new Game Boy Advance! (Failing record sound) Where is the extensive classic library and low priced peripherals? Nothing is low priced these days! Where are the innovative classics? On the top shelf at K-Mart. The GBA is a console out of reach for many and for others not intriguing enough. It is good for expanding your Game Boy selection and peripheral library but come on now.

When I bought the CD, I was speechless to say something about it. \\"Ave Satani\\" is without any doubt the most frightening music I ever heard! Just to think of this music makes me horripilate to death. And indeed, after my first listening experience with the soundtrack, I wasn't brave enough to listen to it again for a long time.

Also the squeaky thing is hard for even me to press. My 8 month old liked the spinning flower though, if it is the only toy around.On the older side there are much better activities. He is enjoying those more, but the pop-up feature won't work. It does not stay closed. If I do get it to close, just touch it and it pops up--you are supposed to learn to press the button. I found this toy in a local baby store after buying it, and 8 of 10 had the same problem.

It has been interesting to see him prefer different activities on the center as he has grown.

The only concern I had with this toy was the two small yellow plastic loopholes on the bottom of the toy. While flipping it over, hung or not on his pack and play, one of my son's fingers would get stuck in the hole and he could not figure how to remove it - tight fit. He would then panic and bend his finger back, causing him to cry out in pain or distress. I removed the loops and filed them down so this would not happen again. Not sure why they are there.

I would like to see the clamp be quickly moved from one hole to the next simply by pulling a release on the bottom of the clamp (instead of an awkward cotter pin) and using a large flange that slides over brackets that were previously attached to the underside of the work surface.

My 4 1/2 year old came to me screaming while holding his pinched finger. I did not know what he meant when he said his toy hurt him until I pressed the gargoyle recoil button. It was then that the excessive recoil action caused the clasp on the end of the cable to pop me on my fingertip. Since it was painful to me I know it would be painful to a youngster. If the action figure is not attached to the end of the cable, there is a dangerous whipping action from the rapid recoil. As my son and then I found out this whipping action can be painful, but perhaps more of a concern would be a serious injury that could happen if this occured to close to the face. This is probably the only concern with an otherwise fun toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible poses","review":"This figure has incredible detail and is excellent to pose.

Don't subject us to this crap.The story is decent, though crapping out at the end, especially in the resolution with the Vong and the cop-out save from Sekot.

The second is 39 seconds long and sounds more like a clip from some longer song. I don't understand all the great reviews Mule Variations has received. There are a couple of amusing tracks, but they lack originallity. In my personal opinion, the best thing about this album is it's cool Dave-McKean-esque artwork (which again lacks originallity as it is mimicing the style of another artist) I recommend Mule Variations only to curious fans and this import should be purchased exclusively by those obsessive completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"AFTER MANY YEARS OF SMOKING AND DRINKING, THE AFFECTS ARE SO CLEAR THRU THE PASSAGE OF TIME, TOM HAS LOST HIS VOICE.

After two months it stopped completely. I sent it back for warranty (which cost me the price of shipping plus a ridiculous $25 for them to ship it back to me.) Two months later they returned the watch to me, saying the second hand had been stuck but now was fixed. Sure enough the second hand works now, but only intermittently. The watch doesn't keep time - it loses an hour or two each day. I called Invicta again and they want me to ship it back to them a second time at my expense. The quality of the watch is quite low & the customer service only slightly better. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this watch even though it is pretty.

The only things that really bother me about this CD are the fact that there is no piano (although that does lend clarity to the bass, as it is sometimes swallowed up in the left hand of the piano) and the trumpet player who appears throughout the album. His efforts do nothing to really add to the music, and it seems he is just mimicking mr. coffin most of the time. Also worth noting in this CD are the tracks where he doubles (plays two saxes at the same time, not overdubbed) this isn't done much, but it does provide an interesting effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"bed cover","review":"Looks great,and was easy to put on.would buy from this seller again thank you somuch.I bought it for my grandsons 16th birthday he got a pickup to larn to drive in.he like the cover a lot.I love shopping at amazom.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so amazing art duffle bag","review":"It would appear from the picture of the \\"amazing art duffle bag\\" that it is chock full of fun art supplies.

People with low hand strength or hand pain can use the trigger ratchet used for the adjustment with ease. It only requires a firm squeeze just over the pressure used for scissors."},{"rating":"2","title":"An IMMENSELY long read...but oh, WHAT a read!","review":"I will agree with some of the previous reviewers, in that this book dealt almost exclusively with the negative side of the human experience (and in some cases that's putting it mildly). But Ms. Morris knows how to write, and does a superb job here. She never failed to hold my interest - though the plot started to sag a little bit at the end.The dialog was a bit stilted, and some of the characters (mostly the secondary ones) were a bit unbelievable (Sam Fermoyle's shrink at the institute, for one) - and does anyone actually KNOW someone who says \\"Yah\\" instead of \\"Yeah\\"? But at the end, it does seem as though the Fermoyles are starting to turn the corner - and I wish them all the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be a masochist to read this book","review":"The title made it seem so promising but it was not to be. If you like reading long, monotanous, novels with many characters (all lacking character)this is the book for you. If you have about six months to waste on a story that not only never really goes anywhere and is not resolved in the end, this is the book for you. If you have some other book you have struggled to get through and want to finish it, this is the book for you because once you pick it up and read anything else will seem good, possibly great. There are 740 pages of complete torture. You keep expecting it to get interesting but it never does. I still can't figure out how or why I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah's book club gone wrong","review":"I finished this book for the sole reason of lack of anything better. I found myself skipping over large chunks that simply weren't worth it, opting for sleep instead.

I couldn't stand any of the characters, and for me, that is the most important part of enjoying a book.

Seriously, I went into a major funk for the two days I was reading it. I suppose it's well written??? That seems to be the majority opinion.

Read this only if you have a great need to fall into a major depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a \\"love it or hate it\\" book","review":"Songs in Ordinary Time isn't a hard read because it's long or unique or sophisticated or suited only for highly literate tastes. It's a hard read because there are too many characters and points of view, some of the story lines go nowhere, and all of the characters continue to make bad choices throughout the novel with no sign of enlightenment or hope of redemption. If you're a reader who likes unmitigated dysfunctionality painted on a large canvas, you'll love this book. If you're a reader who wants to root for the characters or rejoice in them learning from their mistakes, you'll hate this book. I'm in the \\"hate it\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of the most forgetable characters I have ever met.","review":"I am advising all my friends not to read this book. Every character is pathetic. Every situation is hopeless. Who would ever want to meet or be interested in a person like Marie Fermoyle? Omar Duvall is truly a villain, but it shouldn't have taken 740 pages to tell us that. Ms. Morris' writing is not extraordinary in any way. There were many many scenes that could have been deleted from the story and never missed. I wished I had never started to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put This Book Down","review":"Now I know the fuss Oprah made about this book. When is the soap going to come?

It's a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, unpleasant book without a redeeming character","review":"Eight of us in a book club hated the book. The writing rambled, and the story didn't really go anywhere. Book was overlong. The hardest part of reading 700 or so pages was there was no redeeming character among the many described and the story was boring. If it weren't for Oprah recommending it, we doubt this book would have been noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, quiet Vermont town filled with characters worthy of it","review":"Slow, dull-witted plot woven around a group of characters that can only be described as pathetic. It isn't that the story is bad, but that the story meanders like cold molasses and for what seems like an eternity. The stock characters include a pathetic woman, acon-man, a lust-tainted catholic priest, a small town, poor black victims of murder. Trite and unconvincing not a novel worthy of all the hooplah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I am an avid reader and I just loved this book - it was hard to put it down in order to work all day. I found myself daydreaming about the characters during the day- they seemed so real to me. It bothers me that so many are describing the characters as unlikable - Yes maybe Omar is but the rest seemed so real to life and I felt empathy toward all of them and their struggles. Growing up as the daughter of an alcoholic father and single mother myself the book just resonated so deeply. I appreciated the authors showing these characters flaws and all, as opposed to these glamorized portraits we get in todays politically correct world. I am sure I will be thinking of these characters for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it no stars!!!","review":"When I was choosing a book to drive cross country with, I picked up this book thinking - it's long, the synopsis showed potential and Oprah thought it was good. It was the only disappointing aspect of my trip! It was an easy read - fairly interesting characters and evoked disgust and utter frustration at Marie's unwillingness to see what Omar really was. The reason this book was so awful was the ending - or rather the lack of an ending. I truly thought that a chapter had been left out of my book. It almost as if the author got tired of writing and just sent the book off to the publisher with out finishing it. I would have liked to see some sort of resolution or closure, but there was none! I am disappointed that I spent so much time and money on this book and my mission is to make sure no one else does the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was ready to put this down after 150 pages because it was SO depressing, but I stuck it out on principle. After about 350 pages I decided to finish it just because I already had so much time invested in it, and I was curious to see how all the plots would come out in the end. Well, nothing was tied up neatly. I was hoping for at least one of these sorry characters to have an uplifting experience, but alas it was not to be. This was the first book I have read by this author, and I believe it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I have never before read about such a bunch of misfits in my life. The characters were so outrageous, not even close to anyone I could relate to. I think Oprah needs to look into more upbeat readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a new editor at Penguin!","review":"Although this book has a few good moments, they are unfortunately few and far between. One problem: the sense of time. It reads as if she just wrote it in \\"any time\\" and then decided (with the help of her editor?) to set it in 1960. As a result, most of the story reads as if it's anytime, except that every now and then Morris waves a little \\"1960 flag\\"--like mentioning a particular song on the radio or putting someone's bank book in the typewriter to enter a new balance. Very distracting! Also I believe that she truly WANTS us to feel compassion for her characters, but there are simply too many in this book--resulting in half-baked portraits of many people rather than fully presented characters whose motivations we can understand and appreciate. These are problems that should have been cleaned up by a talented editor at Penguin. Too bad she didn't have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in Ordinary Time lacks plot","review":"After reading Morris' \\"Songs In Ordinary Time\\" I was greatly disappointed. The book didn't go anywhere. Nothing happened. The story line was bland and incredibly unexciting. The novel just seemed to have no plot. I do not reccommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"an annoying chore.","review":"I have for the most part stayed away from Oprah's book club selections. I have found in general that the story lines are as follows....I was raped, I was poor, I was raped again and then somebody died. I decided to ignore my instincts and gave Songs in Ordinary Time a go. This book should be re-titled \\"All the Things That Could Go Wrong In a Small Town For 800 Pages\\" This book was relentless almost to the point of being humorous. There was no pinnacle, no point and then the book was done. I suppose life is often that way too.....so if you live a life of miserable and quiet desparation and you would like a little more of the same read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"First, as a native, there is nothing more irritating than reading (or hearing) what is purported to be a central Vermont accent. In as much as Ms. Morris lives in Massachusetts, she ought to know there are more than a dozen spoken dialects in New England. Not one of them 'sounds' anything like what she's written.Second, as a reader, one shouldn't have to spend the first 40 pages of a novel writing down twenty-plus characters' names and relationship in order to follow the storyline. Then again, it would be a gross exaggeration to say there is a storyline in the first 100 pages.Speaking of names, what the heck is with the odd names? First names: Jarden, Jozia, Grondine, Astrid, Renie, Omar, Laydee- in VERMONT?! Puh-leez...I only wish this novel had a hole drilled through it so I could hang it next to the commode with the almanac. Instead, it's headed to the kindling box so as not to inflict another reader with rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"long, depressing, ultimately disappointing","review":"I was almost heartened by the many bad reader reviews I saw on this webpage, if only because it confirmed that I did not miss something in the story. And you will probably not be missing much either if you pass on this book. I ploughed my way through 700 pages figuring I would be rewarded with some sort of redemption for the characters at the end. Instead, it meandered off much as it had throughout the length of the novel. If you are up for a long read with complex characters and interwoven stories, I would suggest Kate Atkinson instead. Her characters are often equally flawed, but the humor and drama makes for a rewarding read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted many hours reading this book!","review":"I bought this book because it was in Oprah's book club. Waste of my time and money. I should have read the reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snow-covered dung heap","review":"Mrs. Morris is undeniably a fine writer; one wonders why she squanders her talent on such a convoluted, squalid, unbelievable story. The characters became caricatures as they smash up against one crisis after another, intersecting each other's lives in confusing, random and often depraved ways. I wanted to shower after each bout with it. A deeply unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst written books I've ever attempted.","review":"\\"It was a dark and stormy night\\". If Morris had written that line it would have been more like:\\"During the winter soltice a memory flooded back from his miserable childhood in which the evening was damply cold, unsettlingly gloomy, with wind-shattering, rain-driven clouds darkening the stormy night.\\"At least 50% of this book could have been eliminated and the descriptive phrases would have still been overbearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing!","review":"If you're considering reading this book, don't be misled--1 star is as low a rating as is allowed for these reviewsIf you're looking for entertainment, this book isn't it.

I was finding myself relieved to get away from Marie Fermoyle every once in awhile, just to get involved with someone else with depressing problems. There was not one light-hearted, nice, smiling character without huge personality flaws. It was quite unnerving at points. It was definitely not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proves that well-written books can be awful, too.","review":"I felt like I lived in the slough of despair while I was reading this dreadful book. If it had not been my next book group book, I would not have read past the scene with the 30-hours-dead judge in the chair at the boarding house. What was the point of that scene? It certainly wasn't something that would happen in \\"ordinary time,\\" and I can't believe that kind of thing is customary in small towns, or towns of any size. The people involved turned out to be very minor characters. It was there just for the shock value. At the beginning of the book, the author could have said, \\"All of the people in this town have led, lead, and will always lead miserable, depressing, horrible lives,\\" and made the book 500 pages shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a total waste of time.","review":"The most disfunctional people, family,town I have ever read about.

The characters went nowhere, the writing was substandard and displayed neither creativity nor imagery; sure it was a semi-interesting story, but I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This was by far the worst book I have ever read. I kept reading because I figured it couldn't get any worse--but it did. It was depressing, and the skipping around of story lines made it hard to get into. I forced myself to continue figuring something good had to happen to somebody at some point--and it didn't. I'm sorry I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help! Save me!","review":"Often I enjoy reading off-the-wall tales of off-the-wall people leading off-the-wall lives. I did not enjoy reading this book. The characters are ALL so unrelentingly neurotic/psychotic that by page 400 I couldn't stand to read another word about them and thankfully gave myself permission to quit reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"I just think that you can spend your time reading other books that are better written, more enticing, smarter and much more moving. I was simply bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who could possibly care about these characters?","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a book. Never! The characters evoked no interest -- I didn't like them or hate them. They were just there. I read through the first few chapters, became exceedingly bored, and then read the last few chapters. After doing so, I was extremely grateful I did not waste any time reading the hundreds of pages in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!","review":"I started reading this book two months ago...and I am not a slow reader. Disgusted, I would put it down and not be able to return to it for weeks at a time. The characters are remarkably uninteresting and truly pathetic at the same time. I finished it yesterday because I am so compulsive that I couldn't just throw it in the trash can, but I will have to rethink that now!!!! This was 740 pages of good reading wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been 300 pages shorter...","review":"I really trust Oprah's taste in books but I think she sorely missed on this one. (Badly enough that I'm taking time warn others in this review). I felt as if I'd read this story in some other grade B book or movie along the way. I plugged along right until the book's end, hoping it would get better but it never did. It was very hard to feel any sympathy for Marie Fermoyle who was simply pathetic. The characters were exaggerated and cartoonish in their words and actions. I felt insulted by them. Save yourself 700+ pages of agony and read something (just about anything) else. I don't think there was one character in the book who was realistic enough to like. I was sorry I used so much time trying to get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I like fat books, and the description on the back led me to believe that this one would keep me guessing. The only thing I kept trying to figure out was why I was still reading it. This book depressed me. I like books about small towns, and although this was a very realistic small town, there was no real depth to the book. It was just 700 pages of bad attitudes, false hopes and bitterness. Not the kind of book you want to dedicate a lot of time to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Snoozer","review":"This book was very difficult to keep my interest. Aside from it being a depressing story, it had too many characters. I often found it difficult to keep track of who was who. This book was not the worst I've ever read, but it did not keep my attention. I usually like to finish a book once I begin reading it, but this book I had to put down. It was more like a bedtime story opposed to an interesting read. I definitely would not recommewnd this book to others. Honestly, I have read other Oprah's book club picks and this is the first one I did not like at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book took forever to read, but I kept reading because I thought for sure there would be some resolution, somewhere, for someone. No such luck. Every time you thought maybe somebody was about to wise up, slam, they hit the floor again. Depressing, gratuitously so. Disfunction for its own sake. And for 740 pages. There are millions of better books. Read one of them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"This book was a terrible disappointment. It's decidedly anti-Catholic bent made for a disturbing read. I've lost a lot of respect for the judgement of Oprah, or those who select the books for her club, in this selection. I've not been entirely impressed by all the club's selections but this one was particularly poor. The gross descriptions and disfunctional characters weren't worth the time it took to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't like the characters, you won't like the book","review":"Although very well written, and so compelling I couldn't give up on it, there's not one likeable person in this book! They're all whiners and users and the most sympathetic character is the chief of police who is having an affair with the sister-in-law of his dying wife ... and it goes downhill from there. DEPRESSING!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and wonderful.....Rich and rewarding","review":"Having grown up in a small town, I felt as though I had returned for a heartwarming visit with characters still so vivid in my own mind and events not unlike those experienced in that summer of 1960!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dysfunction defined","review":"I enjoyed the book very much, the 740 pages went by quickly, there were a few too many characters and some events that had no apparent explanation then never heard of again. (the judges murder) I have to agree with some that the ending was not consistent with the rest of the book. I wonder if Marie learned anything from the experience or if she's not waiting for the next flim-flam man to come around to improve her denial skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time!","review":"There just wasn't much point to this book...it goes on and on and on, leaving the reader wondering where it's taking you and what's the point. It's incredibly depressing with NO characters who are people to admire or aspire to...I didn't like any of the people in the book and the mother, the central character, is the worst. Don't waste your time, there are plenty of better books to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in ordinary time took too much of my time","review":"The story was totally unbelievable with the characters shown as being gullible and weak. The beginning of the book was confusing with too many characters being introduced too soon. But once you finally figured out who was who you wanted to forget them. Definately a must miss in my book"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good!","review":"This was a looooooooong, torturous read. I am a funny gal...rarely will I not finish a book, even a bad one. This was a another depressing depiction of very low IQ family at the mercy of the \\"flim-flam man\\". Someone needs to tell Oprah's Book Club that a good story does not have to be depressing nor does it have to be about stupid or ignorant people. This was a true ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult Read","review":"I found this book a very difficult read. It was interesting only in the beginning, but as you went on and discovered more and more characters and plots it became difficult to follow, uninteresting and depressing. I kept hoping for the mother to redeem herself with her children as she kept begging forgiveness from God each time she harrassed and mentally abused them. This redemption never came and it was very disappointing. Omar Duvall was shallow and easy to see through and although all of the characters repeatedly realized this, they never made a move. Not worth the effort of wading through such a long book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is a NY Times Best-Seller???","review":"I am disappointed, to say the list, that this book reached the NY Times best-seller list and has maintained a #1 position for as long as it has. It is a slow-moving, boring, overly-long book centered around a group of very shallow people. Couldn't this have been done in a LOT fewer pages?The only reason that I made it to the end was because I was reading it while riding in a car, without another book in sight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It goes on & on & on-- & FINALLY it ends-honestly.","review":"This book doesn't hold a candle to Map of the World by Jane Hamilton, another Oprah recommendation. It is WAY too filled with unimportant details in a writing style that certainly is very easy to read but offers NOTHING noteworthy in it's style. Evil man comes into town and walks over people one by one, over and over and over again, ad nauseum. Is it actually possible that ALL these Vermonters were this naive back in the '50\\"s? I hardly think so, or they must have started adding IQ's to our water supply over the past 20- 30 years. Why did I read to the end? Good question. I guess cuz I paid good money for the book so I wanted to find something redeaming about it. Also I kept thinking maybe it would finally GO some place. which it didn't, although the last 100 pages are a bit more substantive, plot-wise. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY LONG AND SLOW READ!","review":"I'm glad to see that so many readers find this book as slow and unmoving as I do. I can honestly say that I don't like one character in the story. I have been reading this book for almost six weeks now and I am on the verge of putting it down once and for all! I hate not finishing a book, but based on the other reviews that I have read, it sounds as if it might not be worth it. Every time I read it, I find myself disgusted with at least one of them: Marie, Sam, Father Gannon, Omar. I feel sorry for the other half; I can't decide who is most pathetic: Renie, Alice, Benjy, Haddad.The list goes on. I wish I could understand why the author felt this was a story worth writing. I have yet to feel close to or empathize with any of the characters. I cannot wait to be finished and move on to a more satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever!","review":"As I lurched through all 600-plus pages I kept hoping any of the characters would at least have one good day! I got tired of the characters expressing themselves mostly in gasps, moans, cries, or hysterical laughter. They seemed always on the verge of complete breakdowns, even when situations didn't warrant that behavior. The story would have been more believable and the characters more real if at least some of them had less hysterical reactions to everything. There were too many characters in the book, and as one reviewer noted, most of them were not developed enough; the reader often was left dangling about their motivations, personalities, and especially their fates. I suppose the author was going for a \\"real life\\" feel in the book, but if that is real life, let me fall on my sword! This is a terrible book and I'm annoyed at the time wasted reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a long draw out story with no ending","review":"I had a hard time remembering each charactor, and was always waiting for something to happen, but nothing, there were so many open ends at the end of this book, I felt cheated of my time. I only continued to read this book because I wanted something good to happen to anyone in the book. What a waste of time, the only good thing I can say is at least I didn't pay for the book. AWFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, I couldn't put it down!!","review":"Although the book was long and there were a lot of characters to remember I really enjoyed it. It was about real life and real people. The characters were believable and interesting. The introduction of the antagonist Omar Duvall made the book even more interesting than I had anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one likable character in the entire book","review":"This book really annoyed me. I am normally not bothered by long books, but this one seemed like it went on forever. None of the characters had redeeming traits - who were the protagonists supposed to be? Certainly not ignorant Marie - even her own kids could see she was being swindled. Worse yet, none of these pathetic characters seemed to learn anything from their mistakes. I kept hoping it would get better; it didn't. Seems like Oprah is making some pretty poor book choices lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyday life","review":"a book filled with numerous intriguing characters, who make up a town. story of a proud single mother's struggle to keep her family together, and find her own happiness. at the end, there are no rose gardens, no magical ending, just ordinary life of a family."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story didn't need to be told in over 700 pages.","review":"The reading group I belong to chose this book and most of us really disliked it. The characters are not interesting enough to merit 700+ pages. The ending was disappointing - it ended because at some point it had to. Lame. Negative story without interesting characters. We all agreed - why? A waste of paper in my opinion.Lisa in Philly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Read","review":"This was the longest, least redeaming book I've ever read. I couldn't believe Oprah liked it and recommended it. It made me question ever reading another of her suggestions. Don't bother is my best advice. I also believe in finishing a book and had high hopes it would get better. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The action and intrigue in this book, like the words of its evil character Omar Duvall, are just promises. The reader is set up again and again expecting a worthwhile resolution and continuously disappointed. As such, after spending weeks with these miserable, self-denying townsfolk, the \\"happy\\" ending offered in not believable - it is incongruous with the author's 700 pages of character development. Skip this book and avoid the feelings of disappointment so well illustrated through the characters in Songs in Ordinary Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Long, Long","review":"I have a policy to always finish a book once I start it. This book was almost enough to make me break my policy. After 800 odd pages I could not have cared less what happened to any one of these characters. The book was not at all gripping at any point and I plodded through each page. Another book like this and I will seriously reconsider my book reading policy as this one never came up with one redeeming quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs In Ordinary Time","review":"This book was indeed hard to get into, but once I figured it out, it went more smoothly. I read this book in about a week because I have lots of free time. Why did I read it so fast? Was it enjoyable? No, no, and no again. I didn't like the book because it was a story of a family who I wouldn't want to know, living in a place I wouldn't want to visit, doing things I didn't care about. By the time I was about 1/3 of the way into the book I started disliking it. The author uses so many words to get to the point it becomes rather tiring. Towards the end, I would skip lines just to get to the point of that \\"chapter\\". This was the first of Oprah's book selections that I didn't like at all. The reason I read it to the end? I thought it would get better. It didn't"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary McGarry Morris' best book!","review":"If you like real characters and situations and a story that pierces the heart, you will love Songs in Ordinary Time. The characters range from an evil con-man, Omar, to the three vulnerable children of a single hardworking mom, Marie Fermoyle, who is rapidly falling for his smooth talk and deception. Her only hope is her teenage son who seems to be the only person to see through this man of lies.The cast of characters also include a wayward priest, a brother and sister who are simple believers and the father (husband of Marie) of the three children who is also the town drunk.Incredible to me were the manipulations of Omar, a sociopath and murderer who knows no shame. Also interesting is the mind of an idealistic priest who rationalizes his involvement with a 17-year-old girl. It is a big book (700+ pages) but I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"748 looooooooooong pages","review":"A co-worker, when she saw this book laying on my desk, told me to keep at it, \\"it eventually gets good,\\" she said. She lied. She suggested, when I finally got to page 300, that I skim. I read a paragraph of each page and finally got through it. I never connected with the characters, except maybe for Benji, the youngest child of Marie, a psycho mother who blames everyone but herself for her pathetic life. It centers around a scam artist murderer who charms his way into Marie's life and Benji who knows the man's secret but won't risk his mother's happiness to tell her what he knows. Save your time and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I've ever read","review":"We read this for our book club and it was voted the book we would most like to burn. Which we are actually considering for the torture it put us though. (There was, in all honesty, one person who liked it.) If you want to be totally depressed I would highly recommend this book. The characters, especially the mother, were pitiful stupid creatures. If some of them had died in the end I would have felt a little better about it. I love to read and this is the first book that I have ever read where I literally hated reading every page. I can't wait for the bonfire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unmemorable","review":"I read this book about a year ago...it was the next pick on the Oprah list and was raved about so heartily I figured it must be great! Then I got the book and struggled through it praying it would get better but it never did and by the end of the book I was sure I had ordered the totally wrong book, but no. It was the right book, just not the right book for me. I just didn't get it and never warmed up to any of the characters. I cannot imagine why it was rated so highly by Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Seven hundred and fourty (yes 740) of the most painful pages that I've ever read. I only finished it because I believed that something-anything good HAD to happen to someone in this book. The end (if you can call it that) was completely unsatisfying. Morris is a good writer but she created not a single character (and there were a lot of them) in this book that I cared about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was not planning to review this book as I am still trying to make my way through it (I am approximately 3/4's of the way through it and am determined to finish) however, I was reading through the other reviews and saw several which said that the people who don't like this book only want \\"happy\\" books and don't enjoy good literature, etc. I feel compelled to say that while it is a dark and gloomy book, the real problem is that it is boring. It fails to hold your attention. I started this book in the middle of October and have had to force myself to read it. It is taking forever. This book is the story of a mean, dysfunctional mother who can't be nice to her own children (for their own good, of course) and yet seems to be blindingly trusting of the only con man in town. None of the characters are likeable, including most of the children. Do yourself a favor, don't read this book. While the story seems to have potential, it's just not worth the effort it takes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing/Sad/Depressing","review":"I was so pleased to read other reviews of this novel that echoed my own opinions, formed while reading -- and ultimately throwing -- the book. While I understand the importance of the \\"shared human experience\\" this is not the type of story I want to read in the few precious quiet-time moments I have for reading. Where is entertainment, laughter, joy in this book? Marie may be strong but her life of unremitting disappointments and struggle and screaming at her children (what is that about?) is not what makes me happy to belong to the family of man. Sorry I agree with another reviewer who said this may be my last Oprah recommended read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"I cannot believe that I actually finished this book. I will admit that it was somewhat well written, or I would not have gotten to the third chapter. The characters were so annoying. I could not relate to them, nor did I even want to get to know them. I just kept thinking that the book HAD to get better, and I am sad that I was so wrong"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in Ordinary Time","review":"This is not a great book by any means; the characters have very few redeeming qualities and for the most part you don't really like them. But, strangely, I was drawn to finish this book to see what happened. I could not read it for very long without having to put it down, though, because the characters and their existences are so depressing. I was especially disturbed by the mother, Alice, who can't seem to see that her troubles are of her own making, and who psychologically and verbally abuses her children. The whole Presto Soap scam was so implausible that I felt certain that Morris must have had some other intention in dragging it on for so long. You kept hoping that Alice would get some sense and finally see what was going on. Her youngest son, Benjy most depicted the result of Alice's psychological and verbal abuse on the children; very scary. All in all, I have to say that it was a fascinatingly disturbing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I just saw all these reviews and I must say that I am very happy to see that I am NOT the only one who thought the book was/and still is (I haven't finished it yet) a boring, depressing read. For the past couple of years, I've picked up the book over and over again, just to make it only to page 120. I've come to realize that about 120 pages is all I can take on reading about other peoples' depressing lives. Maybe one day I'll finish it.........probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely terrific novel","review":"I can't get over how much this book enveloped me!

Am lending it to friends (with the proviso they return it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs in Ordinary Time","review":"I find myself joining the horde of readers following Oprah's recommendations [I just loved Stones From The River].Songs in Ordinary Time drew me in to the Fermoyle family saga and their quest for an identity they could triumph over, and then it left me flat with its unclimactic ending. I don't expect every book to discard the black cloud of despair and reveal a glimmer of hope at its conclusion, but for me Ms. Morris built a staircase of hope, false as it might have been and stunted me with the reality that not all things in life are stitched at the seams with a silver lining. I personally am not used to books leaving me feeling empty and sad, though I now realize this was Ms. Morris' subliminal intention [thanks to Cardinal15's astute review]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible waste of time","review":"This book is one of the worst I've ever read. Somehow the storyline does not hang together so the reader is compelled to finish this very long, surprisingly dull book. Do yourself a favor, read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"740 pages of despair","review":"Almost every character in this book is unlikeable, unbelievable, and leads a life of unremitting misery, to no end. Morris gratuitously gives even her most minor characters sickening motives and gross stupidity. Morris writes well, but her vision of reality is badly flawed. The book is a mess, so depressing that, thank God, by the end it's almost laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"the unfinished novel","review":"No this book did not leave off unfinished, well it may have, I'll never know since I cannot bring myself to pick it up again and I'm only about halfway through it. One reviewer said if you could stick it out through the first 150 pages you'd be glad, but I felt that reaching that point did not signify any speeding up of the story after it's sloooow start. The only reason I stuck it out as long as I did was due to a lack of anything else to read at the time, but since I have replenished my reading materials, I feel no need to continue further. This book is miserable and stays that way. I can't imagine even wanting to see a happy ending for it, as the characters being so miserable themselves make them very unlikeable for me. I like escaping into the lives of ordinary people, but not to become miserable, I need no book to do that. If you're looking for something along those lines try Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, but avoid this book if, well, just avoid it really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh....","review":"I only managed to get about a chapter and a half into this book. I set it down to answer the hpone, and never bothered to pick it back up. It just didn't grab me, I didn't care about any of the characters enough to want to read any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, long, boring, and awfully long and boring","review":"Probably the worst book I've read since in a very long time. No ending, no characters to care about, everything is negative, sad, sorry or dead. Too many loose ends for too many characters with no connection to the story (Joey? The judge? Why?) Lord save me from any more of Oprah's book club choices. And 740 pages? Why? Why on earth? All I can ask is why? Why did I read it? Why did I waste my time? I could've written my OWN book in the time it took to read and get over this abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one more disappointed reader","review":"I cannot recommend this book to anyone. I didn't like a single character. At best the characters are weak and pathetic; at worst, they're vile. I kept hoping that someone in the book would grow into a person I could admire. By the end, none of the characters has grown. They're all still pathetic people that I would never want to know in real life. This book was a thorough waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best description is zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.","review":"I admit, I read to escape, I read for entertainment. Oprah's books are full of the most dysfunctional people ever. Such depressing charactors. Songs just adds to her litany of boring, depressing stories full of dysfunctional people. I never thought it would end, but was glad when it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book so much!","review":"Regardless of your viewpoint or whether you liked the characters, this book is so full of true-life scenes that it reads like a memoir. Although I hated the mother at times, I found that I could relate to many things that she did, despising her and myself at the same time while reading it. The kids were so dysfunctional but so average that you had to love them. The father was pathetic but you cheered for him throughout. This is the believable story of a dysfunctional family who lived their lives as best they could at the time - with the tools they had. How can you not love that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life struggles make for good reads","review":"Life isn't alway easy and there are probably lots more people struggling through it than there are those who are sailing smoothly from day to day. Mary McGarry Morris's books are about struggling through life. Some of her stories are about struggles more difficult than one could imagine, but Songs in Ordinary Time had such a ring of truth for the time and place that I could not put it down. Her prose is easy to read; smooth and well written. The story has a good plot, is believable and, holds your attention. I've always found Morris's books a good read. Songs in Ordinary Time was my first read of Morris's books and I keep looking for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read with a dry sense of humor","review":"This book is not one to spell it all out to you. There is such hidden humor in it you don't even see it, however there are some parts of the book that leave you speechless. You can't help but to relate to Marie and her family at different times of the book. I have read this book several times and love it more and more each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in Ordinary Time -A long dreary book","review":"I devoted a week to reading the 740 pages of this book. I can't remember when I was more disappointed by an author particularty one selected by Oprah's book club. The book is without a character with redeeming qualities and filled with despair and self pitying adults who continue theit self-destructive bahaviors without acknowledging them . Even the children fail to engender any sympathy or much pity. The few characters the reader has some hopeful feelings for ( Sam,Blue,Norm) are left incomplete by the author. Mary McGarry Morris has written a depressing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"read something worth while","review":"The saddest part of this book was that it could have been a pretty good story if the writer just stuck with the Fermoyle clan. Although they were pathetic enough, I think their lives and struggles were pretty realistic. I wish the writer would have elaborated more on them, and then skipped the other stupid, boring, pointless characters and storylines. The ending left too many loose ends and too little resolve. Besides that, the book was incredibly boring and hard to follow. Again, this was due to too many irrelevant sub plots and characters. The end brought no resolve and no happiness for anyone. The main character just seemed even more victimized, in a self-inflicted way, and bitchy.. Save your time and money. No one needs \\"downers\\" like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"I'm an avid reader so I don't give bad reviews (like I'm about to give) lightly. I haven't read all the books in the Oprah book club, but I've read a number of them and this is by far the worst selection. Compare this book to greater books like Stones From the River by Ursula Hegi, Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison, and Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons and you'll see what I mean: negative characters with little or no redeeming qualities in a story that meanders from pointless situation to pointless situation. The only emotion I registered was boredom and I left the book wondering \\"Why did I bother?\\". I understand the premise of the title \\"Songs in Ordinary Time\\" meaning that we'll look at the smaller more ordinary moments of life and not at great achievements or transcendence. A little hope would have been nice but even that wasn't necessary. Ordinary moments can be illuminating in fiction but that was simply not accomplished in this dull, lifeless novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This book was a complete waste of my time.

I respect her opinion.\\" But what a disappointment. The story-line was fragmented and the prose unremarkable. It appeared to me that the author, in trying to develop this \\"cast of thousands\\" into multi-faceted characters, was only able to manufacture caricatures of real people. The entire book seemed superficial and unreal. In the end, I had to force myself to finish reading this tome. At first I thought perhaps I had missed something, but, I see from the other reveiws that I am not alone. Phew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After 740 pages I STILL DON'T CARE!","review":"I waited until we went on vacation so I could savor Oprah's \\"Summer Winner\\". After ploughing through the book, I wished I had spent the time with a comic book. It might have left me with a better taste in my mouth.

Why couldn't she just enjoy them and give them the unconditional love that they deserved? As a young woman myself who is thinking of having children in the future, I would never look up to a woman like the one described in this book. I did not like her in any of her roles - not as a mother, not as woman and not even as a lover.

It was a good story with interesting characters, and Ms. Morris did an excellent job of weaving them throughout the story, but there was no triumph, no lasting impression of what the book was about. I didn't expect a fairy-tale ending, but I did expect a purpose for the book being written, and for me reading it. This book made me feel like I had wasted time reading it expecting to learn something"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst book that I have ever read.","review":"I was swayed by Oprah to purchase Songs in Ordinary Time. Never again will I follow her book recommendations. She kept hyping the book saying that it was long but not to let that bother the reader. She said that you wouldn't be able to put it down!

At times I felt like I was reading someone's classroom assignment to explore characters in depth. I know that not every story has a happy ending, but I kept hoping for some sort of redemption for any of them, especially Marie, and it never really came. I've generally enjoyed the books Oprah selected, but this was a real downer -- I never felt like I \\"connected\\" with this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a novel - Literature","review":"I can understand the frustration of some who feel that there are too many characters, too much depression, or too much deceit, but I enjoyed the book for what it was - well written literature. Marie thinks that she is the only one with secrets. The town looks down on her and her family because of circumstances beyond her control. She is lost in a hole of shame and pride and poverty. What we see, little by little, is the moral poverty of the rest of the town revealed piece by piece. While all of these events are going on around her, she can't see them; all she sees is the possibility of regaining the respect of the town and her children - at any cost. She draws her curtains because she is sure the whole town is waiting to see her fail, but what goes on behind the polished windows of the other houses? What goes on behind the fancy doors of the church?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most agitating book I have ever read!","review":"I had started reading this book several times and kept putting it down and starting another book. I finally \\"made myself\\" read and finish this book! It was...dysfunctional, agitating, chopped up little stories, that never quite came together! The entire book I kept thinking that this crazy, dysfunctional mother would get it together for the sake of her family. This never happens! It seemed to me the author was as tired of writing...as I was of reading. It ends abruptly leaving many questions! I would tell people to not waste their time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing Vicious Cycle","review":"A clear depiction of how the average person deals with negative situations. In this book, they learn nothing from experience and continually spiral downward. I continued reading, thinking the situations would improve. They worsened.

This story is depressing, frustrating and annoying in the lack of intelligence given to or shown in the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Faint-Hearted!!","review":"I had a love-hate relationship with this story as I read it. In the end, my verdict is that it was well-written with Morris' characters intricately formed. The story had me turning the next page and mulling the characters and plot over even when I wasn't reading it. This is the sign of a good book to me.It seemed that Morris gave a generous helping of human flaws to each of her cast of characters with none playing the role of \\"good guy\\". The story demonstrates to me a truth: that no one is all bad or all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner with well-developed 3-D characters.","review":"Mary McGarry Morris has a great way of describing her characters without being long-winded. It didn't seem like 740 pages because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in Ordinary Time is a waste of time","review":"The author tries to explore too many characters indepth and it doesn't work for her readers, or maybe it just doesn't work for me. I found the plot to be tedious, the characters too predictable, and the novel itself too long. She could have have a good novel if she hadn't tried to include the whole town's point of view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, but the ending was not satisfying.","review":"I found myself deeply involved with most of the characters and could hardly wait to turn each page in order to find out what would happen.

Besides the fact that the plot drags along endlessly, there are too many characters in the novel for the reader to know, much less like, any of them. Reading this novel was more like listening to people gossip about others that you don't know. I just never quite caught on to what the point of the book was.

I felt that I was totally inadequate to do so because I was sure that something must be wrong with me since I found this a hard book to want to read. From page one I found it difficult to follow and it took a while to figure out exactly who the characters were and how they related. Not to mention, why they were even discussed! I did, however, finish the book but only to be disappointed in the ending because of it's so unbelievable finish. For such a long story, it certainly had a hurry-up ending.

I was very disappointed because I was expecting it to focus more on Mother Earth. If you are looking for a book on Mother Earth and nature, this probably isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic novel!","review":"This book is just fantastic. It reads quick and makes you think about a lot of circumstances and facts that could had happened or actually happened... who knows. The author won't explain everything, it will let you fill in the gaps, if you may. The novel tells us about classic values and different generations. Also about how people with the same learning values take different paths in life and apply those values in different ways. Short, quick to the point and with a fast end, good to the author style, to make you think. It is a great book and anybody will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man who lived to long","review":"This book reminded me yet again why I enjoy Arturo Perez-Reverte. His creates memorable characters. Don Jaime the fencing master in question is a elderly man who has deliberately chosen to live by a code of honour and behaviour, which puts him at odds with the society and time in which he lives. In the words a character in the story \\"you did not die at the right time\\".The plot of the fencing master is simple in itself and is derivative of any one of half a dozen classic mysteries. But the plot is only the frame to allow the author to explore what happens when such a man such as Don Jaime is forced to interract with the world, that he has rejected a world that is dishonourable and full of intrigue. Can he remain true to himself and his code"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Art of Fencing","review":"Everyone in Madrid in the torrid fall of 1868 is discussing political plots and revolution except for Don Jaime. He is a fencing master and man of honor, an anachronism. For years he has been working on a Treatise on the Art of Fencing, the heart of which is his perfection of the unstoppable thrust. He is approached one day by a beautiful and mysterious woman with a scar at the corner of her mouth that hints at dark violence. She asks the maestro to teach her the unstoppable thrust. Even though Dona Adela de Otero's weapons of charm and elegance are formidable, Don Jaime declines. But he is entirely unprepared for the unhurried, sure, and inexplicable movements that follow. Soon he finds himself involved in a plot that includes seduction, politics, secret documents, and murder.

Simply achieving one of these goals is usually enough to make a book good, but this wonderful book mixes lyrical, almost verse-like prose with a great story. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fencing master","review":"Perez achieves the near unachievable--contemporary writing, depth of understanding, universal archetypes--a page-turner for literaria. If you enjoy wit, a literate style, pace accompanied by depth, don't miss Perez's books. This may well be he least enjoyed by American audiences, but having lived in Spain for some time, the insights to the Spanish psyche, I believe, are the most astute and revealing in, \\"The Fencing Master.\\" I have enjoyed all of his books--but this one the most so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Boring Than Expected","review":"This is the fourth book I have read by this author, and it is the most boring. The book is rather thin in overall character - the plot is rather simple and there is little to no suspense in this so-called mystery. Perhaps someone interested in Spanish fencing masters of the mid to late 1800's or interested in Spain would be more moved by this book. I was just looking for a good read - and this was not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel of texture.","review":"Arturo Pérez-Reverte's 1988 novel, mystically casts interesting lights and shadows on the characters of Don Jaime Astarloa, the aging yet regal fencing master and the femme-fatale, Doña Adela de Otero. The story's uncomplicated thread of historical cause-and-effect regarding Spain's social and political mores of the period will keep the reader captivated. Don Jaime, lives to some degree, in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but shallow","review":"While I enjoyed reading this book, I found it to be extremely shallow. Neither the political background, nor the personalities of the characters are developed fully enough to understand them. The Fencing master is obviously a man of honor--we learn that from page one, but we do not learn anything more about him till the end of the book. The character repeats himself over and over again, until he looks and sounds pathetic. The mysterious woman remains mysterious till the end, making her a trite and not very original melodramatic character. The political conspiracy is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Woman and the Sword","review":"Again Perez-Reverte has created a wonderful novel full of creativity and rich in history. During a time when chivalry and honor are at their end, a single man exists that still remembers and lives in the times of the past. Unfortunately this man is forced to live in the times of the present by unknowingly have been a part of a plot that includes murder and the monarchy of Spain. The cunning and charming exploits of a woman, a woman who has the knowledge of the sword, are enough for him to reveal one of the most powerful and secret sword thrusts known to the art. With a surprising end and the discovery that the fencing master has been searching for all his life, this tale ends with a calm and serene victory over evil and fencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perez-Reverte's Mysterious, Beautiful and Evil Woman","review":"I have only read a couple of books by Arturo Perez-Reverte and have enjoyed them all, but have noticed that he has a fascination with the mysterious, demonically beautiful and evil woman.I'm not providing a summary because it will spoil the story. Let the story unfold and let the author whisk you off your feet if you like murder mysteries with a period setting with perhaps a hint of the supernatural."},{"rating":"1","title":"thin, wan, weak fluff","review":"This book was easy to read and follow, which is great for light reading on the way home or at bedtime. But I find the glowing reviews on quality of the content, style and translation astounding, considering how one-dimensional the characters were, and how flimsy the plot. For starters, sharing more specific intrigues of the political crisis would have made the novel and certainly the wrap-up more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, could have been better.","review":"The Fencing Master is a nicely conceived story, with a beginning,a middle and an end. Unfortunatley the middle comes about 90% of the way through the book, long after you've stopped looking for it. The ending is then too abrupt and the conflict not well developed enough. This could have been a great book. Truly great. But as it is, it is only okay. Great fencing scenes which make one want to learn how to do it. If only there were a fencing master of great quality around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have spent more money on the translation...","review":"Being an avid fencer I was excited to read a review of this book...although the plot was interesting the overall book was disappointing. The translation was poor at best...a spell checker is not a substitute for a real human. My favorite was \\"foible\\" for foil. Touche!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment","review":"I'm surprised by these glowing reviews. I've been a huge fan since FLANDERS PANEL but this new one is suspect. The mystery is entirely predictable, and lasts only a hundred pages. The villainess is stereotypic (a sexy, husky-voiced, athletic, dark-eyed vixen who was molded/manipulated by an older man in her youth) and any other supporting cast of any interest is non-existent. And Don Jaime is a pathetically transparent, clueless, and utterly unlikeable character. It's one thing to have a protagonist who's faulted, another to have a bumbling, clueless idiot.I dearly hope Mr. Reverte is not thinking he can blueprint the rest of his mysteries, giving it a hook that readers will think is 'cool' -- chess, books, religion, fencing -- and plastering mediocre plotting around it. However, judging from the feelings below, he can, which is too bad, because he's far too talented for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fencing Master","review":"This was not the best book by this author that I have read. The characters were on the boring side and I had to push myself to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor and intrigue!","review":"This is another good book from this author that is very entertaining. The plot thickens and increases in intensity until the climax spills over and our hero is left standing with honor and pride, as he should. This is not a complex or overly intricate story, but it is very enjoyable, fast paced, and thrilling, till the very end. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from his other books","review":"For those who have read other books by this author, The Fencing master will be either a positive or a negative surprise. This time he resists the childish temptation and dreams of being Alexandre Dumas of the late 20th century, and thereby manages to combine his historical knowledge with an impressive and well-structured story. The abundancy of fencing techniques may seem unnecessary and complicated at the beginning, but soon you undrestand that the fencing - and the final battle - is an elegant metaphor to describe don Jaime's thoughts and life. Perez Reverte shows why fencing is art, and why it interests us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissappointment","review":"I fell in love with The Flanders Panel, enjoyed The Club Dumas and The Seville Communion, but the latest from this author has me scratching my head: was he forced by his publisher to quickly churn out another novel? Did he run out of ideas after writing several good novels in a row? While he accurately evokes the spirit of the times, I found the reading tedious, with no apparent plot until about 150 pages. Even then, the plot is very thin, and the politics that are described, and around which the plot centers, are described so sketchily that one doesn't really care what happens to these people. I found myself turning the page not because it was so good, but because I was hoping that any minute now it must be getting better. After turning the last page, I unfortunately realized that this would not be the case. This book will make me think twice about rushing out to buy the next book of Arturo Perez Reverte.

Other reviews seem to express disappointment because he didn't include graphic, bloody descriptions of killing women and babies. I, for one, am grateful he didn't. I was looking for a work that exams in excellent detail the factors that molded these two men into degenerate murderers. Lasseter has gone the extra mile to provide that. I couldn't put the book down during the trial segment, waiting in suspense to see if Charles Ng would be found guilty despite very scarce evidence regarding his involvement in the crimes. From my admiration of this book, I will become a regular reader and fan of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying yet enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't have giving it 5 stars for one reason. The author did a tremendous job talking about the victims and giving the reader a background to the crimes but unfortunately (and i hope i am not coming off to sick) there are no actual descriptions of the crimes.

IMHO, it's a waste of paper. I wouldn't waste your money on it. You'll only be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A Horrific Crime!","review":"I remember reading about the Lake-Ng crimes which are still unspeakable, unforgivable, unconsciousable, brutal, merciless towards the men, women, and children who were completely innocent. Lake and Ng were two men of a kind who enjoyed sadistic pleasure in torturing people at their compound in Northern California. Fortunately, Ng is in prison on death row I believe and Lake committed suicide. The story behind their lives is equally fascinating to result in two of the most demented serial killers and sadists around. I read a lot of real crime books and these two men were monsters in human form who enjoyed the sadistic pleasures of torturing women to death and humiliating them. The story of Lake-Ng is only partially told because there are other unknown victims but even after 20 years since the initial discovery of the house of horrors, the Lake-Ng crimes still penetrate a nerve in the community there like ghosts who refuse to go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little on Detail, Big on Boring","review":"I love true crime and that's probably the only thing that kept me reading this book. This book provides very little detail on the actual crimes and concentrates more on how Ng was a sadistic, manipulating know-it-all that liked to play games, but didn't like the consequences of such.I generally can read a good true crime book in 48 hours or less, but this one took me almost a week. Instead of forsaking everything else to read; this time I read when there was nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little boring","review":"I decided to read this book after seeing a documentary on TV about Ng and Lake.

The good guys are good, and the villains are not too villainous.I like to read military fiction, and it seems to me as if the author knows what he's talking about, without delving too deeply into the nuts and bolts. The whole Hollywood schtick rings true too. Overall, I would maybe call it space opera, with a little bit of unapologetic Deus ex Machina.I would definitely not turn up my nose at further books by this author, who, I see by looking at the copyright page, is Joshua Dann, who has other books listed on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Read!","review":"What a charming book. I was wandering through the library, looking for something to read when I picked up Bobby's Girl. The blurb on the back, which by the way is wrong, looked interesting. According to it, Kathy the alien, was here on Earth hiding from her enemies, and no one on Earth knew that she was an alien. The reality is much more interesting. Her friends know that she is from another world, but they love her so much, they just don't care. They help her settle in to a life in LA and are prepared to defend her. The book is engaging and humorous. I read it in a single sitting, and boy is my behind tired! :-))).I would recomend this to anyone looking for something a little different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggressively mediocre","review":"It takes a lot for me to choose not to finish a book, even one this short. I just couldn't care about this story or the characters in it. Way too much happens to the main character way too easily.

Anyone who knows Maddox's work will certainly enjoy this book, and it's definately packs a punch to the ovaries for people who pick it up just for a browse. Crude, direct, and well written, Maddox delivers his particular brand of humour with his usual panache. Although it seems to be slightly more tame than his website, I just put that down to publisher constraints. One thing I did miss was the old fashioned \\"MS Paint\\" artwork that Maddox uses in his posts. Although the professional artwork was done well, I think it took a little something away, and in conjunction with my previous point, it loses a star in this review.I'll never look at my alphabet soup the same way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"I bought this after I stumbled upon Maddox's website.I thought the idea of him paying and running his own website was pretty cool.

July - sucked.The alphabet of manliness was completely hit and miss, some of the articles were hysterical (circa 2001 maddox) but a lot of it was just lame.Maybe someone can explain this to me, but how is it that he's so famous right now?

It's not a serious read (clearly), but I enjoy reading a letter or two in the alphabet every few days to unwind between work and home responsibilities.

The first chapter about punching someone in the balls is material I laughed about in elementary school. Maddox is definitely in better form when he's writing scathing commentaries about popular trends (e.g. iPhones and Crocs), not this grade school garbage.

Random things which come to his mind to rant about. Instead, it almost seems like the writing in this book was forced on a topic which really just wasn't entertaining. The only parts which were worth reading, were when he went off on tangents in the middle of things.I only suggest you purchase this book to support Maddox's website. You will laugh at a few parts, but the rest of the time you wonder if the same author wrote the book and the website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"This book is offensive just to be offensive.

I have to learn to curb my impulses. Once suspects that the author, Maddox, actually wrote this in the tenth or eleventh grade, saved the manuscript and corrected the language later, when he finally learned to spell words other than those that have four letters. A complete waste of time on the subject of manliness and masculinity. It's obviously designed to be over the top, crude, etc., but it's ultimately a depressing read and nothing you'll ever want to revisit. This is the book that sits on top of the toilet tank and eventually gets covered by catalogs from reproduction car model makers and the Nifty Nickel. I threw my copy in the trash, which seemed like a badass thing to do. If you must visit this subject matter, look for the \\"Big Book of Sheer Damn Manliness\\" by the Von Hoffman Bros.

This book is not for the metrosexual (gay) and female rights advocates among us but, rather, hearkens back to a time when being a chauvinistic prick was considered an endearing quality in a man.

Most people find what he says offensive, but the beauty of it is that Maddox doesn't necessarily always mean what he writes. He could be likened to a shock jock on the radio.That being said, the book that he came out with was hilarious. As you would guess, there's a new topic for each letter.

Thus, over time you will find that you have to pick up pages from the album every time you pick it up. In addition, the pages have 3 horizontal places for pictures, and sometimes the plastic splits between pages. The bi-directional album, on the other hand, has a space 3 pictures high, so you can put 2 vertical pictures, 3 horizontal, or 1 vertical and 1 horizontal picture on a page, so you do not have to constantly shift the album to see each picture. I noticed on Amazon that there was one BDP-35 that was cheaper than this inferior album, so I goofed on this purchase.

I cannot use them on my woodworking projects.The original Quick-Grip Mini bar clamps made by American Tool Companies in the USA were of high quality.Today's Quick-Grip bar clamps are made by Irwin in China, they look similar to the original Quick-Grip, but the quality is just not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Small Clamps","review":"As the other reviewers said, these are the handiest clamps to have. I have six and use them for everything from bench hold downs to assembling projects. Even if I don't use them as the main clamps on a project, I do use them as temporary clamps while I get the others on.The best thing about them is the size - the handles fit my small hands much better and are more comfortable than their full-size cousins."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice improvement over screw clamps","review":"The squeezable pistol grip allows you to tighten the clamp fully with just one hand, allowing you to use the other to hold your work in place. It also won't vibrate loose by unscrewing. The one drawback I've found is this clamp can't grip as tightly as a screw clamp tightened with the help of a wrench; it does grip as well as a hand tightened screw clamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I used them for repairing a broken cabinet base while the glue was setting to take some of the pressure off the screws and to hold single pieces of lumber and 1 1/4\\" dowels that were a little unwieldy to cut on a table saw. Not what I would consider heavy-duty, but they do the job well for lighter projects (as expected .. it says \\"mini\\" in the name)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clamp for Model Builders","review":"Because of its size, this clamp does have some limitations; it cannot hold a great deal of weight or generate great amounts of pressure. For small projects like miniature boxes, frames or models, it is ideal.

The arrangements are fantastic. The vocals are explosive and engaging.But how to categorize the music.Ah...there's the rub.Progressive art funk? Hip hop as channeled by 80's era King Crimson?I don't know.

Alias David Bowie by the Gillmans]. In it his ex-wife--a horror through most of his life--simply bitterly airs all his dirty laundry while inserting many lies inside the mix to produce a very trashy, vulgar product. This work slanders without having any redemptive value. If you read other biographies, you will not only get info into this dark period of his life, but also on his coming out of it and moving on. I cannot stress how low this book has fallen, and have to recommend that it stays on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take It or Leave It","review":"I read this book some years back when it was first published. Although it wasn't so dull that I put it down, it by far wasn't the most gripping of stories. Angela tends to talk more about herself and her experiences while married to Bowie than about the man himself. When she wrote this, she was not a happy woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very anoying and angry author","review":"I REALLY wanted to read a book that had some insight and analysis of what makes Bowie tick. This book disappointed me.But that was not the least of my frustrations while I had this book in hand. Its author, David's former wife, apparently is still very angry with her \\"X\\". So we are offered details in support of her thesis which is that he is a cold, selfish jerk. Well, so was Wagner and a lot of great artists.And to the extent she talks about DB's art, it is in the context of her subthesis, which is that she deserves much of the credit for its evolution. Not just that she cleaned house and sewed costumes, but she claims that she was instrumental in shaping the staging DB's carrier.Unfortunatly, DB has still not been given his due in print.

It seems that their design and manufacturing is not conducive to consistent accuracy. My unit is also off 2 degrees in the vertical. The blade is allowed to wander between the vertical posts by design. As noted before, there are NO adjustments of any kind outside of the ability to lock down any angle via an allen screw. The clamp is awkward to use, moving it from one side to the other involves unscrewing and re-mounting a rod. Holding the blade above the work requires using tiny wingnuts that are, again, awkward to reach...Buy the Nobex Proman or Champion - get a real tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For rough miters ok, but PRECISION should NOT be in the name","review":"Same problem as others, miters are off enough to make precision cuts a frustrating process unless you are very nearsighted or have lots of wood putty to fill miter gaps. Operating a manual miter takes some finesse. But no matter how you handle this saw, grip it, adjust it, bend it, or stroke it, the saw refuses to cut a true vertical 90, making this a unintended compound saw and the folks at Jorgensen don't even charge extra for this ability, lol. Stanley is worse, and Nobex still reigns supreme. Thank God *someone* can make a decent miter saw! There was a time Jorgensen saws were pretty accurate, but that time has past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run...

At first glance this looks like a high-precision piece of woodworking equipment. When you get it home however you find it doesn't cut square-- in any direction. I tried cutting a 2x2 block at 90 degrees, it was off by about 2 degrees it both vertical and horizontal planes. The miters are off by the same amount as well. The saw provides no ability to fine tune the adjustments; they are cast into the base. I also tried the compound model hoping it would be better-- it was worse. The blade flexes too much to cut a miter on the flat side of baseboard, and there is no support on the back of the table to miter baseboard standing up.I really didn't want a power saw, but I'm afraid that is what I will need if I can't find a replacement. I will try Jorgensen first and see if they can help, otherwise the saw goes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"good saw / wrong materials","review":"When I first got this saw, I liked it a whole lot.

The whole assembly wobbles when sawing. Forget about getting a basic, straight vertical cut, let alone miters. Off by several degrees, not even close. Not adjustable. In my experience, cheap tools can often be made to do a decent job if you have sharp blades and spend the time to properly set them up. Not this one. Hours and hours wasted, not to mention materials. Do yourself a favor and get a proper tool to begin with. This one, well, it is going into the garbage bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"blade replacement","review":"I recently purchased the Jorgensen precision miter box and it worked very well for cutting moldings. When cutting heavier material, however, the cuts were several degrees out of square. I am guessing the blade which came with the miter box has gotten dull and needs to be replaced. Unfortunately I cannot find the 14TPI blade. A 24TPI blade which cuts metal is available and a longer blade for the professional model is available. Unless replacement blades can be easily located, I am sending the box back and expect to receive full credit.I will continue to look for a company address and the name of the CEO.If you know the address please list it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"not good\\"","review":"Wow! Looks can be really deceiving. I started w/ a 1\\" x 1\\" x 3/4\\" thick test piece to get acclamated w/ this product. It took appx. 8 cuts to get a true 45 deg. angle cut. I had to use slow smooth strokes to get results. The saw blade will bend if you use to much force resulting in a slight bevel cut. After about 30 or so cuts the blade began to dull. No use trying to get better cuts as you go along. W/ no replacement blade to be found i will just use this saw w/ the metal cutting blade i ordered separate from this saw to cut lead trim for stained glass work. this trim is 3/4\\" wide by 1/4\\" thick and requires no precision cuts.

Basically save the money and shipping and purchase the Jazzing for $4.00 it provides the same depth of color and it's a rinse as well.What I didn't care for was how thick the product was. Honestly I'm glad I purchased two bottles. My original intention was to be able to use one in the future. However, I ended up needed both!

It works well for someone who doesn't like to spend a lot of time on their hair but still wants to look good!

But it's hard to say which is my favorite because I love them all. If I had to pick one, it probably would be Piu che Puoi!!!!!

It's a great album, but I'm left with the feeling that Eros is beginning to lose his cutting edge sound and grit. I hope I'm wrong! Maybe it's just the studio producing that is at falt. The duet with Cher which has been long awaited is great! On the flipside, there seems to be a bit too much focus on piano and violins toward the end of the CD.

This is a true heresy ! Pure nonsense !He is popular,like Britney is popular in US.Would you say that Britney is better than Anita Baker or Regina Belle ?Forget about him and rather buy albums by Rossana Casale! She is really sublime !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Pop/Rocker Ever","review":"I first heard Eros about five years ago, in a book store while looking for another singer. It was the best \\"stumble\\" across I have yet done!Eros has a voice that is smooth and strong, yes, slightly nasal but that is Eros, he just sounds that way. His lyrics are great and have helped me to learn the beautiful Italian language. But even if you don't know Italian he puts great feeling into singing.This is probably my favorite album, I can put it in and never take it out of my stereo, except maybe to take it with me in the car. But I really love all of Eros' albums, and would recommend them.For a man who has been singing since the early 1980es, he still has not yet hit a \\"false note\\", and I am looking forward to his new album coming out in the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eros just gained a fan!","review":"I have to admit, I have never been a big Eros fan. I happened to listen to some sound clips of this cd before I went out and bought it, and it really caught my attention! These songs have a lot of quality to them. They are very nice comtemporary rock songs. \\"Fuoco Nel Fuoco\\", the first single has a great beat! All my friends love the song, even though they can't understand it. I have to say, my favorites have to be \\"Piu Che Puoi\\" the duet with Cher, \\"E Ancor Mi Chiedo\\" and \\"Per Me Per Sempre\\"... I'm a sucker for ballads. I recommend this CD to anyone thinking about buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Italian voices.","review":"Every song is unique, and Eros' voice is still magico, one of the best Italian singers ever.

Its a loose collection of urban legends. It made me smile a few times but it never made me laugh. Its good to have to sit next to your toilet for reading to pass time. My kid didn't like it really. She came to me a few times because she didn't understand what was so funny about a story. And I couldn't find it. Kind of a waste of time. I give it a two because i think if you can't get your kid to read anything else, this might be the kind of reading he or she would want to do.

Unfortunately, the awards are few, made apparent when you realize the points that the author tries hard to obfuscate are superficial. Not only is the writing style nearly impossible to get through, the book lacks any deep analysis of culture or economics. The visual tools that the author uses to illustrate his theories are made up of huge oversimplifications of international economies."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad advice...","review":"I read this book and \\"landed\\" my ex-husband by doing the \\"mirroring\\" technique.The result was I pretended to be someone I wasn't and compromised far too much for an abusive, scary man. I'm no psychiatrist but you shouldn't have to \\"make\\" or \\"trick\\" someone into loving you...it nullifies the entire point of finding love to begin with. Love yourself first and find someone kind, thoughtful, considerate who loves you for yourself. You don't need this crap-ola book. It nearly ruined my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this in high school","review":"I read this when I was a teenager. It was very inspiring to me back then. Since then I have learned that men and women, as human beings, are not so simplistic as the book assumes. Whether a man loves a woman or not is not necessarily only because the woman is doing the techniques/things that the book teaches. (At the very least, I wouldn't want to marry a man that is that simplistic and \\"manipulatable\\".) The theory can be seen as part of the whole picture, though, and it certainly is an interesting theory at that. The book is an especially interesting read if you are in the \\"boy crazy\\" stages of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her methods sound hookie!","review":"She does have an interesting theory that every man is either a \\"seeing\\" \\"Feeling\\" or \\"hearing\\" man and depending on which they are is how you communicate with them. Since I have not applied her methods I am not going to say it doesn't work, but \\"Make up, Don't Break up\\" makes much more sense in understanding men & being able to get closer to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you want to \\"make\\" someone fall in love?","review":"I have read the book, out of sheer curiosity. But why in the world would you want to \\"make\\" someone fall in love with you? You can't \\"make\\" someone do anything! I think basically what Ms. Cabot is saying is that you have to alter your own way of communicating and constantly edit yourself to make sure you are talking in the way that your man is talking. I, for one, would find that very confusing and stressful! I do think she has the right idea about making a list of the exact qualities you are looking for and that's why I gave it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great service","review":"This is a fun read. I knew a lot of what they suggest just by having common sense. The book doesn't say anything profound and I recommend \\"The Rules\\" instead because I still revert back to that book every now and then. This book doesn't really give you any good tips to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just okay...","review":"This book was a very interesting way of looking at relationships. I had a hard time reading the entire book because about half way through, it suggested that I change who I am to be more like the guy I wanted to fall in love with me. I am just not willing to change myself that much, so I don't think that I was a very good candidate for the book. I had a difficult time believing that it is morally correct to make someone fall in love with you when you are not acting completely like yourself. After reading this book you may spend more time focusing on all of its rules then actually getting to know the guy. I do think that it is an interesting read but try not to hang on its every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book has been re-issued!","review":"My friends and I had a secondhand copy of this in college (there must have been an earlier edition, because the amazon listing shows it as having been originally published in 87 but we were definitely reading it in the dorm in 85) to howls of amusement --which is NOT to say we didn't try some of Tracy's tactics. I vividly remember an evening at the ice cream shop near campus, my eyes riveted to the man of my dreams across the table, mirroring his every gesture and move -- my friends around the table cracking up because they had all read the book and all knew exactly what I was up to.For the record, it did not work. It does not work. Any so-called \\"scientific\\" or \\"fool-proof\\" method to \\"make\\" someone fall in love with you DOES NOT WORK. Get over it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This book isn't worthless, but it's not very good either. Cabot encourages women to be positive, specific and proactive in their approach to men, which I appreciate. She devotes a good portion of the book to the \\"love languages\\"--auditory, visual, and feeling. This information, so long as it's not pushed to the extreme or used by a manipulator, is interesting and could help people in any sort of relationship. However, ultimately, this is still a \\"man-hunting\\" book, with all that that phrase implies. I think that Cabot's approach requires a bit of tunnel vision, a bit of obsession about men, and a lot of manipulation. Take what you can from it, but I think that Sherry Argov's Why Men Love [...]is a better investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my way of thinking and my life","review":"Tracy Cabot captured my feelings and those of 100's of women when she taught us how to basically catch and keep a man. I have just recently married and I must say that I took her advice of leaving a dead end relationship and now meeting the man of my dreams. She has honestly showed me the way to happiness in a giving and satisfying relationship. I never new I wanted what I have now until I read her book! A must read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it all before!","review":"I would say, don't bother with this book. First of all it's jam packed, the print is tiny and its just an endless stream of sentences so you get bored and loose track and its just a pain! Then the information in the book is pretty useless It has a lot to do with old fashioned seduction techniques which men see through a mile away and has absolutely nothing to do with the magic ingredient that actually makes people fall in love with each other. I think to be honest if someone ever found out what that magic ingredient was they'd bottle it and be world famous by now! The truth is, you can seduce anyone into liking you or fancying you, but 'love', 'real love' I don't think so! Obsession and dependence perhaps... but do you really want that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DRUMMER FROM ELTON'S GLORY DAYS....SOLID SOLO!","review":"A must for any ELTON JOHN fan, the cd issue I have is from SONY imports (JAPAN). The track listing is the same. This album was originally released in 1979. The song \\"DANCIN' SHOES\\" was the single that got air play in CANADA and had modest success on the charts. As a whole I really enjoy this cd, it is standard MOR of the day. There is a good cover of BILLY JOEL's \\"SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD\\" and \\"CASSEY BLUE/AU REVOIR\\" could easily fit on any ELTON JOHN album. NIGEL has a great voice as any ELTON fan knows and he sat behind the kit for many great ELTON songs. There are many guest musicians which include....MIKE BAIRD, RAY COOPER, DAVID FOSTER, RICHIE ZITO and more. Produced by PAUL DAVIS and NIGEL OLSSON.

The song 'Georgy Porgy' is my favorite because it has a sweet Funk&Soul melody that is just not being done by anyone else right now. Eric definitely also has his own style & sound that seperates him from all other male singers.I can't really distinguish between which songs are good-because they're all pretty good in their own unique way. This 2nd album is very jazzy and has a cool-hip sound to it, kinda like in a bohemian way. He's definetely the sexiest singer out there!

I listen to every bit of it untill the last word and listen again and it is never enough.

I was hoping for the original soundtracks, but its not the same. Most of the songs sound like they were played on a Casio keyboard set on harpsichord. If Mike Post was actually involved in the making of this album, I would be surprised. Mike has created the BEST themesongs on tv to date, so I was excited to see this album released. The deep bass notes are nonexistant in any track, and the theme from Hardcastle & McCormack is missing the vocals. The cd says the tracks are \\"Original Sound Recordings\\" by Michael Jones Productions, but they sure don't sound original. Not worth the cd it's recorded on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original recordings!","review":"I've got to agree with the above reviewer - this is a pretty poor CD - not the original recordings! My wife and I have 9 month old triplets, and they love the theme from Law and Order - they stop what they're doing and watch the screen whenever the theme song is on - and we hoped to get the CD to use in the car on long trips, but they don't pay any attention to this copy.

It never should have been published because it's a mess.The characters are so cardboard and one-dimensional: Dolores is a cold, sexless flirt who cares about nothing but money and maintaining her jet set lifestyle. Her sister Nita comes off like a promiscuous tramp. Their mother died calling the name of an ex-husband who did nothing but cheat on and humiliate her.Dolores' friends are empty-headed and shallow (I mean, having a litter of puppies put down because they are cross-bred, as opposed to purebred? I wanted to strangle that particular character). The men with whom she becomes involved are empty suits.Her in-laws come off as bloodless parodies of the Kennedy family with none of the family's humanity....all faults, no virtues.I read the book once....and once was more than enough for me, if I may paraphrase the title of another book by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"It was a very poorly written book.

The only thing that would've been nice is if there were small holes in the seat for drainage, under the shower head water did pool on the seat when I wasn't sitting. Also, the price could be lower.

Unless you, too, think very highly of Fort Worth, TX, you'll find little to connect you to these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double bogey","review":"I started the book with great expectations and it continued to disappoint. I never got the point - mildly humurous but not really very interesting at all. After reading \\"A Good Walk Spoiled\\" and \\"My Usual Game\\" I was probably looking for more than Jenkins could deliver with this wandering tale of a year on the tour. His history of the golf architects and courses was the most interesting part of the book. I couldn't wait for the season to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jenkins' Best","review":"I eagerly waited on the release of this book, but it turned out to be not very good. Jenkins had me laughing once or twice, but not near as much as in You Gotta Play Hurt and Dead Solid Perfect. The narrator was 40, yet always made references to movies that a person would have to be 60 to remember. It was like Jenkins was too lazy to properly date his lead character and instead used references that someone in Jenkins' generation would connect with. I agree with the reader who said Missing Links is much better. Someone looking for a good golf novel will also enjoy Troon McCallister's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't always go home again....","review":"As some have noted, Dead Solid Perfect was a dead solid hit among golfers and has been the standard by which other golf novels are judged. Unfortunately, the author who created the standard has failed to measure up to it. The story is mildly entertaining, but just not up to what we have come to expect from this writer. Having recently read The Green and A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe, I am aware of how good a novel can be woven about this enchanitng and maddening game. This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading if you like Dan Jenkins, but not his best work","review":"I like Dan Jenkins' humor a lot. He seems like a guy you'd love to spend time with and I have enjoyed reading all of his work I've read. And, I enjoyed this book. But, I can't say I found it to be close to his best work (I really liked Baja Oklahoma, among others). It just didn't quite seem like Dan's heart was fully into writing this one. It took me quite a while to finish reading it, even though it's a short book stretched across 261 pages. The characters weren't all that interesting and there wasn't really much of a story, so all I had to savor was the humor and use of language. That's enough for me to read it, but it needs more to be a 5 star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reheated, Quick Copied, Amateurish Rush Job","review":"So Dan Jenkins transcribes a bunch of not very funny observations about the PGA Tour and all his half-literate acolytes can't stop spitting their beer through their nose.

Try Reilly's \\"Missing Links\\" for the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Dan Jenkins' new book...\\"Steer Job et al\\" was a major disappointment to me. The book was a slow starter, picked up pace early on and then ground to a halt.....It is basically a re-write of \\"Dead Solid Perfect\\" with a dash of golf History. Jenkins characters are slightly more urbane (hard to use that word on denizens of Ft. Worth Tx.)than those is \\"Dead Solid\\", however far less colorful. I have read every one of Jenkins' books and they usually have me rolling in the aisles, laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes.

TMW was a St. Louis band fronted by Alice Spencer, an amazing vocal talent. I would compare her voice to Janis Joplin's, but cleaner, more pure and more powerful. Sadly, this was their only release. Spencer's voice was a great match with this band and to date, her subsequent collaborations have yet to find as comfortable a home. After leaving TMW, Spencer switched gears and joined a folk/blues group The Geyer Street Sheiks. They have one album \\"Great Dream\\" (1994)on Bjam Records. Following the Sheiks, she went on to sing with The Barkers (~1999-2000?), and Victrola (kind of lounge/cabaret.)

Not surprisingly for a Pulitzer Prize winner, THE FIFTIES is gracefully written. Not surprising for a man of author Halberstram's reputation, the scholarship displayed is admirable, both in its breadth and in its depth. Any reader with a curiosity about this fascinating decade will finish the book far better informed than at the start. If there is one flaw, it's that the subject is plumbed so comprehensively that just reading this work can, at times, become overwhelming. When it comes to writing, Halberstram is the best and the brightest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"This book is an excellent combination of political and social history told in a compelling narrative fashion. I was often disappointed when I came to the end of a chapter and had to switch topics. I found myself wanting to know more about the matter at hand, to find out how everything turned out.The author does a good job of avoiding any particular political bias. He rarely comments on whether a particular action was right or wrong. He just presents the facts and let them speak for themselves.One insight that reading this book has given me is how drastically the advent of television altered the landscape of American society. Television lead to the trivialization of the political process, the evolution of advertising into a cultural force, and the steady growth of consumerism. With the large exception of the nuclear bomb, television is the worst thing the 1950's handed down to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were the fifties this boring in real life?","review":"Ugh! Well-researched, but ultimately poorly written historical account. In fact, this is one of the most overrated historical works I've ever encountered; there is nothing readable or memorable about the sluggish prose, which trails on for 700+ agonizing pages. On the bright side, now that I've read this \\"seminal\\" account, I never have to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, a little slanted","review":"I light history of selected events that took place in the Fifties. The book tended to try break the common memory of the fifties as being a perfect time. That purpose got into the way of some of the stories. The slant was just a little too much for me. Being rather young, I did like hearing about the way things were back then. I wish there was more information on culture and less on politics. The politics can be found in most history books. This book caused much reflection of what I remember about the seventies. I now regard the past in a more objective manner. Good but a little disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be trusted","review":"I picked this book up, and read the first few pages, getting to the point where Halberstam mentions the perjury conviction of Alger Hiss. Now, as Herbert L. Packer once wrote inEx-Communist Witnesses:Four Studies in Fact Finding, the trial proved Hiss's guilt as thoroughly as a legal proceeding can prove anything. And Allen Weinstein, inPerjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case, found even more evidence of Hiss's guilt. For a historian to pretend, as Halberstam does, that there's some doubt about Hiss's guilt, and not give evidence, tells me that he's writing propoganda rather than history. When he adds in gratuitous gay-bashing (Whittaker Chambers was bisexual. What's that got to do with Hiss's guilt or innocence?), I drop the book in disgust. Your mileage may vary.So read this book if you want, but remember the author is a liar, and don't use it as a reliable source. Check other sources about anything he says, including \\"The sky is blue,\\" because he isn't honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halberstam must be knighed: a masterpiece in social history.","review":"Social history at its finest. The Fifties is a novel with real life characters. Barely misses a second of history in that seemingly idyllic but quite turbulent decade.

The chapters on Ray Kroc, Kemmons Wilson, Leavit, Korvettes, Pincus, Keansey, Brando, Monroe, the H-Bomb, Peyton Place, Harley Earle, Korea, Milton Berle, the Quiz Show scandals...actually all of the chapters, are fascinating.Please, I beg you, read this book.

The author packs each self-contained chapter with wonderful vignettes,facts,fascinating observations, and biographical sketches that bring his subjects to life. My one disappointment in this book was the author's curious overlooking of the religious landscape of the 50's. One would have thought that figures such as Billy Graham, Fulton Sheen, Norman Vicent Peale, Popes Pius XII and John XXIII, the events leading up to and the calling of the Second Vatican Council as well as the explosive growth of church and synagogue attendance would have warranted a chapter in this otherwise engrossing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madness ( Vacanze per un massacro )","review":"This is a B movie that I give a D to.

If you are a literalist and think that the search for truth ends when your pastor opens his mouth, then maybe this book is not for you. But if you believe that God gave us all the ability to think, and if you wonder about the historical contexts in which the Gospels were written, then this book will fascinate you.

I hear the words of Jesus from the Master's lips without someone else intrepreting them. Many of the gray or black sayings were really the same as what Jesus said except the inflection, the irony, the tempo, or precise wording had been lost. Followers of Jesus will only become more radical disciples after reading this. The words prod us, un-settle us, challenge us not to accept what is but to work for what can be.

There is very little real, practical information provided. Most of the material has little or nothing to do about Mac OS X specifically, and the little there is will not prove helpful, except to provide the most basic overview of Mac OS X. The only people who should buy this book would be those who are not very conversant with even the basics of the Internet. For example, if you need an entire chapter devoted to Web _browsers_, then buy this book. The only redeeming feature about this book is that the writing is not too bad, for a technical book, but the marketing is downright deceptive. This book is not a handbook, and contains material that only tangentially concerns Mac OS X, to no practical good effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like bathroom paper than a handbook","review":"There's nothing in this book that's either complete or concrete or even finished. The author goes on and on and on about nothing. He needs help in paragraph structure. Because he never ever finishes a paragraph, he just moves on to something else. He talks about what can be done, but never explains how to do it. This book is a waste of a good tree. How can anyone develop a web server with this?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Photoflex Connector for Elinchrome","review":"The product does not fit well and it does not attach or un-attach without a lot of pushing and expletives (swear words).

It made you feel the same terror and passion that many of the characters felt. I found myself feeling emotions at a higher intensity then under normal circumstances. Danticat personified everything. From the Waterfall to the sugar cane with raw emotion. This book was so marvelous. My only regret was that the story did not last longer. The story was woven with the threads of reality which made it so much more horrid. As you realized this terrible acts really did in fact occur. All because of hatred for things you can't or don't wnat to understand. The strengh these poor isolated, cold and abandoned people felt. Danticat opens your eyes to this little known horror very similar in fact to the Holocaust and the modern day Kosovo crisis. Danticat constructed this story beautifully. And it is a must read for everyone who feels anything in their hearts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Read","review":"Upon the recommendation of a friend, I read The Farming Bones and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author's style of writing was almost poetic and made for a light flow, despite the seriousness of the turmoil the characters face and the time period in which the book is set in. I was carried into Amabelle's world and found myself crying during her most tragic moments and yet hopeful just as she was despite the circumstances she was in. At times the main character seemed to just float through moments in her life, not really seeming to be there as anything more than an observer, however, I took that to be a part of how she dealt with the realities around her, sort of a survival mechanism. There were moments I wished the book would pick up pace, but also found that the slowness of the book added to the charm and overall effect of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, But Lacks Depth, 2.5 Stars","review":"This book really wants to be literary fiction, but it lacks the necessary warmth and depth. The characters are flat and underdeveloped, such that it's hard to feel sorrow for their suffering. The only way I could work up any kind of caring was to remind myself that these characters had real-life counterparts who did in fact suffer the atrocities inflicted by Trujillo.The author seems to assume a lot of prior knowledge on the part of the reader about the events portrayed. The information provided is seriously inadequate. I'm still not really sure exactly what happened, except that Generalissimo Trujillo ordered the large-scale slaughter of Haitian immigrant workers in the Dominican Republic in 1937.An easy enough read, and I wouldn't say it's terrible.

It is written in such ways that I can cry and smile by remenbering the time when I was living there. I can not describe this book because it is so close to my heart. But if I were to try I would say this book is amazing, unbelievable, painful. This book is good for every one to read because it's part of two countries history and by reading this book you will understand a lot about my people and our struggle.

A Beautiful Book!","review":"A beautiful book inside and out, I donated my copy to my school library where I work. I think this book about the life in Hispaniola or Haiti and Dominican Republic from the Haitian author's point of view is done poetically. If you have any interest in reading about the life and times in Haiti, this book should be on your must read list. It is one of those books that you don't forget about easily. You remember the story, the plot, the characters, and the crisis in Haiti at the time. Now with Haitian immigrants in our country, the problems are still there and we must not forget them too.

She situates the lives of the two Haitian women characters (mother and daughter) within the context of contemporary political events in Haiti and the United States.

The text also shows insight into the daily lives of many Haitian women immigrants, and the legacy of culture, history, oppression, beauty, and strength that they bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!","review":"I have read Danticat's other books: Breath, Eyes and Memory and Krik!

POORLY EXECUTED!","review":"This film is based on a heartbreaking true story, unfortunately the tragic story gets lost in this ultimately forgettable collection of uneven disjointed scenes that leave the viewer confused and unattached to the crisis at hand. While the actual story is well worth telling, it's poorly told in this so-so melodrama concoction. We are allowed no time to get to know the characters before the fatal crash and it takes us to the last 10 minutes before we have enough invested in this film to care. I've seen many better sports films that are heartfelt and leave you feeling inspired. I have to give this film some credit as it seems to get it right in the last 10 minutes, which is the only part of the movie that didn't feel forced. It's OK for a rental, but I wouldn't waste my time for a second viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done reminder of a tragedy and triumph","review":"This is one of those movies you just have to see once to realize that life can move on after tragedy. This tells the story of The Thundering Herd of Marshall from Huntington West Virginia, and their horrific loss of 75 players/boosters/coaches at the end of the 1970 season. In 1971, with the bravery of the few remaining players, an incredible school president/dean, and one caring coach, the town was able to reserect the spirit of the town and the nation and in a leave a legacy for those who were left behind. Just think, since then they have won two 1-AA championships, then 5 strait bowl victories in the early 2000's after moving to 1-A.

I saw this movie several times and I think it is one of the best sports movies ever made, and it rivals even Remember the Titans.We Are Marshall is a touching story about Marshall University, which is located in a small town in West Virginia. In this university, football is a way of life and a passion. In the early 70's, the entire school football team and sports department lose their lives in a devastating plane crash while returning home from a football game.The entire town is heartbroken, and some of the townsfolk are strongly against rebuilding the football program. This movie tells of how Marshall University decides to begin the slow and painful process of starting a football program from scratch with the memory of the crash still fresh in their minds.Please see this movie.

And this is one of his best recordings. Around this time of his career he and John Coltrane drew a lot of inspiration from each other, at times they sound very much alike. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I grew up on jazz and have been listening to it for almost forty years. And any of the old Blue Note records from the early 60's are always among my favorites. But getting back to Dexter, he could really swing and also play a ballad beautifully (listen to \\"Until The Real Thing Comes Along\\", WOW!). He was also one of the finest bebop sax players around. Great accompaniment by Sonny Clarke on piano, Butch Warren on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums. If you want to hear a great jazz album, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must!","review":"If I had to choose only one CD out of Dexter's recordings for Blue Note (i.e. Go!, Our Man In Paris,...), I would definitely choose \\"A Swingin' Affair\\". This session is maybe not as intense as \\"Go!\\" but... what a warm, round sound! Billy Higgins does an amazing job on the drums and Sonny Clarck is impeccable. Dexter is at his best. Highlights are the first two tracks. In \\"Soy Califa\\", Dexter is amazing of humor, of energy and of mastery. \\"Don't Explain\\" (one of the two ballads of this CD) is wonderfully interpreted: his enormous tone sets a melancholic mood in just a few chords and it lasts for over 6 minutes of intense pleasure. Enjoy! As an extra bonus: an excellent quality of recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must!","review":"Dexter Gordon was one of the great tenor players and leaders, and this is probably his best album. The warmth and richness of his tone and his invigoratingly live rhythmic sense made all the cuts on this session outstanding, but on \\"Soy Califa\\" he outdid himself, with Billy Higgins and his great cymbal work matching him every step of the exhilarating way. Dexter told the truth here--he was \\"Califa\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Swingin' Affair by Dexter Gordon","review":"While I have all the Bluenote,Savoy,Black Lion & Columbia Dexter recordings in my collection, I still place this album on \\"My Favorite Top 15\\" Jazz albums recorded between 1949 and 1967 - always pure pleasure to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book was written by a Spurrier fan who told me nothing new about the great coach.

Spurrier's Gator coaching accomplishments made him the star that he is today and I was hoping to get a detailed look at HOW he was so successful at Florida. I was left wanting SO much more. It was a good look at his younger days growing up and as a player in college and the NFL. It also explored his days as a small time college coach, but the contents regarding his tenure at Florida was rather pitiful. Still, a must read for any Gator or Spurrier fan, but not a real complete work.

But you can find loads of free information on the internet, either from the MS site itself, or from one of the excellent developer sites such as [...].If you are looking for in-depth details then this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"-5 Stars is the rating","review":"...If you like the type of author's that just talk about the \\"OLD DAYS\\" like they are your Grandfather sitting on their lap listing to them gable about \\"When I Was Your Age\\" stories then this is a book for you.

Platt is totally wrong about Java."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING","review":"I won this book for free at a Microsoft .NET seminar--and it's not worth what I paid for it!This books contains absolutely nothing worthwhile. I suppose the target audience is management, so maybe that explains it. It's extremely general, has little technical content and has too many cutesy little phrases and asides.The chapter on ADO.NET--an essential component of .NET, isn't even included in the printed book--you have to download it from the web.In general:* Where's the beef?* Only useful for someone with little technical or development background.* Focuses too much on web services.* Core technologies omitted.* Since I can't give it no stars, I gave it one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is weak","review":"if you've ever read a good book about programming you will be disappointed. I've read a polish transaltion of this book and it is even worse than in english.

Thus he comes arond many issues by writing to meny humorous bits that (in the long run) tends to get in the way of the actual information. -I prefer a natural mixture of both information and humour.-But, if the reader is able to look through (or like) the author's personal jitter, it can be a quite an informative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst introduction one could hope for","review":"Guys, if this is Microsoft's official way of \\"introducing\\" .NET there's something deeply wrong in Redmond. This book is short and costs way too much for what it's worth.

In my opinion, this book totally [has] no help."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't even walk straight anymore...","review":"Max Decharne with a bottle of Jack Daniels in one hand and the microphone in the other is a common scene at the Flaming Stars live performances.

The Flaming Stars are a band that loves to drink and sing about it whether this is in the form of killer instrumentals like \\"Who's out there?\\" or in more traditional songs like \\"The face on the barroom floor\\" and \\"Only tonight\\". You can picture yourself (or at least wish) in a bar where the band is pumping guitar and organ riffs in your boozed brain.If you like garage music, liquor ballads and an occasional creepy cemetery story this is an album you will probably come to love. It's the best introduction to the world of the Flaming Stars and it won't let you down when you've had one too many and all you want to do is \\"Kiss tomorrow goodbye\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put this book down","review":"I couldn't put this book down. More than that I was astonished by the amount of research and historical accuracy done in a novelistic form. Not only interesting and intriguing, but the author brought this unique era alive.

This is an amazingly well researched book that was written with humor and in many cases love that the author developed for NCB.What could have been a dry, boring dissertation on one of the most colorful individuals of the last few centuries is a excellent, very quick read. There were several situations when I wished that Ms. Rodriguez had been allowed to include all of her findings and research in the book.A STRONG recommendation for this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We both loved it...","review":"My wife has been a Natalie Barney fan for years, and when she began reading Wild Heart she simply disappeared from my life for a few days. She couldn't put that book down. When she finally allowed me to read it, I understood why. Barney's life was fascinating in and of itself, but I also liked the historical backdrop. I particularly enjoyed reading about the Belle Époque and what it was like to be in Paris during World War I. The discussion about Barney's inexplicable anti-semitism was honest. According to my wife, other writers have kept that part of Barney hidden. In our home this book has received a solid two thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Readers enthusiastic about early 20th century Paris or Lesbian studies will certainly be disappointed by the unsubstantial content and questionable scholarship of this book. Apparently, the author never interviewed anyone who actually knew Barney. She recounts undocumented 100-year-old private conversations as if they were solid fact. Some of her assertations leads one to think that Rodriguez doesn't speak French and certainly does not have more than a superficial understanding of the historical events through which Barney lived.However, Rodrguez' related cookbook is quite charming. She'd do best to stay in the kitchen and leave the big research to professional Lesbain studies scholars.Barney's original texts are still in print. Anyone interested in this fascinating woman would do better to go straight to the source and skip this opportunistic, amaturish waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not","review":"Not the melodic rocker as expected.

It contains very few historical facts, and often goes on for pages and pages doing nothing but spouting the author's opinions. It even has an acrostic poem to 'describe' FDR that includes words like 'Likable.' Another example of this bias is a quote from page 41... \\"Coolidge was happy to play the tunes big business wanted to hear- and it was music to the fat cats' ears.\\" Whether or not you share the opinions expressed in this book, they should not be presented to children as fact. That doesn't help them learn about history, it teaches them how to think.Here is a link to an analysis of another book by Hakim in the same series:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to find particular chapters","review":"We are using this with Tapestry of Grace, and I was very glad to see it in audible form. However, the audible version has only 6 tracks, so in order to have your children listen to a particular chapter, you have to listen to the whole thing yourself, and write done the time stamp for each chapter. The original book has 42 chapters, so this is a big hassle.The narration is good, and the quality is fine, but the lack of proper chapter tracks is very irritating, and almost renders the product nonfunctional for my purposes. Unless you intend to listen to it in order, without skipping any chapters, you might want to just buy the paper book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More poetry than history","review":"Strangely written book. I understand it's meant for kids but even then, history is history. I expected the language to be lighter than standard history books, but this is way over the top. Too fruity and poetic in writing style. Author deviates from the flow to focus on strange highlights that are not so important from a historical perspective, and then rushes through some that I would think were more important. Very strange book, not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice and sharp set","review":"I just purchased the 3 piece cab. bit set from freud and I am very excited. The set came within a few days of ordering- thanks Amazon. The bits are extremely sharp and the finish is excellent. The box that comes with the set is well constructed to keep the bits safe and free from dust, which is nice. The only concern that I initially had was whether or not the 3 1/2\\" bit would fit in my router base opening. I have a 7539 p.c. router and the opening is 3 1/2\\". I had to file the opening just a little to make the bit fit. I am sure that you will find this most acceptable. The cuts with the bits are very clean, just like the ads say, and there are no pieces of fuzz on the top of the profile on the end grain. This will save some valuable time.

Perhaps I received a defective unit, I don't know. It seems to retract correctly, however the sound quality is poor. The headphone terminal might be to blame as it appears to slip out too easily. Plus, if I move the cord even a little bit, I notice the connection break with a very annoying crackling sound. I consider this a wasted $20. I might try a more solid-looking brand in the future, however, I could not recommend this to anyone.I actually decided to keep this unit. Yesterday, the retractor snagged and the cord would not come loose. I decided to just throw it away. I have been very delicate with it and still its effective lifespan for me was about 10 months.

This disc collects a bunch of his stories from various and sundry live shows over the past twenty some-odd years. While this would usually be call for massive celebration, this album collects a bunch of stories that, frankly, might have been better off left uncollected. Many of the endings are predictable, and Phillips resorts to the crude punchline a few too many times for my taste. But through it all, he is still a marvelous storyteller, and he understands the timing and craft of humor as well as the best standup comics. If you've heard him before, and you want some new stories, grab it. If you're new to him, try \\"The Past Didn't Go Anywhere,\\" his collaboration with Ani DiFranco, or \\"Loafer's Glory,\\" his collaboration with Mark Ross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre documentary","review":"I was really looking forward to this documentary especially since the one review that it has was 5 stars, however, it begins with a very low budget scene that does not relate to the documentary very well.

But the sentence should read: \\"This is a valid inference, and as long as the two premises are true the conclusion will be true\\".The original formulation is in fact mistaken. Modus Ponens, like all valid inferences, is valid also in the case in which the two premises are false.The standard definition of validity says that an argument is valid if and only if if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Since \\"if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true\\" is a conditional statement, it is true in the case in which its antecedent is false (and therefore the premises are false). So the original formulation confuses validity with truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Logic made simple and easy!","review":"Dr. Deborah J.

I would recommend this book for anybody interested in opening their minds. This book would be great read for an aspiring college student. High School students heading off to colleges and universities should have some idea of logic. It's not taught enough in the earlier grades.

It is, however, larger than the last 2 seats. It is very comfortable to seat on. I am not sure if it would fit in a tub or shower, since my tub and shower are separate.

Unfortunately, this chair sits a little too high and lacks the stability necessary for him to climb into it, and we do not have shower hand rails to assist him. So, I tried using it in one of the our bathrooms that have a tub, but it is too big for a standard sized tub. In the end I had to return the product.

While many of us would prefer the ideal protagonist to self sacrifice and do the ethical thing, would would a real person do when their way of life, their paycheck is on the line?

WHY are they paying their fund managers millions of dollars while investors are being taken for the ride? Lesson to learn: I now know that the best way to handle our own financial future is self-education and trading our own self-directed accounts. To Hell with all those sleezy fund houses and fund managers! They all appear nice on brochures, but are no better than CORRUPT politicians!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ensemble acting!","review":"I loved this movie -- great ensemble acting. It starts with an analyst dicovering impending financial disaster for his employer and then moves up the chain of command meeting by meeting as they contemplate what to do and the moral implications. Altho' we know from recent events what's about to happen, this movie is great at creating tension and drama during the meetings and implementation of the final decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting - Tight drama !","review":"With the heavy-hitting cast of Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, and others, I sure looked forward to this movie, and it did not disappoint! A tight dramatization on how all of America was screwed over, and yet some people landed on their feet. Very well written and equally well acted, I would recommend this movie to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Unsatisfying","review":"Two hours of excruciatingly boring dialogue and general lack of interesting storytelling. No twists, no satisfying accomplishments or any reason to like the characters at all. We kept hoping one of the characters would be shot and/or shoot himself, but sadly this did not happen. Sam's dying dog is intended to be a metaphor for the financial industry or the stock market, but it better applies to the movie itself - a long, drawn out process with no human element."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful movie","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'd say even Boiler Room is better. Also, the male actors are so ugly: and I expected eventually a gay sex scene with the two gay-looking young floor traders, but nothing sexual in this movie. Also, it's basically a cigarette and alcohol commercial, with non-stop \\"tough\\" foul language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better As 1/2-Hour TV/Movie (Commercials time included)","review":"What a boring movie! Impressive cast all gone to waste. Too much time spent belaboring how sorry the characters' situation was. And I couldn't bring myself to care even slightly, except for the Kevin Spacey character perhaps. The pace is so slow I fell asleep during the building steps scene toward the end (yes, I managed to stay awake up to that point), and woke up to the same scene. I dicovered the guy 1 row behind was doing the same so I felt vindicated. Why did this movie even get made? Was this a lame attempt of some Wall St. producer to show they too are having a bad time? So sad I forgot to cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Don't waste your time or money. Very slow, predictable and boring. It is rated R because every fourth line uses the \\"f\\" word. Otherwise it would be rated G. There is no sex, violence or action. A yarn aimed at beating up on Wall Street with a few big name actors. The one star was for the acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible movie","review":"depressing, slow, unhappy--Can't say much good about this movie.

Nothing happened in the movie. One hundreed F.Y. words."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad but certainly not good","review":"2.5 stars. I was hoping for a good movie. And I'm not sure what I got. The acting was solid. The directing was solid. Loved the camera work. But if I didn't know better I would say the script was written for a low budget film. There were very few locations...and too much dialogue (and I generally enjoy slow paced films as long as the characters are developing and I'm learning about them.) I went from enjoying the story to wondering if it were going to 'get going' to waiting for it to hurry and end. Basically there's not much to the characters and the main theme drags....and drags....and drags. I think the director, actors, DP and audience deserved a better script wrapped around this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was hoping to see something that happened behind the scenes. The truth is that for anyone who has good knowledge of happened in the financial crisis, this is almost like a deja-vu. Almost nothing new.So maybe this movie was about the characters? I also found them bland and forgettable. The dialogues are forceful, contrived and unrealistic. I am not sure if it is Hollywood or the actors. But no American movie was ever successful in capturing the corporate work environment. You may be thinking about \\"Office Space\\". No. That doesn't count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great analysis of the great recession...","review":"This is a great film if you are someone who can appreciate and follow a recreation of the financial meltdown of 2008. Thought the story was intense and kept my interest going, without getting too drawn out and dry. Thought it was good, if you like a docudrama type film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated film nails the 2007 financial crisis","review":"I didn't think it could be done. How do you craft an entertaining film about a financial crisis brought about by liar loans, non-existent regulations, securities no one understands, and a financial sector run amok? Director J.C. Chandor's Margin Call manages to tell this backstory and convey the vast greed at the heart of the system through an entertaining and superbly acted thriller that focuses on one firm. Jeremy Irons' portrayal of the firm's CEO is wickedly compelling, but the rest of the cast is also excellent. One of the most entertaining films I've seen in the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"If you own stocks or follow the market, you'll find this movie engrossing. If you don't know what a margin call is, probably won't relate to the movie. The cast was brilliant and I enjoyed the slow pacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Call","review":"I thought this movie had good intentions and tried to stand on its own with a strong acting roster but it collapsed because the screenplay was weak and without detail to give it real momentum and force. I would have done this movie very differently. Also, why get dressed up for a two o'clock emergency meeting? After about 25 minutes the movie lost me. Why does Jeremy Irons play that role again and again. He needs to play a different part. I would have cast him as the guy who gets laid off in the beginning. This movie had so many problems I cant believe my comment is this long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense, taut, but empty","review":"Well acted, and it doesn't surprise me that director JC Chandor made his living directing commercials; the blue/green transfer look is pernicious.But it's impossible to feel any sympathy for any of the characters: to the last, they get away scot-free and rich, with green pastures ahead. The thought it left me with was this: nobody went to jail over the 2008 financial crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"well acted","review":"This is probably like ENRON before the collapse.

Had to shut it off. Shame on this production company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad Cinematography","review":"This film was shot on video, and it really shows! It felt like a youtube project that was thrown together in a few weeks (cheap lighting, jerky camera, soap opera look). I expect more from the visuals especially when top name actors are involved. Also this film was not the least bit a thriller. It's a drama, and the acting was quite decent (espcially Spacey), but the presenation was very amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating.","review":"I gave this movie two stars because it is well crafted and finely acted. However the story is awful. In it we hear detailed arguments why we should accept corrupt and destructive business practices. The decent characters in the story make a few weak protests and then just give in. By the end of the film I felt sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time! So tedious and boring.","review":"How could the word \\"thriller\\" appear in the description of this movie??? This was one of the worst movies I've seen in the past 12 months. It was so slow and tedious. And just when the movie could have started to get good, it just ends.What a waste of some incredibly acting talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing...","review":"I was really looking forward to this after reading reviews in the NY Times & other places. But one more time I got set up. I think I've been spoiled for inside looks at the workings of contemporary business by The Social Network. Where is the excitement in Margin Call? Where's the energy that has gotten these people to the precipice they're about to tumble off? The characters in this movie are so generic they could have walked out of an old Hollywood war horse like Executive Suite. It has a talented crew of actors but I never for a minute got the feeling any of them had a clue about the actual workings of the business they were in. A good part of the blame goes to the lazy script. The higher ups in these firms would have been well aware of the rocket scientists in their ranks because they were the guys hired to invent the very financial instruments that brought it all down. Here they're whiny junior analysts running financial models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Margin Call - waste of time","review":"Starts out slow and never got any better. It was boring. Good thing it was a free rental. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. If you work in banking or stocks, then it's a movie for you. Especially if you want to hate Wall Street anymore than we already do. Full of deceit and corruption. A good old boys network only out to protect themselves and line their pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money","review":"Don't waste your time or money. The 2 stars are for Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons (my fave actors). Otherwise, it's boring, super slow, no action.

The plot is dull, even for a 'based-on-a-true-story.' I wouldn't waste my time with this. If you're interested in '08 market collapse, watch the PBS Frontline, \\"Money, Power, and Wall Street.\\" There is more drama in that documentary than in this drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the WSJ daily, at least it's more thrilling","review":"I truly feel the actors did a great job within the limitations given them in this movie. There IS a real life plot in this movie, but either the writer/director has no idea how to convey a complicated transaction, or they simply don't know the subject matter at all. I have watched documentaries on Enron more thrilling than this movie. Again, I feel Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, and Zachary Quinto did a fabulous job with their roles. Unfortunately, it has the depth of about an inch, so not much more they could do. I like Kevin Spacey period, but given the option again I would have skipped this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"In contrast to many, I found this movie both slow moving and much of the time just boring. Given the enormity of the subject and the catastrophic events and consequences, how one can make a slow and boring movie alludes me. Far too short of tension. Far too short on reality. Waste of some fine actors...though they did make money I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"Given all that's happened in the financial world, especially Wall Street, I expected a bigger, more complex plot. Even the trailer is misleading. This is a very small story, dealing with one event at one firm. Surely as a stage play, this would be very good. The firm seems to be modeled on a number of financial firms, it has elements of many. Simon Baker's resemblance to Jamie Dimon is uncanny, as I'm sure other of the cast members are based on real people. Disappointing film, especially the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"It's hard to be sure, but the extremely elliptical dialog here was probably the result of the script writer(s)not really knowing enough about this very complicated subject to say much more about it than they said. The actors had very little to work with; they tried hard, but seemed mostly at a loss as to how to proceed. Some variation in the swearing might have helped; these young men would certainly have had bigger arsenals of curses. Jeremy Irons had the longest speeches, if one could call them that, but he's been hamming it up for so long now that he can chew the scenery without saying a word, and he did that too. A viewer whose taste I respect has praised this film, but that can only be his reaction to the appalling situation that it attempts unsuccessfully to explain, rather than any merits of the film itself. I was looking forward to this one and had hoped to learn from it, or at least be entertained. It was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a review of Amazon Prime Video, Not the movie Margin Call","review":"I've tried to watch MIssion Impossible and Margin Call using the Amazon Prime service. In both cases the film hung up the system after just a few minutes. This is not a high speed streaming system. It delivers clogs and frustration.I watch netflicks, hulu, and dozen others using my roku system. Only Amazon Prime fails to deliver.I thought we'd be getting a huge selection of films and tv shows as well. Not so.

I NEVER hear that word used by any of my friends or family, so I object to being 'entertained' by its constant presence.

It is just so very, very touching -- about the first time dog and man began to love each other.I am just overwhelmed at the talent of this author: Not only does she write a simple story with great imagination combined with simplicity, choosing just the right words to express the story, but she does her own unique illustrations and, as she has also studied design, this element is also evident in her illustrations, making them original and fascinating.Her trademark is the framework on each page, where she places tiny illustrations therein.

Too bad the movie did not follow through.The opening was so stereotypical that my first thought was \\"Uh oh -another bad cop show\\". But it was more than that. It was a bad cop show with a message. And the viewer was bashed over the head with that message for the entire film. And just in case the lack of subtlety in the script or the over acting of the traumatized hero does not drive home that message, the scriptwriter summed it all up in two sentences at the end of the film.

In this book, however, this is impossible, because the 100 books have been chosen by 100 different authors.

Not only do you need to figure out whodunnit but who's dead. Most of Carr's tales seem to deal with an impossible happening that is later plausibly explained. This mystery falls into that category. In addition, the characters are wonderfully developed although somewhat dated (I can't imagine \\"My wench\\" would go over to well in addressing ladies), and, there is, of course, undercurrents of relationships among the characters that become important as the story progresses. My only complaint is that there are not a whole lot of characters, and, as in one of the Carr books I read previously, one of the most undeveloped (or ignored characters) has too much to do with the finale. Definitely a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE $ PRICE $ IS RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I saw this movie on TV a few times it gets 5 STARS \\"THE MOVIE\\" but the PRICE for this DVD item & what its going for on AMAZON is PURE CRAZY!

Most songs seem more like dragged out \\"parts\\" of songs. Hum and (maybe) Opportune Moment are the notable exceptions, but they don't make up for the rest of the muddled CD. I'm suprised no one has compared this CD to other new bands like Splender, who suffer the same problems.These guys are very impressive live, but with the exception of Hum, the talent didn't translate well into their album. See them live, and hope the next album is worthy of their efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of my list","review":"This band is by far one of the most talented out there. For a freshman recording, this album is amazing. The quality of the recording can be muddy in parts. However, the quality of the songs is top notch.

The large metal casting is suprisingly lightweight, and some of the mechanism inside is plastic, so it is nice and light. I used mine to clamp edge molding onto plywood while gluing, and it gripped just fine, no slippage at all (so yes, to the reviewer above, it's great for bare wood). Much faster and easier to use than bar clamps. Now if only they can dramatically lower the price so I can get a bunch of 'em instead of just one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"costly but worth it.","review":"Purchased a cheaper brand before I bought these. they were a cam system, but the rubber pads didn't stick.

A little spendy, but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throat Depth Counts!","review":"I wasted money on this clamp because the description didn't mention the throat depth. I needed to clamp a 3\\" ear to the top of cabinet sides thus making the toe kick by overhanging the cabinet top. This clamp looked to be perfect, but the throat depth was about an inch shy. The side grabbers wouldn't reach past the ear to grasp the cabinet edge.The clamp would be OK for edge banding, but if you are doing anything else, be sure to check the required throat depth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops keys","review":"This keyboard adapter has trouble with multiple keypresses - if you need to use ctrl-x followed by ctrl-f , it can lose the fact that you still have \\"ctrl\\" held down.

A keyboard adapter should not lose track of keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre; mostly war stories with little content","review":"This book is a mediocre attempt at discussing security issues. Much of it covers basic management ideas and, except for Chapter 6, there is little worth reading. While that one chapter does touch on important security issues, there is very little hard content. I bought the book through the Amazon \\"hype\\" but would like my money back.

They provided the book 7 days late. The book appeared used on reciept and they charged a 20% restocking fee.

So buyer beware, find out where the book you order is coming from and if it is Stork Media, well think twice and ask them the rules that apply to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large & Unweildy but substantively excellent","review":"This book is huge and heavy and hard to hold, but is the ultimate collection of photos (mostly B/W) and descriptions of Neutra and his work. It's written in 3 languages, which means that a lot of the volume of the book (2/3 of the text) is wasted space, though the book is easily 50% photos. A detailed (roughly 15% of the book) nontechinical history, light bio, and analysis is included at the beginning, which is well written for a mass audience (ie, you dont need to be an architect to understand it). There is little to criticize. If you are reading the reviews for this book, that means you are looking for a book on Neutra specifically, and you aren't going to do much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather good...for the most part","review":"This book is amazing though the photos of Neutra's projects are generally not as large as one would hope. It is amazing how much Neutra created during his career. A brilliant book filled with insightful information and general floor plans of building projects. Best of all, there is even a map as to the location of his buildings."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Heartfelt Toast For The Ones We Love\\"","review":"A truly remarkable book! Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.

It gives you direct guidance on helping you find the \\"perfect\\" toast for the \\"perfect\\" couple.

What a wonderful reference book to keep throughout the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the other hand..","review":"I could not have been more disappointed with this book! The suggestions for quotes to use in toasts for various occasions were uninteresting and unoriginal. You could find many more memorable words and phrases to borrow in a host of other books.

Pass this book by and find another to help you in expressing yourself glass in hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not broad enough in scope...","review":"I was disappointed in this book because I had expected useful information and techniques. The photographs chosen do not seem to convey much and the \\"technical\\" explanations of the manipulations involved to utilize the characteristics of variable contrast papers do not (for me) illuminate the process at all!

OOPS! Not only were most of the interpretations questionable at best, the bass overwhelmed the system and was completely out of sync with the rest of the mix. The separation was muddy, and the execution of the pieces stilted at best. This is one of those times you don't want to buy a compilation DVD-Audio. Stick with the conductors and orchestras that specialize in some composers and their works and look carefully at the Silverline label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy yet lightweight","review":"I like to use a bath chair so I can sit during part of my shower, mostly to tend to my feet.

It's sufficiently powerful, very quiet, and seems generally to be well-built. It does not come with an upholstery brush or other fairly standard attachments, and because the hose size is a bit different from the standard shopvac, one cannot just go down to Home Depot and pick up attachments.

So, you'll have to search around to find the wet filter and you probably won't find it easily.Second, the other Fein vacuums are much quieter. The Turbo II and Turbo II at 57 dB make 1/4 the noise of this one.

But after using other types in the past and seeing what is out there now, I decided to give this Fein a shot. As a contractor I use this thing for dustless drywall sanding and will say it works very well. No problems. It also comes with good attachments. Best of all it is quieter than most models out there.

They're easier to read and come in huge scales. What happens if you heater overworks and the tank is at 100 degrees? You can't tell. It happened to me before, and let me tell you, it was horrible.

Anyway I must tell you DO NOT BUY this DVD. The plot is so messed up it's not even funny. The animation is ok I guess. But the story [stinks], it's one of those anime that starts out fast paced with you not knowing who the main characters are and so on. Now most of the time when this is done in anime you would gradually get what's going on. But I'm sorry to say in this one I swear I was trying to grasp what was going on but was so lost. The fight scenes were awful. I stopped watching into the first episode (it was that bad). Trust me don't spend your money on this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erm....WHAT??","review":"the soul taker to me is a running joke with my freinds. What WERE they thinking? The points of view were completely random, people were spitting out dialogue at random moments, it was like the characters were cast in stone, because trhey barely moved. AND WHAT IS WITH THE TEA??? I have never in my life seen an anime that people drank so much tea! The only anime that is more pointless then this was bey blade. One of the things that i really didn't get was..well there was a fight scene, then suddenly, SPARROWS?? There was randomly a flock of sparrows. And the artists, obviously had an odd obsession with stained glass windows because people were being dyed random colours. So my overall review is..DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN \\"ABSTRACT\\" BREATH OF FREASH AIR !!!","review":"I begin this review first with that I almost never write reviews on any of my viewings or purchases,but this one raise my browe.

You don't really get what's going on when you first watch it, yet it draws you in through style and mystery. The animation is spectacular. The story is very interesting once you watch the anime a few times. Give it a break, as with some movies, the storyline may be complex, so we watch it a few times to actually understand. So, don't automatically dismiss this anime like this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"good animation, but nothing else.","review":"Well, I just got finished watching, The Soultaker: The Monster Within, and well they definately have the animation aspect down, but to make a truly good animation it takes more than just good animators. First of all the voice acting and the dialogue were awful. They really need to get some better writers, and get an entire new cast of voice actors. Second, the music was laughable, I haven't heard anything that bad since, well...I can't remember the last time I heard music that bad. And I can't forget about the mad scientist, I mean aren't mad scientists just a little played out by now? So if you are just looking for some eye candy, then Soultaker is the anime for you, but if you want good music, voice acting, and a coherent story line, look else where, in fact I would recommend Boogiepop Phantom or Lain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money.","review":"I bought this DVD, and was promply diapointed. From the very first episode, it just set the mood of complete stupidity. The battles are completely lame and the conversations are all pretty much corny.

If you haven't already seen Neon Genesis Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain, I would make those your top choices. Take it from someone who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"woulda been a good manga","review":"I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the detail is amazing, but that does not make up for this title's shortcommings.The bigest problem I have is that the scenes don't really connect. It's almost like watching a manga.The characters movements didn't really seem smooth either. Not what I'd expect from a modern anime.Another problem for me was the colors. There wasn't much use of natural colors. Each scene had aporx 6 colors to it (almost like they didn't have enough $$ to make the film). Each scene also had different colors than the previous. That added to the disconnected feeling.Overall it gave me a headache. The plot was very average. If you are a liberal arts major you might like how abstract it is, but it's pretty bad in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"slipping here............","review":"these books were once rather entertaining,but I fear they have become as silly as her Yoder series.Please,if I want a stand up comic,I'll find one,enough of the one liners,please."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIGHTMARE BETWEEN THE PAGES!","review":"Normally I'm a fan of the Abigail Timberlake series, so I was looking forward to this latest entry. I came away extremely disappointed. The book was almost completely dialogue, so it was very fast-paced. There was very little setting and character detail, so the usual secondary charcters were barely seen and not developed at all. It was almost as if the author knew she had to get them in there, so she just made up a few scenes. This whole book seems as if it was thrown together. The author concentrates too much on trying to come up with witty or snappy dialogue, but it only ends up sounding phony. There's an alliteration on almost every page which is distracting and annoying. Nobody talks like that. The mystery is barely interesting, and the solving of it is unbelievable since there was too little attention paid to the storyline and too much on Abigail's comments. Overall, this was a very poor entry in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH, WHINE... Not her best, but still a GREAT read...","review":"Tamar Myers is on my list of favorite authors. I agree that this is NOT her best... Yes characters could have been better developed and it did feel rushed (TM dear, don't let those editors rush you, even though we PANT for your next...)However, this story is STILL fun and eccentric. Ms.Timberlake, soon to be Mrs.Washburn has her hands full of costumed characters following a disastrous Halloween party. Murder and mayhem abound and Abigail is in the thick of it trying to determine how the suit of Knight Armor, complete with stuffed in corpse got under her bed. Bit of a surprise ending, as long as the other reviewers don't ruin it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-roaring plot.","review":"NIGHTMARE IN SHINING ARMOR happily continues the Den of Antiquity series. In fact, it's one of the smoothest and most fun in the comic mystery series that began with LARCENY AND OLD LACE. The rip-roaring plot is lots of fun. The book is easy to read, flows quickly and smoothly, and has a fullness and a completeness to it. In other words, it's a satisfying read. But a surprise plot turn makes you wonder -- is this the end of the series? But no! Check out the next one: SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS. Nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Nightmare, and it Doesn't Shine","review":"Is Ms. Myers winding down her Den of Antiquity series? This one was the worst yet. Abby over-reacts a lot (as she does in several of the later books) and once again the humor is just not there. The victim in this story is Tweetie, Abby's ex-husband's wife. It took about 50 pages before we know there's been a murder, as the author takes us through chapters of unnecessary prose that went nowhere. Abby's involvement in this murder sounds contrived, and we don't really care when there is a second victim. Abby's sleuthing is poor, and her realization of who the killer is is barely sensible. The killer him or herself is revealed at the end with not much to lead up to it, though Abby's face-off with him or her was enjoyable. Abby moves to another town at the end of this book. Let's hope her move benefits the entertainment value in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"C.S. Friedman is the author. OMG is this a good book.

Thade has the look and feel of a true collector's item. His face and armor are highly detailed and as close to movie accurate as a toy can get. The same can be said for the horse. However, Thade cannot really stand up on his own. It's a long, tedious process to get him to do so. The horse doesn't stand well either without the rocky platform. His hands are also delicate and can be easily snapped off. That being said, this is a figure I wouldn't pass up. It is rare to find such a well-made figure at such a low price. A child will be entertained by it, but I feel as though a true collector would appreciate it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor nurse anesthesia exam review book...AVOID!!!","review":"I am a CRNA of 22 years.

Upon completion of going through this book, I feel this book was very poorly written, edited, and organized.It was brief in areas that I believe are important...and lengthy in non-essential aspects of anesthesia. It felt like a hastily put-together book. I found multiple errors that were confirmed by my other existing anesthesia texts. Avoid purchasing this book.

From the book cover (yowza), to the dry whit of the author in the entertaining dialoge of the characters, to the story line I was completely engrossed. While it may not have been a true gripping suspense, the romance is there and for me, it was hard to put down.If you seek true entertainment, you will not be disappointed by this read. It's got it all, alpha male, troubled heroine, romance, mystery.

Instead it was as I remember seeing them live in 92, kind of bland. I enjoy listening to their albums, but Dinosaur Jr. live lacks energy. I was excited when they started playing Chunks, but Lou had no aggression, sure it is 25 years later, but it just sums up what I thought of this performance, bland.The strobe lights in the video are very annoying. It gets old fast and even if you don't have Epilepsy you still might have a seizure.If you are a die hard fan, you might like this much more then I did? I enjoy them and consider myself a fan, but prefer to listen to their albums vs. watching them live.I would have loved to see footage of them in their pinnacle in the late 80's.

Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind. I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now.Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions. Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?

For our California Spanish stucco (an architecture style common in other parts of the country as well), there wasn't a single example that translated.I truly wasn't expecting to see a twin of our house in any book; I WAS expecting recommendations consistent with a much wider range of styles and exterior finishes that would be applicable to far more homeowners across the country, if not around the world.

I read this on vacation and found it a delightful ride. Recommended, and looking forward to the next in the series. True to form, not a shallow tie in... enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"New insights to Monk, but surprisingly flat - if you are a Monk Addict, you need this book, otherwise, read the Hardy boys","review":"Read the book to get a lot of insight into Monk's new assistant Natalie, and come to know and like her daughter a lot better. Natalie extends her place as Adrian's Dr. Watson by acting as the chronicler. For this reason, we get a lot more of her thoughts than we do in the show. I like this Natalie better because I understand her better.We also get to see Monk follow his trash to Zone 9, the zone for very clean trash.But with this, the delicate timing and endearing edge that Tony adds to Adrian is missing, and the pacing of the book also feels a bit flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, true to the character and just plain good!","review":"This book surprised me. Although I am a voracious reader I've seldom found books based upon movies and television series to be worth the time but this one definitely is. I'll let others tell you about the plot, it doesn't really matter anyway for this is part of the story of that uniquely beguiling, frustrating, indescribable man called Monk. The television show rides firmly and happily on he back of the marvelous Tony Shaloub's award winning portrayal of a man with a mission to sanitize and organize San Francisco, before reading this book I couldn't imagine anyone successfully translating Monk to the printed page but Mr. Goldberg certainly has. His choice of Natalie as the narrator makes all the difference, her energy, humor, humility and insight works much better then could any other character in the series at bringing Monk to life. Trust me, this book works, it's tons of fun and true to the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Monk story","review":"I read this on the heels of finishing Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants which by the way had me laughing out loud - to the point where my kids were laughing at my laughing. Firehouse is a good story but it reveals the culprit too soon, misses out on some of the lol over the top OCD moments that play out in the Two Assistants and lingers during Natalie's dates with Fireman Joe. Still it's a welcome addition to my library and stands alongside my four other Monk books (missing Monk Goes to Hawaii). I thoroughly enjoy Lee's writing.

Fortunately, his assistant, Natilie, and her daughter are kind enough to welcome him into their home. Unfortunately, their home is not quite up to Monk's standards of cleanliness and order....But while Monk attempts to arrange his surroundings just so, something else needs to be put straight.

And much to his horror, Monk is going to have to dig through a lot of dirt to find the answer.....--- from books dustjacket"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Monk","review":"This book had several places where I had to smile or laugh just picturing Monk in that situation. I particularly liked when Monk and Natalie have to search through mountains of garbage at the transfer station to find a piece of evidence. You have to read it to appreciate it. And in this book, Monk is staying with Natalie and Julie because his apartment is being exterminated by his landlord. That doesn't really go well. I actually think in the books that Monk is presented more obsessive and compulsive and more difficult to deal with than on the TV show. This storyline gives Natalie a little romantic bit too. And as always, Natalie is telling the story from her perspective. It actually gives you insight into Natalie's thoughts and feelings as she moves through her days with Monk that you don't get from the show. This story intertwines a house fire with the killing of a firehouse dog, the latter which upsets Julie and she asks Monk to investigate. Fun read. I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"juvenile","review":"I was so excited to discover these books, and immediately bought one for my Kindle. The story line is good, and if you've seen all the episodes of Monk on tv, as I have, you can readily hear the conversations and tone of voices. But without that as a mental background, it is very juvenile and simplistic writing. Gets a bit tiring and disappointing to have Natalie continually ogling any hot guy who happens by, acting coy and flirty, making snide comments, etc. It seems to be more of a \\"teen read\\" kind of book than what I was hoping for.

And not silly, either. Aside from the challenge of following the clues, and admiring Monk's analytical skills through the faithful narration of Natalie Teeger, we learn a lot about ourselves through the gifts and the limitations of Monk's condition.For fans of the TV series, I can say that Tony Shalhoub comes through great in writing. I only wish they could have given us Traylor Howard on the cover too, since her character is also a star in the stories.

The subplots in this book are a little more complex than in the previous books in this series and include a mentally challenged man who is found wandering aimlessly, a man in a witness protection program, and a deepening romance for Joanna.

It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender. But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd. Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you. It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.

I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever considered long term care...whether for themselves or a loved one. If you are a financial professional, you should not miss this book.

I laughed so hard I almost broke my knee bending over to catch my breath. He doesn't care, he's got on Spiderman gear and he's three months away from actually swimming in a pool this year. I think it's a mistake to only have one squirting glove (what if your child is a lefty like mine?) but I suppose the manufacturing costs might have pushed this past the forty dollar mark at a retail store.UPDATE: 07-June-2008: hot day at my sister's pool, my man puts it on, and they immediately prove... worthless. The flippers don't really flip, and the hand flippers are more of a nuisance than anything else. The goggles won't stay on correctly.

Overall the CD is worth Getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent at best","review":"This group, the 4 Strings, is a lot like any other trance group based on a woman's voice (ie: Ian Van Dahl, Lasgo, etc.) And, like all of those groups, have a reputation based on singles, not albums. \\"Believe\\" proves it.The CD has a handful of good songs. \\"Take Me Away\\" is a good start for the album, but once you get past \\"Diving\\", the CD begins to lack it's main appeal.In my own view, techno/trance/dance has to find an artist that can make more than a couple good songs. I have yet to find a good techno album where I can enjoy it the whole way through.If you can find \\"Believe\\" for under $10, go for it. Any higher and it's a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an good album","review":"This is not an good album. The songs all sounds the same and the beats are boring and the lyrics are weak.

And there was Angelina and Dj Encore. There were always wicked remixes from Cher and Madonna but now dj's have rocked the boat with great dance floor hits from artists like Sara(Fallen) and Jewel(Stand and Intuition). Just when you probably thought that Dance music could not get any better than this you discover 4 STRINGS!!!!! This compact disc is absolutely fabulous! Give the gift of music to a friend that knows and appreciates off tha hook dance tunes! THis ENHANCED cd also has a bonus music video of the song TAKE ME AWAY. Music videos are a great way to \\"connect\\" with the artists. THis is one the few cds that you buy and not BURN! It is that GOOOOOOOD!

I was hoping for a very spectacular dance/trance effort possibly matching other phenomenal trance artists like Alice Deejay, DJ Encore, Fragma or Ian Van Dahl, instead I got something that was mediocre at best... The only stand out tracks on here include \\"Take Me Away (Into the Night)\\", \\"Revelation\\", \\"Let It Rain\\", and \\"Diving\\". If you're considering on buying this album, BEWARE, some of the reviews on here are quite misleading. I guess what I think is fundamentally flawed in this album, is the simple fact that it lacks variety or substance - most of these tracks seem very repetitive, simple, effortless....It seems like 4 Strings' second album delivers the sort of diversity this one lacks....I would encourage tranceoholics to check that one out....otherwise for four standout songs this CD is just not worth getting...Consider yourself warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"This album is definitely much better than Lasgo's cheap trash.

The music is uneventful and repetitive. As far as vocals, at times I think I am listening to a commercial pop star because lyrics are sappy. I have no idea what kind of music fan I would reccommend this album too, but apparently it is quite popular according to reviews. I would not consider this trance at all and I beleive it is degrading to categorize it as euro-trance because of its lack of creativity.

Of course, it's not totally silent, but I have it in my office underneath my desk. I have no problem talking on the phone or with my coworkers. So when I start having hot flashes, I turn it on, and it does the job. Never had to go above the first setting, yet. (Got it because I share a thermostat with my boss, she is cold natured and only has one vent in her office. I have two vents four time the size of her's in my office, which is the same size as her's. The building we are in was built in 1965. I keep the thermostat set on 75 most of the time, but it could be 80 in my office and 65 in her's.) So, the fan has turned out to be a lifesaver for me. The cost was a plus too.

However, I soon noticed that whereas Ms. Rule provides plenty of local color, historical anecdotes and family background, this book seems to be just a chronological compilation of court transcripts, newspaper articles, and anything else that could be obtained by anyone under the Freedom of Information Act. With its endlessly dull verbatim quotes from this or that legal professional, not to mention the truly tedious footnotes, it reminded me more of a sophomore term paper than investigative reportage. I, like others, found myself frustrated with the lack of a real ending. And speaking of frustration, these are real people--why did I have to go to the Internet to find a photo of them? Any true crime book worth its price should have several pages of photos, and Mr. Schiller couldn't even provide one of the victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"could it be more boring???","review":"If you enjoy reading dry court transcripts, you'll love this book. It is an interesting story but was written in a totally boring way. I am so sorry I paid for this book. I see it sells used for [$]. That's about [$] too much! I love true crime but this one stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"This is not worth the time it takes to get through the legal ramblings to read it. I agree with the other reviewer that it is a magazine article, not a full book. In the beginning it appears to be a very interesting story, but about 1/4 of the way through you realize it's never going to get more interesting. The author seemed to go through court proceedings and transcribe them word for word, without much investigating of his own. Pick a better thriller, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"This book read like it was written by a not-very-talented 12 year old.

It is just so tedious, 90% courtroom dialogue, which is great if you want to fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"He sure phoned this one in","review":"The two stars I awarded are strictly for the inherently interesting case which Schiller chose as his subject. However, his plodding style wrings the life out of the story. The key individuals never come alive--barely any physical descriptions, no photos, no enriching details. It was difficult to keep all the attorneys straight, because none was described in any fashion, and no personality traits were portrayed. I've read better written grocery lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rest of this book?","review":"The facts of the story are quite interesting, but there is not enough background given on the victim and her husband or enough character development of the primary characters AT ALL and no pictures of them. It's hard to find a mental picture of them too. There is just not enough here to make a book..It seems like an magazine article blown up into a book.It is frustrating to read. I'd like to know more background on the characters, but it is not there. I would have liked to hear from more people who actually knew the victim, the husband, and the second wife and less from the lawyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driest account of murder I've ever read","review":"I read a lot of true crime, but this was absolutely the driest account of murder that I've ever read. Throughout the tedious accounts of each lawyer's actions, motions filed, and depositons taken, we learn very little. The case does not reflect any emotion; we don't care about Eric Thomas (husband of the deceased) or about his wife. The characters are never personalized. We know more about the mass of attorneys involved than we do about the people involved in the case. I would rather have read the court transcripts than the excrutiatingly detailed legwork involved in this case.Unless you're interested in reading about the legal research involved with building a case, Save yourself some time and just read the inside flap and find something more interesting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cape May Courthouse","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

But they serve the funciton of keeping them on your head well, even though they dont thoroughly push the unit into your ear.I could live with this if not for the fact that the sound reproduction is terrible. No bass, the midrange is extremely scratchy, and I think the uppoer frequencies are way, way too bright. I often pumped the volume to get the bass, but had to bring it back down because the upper frequencies were torturing my ears.I've tried a number of different EQ settings, but I was never satisfied.

If you dont want your music mangled, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"The sound quality of these JVC headphones are normal, but I find this product terrible for the following reasons:1.

I found an alarming number of stories about violence in the relationships of these women. Yes, many of the stories were positive but they were overshadowed by the sensationalism of the abusive relationships some of these women had to deal with. I also didn't appreciate the fact that one story was about a \\"used-to-be-christian, then became Muslim, and now-am-Christian again and need to help abused Muslim women\\" woman. If the book was about Muslim women, she should have been excluded because she blamed her abusive relationship on Islam and any Muslim who practices the religion correctly knows that it is in no way condoned by the faith. Some of this book just reinforces negative stereotypes that the American public already has about Islam. With so many negztive things about the religion in the news, I would have liked for this book to be solely positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity of Muslim Women in the US","review":"The author does an excellent job of telling the stories of Muslim women in the US, who are very diverse.

In the US, the Muslimah has, as the author said, an \\"extraordinary\\" life, complete with choices, unfortunately unlike some of her counterparts abroad. The book is a celebration of Muslimah diversity. The Muslim women are speaking from their own voices. These are their stories. Through the interviews, Ms. Gehrke-White gained access to the lives of Muslim women like few non-Muslim authors have.

They don't have the gripping or holding power as the screw types but for most jobs they work great. Most of the time I position the pieces together with one hand holding the work and the other putting the quick clamp on to hold it secure enough to install the heavy duty clamps if need be. There are several compaines who sell 1 handed clamps, Irwin is just one of them. Irwin ,however, will not get any more of my money as they are one of the \\"sneeky\\" compaines. I saw the 20/20 show about compaines who use sneeky tacticts and fine print to \\"weed out\\" their rebate forms. They try to deter as many as possible from reciving their advertised sales/rebates so they can make more profit.

From Supply chain, US politics, right to on-the-ground tactics; the General goes over everything. At some points admitting Government secrets (That had probably be unclassified by print time).An excellent book, well written, and interesting.

Aside from this, he has some great musicians backing him up,giving this CD a sound much different than DT. I probably enjoy this CD quite a bit more than the last studio offering by DT. There's a great mix of music and lyrics here that should please any and all rock fans, including a real world song about Slick Willy Clinton that really hits the mark. I always run out and buy DT releases the day they are released. I waited a few weeks to buy this CD, but any future works will be in my player the very day they are released.

Maybe he was lost in the over indulging likes of Dream Theater and he felt the need to really do his own thing. Trouble is, much of this disc sounds like DT. While there are some sweet lullibies in \\"Sacrifice\\" and \\"Slow Burn\\", the other songs have that rocking progressive attitude we've come to know & love with LaBrie's tenure with DT. The first 3 songs (\\"His Voice\\", \\"Statued\\", and \\"Shores of Avalon\\") fire out of the shoot with a hard & crunchy feel. The middle of the disc slows down a bit and then it ends with the least inspired & noisy untitled cut labeled \\"As A Man Thinks\\". Overall a very good effort by LaBrie & Co, and it does rival those early songs of a young DT. But if you listen to the supporting Mullmuzzler cast, you'll realize that their musicianship, tho very competent, can't compete with DT's peerless Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung & Rudess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspect it before you buy","review":"The clamp looks great until you start look closer at it. If you look at the lower jaw you will notice that the hole for the hand screw is usually not drilled staight or in the center.

She did some very great interviews over the years and some should be shown whole and not torn into bits and pieces but at least you get to see them again. It's easy to switch to the interviews or specials that you want to see and Oprah really took time (in her kitchen, in her living-room, her office etc.) to say something to each interview and to the special reports. 4 Stars, although it could be (after 20 years!) much, much longer - then it would get 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"O is for Outstanding!!","review":"I just received this collection as a Christmas gift, and I have to say it's the best gift I've gotten in a long time.While I was in high school back in 1986 when the show first aired, I didn't have time to really watch Oprah and and now as a working adult, I can only catch her when I'm on vacation.(Sadly, no TIVO here)She's proven she can withstand the test of time, who else in T.V. history can say the't show has been on for twenty years and counting?

Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea; poor writing","review":"DeLillo has a critical following, so I thought I would give him a chance by reading this short novel. The novel explores a day in the life of a young Wall Street billionaire, Eric Packer. DeLillo does a nice job of narrating the stream of consciousness of his protagonist and exploring his combination of narcissism and existential anguish. What's missing is any sympathetic character who points the way toward a viable alternative to the bankruptcy of modern American life. Another glaring, and perhaps fatal, weakness is DeLillo's inability to write dialogue -- a rather surprising deficit for a \\"modern master.\\" DeLillo's descriptions of Packer's thinking and internal mental life are believable and sometimes compelling. But what he says and what others say to him is wooden and so bad as to be laugh-out-loud funny.I don't recommend this book. I may still try to read one of his other novels, but this one is a clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"American Psycho\\"??","review":"I think people are just scared to admit that this book is terrible lest they be snubbed by other members of the Book Snob Elite. Unfortunately, Brett Easton Ellis did this story a long time ago - and better. DeLillo sleepwalked through this one - a total waste of time. Not worth finishing for any good reason at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony. Pretentious. Inane. Blase. Uninspired.","review":"Delillo seems to think his \\"observations\\" are novel and deep. In truth, Delillo's \\"observations\\" in this little novella are phony, pretentious, inane, immature, misguided, blase, uninspired, and downright imbecilic at times.I'd offer some quotations to back this up but this book already found it's rightful place (before it could be finished): the trash can of a train station."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I don't need 1000 words to express my lack of enthusiasm for this book, my first DeLillo read. For the first 50 pages I took notice of his use of adjectives, quite innovative. The rest of the book, about a heartless, robotic man who \\"becomes\\" what he \\"sees\\" is nonsensical and cold. I knew what the ending would be, but held back my desire to skip to it and end the torture. Definitely not recommended for anyone who appreciates good literature or is looking for news on the human character or condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well, ends crazily","review":"I bought this book while on vacation in Italy - it was the only novel in English by a literary type author in the bookstore. I knew De Lillo was supposed to be a great author and so I bought it. Also, I am interested in reading about financial figures like George Soros or Warren Buffet.The book reminds me of the movie Apocalypse Now which starts wonderfully with great cinematography and eventually descends into craziness and nonsense IMHO. This book starts well with a high concept and great writing style and then gradually descends into implausibility, nonsense etc. The financial transactions didn't seem very plausible to me and the motivation didn't make sense any more and the events at the end of the day involved far too much coincidence to be plausible.Unless of course the latter parts of the day are all meant to be some psychotic episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cosmopolis: A Novel","review":"This is absolutly, by far, the worst book I have ever read. I purchased it in Germany at a train station where they did not have many english books to choose from. I should have just stared out the window during the long train ride! It was awful, depressing and just plain odd. The protagonist, Eric Packer is not the least bit interesting. He spends the day driving across Manhatten trying to get his hair cut, he meets various people along the way and has sex with many of them. He is married, but somehow he does not really know he is married. The odd thing is that he keeps running in to his wife when he decides to get out of his limo to get something to eat. How can she get across town when he can't? None of it makes any sense.Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DELILLO WHO?","review":"A total mismash of observations, half baked philosophy, unstructured paragraphs, pointless dialogue. Waste of reading (or listening) time.I read this after rereading Philip Roth's Zuckerman books. Perhaps that was a mistake. Roth lives and creates life on the page. DeLillo is off in some never never land of his imagination. It does not relate to human experience. It is artificial posturing, meant to shock, but ends up boring.I recommend you get works by Roth, Updike, Bellow, Richard Ford, Ruth Rendel, among others. Even formula writers like Robert Parker and John Mortimer are more stimlating and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Precise and Thoughtful Post-Underworld Work","review":"I read \\"Cosmopolis\\" more as another part of DeLillo's body of work than as a stand-alone book, because, almost immmediately, I noticed the tight thickness of the prose and felt that he was trying to capture and convey the same kind of depth he did in \\"Underworld\\" but on a smaller scale. This novel is full of perfect sentences that can either enhance or erase themselves after considered reading. The setting and characters are wonderfully suited to the method, a frontier world for the new language DeLillo is still drafting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Abomination","review":"I fail to see how the other reviewers of this book can praise it so effusively without breaking down into school-girl giggles. Cosmopolis is not a novel, it is a form of torture. The dialogue is unrealistic to the point of absurdity, filled with inane observations and non-sequiturs. In fact, the entire book is so rife with irrelevancies that I'd swear a child with ADD wrote it. My three year-old cousin can compose more coherent sentences than the ones which litter the pages of this atrocity. I seriously wonder whether DeLillo actually thought about what to say in his passages, or if he merely rifled through the dictionary and chose words at random. Be forewarned: buying this book supports literary terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fictional book about the dark side of capitalism","review":"It's ironic that you have a film and book, which has undertones of anti-capitalism, depending upon its own success on capitalism. Perhaps if the producers, artists and writers are really against the free market they should just avoid any marketing of the book or film-no promoting, no funding or even profiting - since all these activities usually associated with capitalism have no redeeming value. Now that might have made a more interesting statement than this vapid novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd","review":"I got this book because I understand that a movie is in the works.

This book is just awful. It is disjointed to the point that it is difficult to follow. It feels like I'm reading something with pages missing. The worst thing is that there is no compelling reason to finish reading it. It is boring, and I have a lot of patience. (I read Jane Eyre, and Great Expectations.) I can't imagine how the movie about the same thing is going to be any more interesting than this drivel. I wonder who greenlit this for a screenplay. Then they complain that movie watching is down.

The prose of 'Cosmopolis', for a start, is mannered and laboured, with strange staccato rhythms. The insights into contemporary society have been replaced by platitudes that could have been churned out by any [one] at Wired. And if you're looking for the trademark sly, black humour, forget it -- 'Cosmopolis' is tedious and dry. What a great pity. It is not one's case that novelists shouldn't evolve and change (which is why 'The Body Artist' was welcome) but surely DeLillo is capable of much, much more than this disappointing, charmless volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a tedious book.","review":"I love books and it is very rare that I find one as disappointing as Cosmopolis. I am a creative writing student and am aware of newer fiction genres and even with this perspective Cosmopolis defies explanation. Had it been written by anyone other than Don Delillo I doubt very much if it would have even made the top of an agent's desk. The main character is dismal, and the book lurches too and fro with at the same speed as the car he is in.

DeLillo at his worst, I think, writing in a pastiche of his old sharp style. Sentences are gratuitous, cheap, labored. It appears he visited NYC with a notebook and tried to get down his fleeting scenes. While the plot is OK, it's nothing to crow about. But those sentences give no stunning surprise, no postmodern meaning, no delectable wordplay. Don't get me wrong, I loved Underworld, I liked many of his works, but this one is just plain bad. Head to Will Self's best or Independence Day by Richard Ford -- a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Failure","review":"The concept, a day-in-the-life of a young American capitalist as he sets out in his limo to get a haircut uptown is intriguing. However, the devil lies in the details of which this book is sparingly thin on. The main character and the lovers and American archtypes(anarchists, protestors, politicians, wall st gurus) he encounters throught out the day are, as Melville would say, nothing but pasteboard masks. Delillo is an original writer chasing after interesting ideas relevent in American culture, it is just that in this book unlike \\"White Noise\\" and \\"Libra\\" he didn't do his homework and the book comes off flat as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some sentences worth reading; whole book is not","review":"I went to see DeLillo read from this at the Steppenwolf in Chicago and left half way through. A friend who had attended the reading with me had bought a copy of the book. He read it then passed it on to me. I thought I'd try to read because I've like DeLillo's earlier books (except End Zone).The characters don't interest me, they're flat. All in all, the book has the quality of a take myself too seriously TV series and a shock-fest like American Psycho. This one seems to borrow too much from the saccharine world of Bret Easton Ellis but I don't think that DeLillo really lives in this kind of world (thank heaven's for that). Easton's work is overwrought and it seems as of late that he's written himself out. Compared to other DeLillo works, this is lackluster. He's such a fantastic writer, the sentences he contructs are fantastic. Such a shame to waste that talent on a tale such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American masterpiece","review":"I read this and Michael Moorcock's King of the City in the sameweek or so. Moorcock's novel is a storm of anger, an eloquentBritish take on the modern world of high finance and low spirituality. DeLillo's is a cool, equally eloquent, spare parable on the same topics. It was interesting to read both these books in tandem since both take hard, beautifully written looks at the modern obsession with money and fame. DeLillo has chosen to take a spare, emblematic approach while Moorcock's voice embraces the widest possible vocabulary. Yet both writers offer us novels at their most engaging and serious, the best that modern writing can offer. I've been recommendingCosmopolis and King of the City to anyone who'll listen. Theperfect combination. I love DeLillo and this, no matter what some of the reviewers say here, is DeLillo at his very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone off the tracks","review":"This book is, quite simply, not good. End Zone, White Noise and Underworld are all truly amazing works that show an author at the peak of his powers.Cosmopolis, like The Body Artist, smacks of an experiment gone awry. Suprisingly for someone as iconoclastic as Delillo, he seems to have fallen into an all-too-familiar trap. After the breakthrough success of Underworld, he has begun writing in a new style, apparently feeling like he's done all he can with his previous style.I can only hope Delillo abandons this experiment soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I know of.","review":"It was repulsive, and I quit reading it because the Author must have been smoking dope and dropping acid when he conceived it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good cooking tool for office","review":"bought this for office use. 5 people.Can make lunch automatically a few days a month without standing watch over them.chrome rollers are a plus and clean up easily.It would have been nice with a closed bun compartment though in foil defrosts frozen buns nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Dog Cooker","review":"The first one we received did not rotate.

Told in a similar style to John Irving's \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\", yet immensely easier to read. The plot flows more smoothly and maintains your interest throughout.The story begins like your average detective/crime novel, but quickly becomes a flashback story as the main character - in attempt to write a confession - tells the story of his life and the life of the dead body discovered by police.The title of the book comes from the old saying: \\"In the Land of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man rules all.\\" The author manages to incorporate the saying into the story in a way that will startle and move the reader. An outstanding effort with twists and turns around every corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doubles Wild great game","review":"Doubles Wild is a fun strategy game. Good for all ages.

Battery life is as advertised and sound quality is excellent. A nice feature is that you can disable the stupid flashing light so prevalent on most Bluetooth headsets. I am not sure if this makes it any less dorky, but it means using it in a car at night is a lot less distracting. My only criticism is that there is no way (I have found) to determine the current battery charge status. This combined with the fact that there is very little time between the warning beep for battery level, and the thing dying can be frustrating, particularly since you cannot use it while it is charging. That said, the battery life is longer than you get with most headsets, so it isn't really an issue as long as you charge it overnight. A highly recommended purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of the Bluetooth headsets, but bleh.","review":"I bought this headset as a final attempt to find a decent Bluetooth headset for Skype.

It also worked well with my Treo 650 cell phone.I had good reception for the most part. Turning on radios or other electronics sometimes cause occasional clicks or pops but I didn't find it overly distracting or annoying.The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that the charger is somewhat proprietary. I lost mine and went through Plantronics support to find a part number for the charger. It's 695-19-01 in case anyone needs it. At the time it cost 14.95. This is the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news bluetooth","review":"This product was great for the first couple of months, but now it doesn't work well at all.

Therefore, due to the brevity of his career, only 4 comedy albums have been released thus far. This is a collection of his \\"best\\" material from those albums. Therefore, the material is dynamite, however his material was so consistently brilliant that, in all honesty, any of the four albums are as good as this one. Anything with Hicks' name on it deserves 5 stars, but since there isn't any new material on this one (and considering how much unreleased material must still be out there), I'll give it 4 stars. If you've never heard Bill Hicks before, you are truly missing out on a comedic and philosophical genius (it is no coincidence that this CD is called \\"Philosophy\\". This would be a good place for a newcomer to start, but so would \\"Arizona Bay\\" or \\"Rants in E-Minor.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comedy, But Buy The Separate CDs","review":"Bill Hicks is a master commentator (it sounds to belittling to call him a comedian). This CD collects the \\"best of\\" Hicks's routines from his other CDs. The work is masterful. However, it loses some of the momentum when parsed and compiled here.Part of the mark of a legendary comedian is the ability to \\"compose\\" a comedy routine which is like a symphony, it has crescendos, valleys, ebbs, and flows. Hearing the routine in full gives it the greatest comedic impact. This CD, by cutting the routines up, takes away some of that impact.Therefore, if you want to get your feet wet with Hicks, start here. But please, don't stop here. Go to the original material to discover the full impact. The material is five star; presented in this manner makes it a four star CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We are the Hooligians!\\"","review":"I just bought this CD yesterday. Funny. Some of it was a little much for me, but it had some really great moments. Particularly, \\"We are the Hooligians!\\" \\"what do you mean what am I reading FOR?\\" and \\"Pack and a half a day? Why don't you just put on a dress, too?\\" I've never heard a Bill Hick routine as a whole, but now that I've heard a little I do plan on getting the DVD! The compliation is done really well, too. The only reason I couldn't quite pull myself to give it the full five stars is that Bill only lived up to part of the hype. Yes, he was as funyn as I've heard, but I'd also heard that his veiwpoints were totally different from most comedians. Now, maybe it was different back then, but from what I can tell it's the usual left-wing Atheism that most of the media holds these days. I dunno.... That's not to say it didn't have it's moments. He was a really funny guy. And he's right, though. I've never met a Gideon........."},{"rating":"2","title":"another dead hero","review":"Listening to old Bill Hicks stuff from way back in the 80s and early 90s it is pretty impressive how well it holds up. I mean listening to this \\"best of\\" collection it ain't a stretch to say it sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. Except for some of the references of course - but the humor, the attitude, the perspective is fresh and perfectly attuned to the crazy world of 2009. Probably will hold up a long, long while. Because art lasts. But I have been amazed at how some legendary comics' stand-up routines don't hold up so well. Again Not the case here! Maybe it also has to do with the fact that Bill Hicks is arguably the greatest influence on comics in the last 20 or so years. Very smart, funny, talented man."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON RIKO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ANd I am a living proof: I own close to 24 hours of bill hicks bootlegs and there is enough unreleased material to make one damn good disk. it would be *IMPERATIVE* for someone to release some of this never-heard-before material.till then, avoid this best of knowing that there is enough excellent stuff in the other 4 cd's to be well worth the money.BILL HICKS we miss you so much, come sqeegee our 3rd eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows and Light","review":"Photographer Jonathan Bird's book Shadows And Light will extend your horizons beyond the shoreand invite you into his underwater world of beauty and serenity.

I had to go back to using my medela manual breast pump for a while until I purchased an electric medela breast pump on ebay that I really love. My friend owns a lansinoh and she loves hers as well.The playtex system is a great concept because of the soft nipple shield but that is all, it is just \\"a concept\\" because the product does not work.

What a big difference. It cost more but it is the best pump ever. I can get 4 ozs in 5 minutes.My advise to anyone who needs a pump is DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYTEX PUMP.She has contacted playtex, they sent her new tubings and a new pump and it is still a piece of junk.

Ok, first, I was on hold too long with the product recall line, not a good sign.

As of today it is non-functional and is useful only as a slim, trim paperweight. It will simply not play without breaking up even after following suggested correctives in the manual. I believe the DVD tray is not lining up correctly, but it's simply not worth investing any $ for repairs. I suggest spending a little more upfront and purchasing a simple unit that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop","review":"This product is damaged.

The female lead is not always believable, her motives seem a bit contrived at times but the book doesn't really suffer from any of it. I felt the villains were a little flat, not having any real motives but the old reliable greed for more money. Surprisingly the story still held my interest. It has a mellow rhythm that allows for quiet enjoyable reading. The suspense is there, but not the break neck pace. This is one you can read in bed and be entertained, but still manage to get some sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give this stupid book less than 1 star?????","review":"This was the WORST book! Pure torture. I don't know how publishers can sleep at night knowing they allow books like this loose in the world.The characters are supposed to be complex, yet they are completely one-dimensional. No personality. Dialogue verges on simpleton. The daughter Jane is dull as dirt, no personality, talks like an adult...yet we are supposed to believe she's a 12 year old w/ a troubled past. Huh? Supposed to be this great love affair between Joe, the \\"tough\\" cop and Eve. No evidence of that. Eve is a whiner and Joe is just a cop. Galen is supposed to be some complex, dark, protector. Just sounds like a pain in the arse to me.This book is not good enough to use as a drink coaster. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried twice...but no joy","review":"Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read !","review":"My third Iris Johansen book, seriously worth the read. Couldn't put it down. This series really teaches you a lot about forensic sculpting, even if this sort of thing doesn't interest you, you become interested in it.I love how Iris combines suspense, romance and humor all into one. Well done! Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Body of mediocrity","review":"This was probably the worst book of its genre I ever tried to read. I had never read anything previously by Ms. Johansen but the favorable reviews were tempting. What a disappointment! The writing was poor and the plot was ridiculous. Did Ms. Johansen never listen to a 12 year child speak. The dialogue which came from Jane's mouth in no way evoked a child's speech. The dialogue of the adults was pitifully pedestrian. There were no descriptions to conjure up any sense of atmosphere. One hundred pages of this drivel convinced me that there was no hope for anything better from this book so back to the library it went. Glad I did not waste any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy plot","review":"Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, \\"Wow, this will fool 'em!\\" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iris...Iris...if you don't need the money, stop writing","review":"I've been a fan of Johansen's for years...she has always delivered a good (sometimes great) light read. But she is really starting to telephone it in.You can almost hear her ticking off plot twists here--and what has been a compelling situation (Eve's anguish over her lost and murdered daughter) turns into a convenient way to get those plot twists...uh...twisting.I have always bought her books new--but having just read this one and seen what reviewers on Amazon say about the follow-ups...think I'll check one more out of the library to see if she can redeem herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I look forward to Iris Johansen's books. I got hooked when I read the Killing Game. I buy her books in hardcover because I am always sure that her books will be good. I settled down to read the book and I felt like it was a pile of manure. I find that I am tired of Eve's whining. She has Bonnie that comes to her and tells her things. She should be at peace. I feel like this book was written for money. Pure and simple. From now on I will be very careful before I buy another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"eve is tough?","review":"Gosh, she's tough. She's one tough lady. We can tell she's made up her mind,and she's tough, so she won't change it. She is so tough.....that it takes at least 4 men to protect her, and all she does is whine. Her daughter, Jane, could be sweet, but she is given no friends and such adult dialogue that she doesn't provide the relief this book needs. The last chapter was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Last Eve Book","review":"Actually, it's hard to rate a book that I didn't finish, but it's so seldom that I don't stick with one to the end, I guess I owe it at least one star. I had read the two previous Eve books and had enjoyed them. I was, however, quickly disappointed with a plot that was too far-fetched to be at all believable. The dialog was redundant and unrealistic, especially that of the twelve-year-old Jane. Yes, some preteens are insightful and understanding, but Jane's comments and actions are more appropriate for Eve's mother than her daughter. I will read another of Johansen's books but not another featuring Eve as the protagonist. Galen, perhaps, but definitely not Eve. (Oops, I didn't finish the book. Perhaps Galen met the same end that at least four other characters had already met by page 144!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I am on page #110 and so far, the entire process has been painful. Has Ms. Johansen always written this poorly? There are no definingly manners of speech in her characters. One would think, -beings they's all from da South- we would hear a touch of a drawl on occasion. We really have to make sure we know who is speaking at the moment, because all the characters sound identical.The overall emotion is too bland-as though everyone is on some kind of prescription tranquilizer.I remember enjoying her past novels but this one just plain old hurts to read.If this was an attempt to meet a deadline it is a shame. Her writing has suffered for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me glued...","review":"Excellent story line. This is the first book I have read by this author, and I can't wait to read the rest. Totally captivating from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Review","review":"Eve Duncan is a forensic sculptor, specializing in recreating heads from skulls. She has been summoned to the bayous of Louisiana to identify the remains of an unknown murder victim. She has barely begun her work when someone close to her is killed. What follows is a frantic race to finish the skull recreation and identifying the body while trying to avoid those who do not want the victim identified.Unoriginal story (secret world-wide organization that uses its power to plot the course of the world, anyone?) with uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. Even the dialog was annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first two books...","review":"If you liked the first 2 in this series then this one won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off with promise, anyway.","review":"Iris Johansen, Body of Lies (Bantam, 2002)I picked this up after having the first two chapters sent to me on the chapteraday mailing list and reluctantly allowing myself to get intrigued. The first chapter really does pack a wallop. I just with the rest of the book could have carried out the promise.It doesn't, unfortunately. After the first chapter comes long, drawn-out setup that is in no way justified by the payoff. Robert Parker does the same thing, but he does it in about a third of the number of pages per novel used by Johansen. The woman could use a few lessons in tight prose and how it heightens tension in a novel. But this one's a lost cause; by the time her protagonist finally gets around to reconstructing the face on the skull, will the reader still care? Not this one. (zero)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Written at All","review":"Ms. Johansen keeps trying to combine a love story & a thriller. It doesnt work. The thriller/mystery part of the novel is very good. The ending isn't great; but it's good. The title fits the story perfectly. Please, Iris, stick with that & develop it.The personal love story part reads like an elementary school primer & ruins the novel. How many pages can be devoted to the same soupy lines in the middle of life threatening situations? Throw in a 12 year old girl who has the mind & dialogue of an adult and it just helps the book to fail even more.Johansen's books (I have read 3) seem to follow this scenario. Alas, this is my last one. It's unfortunate. If she stuck to the suspense & thriller section, the novels would be very good. Leave the soupy story to another sort of novel.Buy it used at a cheap price, borrow it from the library, or just take a pass on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one to get from the library, not from the bookstore","review":"Though I've normally enjoyed Iris Johansen's books in the past, this one fails to pass muster. The plot is rather far-fetched (3-4 persons out to illuminate and destroy a secret society comprised of world leaders) but it could have worked if the writing was more vivid/emotional/passionate. In actuality, the writing was flat and emotionless; Eve resembles more a bitter and sarcastic has-been, than the smart, sassy, and intelligent character she portrayed in her previous books. For instance, when a helpful FBI agent was killed in a car bombing, \\"Eve turned and looked at the burning car. Poor Jennings...\\" and then \\"Eve nodded numbly. She was so stunned....\\" \\"Poor Jennings\\" to \\"stunned\\" was quite a reach. You'll probably want to read it because of the past characters you've come to know (Eve, Quinn, Logan, Jane, and Galen), but save yourself the [money] and check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Precious Protagonist\\"","review":"In the latest book, \\"Body of Lies\\", Eve is becoming a bit too \\"precious\\" and is in imminent danger of becoming unlikable. Eve calls all the shots and makes it clear that her job is more important than anyone else's. This is reinforced by the fact that everyone around her seems to tread delicately on eggshells and think nothing of leaving home/job to support her. Plausible? What I enjoyed about prior books was the give and take between the main characters, which appears to be absent in \\"Body of Lies\\". However, Galen is a good inclusion that nicely offsets the neurotic Eve. Jane also has good potential for her own lead, but Joe, unfortunately, is too tragically besotted to be anything but a crutch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eve Saves Iris","review":"This book was just as formulaic as the last few from this author. However, while that problem led me to really rate her last book low, because I just didn't like the characters, I like the Eve Duncan character so much that even the author's stilted and sometimes silly writing and plot twists cannot dissuade me from wanting to find out what happens. Basically, I give Johansen credit for having created very memorable characters(all she needed to add was more Logan and the characters would have been perfect), but I just can't understand why her writing ability has dropped so much from her early books(for example, the Ugly Duckling, which was just great). All in all, if you like the Eve Duncan series, read this; if you don't, or if this is your first Johansen, it will probably not make much of an impression on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"please give her some writing lessons!","review":"I liked the plot. But PLEASE! The writing! Ms Johansen is supposed to be a WRITER! The heroes don't just sigh, they constantly \\"draw a deep sigh\\" (every time they get which is a lot!) Question: Why does Eve often (too often!) \\"moisten her lips\\"? Does she suffer from some unknown disease? Why does she or Joe or Galen or everybody else never \\"look\\" but \\"gaze\\" - and frequently(!!!) \\"OVER the SHOULDER\\"? And how many times can Joe just appear and stand in the doorway? English is not my native language, but I love and respect it. Ms Johansen apparently, does not. Is the rule number one in writing not to repeat the same word twice in a row? Ms Johansen, did you know that? I love to read, but this book is not a \\"good reading\\". I am sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened?","review":"I have read all of Johansen's books and until the last one, loved them all. This book is just plain awful. No plot, no dialogue, Jane is a silly character, Eve has grown boring. If it weren't for Joe and Galen I would never have finished this book....I don't know what has happened to the writing...perhaps she is being forced by a publisher just to churn out books to meet a deadline. I am sorry to say that this may be my last Johansen book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Eve and Bonnie!","review":"The characters of Eve and Bonnie need to be retired. This book is mundane, the conversations stilted and boring. I have gone from liking Eve in the first book to really disliking her in this book. The tough, smart women has disappeared and left a whiny, self-centered \\"girl\\" behind. I won't read another Eve/Bonnie book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful book","review":"I got the unabridged recorded book from the library. I kept listening to it (9 CDs!) amazed by how flat and stupid it was. It's hard to believe that the author has any experience in writing novels. The dialog is terrible, and the relationships unbelievable. The conspiracy behind the whole plot is ludicrous.The reader, Cristine McMurdo-Wallis, is very boring to listen to. One character is supposed to be from Liverpool, but he almost never sounds English, let alone \\"Liverpudlian.\\" The other characters are all from the south, but they seldom sound southern. Her voice just drones on and on. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better used to prop up furniture...","review":"This was by far, the worst book I have read in a number of years. It was lent to me by a friend and I have to admit, I owe him a beer because he made me promise not to burn it and I did anyhow.The dialogue is laughable. The characters ridiculous. A gradeschooler with ADHD probably could have polished this novel. In short, don't waste your time with this book. It will make you hate your self and hate the world.That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue Confusion","review":"The plot was very good, but I could not tell who was talking and who was being talked to during most of the book. As an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading an easy-to-read, entertaining book before getting back to something heavier. Boy was I wrong - I am not accustomed to so much dialogue confusion. The book was poorly written and I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth borrowing from the library","review":"I was looking for a new author and saw that Iris Johansen was heavily advertised in a mystery/thriller book club flyer. I wasn't familiar with her, so I thought I'd pick up an earlier book (this one, Body of Lies, from 2002) at the library. I'm so glad I didn't buy her newer title! This is horrible stuff.

This tale is about a small boy and his family who are facing a devastating illness, AIDS! The author has made his characters so real, so human and loveable that you really feel you know them personally. Some you love, some you hate and others you just feel a little sorry for. You will laugh, cry and get mad, but in the end you will understand how out of the worst parent's nightmare, the possible loss of a child, a whole town comes together, and along with Ryne O'Casey, a precious little boy is finally healed.

Some appeared in the vintage footage, a couple were leaders.The commentators occassionally offer self-critiques but we do not hear anything at all from those who were on the other side of the societal debate, so the film is very sympathetic to the left.It does go on a bit too long.

The ABCD keyboard is annoying, if your going to be making a lot of labels and are able to type a labeler with a QWERTY keyboard would be much faster.What really annoys me about this labler is that no matter how you set the margins, it always leaves a half inch of white space before the text. You can't use the built in trimmer to trim off the excess. You have to go and find a pair of scissors and cut of the extra tape.

Great acting. Great storyline and a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"This film was well-intentioned but ultimately unconvincing. I didn't mind the inclusion of the animation scenes. But their effect was to reduce the amount of time on the live-action parts. As a result, the character and plot development aspects seemed very rushed and unconvincing. The twists and turns came totally out of left field. The acting of Kieran Culkin and especially Emile Hirsch was very compelling, particularly the non-verbal aspects... though I didn't really buy into Jodie Foster's performance as a hard-nosed nun. This isn't a totally irredeemable movie, but the carelessly rushed character and plot development made for a disappointing end to what seemed like a promising film.

Every review I read for this film is just praising it, but it's not deserved. This is an okay movie at best. some of the plot lines are pretty good, but some of them are just stupid, i.e. everything that had to do with the stupid cougar. The acting is very strong, and the mixture of animation with live action was interesting, even though Kieren Culkin's alter ego reeked of unresolved psychological issues that no adolescent boy would ever share with his friends in reality. This film tries too hard to be \\"independent.\\" In doing so it falls into the trap of independent cliche. The ending is just plain bad, and for me this will ruin any movie.

The interaction and personality dynamics among the main characters is quirky. My enjoyment of the books varies by the degree of mystery solving as contrasted with character \\"studies\\". My preference is for the \\"who-done-it\\" element which is less in the earlier titles.In parallel with a review at the \\"3\\" level on this book, a substantial degree of this book is the interaction among the main characters with many philosophical aspects thrown in. Per my tastes, this book combines too many different elements among the characters which was confusing in some places and boring in others. The story practically minimizes the mystery solving to the point of being \\"bland\\" inlcuding the continual references to the fact that the police are struggling to make any headway.These are light mysteries which are entertaining as such.

I have used saws owned by others, and owned very many in the last 35 years. The Milwaukee 6494 has outlasted and outperformed all of those I have used. It cuts 51 degrees left and 59 degrees right! The only other saw that is close to that is a Hitachi, which lacks extensions, and has a laser that shows BEHIND what you are cutting - a lightweight saw but terribly pathetic for a Hitachi tool. All the others wear out fast, are too inacurate or too heavy. The Milwaukee 6494 Magnum is very durable like all the Milwaukee tools. A very good investment and a pleasure to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fine Print","review":"I purchased this saw believing it was made in the USA. The technical data provided by Amazon states the country of manufacture as being the US. I was very dissapointed when the product arrived and found \\"Made In Taiwan\\" on the box. I called Milwaukee and was told the US made miter saw, model # 6494, had been discontinued and that the -6 on the end of the model number denotes made in Taiwan. I decided to keep the saw despite this issue, if the quality seemed good. Overall, the saw appeared well made. However I was dissapointed to find a crack in the aluminum base in an area where the casting was quite thin. Needless to say the saw is being returned, and I am shopping for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"PM, RN WHO TANS","review":"I have tanned for years and this absolutely the worst lotion I have ever used.

Maybe 10 pages worth of stuff in the book was really cute and well written... the rest was dull dull dull... and the cute stuff was sprinkled so thinly that it kept you thinking something good was just about to happen. A come on rather than a read. Unpleasantly so. Too bad because the author is obviously intelligent and could write something interesting.

I figured the drill would be the same quality as the jig saw. Wrong! When I tested my new drill I found that about 50% of the time it would start smoothly and slowly as a variable speed drill should. I found that the other 50% of the time the drill would hesitate then suddenly start up with quite a bit of torque and the speed would be fast. There seemed to be no way of knowing which way the drill would start which is a pain if you're trying to start a hole in a very precise place. I was very unhappy with it, and returned it right away. I then did what I should have done in the first place. I bought a Milwaukee 3/8\\" Magnum variable speed drill. I am extremely pleased with it.In regard to the Bosch drill I've learned that this unit is made in Malaysia, and it doesn't seem to be up to Bosch standards.

The company I work for installs commercial metal roofing and siding and we use BOSCH or DeWalt exclusively. The guys had their doubts about the plastic chasis ( the 1587 has a metal housing in front of the pistol grip ) but so far the 1005 has held up. The switch does not feel quite as good as the 1587, and due to a molded tab on the reversing switch, it is harder to reverse with only one hand. However, the 1587 feels less balanced and not quite as comfortable after a days work. The motor is actually 5.5 amps, not 5.0 as advertised. The DeWalts have not been as durable as they used to be, so we are trying some different manufacturers. Milwaukee makes a good motor, but they are not comfortable, the Makitas have had bearing problems, and the Hitachis are not inexpenive and are not as comfortable. So far the BOSCH, like always are holding their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought this as I was very impressed with their jig saw, which I have had for 3 years.

For the heavy jobs we use our 1/2\\" milwaukee. After three months the internal reduction gear stripped while drilling a 3/4\\" hole (this drill is specified to handle up to a 1\\" wood hole).

It's a much more artistic piece, yes, but I don't even understand Argento's imagery. The acting was worse than godawful, not that Argento's films are known for that, but this was really bad.

Maybe i'm missing something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Suspiria","review":"I already knew before buying this movie that I wouldnt like it, atleast it comes with Phenomena wich is alot better IMO. Inferno is not one of Argento's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to Suspiria.

I can't recommend INFERNO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing followup to horror classic \\"Suspiria\\"","review":"Apart from one knockout horror sequence (with the heroine swimming in an underwater chamber) this movie never really catches fire.

Inferno is not-definately not an enjoyable movie. Ihonestly wanted to give the film a higher rating than 2 starsconsidering the massive signature Argento stylistic input but theplot/storyline is just completely unbearable. The slow pace and nonsensicle structure is unforgiving and the film leaves you drained after watching it considering all of the questions you'll ask yourself about the movie. Unfortunately the film never-NEVER EXPLAINS THE \\"PLOT\\" FULLY. While this is a known factor of Argento films, the plot in Inferno is unacceptable! It's the absolute most annoying Argento has ever conjured up!... Still, Inferno features some nice visuals and the dubbing is really cheesy-but in a stylistic atmospheric way.

As part of a film festival it really had impact on the big screen. Although not the masterpiece that Susiria invariably is, Inferno is a great second part of his trilogy (the third film released next year).There are some great set-pieces in this one and who will ever forget the scene with the cats! The audience were laughing their heads of at the stilted dialogue but that all really adds to the experience rather than taking away from it. Better than most of the Hollywood horror's being churned out today, Inferno will thrill, chill and maybe make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk through the funhouse with Dario","review":"Inferno is a film that will drive you mad if you try to attach too much significance to it. Just enjoy it. It's visually stimulating, violent in Argento's theatrical way, and full of his usual eccentricities. The underwater scene is stunning as is the alchemist in the basement part. Far more surreal than Suspiria, Inferno creates an intense mood. Don't ruin it with overinterpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit for all ages!","review":"Got this game a few years back, loved it at the time, & forgot about it.

I was really looking forward to it, since I love Indian chants and sacred songs. Unfortunately, I found Paul's voice to be strange and disconcerting, the melodies were odd, and there was an atonal quality to the music that made it grating and hard to listen to. Not at all what I had hoped for either, and for this listener at least, quite difficult to relax to or practice yoga with. I wish it hadn't been so, but I agree with the other reviewer who said it wasn't what they expected. Ravi Shankar's Chants of India is a much better CD of Indian Chants with better voices to bring out the sacred aspect of the words. Paul's voice just didn't seem to fit this type of music, which is a shame, since he has been immersed in it for years.

The children singing the songs sound drowsy, like they're on valium or quaaludes. There's just about no excitement or joy in their voices. Boring, with a capital B. Instead, get any of the Wee Sing DVDs, there is happiness and articulation in the voices of the children, and they make you laugh.

Discovered at the Apollo Theater in 1952, their hit \\"Gee,\\" was their best single, reaching number 14 in the pop charts.The Harptones were an oddity because they were not on the pop charts for their entire careers, Their leader, Willie Winfield and his brothers Jimmy and Clyde were more jazz-oriented in their harmonies and arrangements. Wifield's \\"I Want a Sunday Kind of Love\\" was a regional success, but never hit the pop charts and never scored a national hit. This CD showcases a group which full potential never hit a stride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy Does It All","review":"Roy Wood's first solo album was basically a one man show.

As I remember it during Shah's regime, Jews were a key group of minorities in raising the economic standard of the whole contry and themselves. Yes, there were also many Ghetto's and poor areas for Jews and all other minorities, but that was a SMALL part of the story, the bigger picture was much happier, ballanced and positive.

Newman, as the Apache-raised white man, is superb in his role of underdog. Boone, as the archevil Cicero Grimes, is impossible NOT to despise. This film delves into the psychology and very heart of our sociologic mannerisms; the ultimate conflict between good, evil, and personal sacrifice for the good of the many. Further still, Hombre examines in detail the role of the potent in protecting the weak from the diabolical schemes of the evil side of man. A must-see for anyone who appreciates fine studies in character, and desires more than a 'shoot 'em up' type of western..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newman & Ritt make a memorable Western","review":"Elmore Leonard wrote a few Westerns in the '50s that became successful films and this one along with \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" still stands out as one of the best of its kind. Kevin Costner has stated in interviews that this film really influenced him in the making of his revisionist Western \\"Dances with Wolves\\"--and one can see why. A suspenseful Western with a social consciousness rarely found in films of that era, \\"Hombre\\" scored with a solid cast of pros, with Newman in his best Western role ever even over \\"Butch Cassidy\\" or \\"The Left-Handed Gun\\". Though he plays a stoical character who was raised by the Indians, his John Russell finally reveals himself in the end to be a man of compassion even over his apparent hatred of the White man when he takes action to save a white woman who professed prejudice over the Indians and humiliated him in an earlier scene.

Fredric March and Diane Cilento (passed away last October) are scene stealers all the way. Of course Richard Boone (God, how I miss his acting) portrays quite a character.Yahoo gave this movie a B.

The script is ghastly, the acting is absolutely terrible. I am not a Paul Newman fan, as I believe he has always been highly over-rated as an actor, but he outdoes himself with bad acting in this movie. Richard Boone sorrily plays his usual predictable part, exactly the same role he played in \\"Big Jake\\".I hate it when a director takes a movie that could be entertaining and ruins it by trying to make it a PC social commentary. And that is exactly what happened in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Once upon a time, I loved this movie. Recently I watched it again and could barely drag myself through it.

In fact, it looks like the format died out about 5 years ago. For that reason I've been forced to troll on-line and came across this one, chock full of '70's and '80's era pop hits. The remixes re very good, especially the Pat Benetar title \\"We Belong\\" where the intro makes full use of the vehicle's various speakers. The only negative comment (and it is, admittedly, a nit-pick) is that the intro to the Katrina and the Waves hit \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" doesn't mesh well into the remainder of the track and sounds nothing like the original song. Having said that, most of these entries are well known and well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until later","review":"This DVD reminds me of the earliest CDs. The technology is there, but the artistry is not. The sound quality was very poor, even with my TV hooked into my stereo.

The publisher has not the right to make money with \\"Da un diario italiano\\", composed in 1963/1964, 26 years before Nono's death. The performances are not marvelous. And the booklet is full of missprints: \\"Scabia Giuliano\\" instead of \\"Giuliano Scabia\\", \\"fianto\\" instead of \\"flauto\\", \\"Archivi Luigi Kani\\" instead of \\"Archivio Luigi Nono\\", and so on. The cover says that the pieces are sang by the SWR Vokalensemble Stuttgart under Rupert Huber, but omits the WDR Rundfunkchor Köln, that, according to the third page of the booklet, is the performer of two out of three tracks. Coherently, the booklet does not mention who conducts these pieces or who plays the percussion, but informs us about who has prepared the WDR choir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Video","review":"Saw this show years ago on TV when it was first shown.

I think the piece would have worked if the scientific community were involved in the production and commentary.

There's nothing new in this book. At least he doesn't go on and on about his political agenda like he did in the last book but in this one all he does is tell you to feed big pieces of bone and doesn't talk at all about WHAT you're feeding - as in the quality of food. Don't you think it's important to talk about that? I mean, is it natural and okay to feed your dogs hormone and antibiotic laden food for its entire life? Give me a break.

My Labrador has excellent health, beautiful teeth, and a well developed jaw and face.This note is just to warn people about introducing raw, meaty bones in a dog's diet: the dog may need to learn how to eat the new food. If you're dog is used to kibble or mashed up stuff, then do not give it small bones like those of chicken or pork ribs. Try large bones first. And when you decide to go with small bones, *hold them* in your hand to make sure that the dog chews and crashes them before swallowing them.A dog as large as a Setter can swallow a whole chicken wing without chewing, and that's something likely to get both pet and owner into trouble.Also, go slowly. Exposing a dog that's not used to it to bone marrow will probably cause it diarrhea and other uncomfortable symptoms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and understand","review":"Even for those who english language is not our native language, we have enjoyed Work Wonders a lot.

This is a good reference guide for the new-to-raw dog owner. The cartoons throughout the book & on the cover, though, are ridiculous & counter-productive. I have been reluctant to lend this book out due to this... it's just really hard to take the author seriously & believe that he really does know what he's talking about when you have cartoons of dogs holding billboards that say 'I'm a carnivore' & 'Kibble Kills'..... Even though this author & veterinarian has done his research & is very credible, he has made himself, & therefore his pro-raw feeding views, look like uneducated stupidity. (Especially when 'presentation' is what ultimately makes the sale in most cases, as opposed to facts).Other than that.... this IS a good book to have around, & I would recommend it to anyone who feeds or is thinking of feeding their dogs raw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your dog's day!","review":"Very simple book, based on a natural premise. I now give my dogs meaty bones at least several times a week during warmer weather, when they can eat outside. The dogs love it and relish their treat. My big dogs can eat anything, and their teeth are in excellent shape, especially considering their age (over 10 years). This book helped me decide to switch my tiny dogs to a raw diet, and they are thriving. One of the toy dogs gnaws on bones, and his teeth are in better shape than those of the more delicate tiny dog. I'm a believer and have never had a problem with raw meaty bones. It may gross out friends and family, but the dogs benefit, even from occasional RMB. I wish I had read this book years ago! Not for the faint-hearted, and you MUST practice seriously good hygiene. Be sure to tell your vet if you switch or if you simply add RMB to your dog's diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids aged 5 - 7 will excel playing this game","review":"My four-year-old daughter found this game a bit difficult and needed my assistance in solving some puzzles and generally maintaining forward progress to the gamefs conclusion.

It touches too briefly on too many different aspects of quilt collecting, without going into depth on anything. For example, included is a list of names of common quilt patterns, with no pictures or diagrams to tell you which pattern is which. What pictures there are are black and white and too small to show anything in detail.

As someone who is facinated with film-making, this one is a real treat. You truly feel like you are on the set.

Unfortunately, it seems to take itself seriously and with a cast of bad actors and mediocre production values, it falls flat. While the premise of having giant mummies and fallen angels is initially intriguing, the poorly written script doesn't give us much different at all.

The design of the Bosch clamp is such that the vertical post of the clamp is knurled to prevent it from slipping in the vertical hole of the saw base. The clamp also features a quick-release clamping handle that makes it very easy to engage and disengage. To use the MS1226 clamp with the Milwaukee 6955-20, you simply drop the clamp's vertical post into the hole on the base of the saw, let the clamping pad sit on the material being cut, push down on the clamping handle to lock it in place, and cut.

No matter how you look at it, book, TV, o movie, X is just plain depressing, though it would have been less confusing if Tokyopop had released the Tokyo Babylon Series first, since it's like a prequil.Don't reccomend watching it in English, since the characters names were so horribly mispronounced in the movie, I don't care to chance it myself.I don't reccomend ths series for men or people with weak hearts & stomaches, as the sedistic mild homosexuality & gore may not settle well with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better then the first!","review":"This the second installment of the series, and it's surreal!!I don't know what to expect from the next.Here you get to learn about some of the characters from both the dragons of earth and the dragons of heven as well as some events in the present. This is a clever move by the director, you really find yourself connecting with the charecters and feeling for them to prepare for what to come in this enchanting series. I don't need to explain more since most of you have already seen the first DVD and if you haven't... WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!! get your copies now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but it's no X [One]","review":"This DVD is just another DVD of a great series. The DVD X [One] blew me away and I immediately bought this DVD as well. This was almost a let-down. It's not a shot at the series, but to the people who are organizing these DVDs for American release. I am seriously sick and tired of 3-episode DVDs. We all know they can put at least 5 episodes on one DVD and when they put 3, they're trying to scam more money from me. For our [item price]we at least deserve 4 episodes!Great series, but these DVD's aren't really worth the money unless you're really into it. I can't justify [this much] to an episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"As nice as it looks, it doesn't fit properly on my PSP. It doesn't close well near the top...and some of the buttons, including the top two, get jammed in the frame when pressed.

I eventually gave it away since it was of no use to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money...","review":"I purchased this face recently, hoping to give my PSP-1001 a nice Chrome/Black look. Unfortunately, the faceplate does not fit well at all. The buttons got jammed, and it did not close properly.

I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Good for Me....","review":"I admit I didn't have high hopes for this CD. I've had a nasty chronic insomnia for the past several years that has stumped an impressive array of doctors.

But with me, it produced only slight drousiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"Tried the CD twice, and neither time did it help either my husband or me fall asleep.

Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleep sounds","review":"I was rather disappointed when I received my Ambient Music for Sleep. I believe its due to my not listening closely to the sample album. I only wanted nature sounds, ( crickets, water, wind, etc) however there is music in the background and that's not what I want. I'm not sure if they specifically sell, what I desire or not.Annette Hill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It's a big stretch to call this music. A more descriptive title would be Ambient Sounds. It's more like variable white noise, or a low, almost inaudible base monotone with hissing. It may work if you want background sounds all night, but I prefer to listen, relax, and then turn it off when I'm sleepy.I bought Peaceful Music for Sleep for our daughter's naps. It's also by Jeffrey Thompson, and it is music-like a gentle flute and piano duet. It certainly seems to help our daughter sleep, and puts me in a restful and peaceful mood too.I expected Ambient Music to be similar, so I was very disappointed. I can't listen to this CD long enough to find out if it works. I suggest you listen to the sample if you can. (I didn't.) On my computer it sounds like very quiet, almost inaudible hissing. That's what this CD is like. Obviously it works for some, but if you want relaxing music, try Peaceful Music for Sleep instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY SAMMY MAGICAL PROJECT S","review":"This anime is pratically base on the tenchi episode.

The Death Parade Documentary was not included, no behind the scenes stuff, backstage footage, nothing! Just a concert. The concert was good though- typical Marilyn Manson show, so that was GOOD, but what happened to all the behind the scenes stuff?

Listen to Portrait of an American Family, that album is 10 times better than anything they have put out since. That was also during the time they were somewhat normal, their looking feminine era hadn't started yet. I have seen that happen with so many bands, where their first album is way better than anything they ever put out again (ie. Korn, Deftones, Rage Against The Machine).

As they groom Sang-hwan (still a nerd) to become a legend, an outcast Master returns to modern-day Seoul to - among other things - enact his revenge on the Five Masters who used to be his comrades.

The graphics of this game are no where near up to scratch with a next gen $600 dollar gaming system. And the load times were absolutely appalling, taking up to a minute and a half to load. Lots of times I thought the game had frozen. The monotony of the levels was a annoyance that was carried over from the original game. On a lighter note, I really think it would suck to work for Armacham Technologies. I mean, wouldn't you get lost all the freaking time??

After you've run all over for 30 minutes trying to find the one spot you haven't found that happens to be the way out, you hear the enemy has spotted you.Bottom line: Exhausting, boring, and a waste of time.

Many of the Chinese characters just look like blobs (unreadable unless you are very familiar with Chinese or Japanese Kanji). There are no romanizations for the Chinese text. The fact that the book seems to be aimed at English readers who may be studying both Buddhism and the Chinese language, it is a mystery as to why there are no romanizations.Only buy this if you are familiar with Chinese text, and want a book to put next to your copy of Soothill's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Statistics","review":"If you have ever struggled with statistical concepts and books that only partially explain the sources of each variable in statstical equations, then this is the book for you.

One gets the feeling nobody had any idea what to do with this otherwise interesting idea--taking Jamie Oliver's immensely popular TV show and adapting it to live performance.

The seat was horribly difficult to get down and I wouldn't trust it to set on....very unstable. I would NOT advise anyone to purchase this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these boots.","review":"Okay. Definitely order a 1/2 size up. Other than the wonky sizing, these boots were exactly what I wanted and expected. The styling is lovely, the color and leather are gorgeous, and if that wasn't enough... they are super comfortable! The first day I got them I wore them to work and I stand all day at work -- no problems! If I was forced to find something to change...the top of the boot is not quite as fitted to my calf as I would like, but I have pretty narrow calves so it may just be me.

From attributing a \\"Theology of Cultural Pluralism\\" to the genius of Lesslie Newbigin(a phrase never mentioned or documented by himself), to the conspicious abstraction of the word \\"church\\" - referenced only as a nebulous concept with never a concrete embodiment or example, Hunsberger perhaps confuses his own cultural disembededness and concomitant plausability crisis for an innovative analysis of Newbigins so-called \\"pluralist\\" missiology. If rallying around studied ambiguity,self contradiction, and inadvertant- if not ideologically deliberate - misinformation and distortion are your goals, this is the one.

It moves easily from bedside to chair, is easy to clean and was just what I needed for my elderly parent who is mobile, but likes to keep a lot of different items that he uses at his bedside. It is also great if he needs to eat a meal in that area instead of his kitchen. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a satisfied customer","review":"I am very happy i purchased this product. I use it in the bedroom, next to my bed to hold my book, writing material, kleenex, etc. I bought this equipment mainly because I will be using it after surgery. The reviews I read was very helpful in my decision to purchase this product, and also the free shipping to Hawaii. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"This product was purchased for my mother whose sight and mobility are limited. The overbed table enables her to use a TV at a height and distance at which she can view and enjoy her programs from her recliner. The table was easy to assemble and is easy for her to roll to any position she wants. I highly recommend the Carex Overbed Table."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"I purchased this table from another vendor--the table top was welded poorly and tilted down at such an angle when it was put together that anything you set on it would fall off. It also does not support nearly the weight that it is listed to support. The table bounced up and down easily if you put any pressure on the table top. I promptly returned this table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting","review":"This product is definately not sturdy enough to support the 50 lbs it is rated for. I anticipated something of more substantial construction, not a hollow table on a hollow leg. The base is listed at 33\\". This measurement is taken from the outside, not the inside of the base meaning most modern, motorized wheelchairs won't fit beneath the table. This is considered medical equipment, so it cannot be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carex Overbed Table","review":"This table is a nice size & very sturdy for over the bed uses. It is also is easily adjustable to different heights & has small indentations for a cup and things like pecils, etc., to keep them from rolling off. It was very useful beside my bed after surgery. However, it must be disassembled for storage. I was disappointed that it did not just fold down & did not come apart easily to store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and convenient","review":"We ordered the table because I was anticipating having abdominal surgery followed by three weeks of bed rest. The wheels move easily enough, even on short carpeting, that from the second day home from the hospital I could wheel the table over me and push it away.It is sturdy but the molded plastic tray is probably not strong enough for regular laptop use. It has been a wonderful blessing for me, holding my medicines, book, water pitcher, etc. with enough room left for a bowl or plate at mealtimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wheels in box","review":"I received the box with the overbed table in it the day before Christmas from Amazon for an ill family member. I purchased it as a Christmas gift. To my surprise when I opened the box there were no wheels. Everything else looked okay, and I even saw where the four wheels screwed into the bottom of the table so it could be moved, but my box had no wheels, which meant I could not give it as the Christmas gift as I had planned. I had to send it back to Amazon, and find another gift. I cannot say I blame Amazon for this because they sent it to my house without opening up the box. I blame Carex for this. The box should have had wheels in it, and even when I tried to call Carex they were taking four days off for the holidays. You may buy this table but be forewarned it may not have wheels in the box because of some worker's neglect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for younger children","review":"Based on the excellent reviews, I bought this video for my 8 yr. old daughter. Yes, we did it together and felt very silly.This video is geared to the preschool set. I thought that the poses were not held long enough, especially for kids who have had some prior yoga instruction. This video is a great introduction for younger children (under 7) but not for school age kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yoga DVD for high-energy kids","review":"I bought this DVD so that I could do yoga with my high-energy, 8-year-old daughter. She loves it! Instead of pushing her to relax and be calm, it invites her to have fun, and so she calms herself without noticing. The DVD has a lot of poses, more than we need for any one yoga session, and that's a plus too, because my daughter can choose her favorite poses and skip the ones she doesn't like. She especially likes the poses that the parents and kids do together. This yoga DVD has worked very well for us and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought it was going to be.","review":"I was purchasing this book for my psychology class, and while it was the correct subject, it was a custom book edited for the Psych program at Penn State.. which is not where I go to school. Obviously, the book didn't really follow along the same way my class did. Maybe in the info it was disclosed that it was not the original version, but not in the main item listing. Kind of a bummer, and of course my school won't buy it back. So I'm stuck with a book that I have no use for.

I miss Toad the Wet Sprocket as much as anyone, but I find that Glen has shown what powerful and entertaining music that he can make on his own. If you like Toad, you will like Glen's music... heck, thats why you liked Toad in the first place, most likely. Get the Abulum, its a masterpiece. Fred Meyers & Drive by stand out for me, but they are all good tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toad is Gone Glen is still as good as ever","review":"I love this CD it is great you can tell how personal it was to Glen. I saw Glen preform this CD in Salt Lake city in a small club. This CD is frank and honest Glen really tries to tell parts of life just how they are at times. I can't wait for more music from Glen in the future. I would buy this if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, just horrible.","review":"I always liked most of what Toad the Wet Sprocket did, but this solo CD really was just awful. It seems Glen choose to take all of the cheesiest moments of his former band and make a whole album out of those moments. I kept switching tracks in hopes to finally hear a good song or two, but each one was worse than the previous track. I'm sure some people will like it, but since I was always a fan of the darker stuff Toad the Wet Sprocket did, this album was not to my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Toad, but not this","review":"What I don't understand is that Glen wrote the lyrics AND music (at least the melody, and possible acoustic guitar part) to many of my favorite Toad tunes, yet there's hardly a tune on this album that I DO like...Meanwhile, I really enjoy Lapdog, their currently one of my favorite bands, though I do miss the depth and introspection of Glen's lyrics. They were so good together. While I appreciate wanting to go different directions and being true to your own dreams, it's a shame Toad is gone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggh, cough, hack, spit!","review":"I couldn't get to the end on this one either. Lyrics where simple(just plain stupid), the instrumentation sounded like it was bought at a music cannery, nothing special or unique on the vocals either. The 5-star reviews must have financial interests in this CD in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggg","review":"Well, I have to say I'm wondering who the talent behind Toad the Wet Sprocket was because it's not Glen Phillips. I wanted to throw this out the car window after listening to the first half. The lyrics and music are simplistic and somewhat reaching for Country Music without ever achieving that either. If you are a Toad fan, I would caution you before buying this disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was a \\"No Star\\" rating...","review":"ohmygod. I wanted to like this album; I really did. I heard it was bad, but I bought it anyway. Sigh. I am soooo disappointed. Oh, Glen, how far you've fallen. Please bring Toad back. Please? To anyone thinking about buying this album, though, DON'T. It is TERRIBLE. No, that's an understatement of it's atrocious affront to harmony, lyricism, and style. And I am of the Toad-can-do-no-wrong school that even liked Bread & Circus, so you know it hurts me to tell you that. Buckle down and hope for better on the next one, I guess?

What is unique and refreshing about his first solo effort is the fun he seems to have as a writer. His songs may be humorous, pensive, or ironic. The variety and passion of his music is special."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABULUM IS A KEEPER","review":"In \\"Abulum\\", Glen Philips shows off more of the introspective, stream-of-consciousness song writing that makes him special. While the album is a stripped-down set with no frills, it still provides an emotional wallop with songs like \\"Darkest Hour\\". The CD has been in my car for almost seven months and I'm still not tired of it. It's great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya","review":"This could be the most touching love song ever written.

Not as much of the haunting melodies he wrote with Toad the Wet Sprocket, but greater personal depth. He's a hell of a performer and guitar player! Favorites on this album would definitely be 'Drive By' and 'Fred Meyer'. Favorite line on the album, \\"If you think I could be replaced, forget my ear, I'll cut off my whole f*&#ing face!\\" Funny, witty, talented, and deep. I am also buying his other stuff and Toad album to put in the cd mixer at the same time. Look forward to seeing him live again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas but ultimately a boring read","review":"The writing is dry, the characters are uninteresting and indistinguisable, and the dialogue is flat and lifeless.

In \\"Mission of gravity\\" (1954), he managed to write a story that combined an interesting storyline with good and comprehensible science. In the current book, he lacks both a clear storyline and comprehensible science. It is possible the science is comprehensible for a graduate in biochemistry, but I doubt it. If not intended to be a textbook, it shouldn't be that complex. The story is, though based on some interesting ideas, completely wasted in too many details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Life is \\"half baked\\" at best","review":"Tedious reading. The book starts out good and has a satisfying ending however it's what's in between that's not pleasurable reading. The story reads more like a term paper for a chemistry class than like any kind of an adventure. Theories for solving the story's conflict are proposed, explored and dismissed in a way that can only be described as pure drudgery. What I found to be lacking was action, adventure, character development or plot twists to spice up this story. The author seemed more intent upon demonstrating his knowledge of science than enticing the reader. Not recommended as reading for anyone who appreciates the usual creativity associated with the genre of science fiction but perhaps those who like pure science texts would like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much science, not enough fiction","review":"All put this was an excellent book. It was well-written, and had many, many very interesting and intriguing ideas. Unfortunately, it was all bogged down with so much high-profile science and sometimes tedious flight scenes.Don't get me wrong: no author I've ever read has made science fiction more convincing, or technically correct, or has presented a truly foreign planet (or moon, in this case) as well as Hal Clement does in this book.But if you're looking for an interesting *story*, look elsewhere. As a scientific exploration of xenobiology, chemistry, methane-based-atmosphere-aerodynamics, and planetography, Half Life has no competitor. Unfortunately, underneath all this science (for which you almost need a degree in chemistry to have the hopes of grasping), there just isn't a real story lurking."},{"rating":"1","title":"totaly unreadable - clement should be demoted to novice rank","review":"if you know what the term \\"half life\\" mean then you may read this book on you'r own risk, else don't bother. this book is so hard core - it hard as a rock. i couldn't lift this rock - it was to heavy for me.advice for clement - you don't have to use all the space in a page, you can leave some spaces, and write short paragraphs, and try to be considered to the reader - he doesn't understand most of the science stuff you talk about.p.s - when you buy a book try to see if there are good revies about it on the back cover - on this book there weren't any reviwes at all, what says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sound, worse video","review":"Gerald Moore is one of the great accompanists, possibly the greatest in modern times, but as a host he is stiff and affectless. The singers are also among the greatest. The music by Schubert, Handel, Haydn, Wolf, Mahler, Strauss - obviously among the greatest ever composed for the human voice. So why do I give this DVD only 2 stars? Actually, it deserves none for really poor sound and the worst pictures I have ever seen on a commercial DVD. But if you haven't seen these singers, it's worth having a look. For sonic pleasure all of them have made vastly superior recordings, as has Moore.

The product was shipped with Firmware version 1.7. It did not work after multiple tries and multiple calls to the D-link support. The problem was localized to the fact that Firmware version 1.7 is NOT supported in 800AP+. The supported version is V1.2. It did not work even after downloading Version 1.2 from the D-link website and applying it to the repeater. Finally, the support person at D-link asked that I return it.Finally, I replaced it with a DWL-900AP+ which worked like a charm within 5 minutes though it cost me $20 more.NOTE TO DLINK users: When configuring either the 800AP+ or the 900AP+ in repeater mode, when it asks for the remote Access Point MAC ID, use the LAN MAC address of the 614+ (The 614+ has three MAC IDs - WAN, LAN and Wireless).

In fact, it's two somethings: firstly, it can be configured to be a basic access point (no firewall or routing facilities). Hook it up to your cable modem or DSL box, and have wireless access to a single computer elsewhere in your house. To be honest, there are many more powerful access point devices out there for similar $$.Alternatively, if you have one of the very limited number of supported D-Link wireless access points, this box will act as a \\"repeater\\": it will accept the signal and rebroadcast it, extending the range.

It was relatively easy to configure. I had to plug it directly into one of my PC's, change the IP address so that it would be in the same range (192.168.0.1-255), then enter the WAN MAC address of my router (gotten from the LinkSys Administration tool), plug it back into my LinkSys Router, then return my IP address to its original setting and THEN ONLY was I able to see th DLINK on my network.Unfortunately, that didn't much matter because of the D-LINK proprietary \\"technology\\" to do the signal repeating...Oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imcompatible with Dlink DI-713P in repeater mode","review":"This DWL-800AP+ is a good idea: AP and repeater in one unit.The price is great.But check AP compatibility before you buy if you intent to use it in repeater mode.

The premise sounded good, but the book is oddly flat. The writers, with one exception, never really distinguish themselves enough to take on unique voices. The instructor is too stale a character--more a stereotype than anything else. I think if I knew who Carter was lampooning here, the satire would have a little more bite, but as it stands, the novel's \\"humor\\" feels too routine.The brief discussions of famous writers, experimental fiction, and genre fiction are wafer thin. This novel is as experimental as testing PH with pink strips of paper. But who, really, is going to read something more challenging in a popular novel?Still, I read to the end, which may say more about my commitment than it does the novel.

The Hilti let's you get more \\"down\\" on your project.If you have a basement floor to tear up, or something outside, don't think you have to do everything yourself. Find a guy who is used to breaking concrete and see if you can make an arrangement with him to be a pair of hands and get him in economically, if that's your deal.If your concrete is an outside job, just bring in a skidsteer or rent a bobcat: this guy isn't about that.Remember you are likely going to be facing rebar, and this guy doesn't like rebar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good deal from toolcrib","review":"I bought this before Home Depot and everyone else started carrying them.

This particular volume is better than most. It combines a thoughtful popular history of the conflict, part narrative, part travelogue, with the lavish illustrations we expect from the National Geographic Society. The illustrations are a lovely combination of Civil War-era photographs, etchings, and paintings, coupled with more modern photography, graphics, and a few paintings commissioned especially for this publication.The scholarship in the narrative, first published in 1969, is certainly a little dated. However, it gets right the key events and provides a good sense of the nature of the cataclysm that was the Civil War. \\"The Civil War\\" is highly recommended as an introduction for the general reader not concerned with the latest editions of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay for drilling","review":"I am a contractor who uses a rotary hammer a few hours per week.

The rest looks like a cheap TV movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Maigret Afficionados","review":"A man is found knifed in a Paris Alley. He is wearing \\"goose dung\\" brown shoes and not the black shoes he had on when he left home for work that morning. Thus begins \\"Maigret and the Man on the Bench\\".During the long career of Georges Simenon, he published more than 200 novels and had more than 500 million copies of his books in print. When Georges Simenon is on, his Maigret stories are simply brilliant. When he is not at his best, the novels are merely good. This is a good novel that I would recommend for devotees of the Maigret mystery novels. I would not recommend the book for a first time Maigret reader. There are better novels with which to become aquainted with the venerable Jules Maigret."},{"rating":"1","title":"The M.O. wouldn't work.","review":"The premise of this Maigret mystery is promising: A man found stabbed in a Paris alleyway with much more money in his pocket and wearing a different pair of shoes and tie than when he left his home in the morning. And why was he in the alley and not at work? These questions intrigue us and our Inspector as he attempts to find the murderer. But, the payoff is a huge dissapointment. First of all, there are crimes committed, but the M.O. of them is not feasible. Maybe, by luck, it could have worked once, twice at the very most, but when you consider it was used over and over within a few city blocks, it's impossible to think it would be successful. And further, the perp is caught due to police work in another city for which Maigret is the recipient of their determined efforts. He does very little to solve the case. The characters introduced in the book are quite interesting, but the plot and payoff are slow-going and disappointing. Not the best Maigret by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really bright, but was looking for a warmer tone","review":"Bulb is bright, but tone seems cooler than advertised.

The book talks about troubled students who are trying to get by in high school and in life. Most of their teachers gave up on them a long time ago, but there was one teacher who did not, that was Miss Johnson. She did everything to make sure they stayed in school. She even sacrificed her job to keep them in school and off of the streets. I would reccommend this book to anyone that is interested in education, wants to be a teacher, or is a teacher already. It was a very good book, and I enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale imitation of its predecessors","review":"If you are interested n this type of story, buy To Sir With Love or Boys Town instead. Dangerous Minds is simply boring and predictable with nothing to make it memorable. There are a couple of decent performances from some of the minor characters but that's not enough to raise it above the sad script and cliche ridden dialogue.On the other hand, if you have no life experience, are very young or simply have watched very few movies in your life, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It's not really a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, emotional film; Michelle Pfeiffer rocks","review":"The storyline of Dangerous Minds is undoubtedly conventional. Former US Marine (Michelle Pffeifer) joins the teaching profession with oodles of idealism, hoping to mould young minds. The rest of the film proceeds to show the challenges she has to surmount to win over a group of underprivileged, mostly black kids, and to convince them that they have options in life. The plot has the potential to be very tired. That's why this DVD sat on my shelf for years, and I never had any incentive to pick it up. When I finally did, the film surprised me with its powerful, emotional acting and characterization. It also imparted some good values without coming across as preachy. In terms of depth, it was also much better than Mona Lisa Smile, or Music of The Heart (both of the same genre). All in all, highly entertaining, feel-good film which unlike most Hollywood movies, also imparts a dose of good values."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie!!","review":"Michelle Pfeiffer is one of my favorite actresses. I have loved this movie for several years. When I noticed the DVD at [a local store] a few weeks ago I just had to have it. So I was thrilled when I got it for my birthday. I just wish that the theatrical trailer was included on the special features section. But I am glad that the music video Gangsta's Paradise is on the DVD. This film is one of Michelle Pfeiffer's best movies. If you like this movie you should also watch What Lies Beneath which stars Michelle Pfeiffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"dangerous Minds","review":"the best real life drama I have seen in years it is one of my favorite movies it took some time to find it on DVD have worn out the VHS tape I had of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Difference a Teacher Makes","review":"As in \\"To Sir, With Love\\" Michele Pfieffer becomes a teacher and gets handed the toughest class in the whole school. They give her a hard time at first, then she earns their respect. My only complaint would be some of the language, but an excellent choice for anyone who needs to be reminded that one genuinely caring person can make a difference in the lives of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and very stereotyped","review":"I enjoy this genre of film, but found this one dull. It carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief, but fall short of both aims. I actually groaned in response to the predictability, and shuttered at the stereotypes, which were mentioned in another review. At best, stereotypes of ignorant, aggressively dangerous, and perpetually struggling African and Hispanic American students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable, blue eyed, blonde-haired European American belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive. At worst, these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring. This movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both. Further, it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial, societal, and economic issues, which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor man's \\"to sir, with love\\"","review":"This is a poor film.

This one harkens back to early S.King in style and delivery (probably Night Shift). I've read and re-read this sick, twisted little mind bender at least a dozen times, and it still shakes me.

It gave me time to think on my relationship with them and their influence on the lives of my family over the years.The writings encouraged thinking about our relationships with our cats in a more spiritual manner. I did not however, find the meditation segment at the end of each story very useful as they seemed rather limited in depth.I did enjoy this book and will encourage any individual who has been lucky enough to share their life with a pet to read it.

Although having historical background, it is an epic. Roland is the Christian hero who by providence is led into the struggle against the pagan enemies. This edition is a good edition with a strong introduction. Also the translation is great, with a good attempt being made at keeping the rythm/ iambic pentameter. Recommended reading for anyone interested in medieval literature. Also it serves as the basis of other works such as Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous photos, but so-so text","review":"The photos in this book are undoubtedly its strength. It may be worth buying this book just for the pictures. The problems with the text are as follows. First, it is obviously translated. It has been edited for correct English, but some of it still sounds awkward. The word usage often seems strange. I found a few errors, probably introduced by the translation/editing process. Second, it is not clear who it is written for. The vocabulary is probably too advanced for a non-scientist, but the information is nothing new for the specialist. Third, some of the information is too cursory to be of much value. For example, the chapter on diseases is very general; I don't think anyone would find the information here of much value.This book is worthwhile, but I would not consider it an essential reference work. Buy it for the photos, but don't expect the text to be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Drill.... Buy It!","review":"There are many corded drills out there to choose from but you can't go wrong with this one. Here's a very solid, powerful machine which has stood the test of time both in my own work and in the market, and which continues to be a great buy at only $160. It's been a workhorse for me both as a hammer drill and in timber framing, driving large bits through thick timbers with no trouble. The auxiliary handle and the depth gauge are simple, strong, and easy to use. I only use a different drill when I need to do right-angle work.

If you're a casual tourist who is only spending a day in the Bavarian capital, then this map would probably fit your basic needs. But if you're planning on spending a week or more in the city, or if you want to see more than the city center, then avoid the map at all costs.The map shows only the inner city, with few streets shown beyond Briennerstrasse or the Isar. This is simply not acceptable, especially if you want to see anything of the city beyond Marienplatz. There is also some outdated information on the reverse, giving U Bahn stations on the wrong cross streets. This could present clear problems for travelers. I do not recommend this map to anyone unless you're restricting yourself to a small area in the pedestrian-only zone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful, useless map","review":"The people at Streetwise should be embarassed to even sell this map. Its poor design is EXTREME. I was so shocked at its terrible quality because OTHER Streetwise maps have always been so useful. Not this one.

But if you're into some mind games, this is probably worth your time. Set in Bulgaria and the scenery is pleasing; definitely eastern European if Bulgaria is not the actual set. One or two actors are very good; the others average. The plot is shallow and simple enough, but has some twists that bring some unexpected turns.An election is reaching the end game and political forces clash in a mix of old school cold war intelligence games and western influence peddling. The down side is that America is once again played as the corrupt snake in the grass attempting to circumvent the \\"free processes of an independent nation\\". Though not a Hollywood flick, it's definitely of their mindset. A more interesting and realistic view would have been to actually incorporate historical forces that helped to make that nation what it is today.

It appears to have been a hastily edited and heavily cut compilation of a series which was made for Canadian TV, with some disturbingly short and choppy segues from scene to scene, implying there was much extra material removed to edit this down to a film length feature. For continuity, I wish that the editors had allowed the original series to be transposed onto several DVDs and sold them as a complete set - it would have made more sense as a story, and allowed the original intent of the screenwriter and director to come through. Overall, though, it was a good try. Wait for the whole thing to be released, though - the bonus features hint at an amazing and entertaining multidisk story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 Persian Cats Give Them 5 Stars Each","review":"My 2 Persian cats love them, more so than any other cat treat.

When I used this to cut through floorboards and 2x4's it was as smooth as a hot knife through butter. Unistrut and allthread were also no match for this machine. This sawzall also has the new Quik-Lok blade clamp which allows you to change blades in seconds rather than minutes. There's no more searching for a hex wrench to change blades here.I've been using sawzall's for quite a while now and I have always admired Milwaukee Sawzalls for their dependability and durability. The added power of the Super Sawzall and ease of use make this an ideal choice if your building something new, tearing something down, or fabricating something for a job. I would highly recomend this product to anyone who wanted to purchase a sawzall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I get one sooner?","review":"This was one of those tools that made me say \\"Why didn't I get one sooner?\\" If you can't think of something to get for a fellow that has everything, believe me he won't be disappointed with this.

I kept thinking Ive seen it all before with the movie being twisted and twisted in an obvious effort to disguise the fact that the movie is based on the same old boring plot we've all seen before. Even the addition of top actors and a big budget couldn't save it from flopping. I felt a general lack of interest in what was going on throughout the movie but every now and then a LOUD in my face action sequence was thrown in just to shake me out of my daze. During the movie I ended up wanting Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) to Die, and for the movie to climatically end. To sum it up I found the Plot boring and a waste of two precious hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"body of lies","review":"very good movie about the c.i.a . lots of action and very good acting. i thought russell crowe was good but i thought leonardo dicaprio was great.the movie shows the c.i.a in action they are very brutel at times.it also shows how they can followyou how they can track you all over the world. i found that very interesting.i think you would really enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of DiCaprio's best","review":"This guy seems to get better and better as his acting career goes forward.

Against Hoffman's advice, Ferris turns to the Jordanian intelligence chief for help in nailing the terrorist culprit, and nearly gets himself killed in the process.Alas, David Ignatius has created one of the most ridiculous Middle East story lines I've ever seen. But director Ridley Scott also did an awful job. The entire film is unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused and weak for Ridley Scott","review":"I had high hopes for this film. Any movie directed by Ridley Scott gets my attention. Unfortunately it didn't really leave me feeling satisfied. The plot just seemed ... incomplete. It's as if not enough happened.I think my problem is that the plot didn't give me a sense of importance and the characters didn't develop either. It failed to pull me in and give me some investment in what happens. Ultimately I just didn't care all that much.

A disparate disconnected mess of vignettes strung together and all going nowhere. This is a bandwagon film that rides on the whole 9/11 middle east terror news of the day. Insert the Russians, martians, or any such enemy and it's the same junk different day. The cookie cutter techno babble main titles that have been so overused that my dog has seen it too often was my first clue this film was going to be a mess. Insert gunplay, explosions, and the desert, car chases and you can watch this film 1/2 asleep and still write a thesis on it. The attempt at layering in some sort of base moral message into this mess makes it even more ridiculous. there must be a thousand films like this already made and at least a hundred that do it better.

But it just doesn't work (and that's being generous). The role would have been more appropriate for someone like Billy Bob Thornton or Michael Wincott.The plot is not all that interesting, and it was hard to sit through the whole movie. Or maybe it was a marginally interesting plot-- but it collapsed under the weight of trying to believe DiCaprio's character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leonardo Dicaprio is way overrated as an actor; and I can't say that I am fan of Russell Crowe. The story is the same garbage that only Hollywood knows how to waste time and money on. This film is not worth five stars. I am sorry that I had to give it at least one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie","review":"This is a very good movie, it takes a while to get to the action, but when it gets started I think you will feel it was worth the wait. Mr. dicaprio was kind hard to take him as a real CIA officer, russell crowe, played the part of a un-trusthworthy, crummy CIA boss he really sucked, it's might be true, that how they are in real life, it's local is the middle east.

They're further trained at Langley, Quantico and elsewhere for at least a year before being sent into the field.This picture is about one-such.

If you are a fan of \\"Bourne\\" movies, that you will definitely like this one.Set in exotic locations in the middle east, this is a story about young CIA agent who speaks fluent arabic and fights terrorist in an effort to eliminate their influential leader. Mix of cultural differences, bias and pretenion of a \\"normal life\\" of a CIA agent is the center of this movie.Leonardo DeCaprio and Russell Crowe give fantastic performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. Could Have Been Good, but Stumbles Badly","review":"The easiest way to summarize it is not smart enough to be Syrianna and the action didn't compare to The Kingdom.It sort of attempts to do both and comes up neither.That, and a muddled storyline don't help. I'm not sure what to make of it other than the so-what ideas that: a) there's plenty of jihadists that hate us and will kill us no matter what and b) we've done plenty throughout history to incite this kind of behavior. Not exactly a newsflash.What is also completely distracting is Crowe's first peformance ever where I didn't buy it. He's so completely superficial and they pound home the point that Leo's in the desert getting shot at while Crowe shuttles his kids to school plays, conducting war via cellphone. Not exactly subtle.DiCaprio is solid but hardly able to save this mess. Far more superior are the aforemetioned Syriana or The Kingdom, if you want to see DiCaprio in a political action thriller that does hit on all cylinders, try Blood Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Action Movie","review":"This is a very good movie. I loved the casting and also loved the realism. Ridley Scott is at the top of his game (when isn't he) and so is Crowe and DiCaprio.

I will buy it, recommend it and watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Previously impressed with all Ridley's works, this one? Hmmm. Could have watched \\"The Unit\\" on CBS and gotten the same result. Only with that TV series I would have at least experienced an appropriate ending. No wonder this movie had no \\"press\\" - it is definitely \\"less than\\" in many areas. First and foremost? No ending. All it accomplished was to further impress the fact there's dramatic problems in the middle east - that we have no real power over, and probably never will at the cost of too many american lives. If that was the reason for producing this movie, well, it was successful. As an entertainment piece? Nope.

I have to say I think Body of Lies is actually the better film.Scott's films are becoming deeper, and more thoughtful, than a lot of his previous films. The beliefs expressed within this film seem to be the uselessness of acting like a Machiavelli, and that, ultimately, trust can do more good than harm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your worst enemy is your own boss","review":"DiCaprio is a spy. The greatest dangers he faces are not the terrorists but his boss, a gung-ho glory jockey played by Russell Crowe, and Crowe's rival for the command post, a stereotypical brain-dead but obstinately arrogant bureaucrat that the civil services breed like rats. No matter what happens, it is only a matter of time before DiCaprio gets screwed.DiCaprio wants to establish trust with the anti-terror unit he works with, so he can eventually nail the top terrorists. But Crowe is too impatient, and will take any risk, abuse any relationship and burn any asset for a quick result that he can show off to the big boss to boost his career, even if it means getting his own agents killed.It is a very revealing look at how a US agency works, very realistic and a great eye-opener. But the plot gets muddled and the ending is a bit anti-climatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible -","review":"'Body of Lies' follows CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) in the Middle East trying to foil a terrorist plot, while his controller, Ed Hoffman (Crowe) sits back safely most of the time in Virginia. There's the usual tension between young subordinate man on the scene and an old boorish boss far away, a very poorly scripted romance between Ferris and nurse Aisha, and far too many Arabic names and faces. (Yes, most of them look alike to me.) Then just in case you're not already bored stiff, there's political posturing and preaching thrown in. At the end Ferris throws away his CIA career and remains in Jordan to be with his honey - just one more in the film's collection of worn-out themes.Actually, at times I thought the movie was just a long Lincoln ad - every chance the director had utilized a parade of brand-new, spotless black Lincoln SUVs, about as realistic in poor Middle-East nations as me winning a gold medal in the 2016 Olympics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leo Fan","review":"I was disappointed with this movie.

It was kind of hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"big cast with stupid plot","review":"This movie was so unconvincing. A trained CIA agent entrusted to an independent operation in the middle east even overpowering the director in Jordan is acting like a hot-blooded rookie (a girl friend in enemy territory, come on, like \\"hey, why don't you guys kidnap my girl friend to blackmail me!\\" Muahahaha!!!), without calm, and without brains. The CIA boss played by Russell Crowe was a waste of talent as well. The role has no importance. Appearance and decision made were also unreasonable and unnecessary.

The title poem reflects a childhood any child would be privileged to have - a \\"flying pool,\\" a cousin from the South whose words just kinda \\"slide\\" out of his mouth, a Mama whose arm is for holding her child...and for being kissed. What more could anyone need? The other poems are brilliant as well - especially HARRIET TUBMAN who didn't \\"take no stuff.\\" This poem, in fact, is an anthem for school children everywhere, who love a hero and aspire to be one as well. Poetry doesn't get any better than the stuff that comes out of Eloise Greenfield's experiences, heart, and pen.

Jason Aldean and his WONDERFUL band have recently skyrocketed to the top of the billboards and this DVD will give you a good idea why. It is a quality DVD, produced well and of course it is full of all of his hits, plus more. I HIGHLY recommend it to all. I'll promise you that you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappionted in Ohio","review":"yea, i have been getting alot of dvd concerts. and this one didn't impress me much.

Got this blu-ray under $8 and man, this is one of the better blu-ray concerts I own (the best being the Celine Dion one). Eagle Rock has really produced a great concert disc here. All channels are finally used (including center channel) and for 1080i, the video is amazing!! Most of Eagle's rock concerts I own on blu-ray are ok at best...not impressive at all. But man, someone tweaked up the quality control for this one! Lets release more country concerts on blu-ray like this one and not a bunch of old rock and roll bands that should retire! This guy is refreshing and this concert made me a Jason Aldean fan. Gettin all his CDs now.Just glad I took the risk after sooooo many disappointing blu-ray discs from Eagle Rock and I am VERY impressed!Great job guys! Bring on some other new acts for us music fans!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music *****","review":"I am sure glad I found this guy. Love his music but I prefer the audio on his recordings rather than the Live Concert. This will give the fans a new insight into Jason and the band. If your a fan then this is for you....next best thing to being there live. I bought this DVD first and then I bought the albums. Probably should have done it the other way around. I am sure glad I have the albums because I like so many of the songs that were not performed live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason Aldean: Wide open live","review":"I really cannot review this item because it will not play in any CD player.

I think this is around my fifth automatic diver from Invicta. The watch is beautiful!!! The things I have noticed are a different movement. It is not the Myota movement anymore, the Myota was 21 jewels and the rotor was plain with just the name etched in it. This movement is 24 jewels and the rotor is engine turned (or \\"jeweled\\" ) and it is pretty. The screw down crown threads seem \\"rough\\" compared to my old watch, not smooth when tightened. The bezel is smoother than the old and the superluminova is very nice. The band is the same and I wish Invicta would make this a \\"diver\\" band with the wetsuit extension. This is the cheapest price I've ever paid and probably the best watch so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Watch","review":"I own a number of Invicta watches.

Unfortunately it was a big too large for my wrist and had to pay to get it sized properly.Once that was done however, some of the pins began dropping out, so I had to take it back to have it looked at. At this point I'm still not sure if it was the watch sizer's fault, or a fault with the watch.However after this the seconds hand stopped turning, and would 'hit' the minute hand and not be able to move anymore, despite the watch keeping perfect time.So in the end had to return it to Amazon, which did a fantastic job of the return imo.So verdict, Invicta watches are a steal and look great, if you get the lucky one that was manufactured well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta 8926 Pro Diver - You can't go wrong with this watch!!!","review":"Automatic Diver watch for around $80? I could not have asked for more!The watch looks great. Obviously inspired by the iconic 1954 Rolex GMT Master, the design is very neat and appealing. The watch is about +-6 to 8 seconds accuracy per day. Which is not bad for this price range at all. If you can't live with that kind of accuracy, be prepared to spend at least couple of hundreds more.If you are planning to strap a NATO on this one, use a 20mm width strap. The measurements provided in the product description is not accurate. I bought a 22mm strap and it's too big.PS - I wish someone from Amazon would read this review and update the product measurements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good intro to automatic wrist watches","review":"I'm wearing it right now. It looks good, keeps good time(about 3 minutes fast/week) and does not run out of power over a weekend. I'm impressed with what I got for the price I paid. Just don't expect $300 watch however as evident in the wrist band and the links. Although good, they don't have the damped feeling of more expensive watch. The crystal has been good so far. I'm prone to scratch my watches easily but thus far none. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch esp. for the price","review":"Have used my watch for a few weeks on a trip to Hawaii. Dove twice to 70 ft and was in and out of water with it several times with no leaking. Nice looking watch that gets some attention. Sort of heavy, but not bad.Great watch for outdoor water enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"What customer service.","review":"I emailed Invicta for advice in adjusting the watchband and was ignored. I bought the watch to use while snorkling and I got the automatic because I do not think the quartz watches are much different among brands except for the case and therefore not worth the premium price. I am sorry I bought an Invicta because the total lack of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"This watch does not work for me after I bought everything to make it work, after several days I decided to take him to watch where I said it was dry, they had to wash the machine with oil, after that pay for q is fixed but would not recommend even now prefer not to buy these products or maybe I just had bad luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not purchase again","review":"Not impressed with this brand because it stopped working rediculously fast.This watch didn't even last 6 months of gentle wear.One of my old watches I wrapped around the steering wheel of my old truck so I would have a clock in it. Years of hanging out in the truck, hot or cold, it kept working. And this was after I had worn it for years as my outside work watch. It was a Mickey mouse watch I picked up years ago on a trip to Disney. I had outgrown it.I now know I should have appreciated my old watches, wish i had never given them to the local thrift shop when they weren't shinny and new looking after years and years of wearing.This brand didn't last even six months of office wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months... :(","review":"The aesthetics and the apparent build quality is as good as people say here. However, my watch broke after 2 months. It stopped at 11:55pm, which means that the date mechanism broke. The Invicta warranty is horrendous - requiring a bank draft of ~$28 to pay for return shipping and I'll also have to pay to get the watch to the service centre. I've decided to just throw the watch away and not invest half of what I paid for it plus time and energy. Not sure if it is just this line of movements from Invicta as Costco carries the brand too. But this is the last time I'm buying an Invicta product."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap crap","review":"stopped working 3 minutes after taking it out of the boxthe seconds hand stops by the 22 markwhat a waste of money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Invicta Pro Diver","review":"INVICTA IS THE WORST AT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STANDING BEHIND THERE PRODUCT.

Now, I took the watch into the ocean for the first time and it filled up with water. And this is the \\"pro diver\\" version that is supposed to go to 660 feet? 6 feet and now it is a disposable item. And the watch is untouched from the factory...I've never had the back off. After what I went through with the bezel insert I don't even want to call them again.

This watch was as advertised, solid, good looking, and so far, accurate. The heft takes a little getting use to. I'm a little annoyed by the need to wind this watch.

This review applies to both of my Invictas."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 Weeks Old & Leaking Water","review":"I actually bought the battery powered version but because I had already given it a review, it won't let me add another review. I have had the watch 6 weeks. It is now leaking. I saw moisture on the inside of the crystal and after closer inspection saw water rolling around inside of the watch. The warranty required me to send $25 shipping and insurance and it cost me another $10 for shipping and insurance to send it to Invicta. I have over $100 into the watch. I checked the pin and it was screwed down tight and I never took the back off as it came with a working battery. It is a great looking watch and the battery powered version I got kept great time. But, leaking water after 6 weeks is unacceptable. You might want to look elsewhere. And, I don't know if it's even going to be repaired properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta - I love you!","review":"This was fab.

My watchband (all stainless steel) broke at the end and a regular watch repair shop cannot fix it. It must be replaced, so I called/emailed Invicta and their response was that I can PAY for a replacement. The replacement fee was 20% of the MSRP of the watch, which is $255.00 on their website, not including shipping! The warranty that is supposed to be one-year only includes the interior mechanism of the watch. It doesn't include anything that is related to the exterior, including the watchband. I emailed several times to Invicta, and I never got an email reply back. I am extremely disappointed and I thought I was getting a great product that will last. Next time, maybe I should invest my money in something that has a REAL warranty with a real effective customer service department."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I bought this watch for my sons graduation gift.

Closer to the end of the warranty period it became not as accurate as it used to be, and precisely after 1 year it started dying at random moments. The cost of repair now is comparable with a cost of a new watch of the same kind, or even higher.In other words guys, the looks are deceiving.

In this case, the automatic movement began working (after some initial winding) but I was surprised to see that it had stopped in the middle of the day (while wearing it). I cranked it up and again, it stopped after a couple of hours. This pattern continued to repeat before I finally decided to return it for a refund. Yes, its a nice looking watch (if a common and tired design) and is sold for a great price, but I'm now quite skeptical of Invicta's quality. I had previously purchased the very similar (but smaller) style #8932 from another store and it had the same issues of running for a while, then stopping. Which was even more surprising in that case since it was a battery-powered quartz movement (battery replacement was no help). So I guess if you are one of the lucky ones to get a good unit you have a real bargain - if not, you may be out of luck and late for your appointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"Since I bought, I have set the time more than 5 times and everytime after a day it changed its time.Returned it back.

Yes, their watches are cheap, but that is because they are shoddy! Invicta makes poor-quality watches, and their customer service is absolutely atrocious! My watch, that is supposedly water resistant, stopped working in normal humid weather. I never wore it swimming or in water. The customer service department is very difficult to deal with, and mystery charges appear for things that should be covered by the warranty ($28 flat-rate shipping, except internationally, which is $75, etc).

The enclosed instructions include only directions on winding several watches, refers buyer to Invicta site, where there are no instructions, including how to adjust the band. The band requires special jeweler instruments/tools to adjust, and other Amazon postings indicate it is a hassle to reassemble. I have a real Rolex, and the appearnce of this vis a vis genuine is about 180 degrees out.

Good Japanese Miyota movment; keeps decent time without gaining too many seconds over a month or so. Tough stainless steel case.

I've worn mine in the pool, shower, lake, ocean, and never had any leaks or \\"fogging up\\" underneath the crystal front or back. The luminous hands and markers are quite handy in the dark as well. The bracelet is of a very high quality stainless steel with an effective clasp. If you want a great automatic watch that functions like a citizen auto but has the looks of a Submariner, then this watch is for you.Other thoughts: if you have the extra funds, go with the Invicta 9937 model.

Figured I may not have wound it correctly and went to sleep. The following morning I wound it up again, this time turning the crown twice as much as the manual recommends. By the time I got to work it was dead again which is when I decided to return it right away. From what I can tell dealing with Invicta to get it fixed would only cost more time and money, when it should of worked right when I got it! I may decide to order a new one because it really is a great looking watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the money","review":"I've had the Invicta Mens 8926 Pro Diver Automatic for 3 weeks now & I thouroughly enjoy it. It is a great watch for the approximately $80 that I paid. It is sturdy, attractive, & built very tough. I am hard on watches but 2 things bother me about most watches more than anything else. I have large wrists & most watch bands do not even come close to fitting comfortably. The band on this watch had to be adjusted down 2 pegs. My second problem with most watches is that the battery always runs out at the most inconvenient times. This being an Automatic watch, I don't even have to wind & batteries are a thing of the past.. All-in-all, I think I made a great & valued purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch, Great Price","review":"I've had probably 12 - 15 decent watches, but the Invicta Pro Diver has, by far, been the most reliable and attractive watch that I have owned. It's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"WOW! Very nice watch! I bought it for $94 and now its $74. Its a heavy, solid watch that some people mistake for a Rolex Submariner. I'm going to pick up one more at the new price. It will lose time after about 2 days of not wearing it since it gets its energy from your body movement. Hands down best watch for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"After wearing it daily for a couple of months, the pin that holds the safety for the fold-over-clasp broke down. I didn't want to get rid of the safety, so I let it hang in there until it just fell off one day without me noticing. Then a few months after while I was walking, the watch just fell off of my wrist. The pin for the fold-over-clasp somehow broke so the bracelet got disengaged. I didn't bother looking for the pin anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"I got this watch two years ago, and wanted to see how it held up prior to reviewing. If you can get by the concept of the wildly inflated MRSP (I defy anyone to say they found someone selling an Invicta at even close to the MRSP), it is an excellent watch for the value. It keeps excellent time, takes a beating, and the power reserve is very good. Based on the other reviews, I gather quality control makes this a slightly risky buy, but if you luck out as I did, you will like this watch.Update: It actually does work as a diving watch...I took it on a series of dives down to 120 feet, and it held up well. bumped it against the tanks and other hard objects a couple of times, and the crystal remained intact and unscratched."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a watch for looks alone....","review":"I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. We both loved the style and how nice it looks on his wrist. However it does not keep time. He wears it a lot and yet it is always off on date and time. So, if you aren't going to use it to tell time than this watch would be fine but if you are counting on it to keep time this is not the watch for you.I am very sad to have to return this watch because they company would not send a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"May not be a Rolex but it kind of looks like one","review":"I love the looks of this watch, after removing a few pins I was able to fit it to my wrist and it feels just great. The watch is not heavy at all even though it is automatic, I mention this because I have a fossil which is automatic and feels way heavier than this one. It looks very elegant when combined with a nice suit too. I haven't used it much to comment on the time delay but I do have a friend who has a similar model and wears it all the time and he did say that every few days he has to set it forward about 5 mins. I don't wear it all the time so in my case I have to set the time every time I'm going wear it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"invicta men's 8926 pro diver automatic watch","review":"Worse kinetic watch i've owned.

It's a good looking watch, but the quality is terrible. Furthermore, Invicta's warranty is a less than desirable. You have to pay them $27 plus S&H to send the watch to them and I've heard horror stories of people not receiving their watches back for up to 3 months. There are countless complaints on the web about Invicta. If I had to do it all over again, I'd stick with a brand name you can trust and stay away from Invicta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great..

It did not have a saphire crystal like the watch I was comparing it with, but I figured it was a good compromise to get an automatic. Within the first week of casual wear, there were multiple scratches on the crystal that were too deep for buffing. Very soon after, the bezel quit turning so I brought it in to be fixed. Now, three months after the first repair, the watch has quit working completely. Luckily it is under warranty and it has been shipped out for repair. Unfortunately I was told repairs typically take up to six months. Overall this watch has been very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Unfortunately the gift wasn't used for a year so by the time it was taken out of the box, the warranty had expired.

Sent to Invicta Service Center in Hollywood, FL along with money order for $25.00. Sent UPS so I could track. They delivered on Monday the 22nd of August. Heard nothing from the Center. Called on August 31st, spoke with someone, with very broken english, and he informed me that the watch had to be sent to the factory, and would be returned within 90 days. So, I am not happy with the product or their service. Will post again, if and when the watch is returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Value Classic in the World of Watches","review":"This watch has become a classic amongst those wanting a high quality mechanical dive style watch for a very reasonable cost. Invicta automatics use a Citizen/Miyota movement which is very reliable and accurate. Overall, the watch compares favorably with the well regarded Seiko automatic divers. The bracelet quality is worth the price alone. I've had mine for several years and it has been problem free and runs accurately to within a few seconds per day. Upon close inspection, it is not as refined as the Swiss divers which are several price classes above the Invicta, but this remains a handsome and durable watch. For the price, if you like the styling made popular by the Rolex Submariner, this is a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta pro diver great watch","review":"What a deal, I am very pleased with this watch.

The customer service department is very difficult to deal with, and mystery charges appear for things that should be covered by the warranty ($28 flat-rate shipping, except internationally, which is $75, etc).

Major disappointment that this one wouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice watch, questionable quality control","review":"I received this watch and was pleased with its looks and performance for about eight days. It would not stay wound long enough to keep time after about the eighth day. I sent the watch in to be repaired and Invicta wanted $28.00 to have it repaired. I called the company and later learned that they had the purchase date for a older watch that I submitted for repair. I know they must have looked at the copy of the invoice I sent with the new watch because they knew I purchased it from Amazon.com. The billing department asked for another copy of the invoice and it was mailed the next day.

I bought this watch last November here on Amazon.com. The Invicta 8926 replicates the look of the iconic Rolex Submariner at one hundredth the price. I've found it to be very accurate, staying within a minute of my cell phone over a span of one week. It's been fairly durable, only showing faint scratches in the stainless steel case and band. The glass is still flawless.Criticisms are few. The date magnifier is weak and ever-so-slightly misaligned. The automatic movement makes junky rattling sounds in certain positions such as driving. The rotating bezel is very stiff and difficult to turn, I don't even bother. If you would use this function, get the coin-edge model which has a grippier texture.In summary, this watch is well worth it. A timeless heirloom to pass on for generations? Hardly. A well-made automatic for guilt-free everyday use? Absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for...","review":"Is $85 too good to be true? Sadly, yes. The pictures look great for this watch, but once you actually inspect it in your hands, it doesn't hold up. First off, the \\"cyclops\\" magnifier on the crystal hardly magnifies at all. I don't know what the specs are on this, but the date font looks as if it gets enlarged by 15% tops.The worst part of this watch is the bracelet. Again, it looks pretty in the pictures, but it feels tinny, light, and cheap once you feel it in your hands.Basically, this watch is worth $85, and if that's what you were looking for, that's great. I was expecting something more Rolex-like-- a heavier weight and more functional date magnifier. If you're looking to get a better value, I'd check out the Seiko monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Very Satisfied","review":"I am not a \\"watch freak\\" by any means, but I was looking for a solid automatic watch that would keep reliable time.

It took 5 attempts to reach someone in customer service. I waited 4 weeks and was shipped the wrong part. I contacted the company again and was told to mail the watch to the company (at my expense) and, despite the watch being under warranty, I was to send the company a $20 money order to cover shipping and handling for the return of the watch once it was repaired. So what did I buy? A defective watch that they'll gladly repair under warranty at MY expense (I'm guessing the pin costs 50 cents, but they wouldn't send it to me and it isn't the type normally found on most watch bands or I'd replace it myself). I think I'll pass and write this one off to bad judgment.In addition, the watch stops if not worn for a day.Oh well, I guess one only can expect to get what one pays for. I should have played it safe and bought a higher quality watch for a bit more money.

Called Invicta to inquire about the warranty to learn that a check for $35.00 must accompany the watch to obtain service. Ridiculous to pay such an amount on a $99.00 watch after 6 weeks.

But, I can't get use to having to set the date and time each time I put it on. I can wear the watch all day, take it off when I go to bed, get up in the morning and the watch always seems to quit running before the date change at midnight. Bought an automatic winder which didn't help. I still have to set the time each morning when I put the watch on. I definitely wish I would have bought the quartz model or maybe a different watch.UPDATE!!!Now January 2012, less than a year after purchase the watch quit working properly. The second hand stops whenever it reaches the date and does not start up unless the watch is shaken. Definitely would not recommend this watch.

Overall, I had been very happy with the look and feel of it for the value. However after just 6 weeks, I have several concerns. First, the clasp on the watch broke without any significant impact. What's frustrating is that I won't send it back because the warranty requires additional shipping and handling charges for this defective part. Another concern is that the watch does run fast (about 5 minutes per week or two). I have had to reset it frequently and cannot use it for work because it is not consistently accurate. Lastly, you must wear it daily or the watch will stop fairly quickly. Overall, it has not lived up to what I expected and I am very dissappointed in the warranty coverage. Any product that is broken this quickly should be fixed without charge or hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invicta's shipping and handling a Rip-Off","review":"Eagerly purchased to 8926 for only $95.00.

I sent in the watch for repair when it stopped telling the correct time. The watch was returned to me, but it still couldn't keep time. Also, the company's Web site made it impossible to track the status of my repair. When I finally did a company rep on the phone, she sounded as if she had just woken from a coma. I wrote the company a letter explaining my troubles, I received no reply. This is one of the worst outfits I've ever dealt with. And the watch still doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta 8926","review":"I had earlier bought a gold Invicta with a blue mother of pearl dial. It was a bit too much major bling for everday wear so I bought this one. The 8926 is a very nice quality knock off of a Rolex Submariner. The bracelet is very nicely done, very solid and attractively finished. The movement is a Japanese self-winding movement. It doesn't allow \\"hacking\\", stopping the second hand when the stem is pulled out to precisely set it, unless the watch is somewhat run down. That being said, the watch works quite well. It gains about 1 minute over a month. The Rolex doesn't do that but then the Invicta only cost $89.99, not $4,000+. The Rolex is water resistant to 300 meters and the Invicta \\"only\\" to 200 meters. Realistically, even if you were a scuba diver, would you be going down further than almost 700 feet?All said, this watch is a real bargain for its price. It's very attractive, will be easily mistaken for a much more expensive watch and it never needs a battery. You'll be happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch But First One Didn't Last","review":"I ordered this watch a month ago. The first day I wore it, 3 hours in, it no longer worked. I had to return it and repurchase another.The new one came in and I love it. It looks great and is very sturdy. I will be using this watch as my daily wearer as it feels like it has enough metal and strong crystal to stand up to most anything and looks visibly pleasing.It is an easy to set watch and has been accurate. The cyclops magnifies the date @ about 1.5x (not the 2.5x that I prefer). It is a normal size watch.

I was really impressed at first with the look of the watch and impressive packaging! The watch looked great. Only problem was the watch was consistently slow by about 5 minutes. This required resetting the time every 3 weeks or so. A pin in the ban failed and I had to have it replaced in year 1. Then, after owning the watch for 2 years, it died on me. Dead.

To top it off I returned it to Amazon and they didn't even issue a full refund. I didn't put the link back in the band ,although I did return it with the watch.

Mine came and after I wound it up ran for 5 minutes and quit. The second hand stuck at about the 20 minute mark and that was it. No amount of winding, shaking gently would unstick it, so back it went.Oh yeah about the pins, before I wore it I took it to a jeweler to size it and they bent one of the pins getting it out and back in. They appear to be too light gauge wire for the job.Anyway, back it went and since it was DOA, the return was not an issue. But I won't be buying another invicta anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - Steer clear","review":"It's just a simple switch, what could go wrong? Made in China - says it all. It actually didn't work! How is that possible, you say? Because the bottom of the screw knob has to come in contact with the top plate in order to complete the connection. This unit was not manufactured properly. The bottom of the screw did not project below the plastic casting of the green knob. It was necessary to file away excessive plastic in order to maintain contact. A switch like this cannot be allowed to operate inconsistently.

It's very easy to install and use, deters theft, and allows quick connection of a battery charger while isolating the battery from the rest of the electrical system.I tried other switches but had trouble mounting them in the crowded engine compartment of the F-250.

I think people will really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show ever","review":"Witty, funny, best guest stars and an ensemble cast that is one of the best ever which is why I highly recommend it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck: The last season","review":"Only way to see season 5 as Chuck was not rerun on NBC. Now I can watch whenever I want to see a little Nerd Herd action! Actually, great package and was happy to add it to my collection. Chuck was one of my favorite series...sorry to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerd Herder Forever","review":"There are 3 hours of bonus features included with this season five dvd. The extended season finale adds so much to the finale and gives precious screen time to the supporting cast!! It gives everyone there own screen time to shine!! Buying season five for the extra ~8 minutes of new chuck was priceless for me! I am so sad that this show is over, but maybe they will come back for a reunion movie or something. Buy this finale season of chuck and you won't be sorry!P.S. Did I mention that the last two episode have full commentary as well :) All new chuck is great! Do it, buy more chuck...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Casting","review":"The premise is rediculous, but the show is cast so well, that you forgive everything. You simply want to spend more time with these people. Levi is incredibly relatable and Strahovski is so beautiful you instantly fall in love. Every time she enters the Buy More you get just as breathless as Chuck does. I like all the supporting charaters from Morgan to Big Mike. It does remind me a little of Scrubs with the great music and nerd comedy, but it's the casting that puts it on a new level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Picture!!","review":"This review is not about \\"Chuck\\". I love the show. But the quality of the picture on the standard DVD is horrible. I've got 20 year old VHS tapes that look better than this. I have all five seasons on DVD and this is the worst, to the point where it's distracting while watching. Previous seasons came with a minimum of 4 disc and as many as 6, this only has 3 which means they had to compress the video more to get it on fewer discs. I wasn't happy when the ended my favorite show, now I feel like they twisted the knife in me as a final farewell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible End to a Great Series","review":"After four great seasons and an incredibly uplifiting end to season 4, the writers totally dissed their fans and created a depressing and outrageous fifth season. The series 2-part finale went against everything the series had built up over four years. Each episode, from Morgan's ridiculous use of the Intersect to the final outlandish villain, reeked of the writers' antipathy to the characters. I will always think of the last episode of season four as the real series finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be funny!?","review":"There were some clever parts in this show like the \\"Buy More store\\" but, come on Zachary Levi is no ones nerd! It would have been funnier if Chuck's friend played by Joshua Gomez had the title role. Now he's a nerd. I don't think I laughed or even chuckled once during this whole show. I get the feeling I have seen this show somewhere before. I'll skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This show is hopelessly lame. I had high hopes for it based on the previews. The premise of the show has an identity problem. Is it a comedy, is it a drama? It does neither well. Cancel it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"my first review...","review":"I have never posted a review on amazon, at least that I can remember, but did so with chuck because of how much I hated this show. I thought the acting was forced, his stammering geekiness was a shameless rip off of \\"Jim\\" from the office and \\"Seth\\" off the O.C. The pilot was not exciting at all, and the female lead looked like a rabbit crossed with Naomi Watts. It was trying too hard to be funny and original, and it just came off as stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"fan so...","review":"such a big fan of the show. it and the characters actually GREW rather than just got stuck in the non-ending situation syndrome. this final season was a great send-off. worth every penny to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out With A Bang","review":"The final season of Chuck actually went out with a bang. The story line tied up a lot of loose ends, except did Chuck's dad actually get killed off. The stage is set for a couple of Chuck movies, as well as possible spin offs with Morgan or John Casey. During its five year run, Chuck never truly reached its full potential. It retained slightly too much campy material. It could have remained a little more serious and garnered a larger audience along the lines of 'Alias'. All in all, another terrific series has bit the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck lives on...","review":"This is a great story, even though it takes off differently than I expected. I like the way the usual \\"suspects\\" (characters) are enmeshed in the story line and the final episodes with comentaries are great! I've followed these characters since season 1 began and will miss having additional seasons to enjoy. I like the way the final episodes hint at the possibility of an additional sequel, movie, or season down the road!!!The product is very good, the packaging is excellent and the delivery time was as I expected it to be!!!EXCELLENT MARKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"I love the Chuck television show but the picture quality of of these discs is terrible. They seem like the cheap bootleg DVDs that are made in China and sold on the street. I feel that I was cheated and I will not purchase another product from this seller. I guess that is what I get for trying to save a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun tv series!","review":"This TV series has it all: suspense, comedy, and a little romance on the side. Really enjoyed!

But our hopes were dashed by the disappointing storyline. We felt sorry for the actors!

I E-mailed the company, no responce. The last time it actually slid the pan several inches on my glass top range not to mention making a mess out of my kitchen. I have checked and no cooking vents are plugged. I love cooking with a pressure cooker, but I'm throwing this pan away before some one gets burned and I will never buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy at your own risk","review":"I purchased this pressure cooker approximately 7 months ago. When I recently went to use it (after many successful and enjoyable occaisons) I found the pot had cracked about 8 times in a vertical fashion around the lip. I have since found out that the maker (Innova) is not longer in business and the company that has taken over their product line (Kinetic) will not honor the 3 year warranty--in fact, they have not responded to any commnications I have tried. It appears I will have to chalk this wasted $100+ to experience and try to buy another pressure cooker from a more reliable company."},{"rating":"2","title":"It lasts and lasts","review":"I have enjoyed this pot for well over 20 years. It has been a joy to use throughout and it is easy to clean and maintain. It still sparkles like as though it were new. However, the manufacturer doe not recommend this pot for pressure frying, so I've never tried it.The \\"Use and Care guide\\" is clear and easy to understand.This pot is very useful for a 2-6 person family and it allows canning for jars up to a pint size. The quart jars are too big to fit.All my stoves have been electric reanging from radiant to glass top, so I wouldn't know if the pot works as well on a gas stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"No such award given...","review":"In regards to the review given by \\"Happy Cooker\\", I could not find any article or award that was related to this pressure cooker on the internet. There is no \\"American Culinary Institute on the web.

However, the punchouts don't even fit the dolls or hang on them properly! Several of Ken's costumes don't fit (are too short or something else wrong) and Barbie's outfits don't fit well either (the mermaid top doesn't cover her undergarments on the body). The only good thing I can say is that I don't mind if the dolls and outfits get roughed up, since they can't be any worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is an album which has kept me good company for nearly three decades. If you have enjoyed it in the past, you should buy this gorgeous re-mastering - it is worth it!

SPECTRUM is great!!! buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fusion becomes muzak.","review":"IF you're thinking of buying this because Cobham played with Mahavishnu, you're in for a big disappointment. This has NONE of the raw energy or lighting guitar work that characterized Mahanishnu. It's slow, repetitive, mellow (ie. boring). Buy this only if you liked Mahavishnu's most mellow stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the groundbreaking \\"Jazz Fusion/Funk\\" recordings","review":"Almost 30 years after \\"Spectrum\\" was recorded, there still seems to be a youthful interest in \\"funk jazz\\" and \\"fusion\\"; especially now that digital sampling has exploded into the musicworld and e-musicans are trying to create music that is both dancible and sonically interesting. Moreover, \\"Spectrum\\" almost serves as a \\"how to manual\\" for making tasteful music from these genres. It features some very good musicians in Cobham, Jan Hammer, Tommy Bolin, Joe Farrell, Ron Carter, and others. I highly recommend it along with Jeff Beck's \\"Blow by Blow\\". Admittedly I rarely listen to either much anymore, but that tends to happen after a few hundred listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Bolin at his best!","review":"One of my favorite Jazz-Fusion LPs. Billy and gang are as tight as ever and take us on a journey of pure enjoyment! The album never lets up with its fine interplay of instrumentalists knowing when to come to the forefront and yield again. Tommy Bolin's guitar sneaks up on you and then grabs you by the ears making you want more. His playing truly is a \\"Teaser\\" here and shows his versatility. Billy is, well, Billy. If you like Jeff Beck, you will love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another Billy Cobham's greatest !!!","review":"Trying to give an opinion about a materpiece is somewhat dificult but pleasant when assertive. Billy's great versatile personality is well felt throughout this recording. My sincerest congratulations for carrying, promoting and selling such an explendid and rare find, Billy Cobham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album","review":"One of the great things about being a fan of Deep Purple is exploring all of the music each member was involved with. Sure I love the heavy stuff but its great to be able to listen to a genuine wide spectrum of music.I'm glad I didn't listen to this album when I was a callous youth. I probably would have had real trouble with it. As a matter of fact, I made a conscious decision back then (mid eighties) not to listen to \\"Concerto for group and Orchestra\\". I knew I wasn't equipped to handle it and now its one of my favourites (actually the new version with Steve Morse is my favourite).Spectrum would have been totally over my head but as I write this I am totally grooving to this extraordinary album. It's fantastic.I look forward to enjoying this for many years to come and to exploring more from these fantastic artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY BAD PRACTICES","review":"First of all, this book has almost nothing to do with OOP. It has some useful tidbits, such as using custom (server) controls to reduce coding and to increase standardization.However, I cannot recommend this title because of the many poor practices and bad application design it advocates. Why Microsoft Press doesn't insist it's title have some consistency in the use of naming standards, coding standards, application design, etc., is beyond me.The application design is poor or maybe the examples are just poorly done. The business layer doesn't appear to enforce any business rules while the data-access layer is also unconventially designed.Only one-third of this book (regarding server controls and UI design) is of any use. The rest is just junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is 99% crap.","review":"I have 2 bookshelves of bargain .net books.

For component building, I reccommend the Apress! Class design Handbook as a starting point.Despite the inappropriate title, I read on and found poor practice after poor practice. If I were tasked with maintaining the resulting application, I would schedule a re-write from scratch.For a better insight about modern real world n-tier and component development, I recommend any of Rockford Lhotka's Business Objects books, especially the newer ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISNAMED AND NOT PARTICULARLY USEFUL","review":"Is \\"junk\\" too harsh a term for this book? Yes and no.Some of it is very useful, but the majority of the book isn't--particularly the architectural guidelines. I realize there can be more than one way to do things. This book, however, takes a very different path towards getting things done and doesn't seem to fit with the recommended design and architectural guidelines from other Microsoft Press titles.If you are new to distributed programming, this might be an eye-opener for you. However, be prepared to take the road less traveled if you following this book. If you're experienced in distributing programming, you will likely disagree with how the application is designed.For example, why aren't type datasets used? Perhaps there is a good reason for this, but it isn't in the book.I agree with the first reviewer--some of the book is quite useful, the REST is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersection CD","review":"I loved the movie and the soundtrack, \\"JUST AWESOME\\" I totally love everything about this CD.

One star for the soundtrack and decent acting. The other star is for the young lady with the massive breasts.Would I recommend this movie? No.Will I ever watch this movie again? No.Will I continue to waste money on bad horror movies waiting to find a diamond in the rough? Yes I will and that's why you don't have to. Don't waste your time with this one.

The color was very good, even the night shots that were actually blue instead of night looked good, which they actually make fun of in there commentary which has to be the funniest thing I have ever seen.

This was made in 1986.I actually don't think I ever saw this one all the way through when it come on one of my local PBS stations, I must have had something else to do at the time.I was not disapointedin the least. this story has elements of two earlier cyberman stories, \\"Tomb of the Cybermen\\" and the first apperance of the cybermen \\"The Tenth Planet\\". I found the story to be very engaging and it also shed a little more light on the history of the cybermen.

It sorta works, but as other reviewers have noted, it absolutely does not fit my 6934 saw correctly.

Either way, its a design failure. I expected better from Milwaukee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit","review":"I had the same experience as G. Mealhouse. It is too wide for the slot on my Milwaukee circular saw. The problem seems to be that the metal-stamping process left several little 'nubs' of metal along the edge. I will have to file them off.Until I can do that, though, I forced the thing into the slot (skinning a knuckle in the process) and used it, and it does the job nicely so long as you don't want to rip anything wider than six inches. The measurements on the scale are accurate. I'm sure I'll be happy with it once I can modify it to fit properly.Update Dec. 2009: I finally got around to filing off those 'nubs' and now it does a good job. Still a little too snug in the slot but usable and very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit","review":"Does not fit on the saw properly, the blade is too wide.

No rubber grip. In fact the whole thing is metal, even the handle. The motor is only four amps but it still cuts like it did 40 years ago. Now you get the same exact mechanism with a more powerful motor, Variable speed, a rubber grip and quick loc blade clamp. I like the 10 amp super sawzall better ( It has a lot less vibration, a longer stroke and a lot more power and I like the orbital one even more.) But if you don't mind a cut taking a few extra minutes here and there, you can't go wrong with this saw. I beleive that it will outlast any other saw from any company including Milwaukee. It's nothing to see one that has been in daily service for 20 or 30 years. No other saw I know of has even been on the market that long. It must be a good tool or how could they give it a LIFETIME warranty. Where else are you going to get that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best made","review":"You want a recipro saw that will work in restricted, confined areas. This is it.

And we have Dorothy, a young and beautiful woman awaiting her husband's return from war only to learn of his death.Combine these two kindred spirits - a boy waking up to his sexual urges and a sad, lonely woman who has just lost a husband - and we have the centerpiece of a great and sensitive story. Theirs is a journey of innocence and awakening, quite similar to that in Bobby Goldsboro's 'Summer'.

It is refreshing that this power tool comes in a useful case that actually can hold more than the tool and a bit. I'm not big on the plastic cases supplied with power tools these days since they take up too much room and have no space inside for anything else. This metal case is actually useful. The supplied bits are pretty high quality too."},{"rating":"1","title":"lamer than FDR's legs","review":"this film is only enjoyable for the people from new orleans that are in it or have friends in it, and even then the amount of enjoyment derived is quite limited. not enough substance, way too drawn out, and somewhat boring... might be better if watched while under the influence (like many of the folks IN the film seem to be), but just a drag to watch sober.also, saying this film stars josh wink is a HUGE misnomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I got this dvd three days ago and have watched it five times already. Yes, it's possible that this movie will appeal more to members of the new orleans rave scene, but others will enjoy it as well. It starts out by introducing a few members of the scene, including disco donnie, a few well-known ravers and a weird rave performer. After a little background and party set up info, it goes right into the good stuff, the state palace party, which I think was freakfest. The video was edited quite well and recreated the feeling of a party at the palace, and then at the peak of the party the graphics start getting crazy and kind of made me feel like I was at the peak of a roll. I will keep this dvd forever to bring back memories of all the good times I have had in that venue. If you've ever been to a party in New Orleans, or want some insight into the culture here, this is a must-buy. BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's o.k.","review":"Not the best documentary that I've seen, but it has it's parts. The most interesting part, in my opinion, of this film is that it's the beginning of the Rave Act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead.","review":"This could have been made a whole lot better. I'm certain it wasn't fair for all those talented DJ's and musicians to be a part of this movie, because it wasn't put together the way you'd think. It's not a documentary on how Disco Donnie was put on trial or anything, it's more like \\"Here's 3 Easy Steps On Becoming A Raver: Nevermind those Freaks\\" The soundtrack is pretty good, with Q-Bert and Crystal Method, but the whole package really isn't up to par with Groove, Human Traffic, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message is lost in words","review":"More than half of the book consists of quoting what other people have said. In remaining few pages the author goes on repeating the same things again and again in different words and ways. In the end the reader is left with little to hold on to besides words. It si better to use this time to meditate instead. If you must read, you may want to try \\"You have to say something\\" book:You Have to Say Something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great As A Companion to Two Other Books","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers here. This book has some terrific insights. It can be very useful if it is considered alongside some books that are more focused on understanding human nature. The two best books in that area are Haidt's, The Happiness Hypothesis, and Wilson's, Healing The Unhappy Caveman.While Ricard is correct that getting outside of yourself is the key to happiness, most people will have a hard time succeeding at what he recommends without understanding what is built into the human mind and how to work with and around those \\"mental appliances.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy.","review":"The book arrived speedily and in excellent condition. I have already read more than half of it and find it most informative. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"The books kind of complicated and requires a lot of reading.

He then was able to afford to go to Nepal to study Tibetan Buddism and supported himself. This took him quite a number of pages to say. By the time he was ready to discuss the book's subject, I was quite depressed and could read no further. This negated the promise and premise of the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Last Minute Term Paper","review":"This book reads like a undergrad student's last minute term paper. It is sophomoric, bland and lacks critical analysis. It does not so much talk about the practical applications of 'happiness' as to discuss the dictionary meanings of it in every language and culture. Boring and useless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buddhist book i have read.","review":"Nothing in this book is unique but the delivery and focus of the book are really special.The author believes that through how we approach what happens in life and the choices we make very much affect how we feel. These are not new concepts and certainly science supports his point of view.The strength of this book is that the author presents an argument about why we should follow the ideas contained within. Information he draws from sociology, psychology and brain science is presented along side real life anecdotes and ancient wisdom. This allowed me to see the relevance of what he is saying, to the choices i make in my own life.There is a difference between knowing what to do and actually doing it. For me this book was the motivation to do what i know to be beneficial for my well-being.Also I really loved the description of the \\"Three kinds of laziness\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiness by Matthieu Ricard","review":"Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important SkillThis is the best book I have ever read on the subject of happiness.

Also addresses why it is okay to seek and nurture your own happiness. Spoiler alert: Matthieu Ricard is the Buddhist monk who is mentioned in the book as an anonymous meditator who showed total control - unperturbed by the sound of a gunshot while being monitored by a functional MRI machine, physiology never before seen by scientists nor replicated by any other; proof positive of the plasticity potential to grow and change of the human brain.

Now that the black one has road rash, I've replaced it with this clear one. I like that the keyboard lighting shows through the clear cover, so it's more usable in low light conditions. This one also was manufactured without a hole to let the sounds out the top, but was easily modified with some sharp scissors.

I wish that Jude Deveraux had written her characters with more depth. So many of the stories started off strong and somehow at the end its like she got bored and slapped on a happy ending.Also at the end of the book Jude Deverax does a short epilogue to tell you what happened to everyone and I just couldn't believe how pat she made everything at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series","review":"Jude saved the best for last. I loved the whole series, but this was my favorite. I hate to see the series end. I found myself wishing that there were a couple of more brothers to marry off. I also love how strong and intelligent the women are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read a few JD books since the beginning of the year and I have really loved some of the others such as the Heiress and the Raider but I found Velvet Angel rather disappointing. I didn't like Elizabeth and I thought that Miles must have been a real \\"goer\\" to have had already 3 children at the tender age of 20! I suppose they didn't have contraception in those days. Still it's not very romantic to read that the hero has so many children running around already even before he has met the heroine! I didn't think much of the plot either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad story","review":"When I read this book, I felt like the author was under a deadline to get it into the publisher. There is little character development, and the plot is ridiculous, even for a romance. And then there are the multiple endings. I count four endings. And I didn't really like the main characters and the endings became cartoonish. There was sex, but no real heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first two!","review":"After reading \\"Velvet Promise\\" and \\"Highland Velvet\\", I must say that I was disappointed by this book.
