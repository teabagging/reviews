I really enjoyed it and passed it on to a friend. It was so nice to read a positive book with a Catholic theme. My friend enjoyed it as well. I highly recommend this book and I am excited to read the others in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"If you are a fan of The Mitford Series, I think you will also enjoy A Miracle For St. Cecilia's. Set in a quaint, charming, New England town, you will meet an endearing set of characters, both parishoners at St. Cecilia's, as well as the towns folk of Dorsetville. Leading the parishoners of St. Cecilia's is Father James, who learns that St. Cecilia's doors will be closed due to lack of funds. Heart-broken, Father James is distressed at what will happen to his St. Cecilia's family, who rely on the church and their friendships there, to get through life's struggles.Katherine Valentine is a gifted writer, though her style is simple, it is wonderfully easy to read, and creates a true warmth and feeling of comfort. Even though it did seem a lot like the Mitford series, it was still creative in the story lines, entertaining and insightful. For those with Christian roots, it provides some strong messages of faith & hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Mitford!","review":"This was such a wonderful book. Do not listen to those who accuse the author of copying the Mitford series. I enjoyed the Jan Karon series but I LOVE this one. You will not be disappointed. The uplifting message of faith and hope filled my spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"This book was sweet and innocent, which are hard qualities to find today. It had lots of little giggles along the way. I recommend it. Catholics will really love it. There are lots of religious mentions throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sure if I would recommend...","review":"I ordered this book for my stepdaughter and opened it to find subject matter regarding the pleasures of masturbation and how to shave pubic hair. I would have liked to have known this before purchasing the book. No where does it say that these topics are covered. The book is supposed to be about journaling ideas for young women not lessons on the birds and bees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely written!","review":"This was a pretty good book. I liked it because the author had a good knowlage of her subject and she wrote it very well. This book inspired me to write a journal! I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating and Informative","review":"This book is excellent for anyone with a serious interest in Chinese religions. It traces the development of Chinese mystical thought and practice from the earliest mystical and philosophical writings up through the Tang dynasty. In addition to its appeal to the scholarly community, anyone who has read and enjoyed some of the works of Chinese mysticism will find that this book provides a background in which to better understand what they have already read as well as exposing them to works they are not yet familiar with. All in all an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judgement Time","review":"Love this game. Best Dredd game to date.

I concur with Dudley Tate'sreview in that aspect. This piece is very easy to watch,and the extended battle between the horse and the blackbear is the only violence in it.As to the quality of the print, however, I must disagree.This film was obviously not shot on Kodachrome. Theprint used to make the DVD has faded heavily towardred and green tones, and no amount of adjusting of color,tint, contrast, or brightness on my set could restorea full color spectrum. But that is minor.For its intended audience, it succeeds wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glasses","review":"I've had these glasses for close to 2 years and they are great. I work at a rock crusher so for them to last this long with very few scratches is amazing. I don't baby them, they get thrown on the seat of the pickup and kicked around. I also wear them when I ride my motorcycle and they are perfect for that as well, good visibility with little distortion and good ventilation. The only fault I have with them is they are not offered with an amber/blublocker type of lens for times with lower lighting when you still want sunglasses. I just bought another pair for me and one for a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on man, these are so stupid looking","review":"I thought these looked cool but once I got them I realized they look sooo stupid.

I got it in a vroman's bookstore. Bookstores are rare these days and I appreciate them so much, and I often find they have very exciting products due to the competitiveness of online book shopping. But I believe this product should be taken off the shelves, because I didn't get anything out of it. My musical sense leads me to listen to different things for calming, healing, energisisng etc. I plan on getting a refund. But,I see that everyone else has put excellent reviews, so maybe they are getting something out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Medicine: Brainwave Massage","review":"This is a great CD.

These CDs are better than drugs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit properly","review":"I bought this to protect my ipod nano. What a dissappointment. The case fits fine, but the problem is you can't plug anything into your ipod with the case on. I tried both my earbuds and my idog and I couldn't hear through either one. The case does not allow enough room for the cord to plug in properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these other reviews written by friends of the author?,","review":"I notice all of them only have one review each. Oh well conspiracy theories aside, Overpriced the book doesn't deliver what it promises. Brief superficial over view of animation, more of the book is given to listing past animators, Than any current how-to info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oft overlooked Goth band","review":"For those who like 80s Goth music (e.g. Joy Division, And Also the Trees, Death in June, etc.) here is a band that you should check out. While never receiving much attention in the US (largely due to distribution issues) the one album they put out with the great WaxTrax label is available here. It is surely worth purchasing just for the song \\"When Will it be Me\\"...a classic lament about fate and fortune passing one over time and time again. Other great songs on the album include \\"Waiting for a Friend,\\" \\"Summers Die\\" and \\"I Send You My Tears.\\" Rest assured that if you want to broaden your collection of Goth music you should buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes the fun out of screenwriting","review":"I found this book to be cluttered up with rules and what not.

The information contained in this book is invaluable for anyone attempting to trace the roots of the current troubles in Northern Ireland, or with any serious interest in the history of this troubled island. This book is not for the casual reader, as Elliot's dry academic style could grow wearisome for those looking for a light, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Sister","review":"I am new to leading a women's ministry group and this book has helped tremendously.

It's called fyshese and it will tear a whole through your head. The things you thought you knew will seem pale and arcane as you whiz through the playful and pensive mind of fyshe as she travels up the stream of consciousness to the source of all of love and beauty and decay, searching for the meanings of life. Trading in the decadence of los angeles for a life of substance (abuse) in bohemian europe, this party animal does it all and lives to write about it. we thank fyshe for her contributions to the body of work, and hope you will enjoy looking into her crystal bowl. I can not wait to see this up in film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"As a postgraduate student of English Literature, about to start my PhD, I was disgusted to read this excuse for a waste of paper. 'Fysche' claims to have invented a new form of English, when in actual fact Geoffrey Chaucer spelt and wrote more legibly, and was a great deal funnier. 'Fysche' has merely combined text messaging slang with 'netspeak'. This makes little to no sense at best, and reads worse than written work produced by kindergarten-aged children.I am extremely glad that I did not have to pay over $20 to read this immaturely-written, inane rubbish, instead I borrowed a copy but I regret the few cents I spent on gas to get to the college library and back.Anyone who has even the most basic grounding in English literature and/or language should avoid this book. Literature is supposed to be coherent and well-structured, not resembling a linguistic train-wreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific buy","review":"I've been using my Sony DVD player for a year now, almost daily, and I love it. I used to watch movies on my computer, but when I wanted to watch them on a TV set I went for a $29 DVD player at Target. It had no picture and audio options and died in less than two weeks. Sony's player is full of options to customize your viewing experience perfectly to any equipment setup you have. This is a sound investment and my prior, outstanding experience with Sony's customer service gives me a lot of peace of mind because I know that even if the thing dies in a few years, they will fix it or buy it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"semi- DOA","review":"It won't respond to the remote. (I know the remote is working, because it controls my other Sony DVD player) Furthermore, the front panel display works only intermittently.I will now see how good the seller is about taking it back and giving me a full refund. (I just went to Walmart and got an NS57p for the same price.) I'll post on how helpful they are. If they make it easy for me to send back for a full refund, I'll give the seller a top rating. Otherwise ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Player","review":"The DVPNS55P is good, solid basic player. The component video outputs provide an excellent picture - very acceptable for an HD Big sceen. It's compact size - (it's very thin) make it a good choice for those needing to save space, and may provide better performance than many TV/ DVD combinations. Overall it is a good choice for those who don't need a lot of \\"bells and whistles\\" or as a good value for a 2nd DVD for a bedroom TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"couch potato","review":"Although I have had this player a short time, it has played every DVD I have put in it including my wifes Thai DVDs. The Panasonic combo DVD/VCR player that this Sony replaced would not play any of my wifes DVDs and on occasion would not read some of mine until I reinserted the DVD. (to be fair to Panasonic, the VCR section of the player worked fine and the sound and picture were both good). Getting back to the Sony player, the sound and picture quality is great and seems to be an excellent match for my 36\\" Sony TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"The Sony DVPNS55P/S Single Disc DVD player has worked wonderfully for me. The only bad part about its that it only holds one DVD at a time. Other then that it works with all DVDs (not BlueRay) and never skips. I order a lot of DVDs from netflix and they are often scratched. However, you can not tell with this DVD player. Overall a good buy for a first DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased Used","review":"I bought this DVD player after my Phillips player died a slow death. I needed a new player fast and didn't want to pay retail. I found one used and wasn't expecting much. This DVD player has been fantastic and has exceeded my expectations. It has a very good picture and sound. I was surprised how good the sound was when using the theater wide sound effect - way better than the \\"SRS\\" on my Sony TV. Remote that came with it was a bit cheesy, not quite what I've come to expect from Sony, but I replaced it with a universal remote.One note - This DVD player has digital audio output and component outs, I don't think models after this one included both of these features together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great player, doesn't last long","review":"I only got 2 years out of this player. It still plays retail DVD's but playing DVD+R and DVD-R discs is a nightmare. It either doesn't recognize the discs or its a garbled mess on the screen. I also couldn't fast-forward or reverse anymore. It looks like the laser is going bad. It is just a matter of time before it won't play retail DVD's anymore. I guess Sony makes their players disposable to last only a few years. They want to keep you coming back so they can get more of your $$$. If you are looking to buy this I would avoid it and try another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just great!!!","review":"I really like the DVD player....

Sony tech support confirmed it's a defect, sent it back. Amazon was great, shipped a replacement immediately. The second one had the same defect. We unplugged a player from another room - no buzzing. What are the odds of it happening twice? Not high...unless it's a defect in the design or manufacturing line. My real problem is with Sony - they offered to replace, but wouldn't promise new (it may be refurbished) and wouldn't offer expidited shipping even on the second defective unit - weeks of waiting. So much for their commitment to quality! I returned #2 to Amazon and bought Toshiba. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"good and cheap","review":"No problems with this unit. It is a little slow to respond sometimes, but you are not buying a top of the line unit here. You will be satisified with this unit. Why waste your money on anything more expensive for a standard DVD player?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice player and features, but doesn't last ...","review":"I enjoyed this player for a little longer than a year, and then it stopped working. It spins ok, but says \\"No Disc\\". Seems like the laser burned out. This appears to be a common a problem with these Sony units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony DVPNS55P","review":"Good unit, able to play most every kind of CD and DVD media I've tried. Only two complaints: (1) It's very slow to load a disc after insertion, and (2) hard to control with the buttons on the player itself (note: the remote works better). Elaboration on (2): The unit's own buttons seem to only obey firm, definite key presses, not the light taps I'm accustomed to. Result: it frequently doesn't respond to one press of the \\"eject\\" button, but if I push it twice, in anticipation of it ignoring my first press, it will instead start to eject then rapidly close again. So sometimes the simple act of trying to put in a disc feels like a slapstick routine. But this unit was so cheap I figure I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy for the price","review":"Its good deal for the price. The menu system seems a bit cryptic..but overall no complaints. Would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player was damaged and inoperable when it arrived","review":"The DVD player I ordered was apparently damaged in the factory. When I opened the box, the DVD drive door had been snapped off and the drive was inoperable. I had to return it at my own expense, and was out $20.00. So I went and bought a Toshiba instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"I bought the DVPNS50P, which is a similar, if not the same, player. It worked well enough, until it stopped working, about two months after I bought it. Of course I bought the Sony, rather than a cheaper off-brand, thinking the thing frizting in two months would be less likely.So, what I'm writing about is the customer service: ridiculous. The unit qualified for \\"exchange\\" under the warranty. This means I had to bring it not to Best Buy, where I bought it, but to a UPS Store, and have it packed and shipped, at a supposed discount ($20!). Overnight service for me? Think again! So far, I've been waiting 17 days for the new unit.You would think Sony stood by their products, and that they could therefore afford to take better care of their customers when their products didn't work. This bargain basement customer service would seem to indicate Sony doesn't stand for reliability anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD player I've ever owned","review":"This is a wonderful standard DVD player and it's a shame that Sony does not make it anymore.Plays any disc I pop in, including the ones I get from Netflix which have been through God knows what and have all kinds of scratches/blemishes. It features component hook-up, a format that is far superior to the standard A/V, creates a beautiful picture even on a standard definition television. Noise is not an issue with the unit as the only noise you will hear is when it is firing up on a disc and bringing up the menu. During the movie/TV show, it is dead quiet. The remote is great, simple and easy to know the layout like the back of your hand in no time.If you can find one of these and it's still in the sealed box, don't hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was good for 8 months.","review":"The player itself was pretty good - the quality of picture, options, etc. But only after 8 months is stopped playing any kind of disks we put - \\"cannot play\\" was the message on the display.Why do i give it 4 stars you may wonder? The answer is simple - replacement of the player was the best experience i've ever had with service of the product under warranty. I went online, filled out the form, printed 2 pages, packed the player ( 7 lb is not expensive to ship - $10 UPS)without spending any time on the phone with anybody. My replacement was shipped the very next day my return was received. No worries at all.Yes, the product fail, but the company stands behind it and that makes you feel good. My only advise, spend those extra $$$ for extended warranty - you never know what may happen and with Sony it worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great DV Player","review":"This player is wonderful!

This album takes us back to the beginning prior to 1980 if you include when he starting writing. This includes 36 tunes on 2 discs plus a bonus DVD. If you're a Bryan fan, you know all of these so just a word about some of the recordings - this has the long, not radio, version of \\"Everything I Do', a studio version of 'The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You', (I prefer the Unplugged version), live version of '18 Til I Die'.

Not worth the price.","review":"I have given this product 2 stars. It might be a fab bottle for you, but personally it was a nightmare for us. Just make sure you have other bottles on hand, in the event your little one doesn't like Avent. For the 1st 6 months of my daughter's life, feeding was a horrible experience. The nipples are pricey & don't fit any other bottle. My daughter got to the point where she wouldn't nurse from a bottle. I ran out & bought some cheaper nipples & bottles and finally found one she would take.Yes, the nipple on the Avent bottle is more like a mommy's and baby does have to work harder to get the formula or breast milk out. But there are other brands out there that are just as good (I personally think) than Avent. If you want to be trendy...go ahead & spend the money. Just make sure you've got those other bottles ready, just in case. I wish we had!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $","review":"These bottles are not worth the $$. They get more air bubbles then any other I've tried and you have to purchase their special nipples for bottles none of the others work. Even the slow nipples for newborns pores milk out too fast and my baby gets an upset stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating bottles","review":"I know these get a lot of hype, but...I have had a LOT of very frustrating moments with these.The disposable liner is practically impossible to keep from creasing around the top which causes leaking.Also, the regular bottles come with nipples that have a lip on the inside. If it doesn't go on just right...it leaks. Sometimes it takes a good 5 tries just to get the nipple on right! UUUGGGHHH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT use these!","review":"bought these bottles because they are famous, because they are sleak, because they were supposed to reduce bubbles and solve my baby's colic problem. but they don't. what a waste of money.the wide neck means they have to have large teats, which slow down the sucking and my baby usualy ended up sleeping on the bottle when only half amount of the fomula has been taken. he was so tired of drinking that he just gave it up all together. it made feeding tiresome for both of us, esp. for the baby who eventually hates drinking milk and dreaded to see the bottles. he was rather hungry than having anything to do with these bottles. i have gone back to the old type of bottles since. i didn't give the bottles away to salvation army or anything in case other babies have to suffer. now they are nice bird feeders in my garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, leaky, leaky","review":"I bought these bottles because of their great popularity. However, no matter how dry each part was, they constantly leaked. The nipples never look clean, they get very filmy looking, even after boiling or putting them in the dishwasher. My daughter had a lot of problems with gas and these bottles contributed to that. I switched to the Dr. Brown bottles, and she slept better, and did not have these painful gas problems. The bottles also cleaned better than the Avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak all the time","review":"I'm so frustrated with these bottles - they leak all the time no matter what I do with them.

The problem seems to have gotten progressively worse over time because now they leak to the point that I'm not sure how much my son is ingesting and how much is soaking his bib and burp cloth. I tried adjusting the nipple and tightening or loosening the collar - nothing has stopped the leakage. I have switched to Gerber New Traditions bottles with no problem so far. I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because the nipple shape is very similar to the real thing, and that's always a plus for someone who wants to combine bottle and breastfeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent Bottles","review":"The only nice things I can honestly say about these bottles is that my twins can easily switch from breast to bottle with them and that they are easy to clean and mix formula, BUT... THEY LEAK! This is most anoying when you have two screaming babies and the bottle is leaking as you're trying to make the bottles. For how expensive these bottles are, they should not leak. I have tried various ways of putting the caps on, etc., but they always leak. I don't have this problem with generic, cheap bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bottles are a joke!","review":"The problem with these bottles is the newborn slow flow nipple flows too fast. Milk just squirts out when you turn the bottle over and my daughter chokes and she is covered with milk down her chin and neck. Plus, by the time she is half way finished there are so many bubbles inside she gets very gassy.(we make formula ahead of time to avoid shaking the bottle)They have leaked occasionally around the neck.We switched to the best bottles, which are Dr. Browns. They work great! No bubbles or leaking and easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks too much","review":"this bottle started out ok until after about 5 months of usage, it started leaking around the collar no matter how tight the collar was screwed on. this was so annoying, especially at night when you are sleepy. you have to remove the collar and nipple, put it back on, turn it upside down and pray that this time it wont leak (after going through this a few time you will want to throw the bottle into the wall). eventually you will get lucky and the bottle wont leak but for the next feeding you go through this process all over again. try the playtex disposable nurser (the drop in liner is fabulous), buy the one with the avent-like nipple. so far this is excellent, no leaks and no wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these bottles!","review":"They leak, my daughter gets too much air, and they are very crappy quality for the $. I had heard so many good things about Avent so as a new mom, of course I went with \\"the best.\\" Big mistake! My precious pumped breast milk would spill and my daughter would spit up A LOT after each bottle. I tried Dr. Browns, Playtex Nurser, and Munckin Tri-Flow, but the BEST, BEST bottles EVER are Playtex Vent-air Natural Shape! I will just pour the pumped milk into the playtex bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate them","review":"These bottles are horrible! I agree with one of the other reviewers that they leak, but unlike her experience that they leak inconsistently, mine leak all of the time. I have wasted so much formula and time with these bottles. Sometimes they have leaked all over my daughter before I realize it. I am going to do my best to return them even thugh they have been used. I hate to see the manufacturer get rich off of something that doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bottles!","review":"I wasn't going to write a review, but after reading many of the negative comments about these bottles leaking I decided to.We have not had any problems with these bottles and my son does great with them. He goes very well from breast to bottle throughout the day while he's in daycare.As far as the bottles leaking, I had that problem with one. I discovered that the reason the bottle leaked was because the bottom of the nipple was slightly warped and was not creating a tight enough seal. All I did was replace it and it worked fine. Maybe disappointed customers should check the bottom of their nipples when they are in the bottle lid/seal and make sure that they are perfectly rounded and not warped at all. That should solve the problem. They may also want to check to make sure that they have the nipple pulled through the whole way.We love them and would recommend them to anyone and do to all pregnant people we know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid at all cost","review":"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKING!!!","review":"These bottles are awful! From day one, they have done nothing but leak and create a mess all over my daughter, the couch, the floor, you name, AVENT bottles have leaked on it! They were recommended by a friend, who's a nurse. My daughter still gets air in her belly from the bottles. Plus you have to buy new and expensive nipples as the child gets older...so the new nipples can leak on you. I've told several friends NOT to buy these bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bottles","review":"I used Avent bottles for my 21 month old, but experienced many leaks. However, I decided to give them another go when I had my son in November. Once again, I had the same problem, they leak constantly - I even shook the bottle on a recent flight to mix the formula when it sprayed all over the passenger next to me - quite embarressing.On the positive side, when they don't leak, my son seems to like them, they are easy to clean and work well with the Avent microwave sterilizer (which I wouldn't change for anything!)However, if I do have any more children, I will probably use a different brand of bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"leak, leak , leak","review":"These bottles are not worth it. No matter how tight you screw the nipple on, they leak like crazy. I thought i was doing something wrong at first but then bought new ones and had same problem. I'm not talking a little leak either.

But let me position mine a bit more bluntly. AVENT BOTTLES LEAK and LEAK and LEAK - and more than just occasionally. Bottle feeding can be a tough gig when you're up at all hours of the morning. On top of that, consider that when parents and babies use the product, one (or both) are typically over-tired, stressed, edgy, nervous, etc. So when Avent bottles continuously leak, the result is more than just a wet onesie. It's an uncomfortable baby that gets even more overtired. It's another change of outfits with more crying, more frustration, more stress. And it's another long day/night with less sleep, less relaxation, and considerably less patience with a defective product. Avent - are you DOING anything about this? Please let me know what's up. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this System","review":"I am very disappointed with the Avent bottle system. I purchased the Avent hand breast pump and Avent bottles 8 months ago when my son was born, and I am frustrated with the poor performance of these products. The bottle seals are prone to failure resulting in a great deal of leaking, and it is difficult to achieve and maintain effective suction with the Avent pump. For the cost of Avent I would expect a more reliable product. I would not recommend purchasing Avent products, and I plan on invensting in a different brand with my next child. Wish I would have saved my money the first time around by avoiding Avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bottles LEAK!","review":"These bottles are so frusterating! They leak all over the place.

These bottles were wonderful for that!! HOWEVER, I had a heck of a time with them leaking after about three weeks of use. I couldn't figure out what was wrong, but my husband realized, like many others have, that the seal is broken if they are tightened too much which causes them to leak. Since we found this out I have not had a problem and am enjoying them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!!!","review":"I purchased the Avent Starter set and they worked wonderfully for about 1 month - then they continuously leaked.

I purchased AVENT after reading the reviews on all the baby product websites. I even read the reviews about the leaks, but because there were so few, I thought it was just a fluke. Wrong! They leak-- a lot. They don't just sprinkle, they poor. My husband and baby were soaked every night while attempting to bond. Other people will tell you that it is all in how you twist the top on--not so much! Who has time to turn a top just right? You can't twist too tight or too loose with this thing. I want to be able to just get it ready quickly and feed my crying infant! I bought the Dr. Brown's wide mouth bottles instead and they have been wonderful!!!! No special mechanics because they make their bottles for people who need ease! Do not buy AVENT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent leaks!","review":"Bottom line...these bottles leak! Not every time but when you have a hungry baby and formula is spilling out all over them they don't want to wait until you can fix it. The bottle gets sticky. They need changed and sometimes you will need to change clothes yourself! I tried all the little tricks you read about online but eventually one will leak. And for the price of these bottles one is too many! Do yourself a favor and buy the Dr. Browns. It's a little more cleaning but less aggrevation and happier babies. Also they are nicer to hold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"For the price of these bottles you would like it to last more than a month. BUT IT DOES NOT. It leaks BAD. If you don't mind you or your baby to smell like formula then it's great for you.

I don't know why the people who recommended them never had a problem with the leaking but I sure did! The worst was rushing to feed the baby because he's screaming and then having to remove the bottle from his mouth to fix the leaking cap/nipple.I wish the people at Avent would read these reviews. Maybe the bottles I bought were part of the \\"defective lot\\" but I spent so much money on 10 bottles and I threw out the pkg. so I just keep using them - making sure the bottle doesn't leak BEFORE starting a feeding is a MUST now. Maybe I will try the playtex bottles when the time comes to advance in nipple flow before I spend the money on 10 #3 Avent nipples."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS I EXPECTED","review":"Based on rave reviews these bottles received, I was expecting to have a great experience with these bottles. However, I returned them to BabiesRUs after a few attempts at giving them to my son. He found it really awkward to latch on to the nipple, which I believe is what caused him an extraordinary amount of gas pain. It would start causing him pain right in the middle of his feeding. I went back to using the Playtex Nursers and VentAire bottles with the Natural Latch nipples and he does great. On a side note, I also had a leaking problem with one of the bottles as many others have also had. Unfortunately, despite the rave reviews, these were not the bottle of choice for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY..DOESNT PREVENT GAS","review":"I am a new mom and I thought after reading the reviews regarding this bottle I noticed alot of people saying that they leaked, then others would say they arent putting the nipples on correctly..Well, I want to say that before I nknow it when I am feeding my baby, the formula is all over the bib and her clothes and me and everything else in the path.

Well, it turns out that my son is allergic to milk which causes him to be very gassy (even on hypoallergenic formula), and these bottles only seemed to make his gas and colic worse. They never leaked like so many others have complained about, but they sure did nothing to help with his gas and colic like they claim to do. He also spit up constantly while on these bottles.

The leakage did not improve as she grew to an age where she should have been using stage 2 nipples.

I think the bottles have something to do with this. UPDATE... After using these a year now I can say the fix-all is indeed not to overtighten the lid.

We found that they both did much better with the Playtex nipples since they didn't suck air and the nipple was more like the breast.

He is now 11 months and he refuses to even take a sip of juice out of the Avent bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breastfeeding mommy...","review":"I know that the Avent brand is supposed to be the perfect bottle for switching back and forth from breast to bottle, but whose nipple is as hard and erect as the nipple on the Avent bottles? My baby had a hard time latching onto the Avent nipple and seemed to always have violent gas attacks right after finishing a bottle. I like how convenient and no-fuss the Avent bottles are, but I decided to switch only to make it easier for my little one. We now use the Ventaires, which are such a dream-come-true for feeding! I still have the Avent bottles and hope to use them when I am no longer breastfeeding. Hopefully by the time he is sitting up and can easily burp on his own without having to prop him up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles","review":"These bottles are the perfect size and work great with the Avent Isis breast pump. I never had a problem with them leaking at all. You can freeze with them too. The 4 oz. size is perfect for the breastfeeding mother. The milk doesn't come out fast at all. Great bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"terriable bottles","review":"We registered for these bottles after using Playtex Vent Aire bottles with our previous foster kids. After a terriable first couple weeks with the AVENT bottles we switched back to the Vent Aire bottles. The AVENT bottles leaked all over our newborn, the nipples were way too big for her tiny mouth and the milk would come flowing out the sides of her mouth. She soaked 1-2 clothes per feeding we never knew how much was acctually getting to her belly!! Our little girl also had terriable gas pains, and very loud choking type adult burps while on these bottles. All this changed for the better after switching to Vent Aire. I do not reccomend AVENT bottles. They do look nice, and appear to be great but they are not!! I suggest using the playtex Vent Aire system."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bottles DO leak.","review":"These are the most frustrating bottles I could possibly imagine. 3:00 AM, screaming baby in your arms, and the bottle you've paid an exorbitant $5.00 for (because you want the best for your baby) is leaking like it doesn't even have a top on.

There have been times I've wanted to smash these bottle with a sledge hammer.How hard is it to make a bottle that doesn't leak?Avoid these bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst bottle ever!!","review":"I started with these bottles and found that they leaked all over everything, there is nothing more upsetting than having to change your baby after half the bottle has leaked all over you and the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I am not happy with the Avent bottles due to the leakage. I contacted the company who explained in detail how to assemble the bottles so that they don't leak. It does work, however at 3am with a fussy baby I prefer a bottle that is quick and easy. Avent is not. I ended up switching to Dr. Brown and am very pleased. It does reduce gas as it advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best bottle","review":"Despite the hype about these bottles, this product isn't the best. They leaked if you didn't get the nipple on just right-of course you found that out after losing 1/2 ounce or more of valuable breast milk or formula. Also, when a babe breathes through it's mouth back into the bottle more air bubbles were created and thus at the end of the bottle and feeding there was a mountain of bubbles to enter babies tummy if you weren't careful.

After our son was born, he could not latch on to the \\"standard\\" nipple that comes with the Avent bottles. Needless to say, we searched everywhere for an orthodontic nipple for the bottle. Does Avent even sell them? It's ridiculous for a bottle manufacturer to only market and sell one shape of a nipple for their bottles. Even Playtex you can buy different nipples. We have about 12 of these bottles from 4 to 8 ounces and can't even use them for who knows how long. We gave it a one star because there is no option for 0 stars. We can't even use this bottle at all thanks to poor marketing from Avent to see exactly what types of nipples to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE BOTTLES LEAK!","review":"I purchased these bottles for my second child and found out that unless you screw them on \\"RIGHT\\" they leak.

You have to screw the nipple on just right otherwise the liquid just spills out! I have had these bottles for almost a year and still have not figured out why they leak sometimes and not the others.

I would not recommend these bottles!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak","review":"A nurse at the hospital recommended these bottles to us after I had my daughter. They worked great for a few weeks, but then they started to leak. When they leak, you can take off the lid and rub your finger around the inside of the rim to strengthen the seal. It stops it from leaking, but it's a hassle. Being a first time mom, I thought perhaps this was a problem with all bottles, but my sister uses playtex bottles and has never had a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody leaky bottles","review":"You turn the cap less or you make it tight,No matter how you try, you wont get it right.You think they drank four, but they only got three,Because below their mouths, the bottle's on a leaking spree.The thing is going to leak, screw it as you might.Who needs this aggravation, at 3 in the night.Warm milk or cold milk, no matter what it holds,Its gonna leak out and seep into their neck folds.You'll need a calibrated wrench, from the Institute of Measures,Who needs these leaky hassles, to feed their little treasures.Each time I use them now, I end up swearing,Many have leaked similar complaints, how can Avent be so uncaring?"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD BOTTLE, MUST FOLLOW DIRECTIONS EXACTLY","review":"These are very good bottles. I have experienced some leaks as others have stated, so I went back to the directions and it says to make sure the nipple is WET, put the ring on, then put the cap on. After that, put it on the bottle, but do not tighten it too tight, just until it is locked in.When the nipple is wet, it makes a seal, like suction, sometimes you can even hear it when you put the cap on. I still get a leak here and there, but I just open the cap, rewet the nipple and replace. Leak...all gone!So, don't be put off by those who did not read the directions and gave up and returned them. They do work! Hope that helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak and leak and leak.","review":"These bottles leak terribly. We couldn't figure out why at first. After reading online complaints, we found out that the inner seal vents need to be aligned a certain way to prevent leaking. The problem, however, is that they repeatedly slip out of place even after they have been arranged properly. It is a terrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes they leak, sometimes they don't","review":"I, too, have experienced the bottles leaking, which is very frustrating at 3 in the morning when you are half sleep and feeding the baby by a nightlight. The bottles do not leak around the nipple (which is what I think one mother thought when she mentioned that it leaked b/c she didn't put the nipple in correctly) but it leaks from the base that you screw onto the bottle. I can't figure out exactly why they do this occurs because I have screwed them on tight everytime. Great bottle, but they are hit-or-miss with the occasional leaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hungry Baby Bottle Available.","review":"These are the widest bottles that I have seen available. They are well made and easy to assemble. I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers (a problem with another make I tried.) or discolouration of bottles. They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups. The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids (my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks (with Doctors approval) because he is so big (90th Percentile) and was so very hungry. The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose. What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us. They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric."},{"rating":"1","title":"They do not Leak...they Pour!","review":"Here is our experience: The nice thing about Avent is they are very easy to clean, but the mess they make isn't. This is our first time using Avent bottles. I did not use Avent with our first two children and I never experienced the leaking with their bottles as I am with the Avent bottles. The leaking doesn't happen right away. It begins about two weeks after you have been using the product. It doesn't just leak, it pours out! Of course, I thought we were just over tightening or not pulling the nipple all the way through the ring, but that was not the problem. Please note that Avent has an extensive page on their web-site regarding trouble-shooting for leaky bottles. That speaks for itself. One should not have to manipulate or figure out how to screw a nipple onto a bottle, no matter if it's 3:00 in the morning, out shopping or at home in the middle of the afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!","review":"Leaks! Especially difficult to get a tight seal if you use one hand (while holding baby). A much better design is the Breast Flow Learning Curve First Years bottles. Instead buy The First Years 3pk. Breastflow 5oz. Bottles These worked much better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Leak, They Leak, Leak, Leak and then Leak some more!","review":"We have uses these bottles for 2 months. About 1 out of 3 bottles leak. And we're not talking a drop or two. We're talking about milk flowing out of the cap as if it's not even secured. You can insert the nipple into the screw cap, hear the \\"click\\", squeeze it tight, squeeze it loose, squeeze it any degree between, but they leak. AVENT's website even has a section on how to prevent the bottles from leaking. You want to know why? Because they leak. AVENT bottles must be the poorest designed product we have used in the past year. They leak, and they leak. They leak at the worst times, they leak and the best. If you want to ensure that your feeding experience with your child will be ruined 33 percent of the time, by all means -waste your money on this poor excuse for a product. AVENT should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"infuriating!!","review":"The good points... easy to clean, no stupid liners to deal with, clearly marked nipples, correct measurement marks on bottle sides(surprisingly uncommon)The bad... impossible to tell if the collar is screwed on correctly, until you shake it and milk gets everywhere, or dumps all over baby during feeding. Also slowest nipple is much faster than playtex or gerber, and tough for slow eaters to get used to.The screw issue makes these useless for me to travel with, as everything gets soaked. Just a stupid design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to clean, popular bottles but annoyingly LEAKY","review":"Out of all the bottles on the market, Avent bottles are the easiest to clean because of the wider shape. My baby also seems to be comfortable with drinking from this bottle. The most annoying thing though about these bottles is that they leak. I've tried so many techniques and sometimes it will still leak. One would think that Avent should figure out a way to resolve this. Aside from the occasional leaks, these bottles are perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"gas, spit-up and major discomfort","review":"I know that every baby is different but I just wanted to share the experience that I have had with the Avent bottles. For my 2 month old daughter, they have resulted in gas, spit-ups and major discomfort. At every feeding, she would spit-up 2-3 times. After one ounce of formula, she would cry because of the gas pains. Feeding became a nightmare. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE these bottles","review":"I got a wonderful shower gift from a co-worker with 4 kids, she bought me a basket and put 5 different brands of bottles in it with several different nipples for each. I was already leaning towards Avent since the nipple shape is so closely related to the natural nipple and I wanted my son to have as little nipple confusion as possible. THese were by FAR our favorites and his as well. Yes, occasionaly they will leak, but if you READ the directions that come with them, they advise you to tighten only until you meet with resistance, not all the way. Stopping the over tightening solved our drippage problem. I think these are some of the best bottles out there! You also have to love the interchangable aspect of Avent's design. My son loves to hold his bottle using the handles that also work for their sippy cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!!!!!","review":"I hate these bottles, I have a ton of them that I have registered for with my first baby who is 16 months old.

After they started leaking, I just sucked it up for a while. Then I got aggravated enough to write to AVENT on their website. They wrote back to me that I was screwing them on too tight. So, i took their advice, and now, after washing the diaper bag for the umpteenth time because the contents of the bottles spilled out all over, I have written to them again. I don't think that I should have to worry about how tight I am screwing the tops on. I should be able to twist the top on and rest assured that my child won't go hungry and scream because his formula is all over the bottom of the diaper bag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!!","review":"The bottles were fine at first, but are now terribly leaky 3 weeks after I started using them!!

Yes, I know how to work a bottle. They leak all over the baby. I would recomend Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. So much less air gets in the bottle and the nipples are ideal for switching from breast to bottle. These bottles are supposed to reduce air bubbles? Yeah, right. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!!!!","review":"These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak. I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak. Well less tightening did not help. Don't waste money. I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for formula baths!","review":"<br />Whenever I want to give my baby (and my arm) a nice soothing bath of formula, these Avent bottles work GREAT! Almost every time I take the bottle from her mouth a cascade of warm formula gushes out from under the collar. What a treat! HOWEVER, if you don't like soaking your child or yourself with whatever is in the bottle, try another brand. But aren't the bottles pretty?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet Baby","review":"These bottles come with an extra plastic piece on the inside. Most bottles do, except with the other bottles the plastic piece is disposable packaging. Don't make the mistake of throwing it away when you purchase AVENT Bottles or else you'll end up with a wet baby from the leaking bottle. Why purchase these more expensive bottles when you have an extra piece that needs to be washed and kept up with in order for them to function properly? I don't get it! I recommend Nuk bottles as a better plastic alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY FRUSTRATED","review":"I had thought I loved these bottles...but I have never been so dissapointed and frustrated ...2am ,my daughter is completely soaked!!! now she is starving,freezing,being changed and hungry in the middle of the night!!!they leak so much and formula is expensive!!!

I had no problems in general, my baby used them fine from the time she was 5 weeks old. I'm just weaning her now at 13 mos. The major complaint I have about these is that they leak around the rim like crazy. Sometimes you have to unsrew it and put it back on two or three times before you can keep them from running all over. And, no, it's not just one. All of them did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Experience","review":"I bought the Avent bottles with the best of expectations. The first sign of my let down was how bad they leaked. If you screw the lid on too tight, they leak and you have to loosen it so they won't. I recently discovered that my son's trouble eating was also due to the large size of the nipples. I switched to the the old faithful, Playtex Nursers, and he's eating much more relaxed and much better now. I can't tell you the difference. The nipples are just too fat on the Avent system."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Word of Warning","review":"I bought these for my daughter. I have been using them since she was born, but I have had (like a lot of other people) trouble with them leaking. I have had so many problems with leaks that I am considering not using them for my next child. Sometime the only way to fix the leak is to take the nipple out of the ring and run water over it. As you can imagine, this is not very helpful when we are away from home. I have tried to just not screw them down as tight, but it doesn't always work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The manufacturer claims these bottles vent and therefore reduce gas and spit-up, but I don't think we found it's effective. Besides, they do leak a lot, and are very touchy about how you screw the ring on. Sure, you can wet the nipple like the maker recommends to create a seal, but if you sterilize your bottles and nipples wetting them with tap water defeats the purpose of sterilization. So you pretty much have to assemble the bottle right before feeding. We also were very frustrated by the fact that the nipples wear out fast (get larger holes), yet they are stiff making it frustrating for the babies to suckle. As compared to other feeding systems, this is not worth it - get Dr Brown's instead and save your money, because if your baby has problems with gas you'll probably end up trying Dr Brown's anyhow. I have twin boys and we feed them breast milk that I pump, so leaking is such a waste... I wouldn't recommend this feeding system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Leaky!","review":"I purchased the Avent bottles because I heard they were the best. They were very expensive but I bought them anyway. I am very disappointed with these bottles. They leak alot!! Not just a tiny drip here and there but streams of formula running down the bottle onto my son and his clothes. He is often soaked after feedings and I have to completely change his outfit. I tried not tightening the bottles so much and I must admit that it helped. But I still get about 1 leaking bottle a day. Just enough to soil me or my son's clothes. The only good thing is that they are super easy to clean. I am to cheap to go out and buy a bunch of bottles that are a different brand. Who knows if those will work either. But I would not recommend that anyone buy these bottles. More expensive does not mean better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only open one in the beginning","review":"I also was told that this was the best bottle for a breast feeding baby. We introduced the bottle to my daughter and she would not have anything to do with it. She would open her mouth and shake her head back and forth. She never latched on to the avent nipple, but the very same day did not have any trouble with the evenflow.I know that all babies are different. With that in mind, if you want to try these bottles only open one to start with.

It's like playing Russian Roulette. Hence, I never get her dressed up in something that I want her to stay remotely nice in before a feeding. I also have a baby that spits up about 80% of the time, and I will be very curious to know how she will be after making this switch. I believe I am going to purchase the Dr. Brown's system.

I had to give it to my friend, she is still breast feeding so I have yet to find out if it will work for her. I went to the store and bought my Gerber and couldn't be happier. They are easy to hold not big and bulky like Avent.Avent is harder for a baby ready to hold her/his bottle to do so.

You must line the rings of the bottle and the nipple ring up just right or the contents of the bottle (4- and 9oz and sippy cups) will leak right from under the ring, as the ridges in the bottle and the ring do not go all the way around. It is extremely frustrating to have half the contents of your baby's meal spill out onto their clothes, especially if you have breastmilk supply issues like I did, where half a bottle could have cost you a full day's pumping. I would suggest that if you are looking to prevent gas and colic, try the Dr. Brown's or the Ventair's. If I had it to do over again I would not choose this bottle, and when I have another child I will use a different system altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter got to much air!

No matter how much we adjust the nipple and bottle neck system it leaks! Even in the sippee cups the union leaks. I love the feel and shape of the sippee cup spout and so do my kiddos, but it is not fun to always be cleaning up juice, breast milk, and formula from baby and you! If you want the wide mouth system try GERBER New Traditions. They have 3 different nipple types, with variable flows, and an incredible bottle shape that makes it easy for baby and parent to hold. I just wish THEY had the transitional cups also!!! Unfortunately the nipples are different diameters! I gave AVENT 2 stars for their compatibility from bottle to cup, but other than that I would give them none. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this bottles","review":"I hate these bottles.

The quality of the bottles is great, but they don't work for everyone. The leaked horribly. When I say leak, the milk didn't come pouring out of the rim or anything, but the nipples are an odd shape that can be difficult for some infants to master, causing the milk to run all over their face and clothes. My husband got so frustrated with the amount of milk running down our 2 month old's face that the threw most of the in the trash.

I orginally had the VentAire bottles but took all of them back when I realized just how many parts to the bottles there were, and that it wasn't recommended to use them in warmers!In the beginning we had some trouble with the bottles leaking, but I soon realized that I was putting the bottles together wrong. After reading the instructions (duh) it said to put the cap on before attaching the nipple & ring to the bottle. As soon as I did that, the leaks stopped. I also found out from reading other reviews that I was screwing the lid on too tight!As for the bubbles in the bottle... at first I had a hard time with that. But I soon realized that it was better to have bubbles in the bottle than in my son's tummy! My son is 9 weeks old and we have not any any gas trouble OR spit ups!!!!I am very pleased with these bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for breast-fed babies","review":"We registerd and received these bottles because of high recommendations from breastfeeding consultants. All we can say is YUCK! Our daughter HATED eating from these and would cry and fuss until she finally got so hungry and took them. She never had a problem with gas or spit-up, but feeding her from this bottle was a nightmare. Each time my husband fed her, it was a battle. So, we switched to the Playtex Natura-Latch nipple in slow flow with the bottles with disposable liners, and she took it on the first try. She started eating right away, and has NEVER cried or fussed while eating from this bottle. This eased my mind knowing she will eat when I go back to work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm...","review":"I bought these bottles for my two month old daughter because I thought it would be a nice bottle for her to &quot;grow with&quot;.

However, my son would suck for half an hour and could never get much milk out (has to work too hard, he certainly doesn't work that hard at the breast). Also, he didn't like the nipple shape, he kept trying to put his mouth over the whole nipple to latch on.I gave it two stars since the bottles are definately sturdy and nice looking and my friends have had good luck. Also they work in warmers whereas the ones I use now don't. Unfortunately I now have a pantry full of these bottles from baby showers.If these nipples give your breastfed baby problems, try the Playtex natural shape (disposable and also the new ventair natural shape). Every baby is different but good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"these bottles ...","review":"As a first time mom of twins, I believed the ads about these bottles and registered and got the whole she-bang...bottles, nipples, storage rack, sterilizer, etc. Common sense should have told me that tiny baby hands couldn't hold a bottle that big around. Besides that, the nipples split and turn yellow with use, the nipples turn under, making it hard to know if the lid is on tight until formula has dripped all over the baby, and the measurements are often wrong on the bottle...the 4 oz mark should be at 4.5 oz. My sons were having a huge problem feeding themselves until I tried some cheap Gerber bottles that had come free in the mail...the little ones that fit perfectly in their hands...."},{"rating":"1","title":"As an infant teacher..","review":"I wouldn't recommend these bottles.

It comes pouring out like a river! Personally, I used the Playtex disposible bottles. You can get the same great \\"mother like\\" nipples, same easy clean-up, same gas reduction, and a LOT less leakage! None.. Imagine that?!

They are also lighter and easier for our sons to try and hold onto and when you have to prop, which you have to do sometimes with twins, they don't roll. I have no more messes in my diaper bags, my fridge or on my babies from leaking formula. I unfortunately have over 100.00 worth, giving them to a friend having twins, she doesn't mind leaks I guess.

If you do not tighten it JUST RIGHT, it still LEAKS. Extremely frustrating when your child is hungry and becomes upset when each time he/she tries to suck, they receive a face full of formula.We trashed all AVENT products and moved to Dr. Browns - have not had a single problem since.

The lowest flow nipple was way too fast, and my sons would end up wearing half their meal. And we would frequently experience leaks from the nipple not creating a seal with the bottle. It was a mess. We switched to Dr. Brown's bottles. The boys love them, and they seem less gassy since we switched. At four months, we graduated to the level 2 nipple, and the boys took to it easily.

Talk about frustrating - and it is always the middle of the night feedings when they really leak everywhere - not good.

I know other people have said that if you do everything correctly, they won't leak...in my opinion, if it's that much of an exact science to keep a product from leaking, then the product is not up to reasonable standards. I switched to cheap Evenflo bottles and never had a single problem with them. I wish I had my cash back for the Avent ones.

No matter how well he latches onto the nipple, the formula spurts out of the side and down his chin. And making 6oz just so he can get 4oz in his little tummy is too expensive for me. I just wish I would have known all this before 16 bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Introducing Bottle while Breast Feeding!","review":"I think I about drove myself CRAZY attempting to to choose THE bottle system...there are so many choices and even many more opinions! I finally settled on the Avent after working with a couple other systems and have been so very satisfied. The nipple system works great for the different stages which is important to me since I am also b-feeding and need to alternate back and forth between bottle and breast. The bottles are comfortable to hold and are well marked so one knows the exact number of ounces consumed Several people have noted they have experienced some leaking with the other Avent bottles in the 9 oz and even 4 oz sizes but I have not had this experience....I think it depends on the position in which a person is holding the bottle. Worth the money spent to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking is so frustrating","review":"I would not recommend these bottles to anyone. I have been told that untightening the top prevents leaking.....but I have found they leak when they are too tight or too loose. It is not easy to find the perfect tightness and I have spilled more milk on good furniture. They really need to fix this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these leaky bottles!","review":"My husband and I agree that our daughter hasn't had a problem going back and forth between Avent and breast. The only problem we have had is that they leak just about every time that we use them unless we wet the nipple in hot water immediately before inserting it into the nipple ring and then immediately serving the bottle. Otherwise, our six month old loves Avent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottles as a gift","review":"I bought the bottles as a gift for a baby shower because they seemed practical. They were very much appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bottle on the Market","review":"I have triplet girls so I have become an expert on bottles we have at lease one of every kind on the market. I must say these are by far the worst bottles on the market. They leak at random and when they do they make a mess all over your baby or the diaper bag. They are expensive and there are many cheaper bottles on the market that are 100% better. Do not waste your money on this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for feeding and interchanging with ISIS breast pump","review":"I loved these bottles. Never had one problem. No leaks, nada one. I also was able to attach these to the ISIS breast pump. I only use these for baby water now, since I use larger bottles. 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible LEAKAGE!","review":"After hearing so many good things about these bottles, I decided to buy them for my newborn. I immediately started having problems with the bottles leaking. Not just a little leak, BIG ONES! Leaks that pour from the bottle where I have to change my babys clothes & wipe myself off as well. This is such a HUGE inconvenience, especially in the middle of the night. I sent AVENT an email explaining my problem & they are aware of leakage but state that I must have been tightening the bottle too much to cause the leakage. They instructed me on how to screw on the top but to this day (my baby is now almost 4 months old) I am STILL having problems. I will get rid of all my AVENT bottles & switch to a new brand & I will NEVER recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAK LEAK LEAK!!!","review":"These bottles are terrible~once you get comfy with baby and start feeding~they leak all over, then you & baby are soaked (and smelly~especially when on whole milk) and no longer relaxed. Terrible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles, they work with almost ANY breast pump, just buy the adaptors","review":"For women that are using a breastpump, these bottles are perfect. You are not obligated to use the Isis with them either, just buy the adaptors that are available and use the brand you are comfortable with. (note the adaptor fits most brands- but not the Gerber hand pump)I've been using these bottles with my daughter for the past 3 months and I love them! I pump directly into the bottles (I use the Isis at work because it is very portable and an Ameda Purely Yours at home to double pump) I haven't had the leaking problem that several people have complained about. However, I usually put the bottles and their various parts together right out of the dishwasher. They are usually still damp when I do that which probably creates the seal needed to prevent leaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bottles... When They are Not Leaking!","review":"I bought these bottles when my aunt recommended me to use them. The bottles do not produce much air bubbles like other bottles I purchased. But the bottles will leak if the lid is not on properly. I learned the hard way when my son's bib had more formula then he did. But now I make sure the bottle isn't leaking before I begin to feed him. I should of bought these bottles from the get go. I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed AT ALL !!!","review":"I have a 6 week old daughter and have tried using the Avent bottle to supplement breast feedings. Unfortunately, I have found this bottle to be worthless for anything except storing pumped breast milk. It is extremely difficult for my daughter to suck anything out of this nipple. I too have found leakage from the nipple ring, making for a very sloppy feeding session. I have since bought and used the Playtex VentAire bottles and haven't had any difficulties. The shape of the Playtex VentAire bottles are also much easier for feeding. I would not reccomend the Avent to anyone unless their baby has an impressively strong suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for nursing babies","review":"These bottles were recommended to me by the lactation consultants at my hospital. I needed to get my baby aquainted with bottles for daycare starting at 12 weeks. I used both the manual Avent hand pump (which was great) and an electric pump. I started the bottle at 4 weeks. Both of my babies transitioned well back and forth between breast and the Avent bottles for 1 year. I did notice some leaking of the bottles when traveling with them, so I strted to use the small cap inserts. Once I was ready to use the bottle, I would put the nipple on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!","review":"These bottles were great at first, but after only a few months, they started to leak horribly!! I went to the website and it says to change the nipples every 3 months, which we did...but they still leak. We have tried everything to get them to stop...screwing the nipples on tighter, etc. I would still say that 2 out of 3 times they leak...and I mean LEAK!! Like puddle on the floor, milk all over baby's face, neck, clothes kind of leak. My son is almost a year old, so he can hold his own bottle. Sometimes in the middle of the night if he gets up and I feed him, I can't see that it's leaking all over him and I don't realize it until he starts screaming!!I think I might have to switch bottles if I don't get an answer from Avent that I am doing something wrong.I would suggest looking into another type of bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice bottles","review":"I like these bottles a lot. I really like the shape and the size of them. I have not had a problem with them leaking at all. I like the fact that you can interchange the parts with their other products. They interchange with other larger bottles and also sippy cups attachment parts. I tried the playtex ventaire bottles and did not like them- they had a top piece and a bottom piece you had to screw on to make sure they would not leak. My baby does spit up often but he does this even when breastfeeding or when I use Dr Browns bottles so I do not attribute this to the bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Nipple","review":"I breastfeed my daughter and she has never accepted the Avent nipple when she gets a bottle. It is very hard and she could not get a good latch. I tried the Playtex Nurser bottles and she did very well with them. They are much softer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good bottles!","review":"These were the only bottles I ever gave to my baby, so I'm not sure if she would have liked something better, but she seems to really like them now. She does seem to like the nipple shape and the air stays out of the tip. The only drawback is that they leak and squeak loud if you tighten the cap too tight. Overall, we are very happy with the Avent bottles and nipples, I probably wouldn't buy anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"I started my second child out on these, while they were easy for him to take, and not a complicated system, they still had way too much air inside!! which caused gas and left him fussy!!!!

Recently we tried Dr Brown's bottles and baby is sleeping much better and not as fussy."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO LEAKS","review":"I have heard so many people say that their bottles leak---the key to this...DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN your bottle top. We have been using the same 6 9oz bottles for the last 5 months and we have YET to have one leak on us. A friend of mine told me that she tightens hers with rubber gloves on...to make sure they are good and tight---WRONG!!!!!!!! Hers leak by the way!Aside from that---I give this product 4 stars because sometimes I have an issue transporting these bottles due to their slightly larger shape..most bottle bags are designed for the tall, slender bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I registered for these because many of my friends use them with their children. I found that these bottles repeatedly leaked from under the caps, even when I had my husband tighten them. They would be fine when they were inverted for feeding but would leak quite a bit when I would flip them over to put them down. The nipples were too long and would make my daughter gag. I also couldn't seem to get the correct flow from the nipple either. Even with the medium flow nipple, it would take my daughter around a half hour to get about an ounce out of it. I switched to the Playtex bottles with the NaturaLatch nipples and have seen a huge improvement. She latches onto the Playtex nipple much more easily and the bottle doesn't leak. The only advantage I have seen to the Avent bottle is that there is no repeat cost for the disposable liners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bottles but some problems","review":"I bought these since I was going to breastfeed my son. The problem is that my son couldn't breastfeed due to low suction and a poor latch. SInce these are so like the breast, he couldn't latch onto these bottles either. He got a lot of air and gas from them. They do leak if they are not assembled when they are damp. (The leak comes from the collar, not the nipple.) I also found that they sometimes spray formula when they are tipped over. My son had problems with the #2 nipple with formula running out the sides of his mouth but unable to continue with the #1 since the hole was too small. They're great to have if your child can latch on correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible hard nipple, cannot use for newborn","review":"i read all the review and bought the avent bottle, it is expensive but hopeless, the nipples are so hard and my daughter will not take it, I breastfeed my daugter so she is use to my soft nipple, so she hates avent.I tried Dr. Brown,evenflow, playtex bottles.Evenflow, avent, and playtex have hard nipples, so conclusion, Dr. brown is the best of all bottles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I researched and asked a lot of questions before buying bottles. Everyone told me how much they loved the Avent bottles, so I bought them. Even the stage 1 nipples were too fast for my baby when she was in her first weeks. She ended up with more formula on her face, chin, and bib than in her tummy. I put them away and tried again later, and the nipples just seem too big for her mouth. I'm not that impressed. We're using the Playtex Vent Aire now, but I think the Parents Choice Wal-Mart kind are just as good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for breast fed baby","review":"I got this 3 pack for a shower gift thinking I could use them for my son for the occasional bottle he would need. Avent advertises these bottles as being good to use in conjunction with breastfeeding, and they were terrible for my son. The milk leaks out of his mouth, because he cannot latch on like the breast. If you are looking for a bottle to use with breastfeeding, the Playtex nursers are the best. We switched to that, with the NaturaLatch nipple, and it works great. The nipple is softer, he's able to latch better, and is less gassy(another problem I had with Avent). A bonus to the playtex nursers is that you can store your breastmilk in the bags, with little mess. Much better than Avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipple not like Mom's","review":"I found the nipple to be way too hard for my newborn son to suck. I then ran out and got the Munchkin Tri-flow. You can change how fast the milk flows out of the bottle as you baby grows and the nipple is much softer!Munchkin also sells just the nipple that is compatable with the Avent bottle. So, if you've already purchased the avent bottles your money has not gone to waste! The only problem is that the Tri-flow is still fairly new and is very hard to find! Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT.......BUT","review":"At first I wanted to breastfeed, but my son had trouble latching on, so I had to pump, I originally wanted to use Playtex bottles with the bags, but then my son had trouble latching onto them, so I went with Avent. Wonderful bottle, my son suck like a pro with these because the nipple is longer and hit the roof of his mouth. HOWEVER the leak TERRIBLY!!!!!!!!! I would tighten the lids, and they would leak, I would loosen them, thinking they were overtightened, they would leak. I love the bottles, but the leaking made me change more outfits then I would have had to!!!!

It seems like no matter what I do, they leak. Most of the time I don't realize that they have leaked until the front of my baby is soaked. I screw the tops on tighter and they leak; I loosen the top and they still leak. I can't win! The problem for me is that I have so many of them that I can't bring myself to invest in another product.I also have one Dr. Brown's brand bottle that I received as a gift, which doesn't leak at all, but has lots of other parts that you have to deal with. If I had to recommend any brand of bottle, it would probably be that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the safest thing to use, some leaks","review":"I rate these a two because first of all we had a problem with them leaking.Secondly, and more important in my opinion is all of the research regarding the harmful effects and potential damage of using plastics, especially to reheat food in. Who knows what chemical changes occur in your breastmilk or formula when plastic bottles are used. The best choice is glass bottles, they are much cleaner and easier to sterilize. I wish I had known that when my baby was using bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best bottle out there","review":"I have used three different bottle for my 3 month old son now. He gets horrible gas and avent bottles are supposed to help with that, but for me they dont. ALso they leak all the time. The only good thing about them is that unlike the plytex bottles i use now, the avent bottles have several stages of nippples so there is always one that is the perfect speed for your baby. Personally i have had more luck with the playtex ventaire bottles and the playtex nursers. They allow less air to get in babys belly, but they only 2 nipple stages, fast and slow. Its good to register for several differnt bottles and let your baby decide which ones are right for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all babies, there is no \\"best brand\\"","review":"Not for my unhappy colic infant.

As a new mom, I was so impressed with the Avent advertising campaign I refused to &quot;believe&quot; other reviews on this site that the bottles leak. Now that I have been using them for the past three weeks, I have discovered that it is true. It does not matter how tight the collar is attached, or what nipple is used, they leak. I have tried a leaky bottle with other nipple/collar combinations and I have found that they still leak. I am not sure what aspect of the product is defective. It is a pain to have a bottle leak, wet the bottle bag, the car seat, or soak your newborn's onsies. I am very disappointed that I have invested a significant amount of money in avent products. I have over 10 bottles, the pump, and a few other items. I am going to switch to another system.

He switches from breast to bottle and back with no problems. We've been using them for 4 months and have never had a single leak.

Voila, no leaks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"Of course we wanted the best for our son. I read all reviews, compaired all brands, did my homework. Never thought I would have such a big mess using the Avent bottles. My son was a month early so he was smaller than normal (6lbs 6oz-if that is small). From the first feeding he got way to much formula and half the bottle ended up down the front of him. Not because the bottle leaked, but because he couldn't handle the flow and was spitting it out. I was horrified! After two weeks of trying, and it not getting better, I looked for another bottle and ended up with a much cheaper bottle and NO SPILLS! I have no complaints about the bottle itself - the flow is just to much for my baby (yes, I was using \\"#1\\" nipples). What a disappointment!

I plan to discard the bottles after replacing them with a few Gerber or Playtex cups.I feel that Playtex's feeding system is better for babies transitioning from the breast.

Every where we go - I have taken premixed bottles and warmed them while out - but they have leaked in the diaper bag, in my purse and in my hand. I have taken sep. containers of formula and water and mixed when he is ready to feed = still flying formula everywhere and it's getting annoying and embarrassing. We have switched to Dr. Brown's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!","review":"These bottles are not worth the money.

All they do is drip and leak. I have tried over and over again and no matter how I put the lids and nipples on they leak. Since I am pumping the last thing I want to do is waste my milk. If I had to do it all over again I would not waste my money on these bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Mess","review":"I bought these thinking that they would be an easy transistion to breast feeding my twins. I could not have been more wrong. The bottles were nothing but a leaky mess. I nipples & lids would not seal right. After a week I gave up and went with the playtex nurser. The liners are a bit of a hassle, but well worth not getting drenched every feeding. I used the playtex disposables with my first baby and they worked great then. I don't know why I tried something different. I should have stuck with what I knew worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for us!","review":"Bottom line, we have found that we needed to try several different bottles before finding the right bottle for both of our twins. These Avents were highly recommended and were great for breastmilk storage at the beginning when we first brough them home, but found that the nipples were nothing like the breast, didn't vent properly, and were not doing the job we hoped for!We tried Gerber and Evenflow and finally the Playtex disposable system, which we were hesitant because of the cost the liners. We found that they both did much better with the Playtex nipples. We also found that the cost of the liners wasn't much of a problem because the store brand is equally reliable.On the other hand, my sister-in-law has twins and swears by these bottles! It all depends on your kiddo! I have several of both sizes used only for milk storage since I was stocking up for two kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, leaks, leaks","review":"I bought these bottles after trying the Playtex Nurser system and the Vent Air system. I've had nothing but problems with them. They leak everywhere, and being a new mother, I don't have the time to spend 5 or 10 minutes just trying to get a bottle made. I've followed the instructions and consulted with Avent, but the bottles still leak. The only positive thing I have to say about these bottles is they do seem to reduce if not eliminate gas.Overall, I would NOT recommend these bottles to anyone who doesn't have a lot of patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks","review":"I am now using Avent bottles with my second child and they leak all the time! The bottle will start to leak and I will readjust the nipple and the cap and it will continue to leak until I have readjusted it several times! The nipple shape is perfect for my daughter however it is very frustrating to have them leak all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with bottle's design","review":"I was disappointed with these bottles. There was nothing in the literature with the bottles about having the lids too tight. I was having a problem with the bottles leaking so I assumed the first one was defective, so I threw it away. After having this problem with 3 other nipples and rings, I emailed the company complaining of the problem. This is where they told me it was because the tops were being put on too tight. I could buy that....but these tops are too touchy. You have to get it just right or it's either too tight or too lose and still leaks. It's frustrating when you have a hungry baby crying and you're too busy messing with the bottle to make sure it doesn't leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE HATE THE BOTTLES/NIPPLES!!!","review":"They leak every so much. The newborn nipple hole is too big. It pours out too fast for a newborn to take in, which means he was swallowing too much air. and that would make him gassy and collicky.

Our son was born 10 weeks ago and we did a TON of research for baby products before he was born. We decided on the Avent bottles for many reasons. They are really not that bad, but I have to disagree with all of the glowing reviews. My son has been diagnosed with Reflux and these bottles did NOT help! He has all kinds of gas, etc. And these bottles leak like crazy. We tried tightening and everything, but to no avail. We heard about the Dr. Brown's bottles that prevent gas and air flow and they REALLY work. And the Dr. Brown's don't leak and they have soothed my baby SO MUCH. No wicked gas pains in the middle of feeding. Just big huge burps and happy smiles! I wanted the Avent to be better but you can't always get what you want!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy check (and fix) for leaks","review":"I love Avent products, and so does my baby. I was given an infant feeding set by a friend before my daughter was born, and when I choose to bottle feed when she was about a month old, the Avent system made the change so easy. I love how the system will grow with my baby.However, I did have some problems with leaks so I did a bit of testing to determine which part of the assembled bottle was faulty.I discovered that some of the teats still had little bits of silicon left at the base from the manufacturing process (I'm sure there's a name for that!) which was preventing them from sealing properly.Easily fixed - just run your finger around the inside and outside of the base of the teat, and if there are any bits of silicon sticking out, pull 'em off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVENT BOTTLES","review":"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.

After every feeding my baby had terrible gas. The newborn nipple holes are so big my baby kept choking. My daughter is now six weeks old and she cannot use the stage 2-1 Month nipples because the newborn nipple holes are still to big for her. These bottles also leak. While I was feeding my baby, milk was leaking from the neck of the bottle all over her. Also, if these bottles tip over the milk will leak right out. I had them in the diaper bag and the diaper bag tipped over and the milk leaked everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS","review":"I would not recommend these bottle to anyone. They leak on us all the time. No matter how tight you put the cap on, no matter how many times you adjust it and no matter how many times you pop in and out the nipple they leak!

I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. For one, the bottles leaked from the collar, resulting in more formula on the bib than in her stomach. Secondly, the bottle allowed for a lot of air to enter her belly, resulting in painful gas after feedings. In addition, there always seemed to be a lot of spit up ( I initially thought maybe it was my daughter not latching on well enough, but since switching to Dr. Brown's bottles, there has not been any spit up or gas at all. I highly recommend Dr. Brown's bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mixed bag","review":"I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had. I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed. I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts. I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts. Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an OK bottle","review":"I haven't had the leaking problems that some complain of, but I'm just not wild about these bottles. Too fat. I find slimmer bottles more comfortable to feed with and easier for baby to hold when they are ready. Also make sure that your bottlewarmer and other items will work with these thicker bottles. My bottlewarmer I used with my first baby doesn't work with these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good bottle","review":"These bottles are pretty good. The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby. She makes quite a mess while drinking from these. However, the bottle is nice and durable. The nipple and caps fit snug. Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers. You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage. I like that. My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very leaky and frustrating","review":"Mine were leaky out of the box, and attempting to adjust the ring and nipple several times did not solve the problem.

So, for the sake of brevity, I will keep it short: These bottles are not worth your money. Having years of experience working in the production/manufacturing industry and on similar packaging/storage containers, I can safely say that the fault with the serious leak issue lies with the design, production and/or quality control (at manufacturer level of course).Simply put, the bottle's threads (and possibly it's seal where the nipple is seated) need to be re-engineered. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, folks...these aren't worth the frustration or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaky and too slow of a flow.","review":"i was pumping for my daughter when she was born and used these bottles and they were great for storage and easy conversion to a bottle, however the milk leaked out of her mouth all over the place and breast milk is precious. i wasted alot and ended up switching to another bottle. also the flow was too slow on the stage 1 and too fast on stage 2 for her as a newborn. it took almost 25min for her to finish 3-4oz. while it only took 10 or so with a standard bottle. Easy for starge to bottle conversion though.i do not recomend these bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent = Gas problem","review":"I started using these bottles prior to going back to work, wanting a bottle similar to the (...). My daughter took the nipple, no problem. I didn't have a problem with leaks...as everyone else noted, you just screw the nipple ring on lightly and assemble the nipple and ring while wet...that's all it takes. I do however have a problem now with terrible gas build up in the evenings and gas noises that make my husband blush!!! . You moms know the screams of a baby with gas build-up...it's awful.

I'm buying all new bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Leak. Plain and Simple.","review":"I have called Avent many times. I have even visited their representatives at a baby faire to complain about these bottles. They showed me how to cap them so they don't leak. First of all you should not have to go through this much trouble to put a cap on this expensive of a bottle. Second of all it still only works about 35% of the time (it basically involves using the cover to do it).What a nightmare. I know at least three people who use these and have the same problems. I have riuned countless diaper bags and forula becuase of these. Now I keep them all in ziplock bags. When I pull them out aout half of the water is still in there and half is in the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Like Avent Bottles - Love the Sippy Cups","review":"I bought these because Baby Bargains' book stated that these bottles were the top of the line. I had nothing but problems with them. They constantly leaked when mixing or trying to feed. They did nothing to prevent gas in my child. I was disappointed with these bottles. I traded in the ones I had not used and switched over to the Playtex disposables. They do not allow air to get into them because you can burp the liners and they have yet to leak on me. I am now starting to use the Avent sippy cups with my son, who is 7 1/2 months old. I love these, but I was really disappointed in the bottles, since all the books I read stated that they were supposed to be the best bottles out there. In my opinion, that was farthest from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options","review":"I had no feeding issues with my son. The issues were with the bottle. If you don't screw the lid on just right, it leaks. And in the begining you're really tired, so it's just not worth it. I bought a ton of these bottles because I was told they are the best. My opinion is that they are trendy - there are other cheaper options. I suggest you buy a few different brands and see what works best for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Bottles Leak","review":"Plain and simple - these bottles leak! I wish I read the reviews before buying these Avent bottles. My husband and I knew nothing about bottles so when our baby arrived 3 weeks early, we didn't get to research and quickly bought these. I bought several of them and when they leaked thought maybe there was just a bad one in the batch. Every time one leaked, I removed it from the rotation. Well, they all eventually leaked so I can't stand them; it's very aggravating. I've since bought the Dr. Brown bottles and have had no problems with them. I even think my baby is less gassy and spits up less with the Dr. Brown bottles. People complain about the extra parts to clean of the Dr. Brown bottles, but that's less of a pain than having the Avent bottles leak all over you and the baby and wasting formula. I'm going to write to Avent and see if I can get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!!!","review":"Look through the reviews and you can see many people upset about these leaking. They are correct! Because it only happens to one in about four or five reviewers, I think there must be a problem with production. Maybe some are leaky, some are not.

One other problem we found is that despite repeated cleaning and sterilizing these bottles maintained the plastic smell.

The nipple did not form a seal around my childs mouth and formula leaked out. She would then cry out of hunger. It was a never ending battle.

I had heard about all these HORRIBLE experiences that women have had... from thier babies not taking a bottle, to having to trying many different bottles and so on... it was very scary. One day my husbad and I were buying a new car and I had the option of nursing in the bathroom (which was gross) or using the bottle that I had pumped for these reasons in the first place. I choose the bottle and my son had no problems at all. He was so happy, I started to pump more and use the Advent bottles more and more. The four ounce bottles are great for little ones. We love advent products I was able to swich from nursing to bottle with out any problems at all!!! Plus now as he's growing they have different sizes of nipples that you can use and these great sippy cup tops that fit onto the bottles....My son is still using them and he's six months old!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Leaks!","review":"I purchased these bottles only because I had planned to breast feed and I had done research that the Avent brand was excellent when switching back and forth from breast feeding to bottle feeding. I was unable to breast feed so I am using the Avent full time. For the first few weeks they were fine but we have had a lot of problems with leaking. Its very frustrating! Sometimes we have to change our sons clothes because formula has leaked down the front of him. We really only keep using them because we received so many at our baby shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"consistent and horrible leaking","review":"How irritating to feed baby in the middle of the night with significant leaking from the bottle. I cannot believe that this bottle is even marketed any longer. These bottles have leaked from under the cap 9 of 10 usages.

Another time , the nipple had cracked and the formula was pouring out, but a new nipple ( upgraded to a 3 mth+) fixed that problem.

I loved them. They leaked only a few times before I loosened the lid. If the milk flow was fast(as another parent mentioned) I switched to a nipple that had a slower flow. I especialy loved the nipples because they don't colapse in and cut off the flow of milk. Worth the investment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love Avent... best for breast or any babies","review":"I haven't had ANY problems with leaking. My daughter was strictly breastfed for 4 weeks and I dealt with horrible colic. I have overactive letdown that I thought might be causing it, so I went strictly to bottle. When I started introducing this bottle, she took it happily. Now she's on bottle fulltime, colic free, and this is the one I use. Tried Vent Aire & the flow rate gave her colic again so I went back to Avent. Baby & I are both happy.

They say the nipples are shaped like mom and good for switching from bottle to breast but my son didn't take to the stiff shape. The nipple is really hard compared to others. Also, no matter how we screwed the lid on, we always had leaks. The third thing that made me throw them out was the fact that they are so BIG. At my son's day-care most of the parents brought Avent bottles and they take up way too much room in the little fridge. So we tried the Munchkin health-flow (used to be Johnson & Johnson's) and we're much happier!

Not only was she exhausted from these results of these bottles, but so was I! I orignally bought them because they seemed as though they were a good quality (hard plastic, etc).

I am still not able to figure out why it leaks but it does and it drives me crazy. I hate having to take the nipple ring on and off to get it screwed on just right so that it doesn't leak. You shouldn't have to do all of that just to keep the milk from leaking. I think they have very poor craftmanship, and need to be discontinued until they are able to redo them.

These bottles would not release when my son was eating, so only when he starting crying because he was fed up, did air go through the nipple and let the formula come down so he could eat. I think, one of the best and honestly, more practical, things to do is buy one type of bottle of each one you think is good, then once the baby is born see what works best with them.

My baby gets one bottle a day of breastmilk and breastfeeds the rest of the time. He has been able to switch back and forth without any problems. My only complaint is the 4 oz. size doesn't seem to practical. He's only 5 months old and drinks anywhere from 4-6 oz. at a feeding and has been doing this for several months.

Now, she can't stand to have Playtex or any other type of nipple/bottle. I have read the other reviews for this product and I noticed that several people had commented on a leaking problem. Actually, if they had read the instructions properly, the nipples for the feeding bottles are not made for the disposable bottles. Granted, I would like to have an interchangable nipple and not have to worry about the finding the right nipple at 3 a.m. But, now that I know about the problem I keep the nipples separated. I am sold on the Avent and products! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly unsafe plastic, leaks","review":"These bottles leak like crazy... and they are/were (at the time of this review) made from potentially unsafe plastics (PVC, phtalates).

I EMAILED AVENT 2 TIMES AND THEY TOLD ME FIRST THAT I HAVE TO CALL THEM TO \\"TALK ABOUT IT\\" I SAID FORGET IT AND THEN I COMPLAINED AGAIN WHEN THE LEAKING KEPT HAPPENING. THEY SAID THAT I WAS NOT PUTTING THE NIPPLE AND RING ON CORRECTLY. THEY TOLD ME TO ONLY TURN THE RING UNTIL U FEEL IT JUST ATTATCH TO THE BOTTLE AND DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN. I TRIED THIS AND YET AGAIN THE BABY WAS SOAKED!!! MY POINT OF WRITING ABOUT THIS NOW IN 2005 WHEN I USED THESE BOTTLES IN 2002 IS THAT I CANNOT BELEIVE THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED YET!!! WE THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT, NOT, NOT, BE GETTING AVENT BOTTLES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak all the time........","review":"I bought these bottles in spite of the price because I was told they were the best. They are the best when you can stop the bottle from leaking which is not often. A few times I gave my son the bottle and left to come back and find him soaked, crying and still hungry. How annoying! I did visit a variety of websites and was told I was screwing the cap on too tight. Whatever! Who has time to think about all that when you have a hungry baby on your hands in the middle of the night. I would not recommend this brand to anyone. Not worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible leakage, don't waste your money","review":"These bottles were supposed to be the \\"best\\" so we went with them, and they were good for about a week. When you would put the tops back on and shake them to make sure that the formula was mixed - the formula went EVERYWHERE! You would have to screw the top on and off several times to get a good seal, and even then it still might leak all over and run down your baby's chin and chest. I also found that my son was getting way too much air from the nipple, you could hear it very loudly. These bottles are all in all NOT worth it, I hope that this was helpful to some of you :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOTTLE","review":"I have read other reviews and I understand they do leak but you have to make sure the ring and nipple are snapped together before you start vigorously shaking the bottle. I have learned that from experience.We did a couple of other brands at first then made our way to this bottle. We like the small size, easy to clean bottle. I like also that you can keep the same bottles and just change the nipples as your baby gets older. My sister-in-law does not like this bottle, but every baby is different. And why change when it's working. I'm a happy customer that I even got my sister to use their sippy cup system for her daughter to get her off the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOTTLE!","review":"I love this bottle.

I switched to this bottle and now mother and baby are very HAPPY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky bottles - Waste of Money","review":"I had a really hard time finding a bottle that my son would take. I could never get him to take a bottle at all until around 12 months. Although my son likes these bottles in comparison to other bottles they are horrible. It is hit and miss when they leak. I'll take the cap off check the nipple and replace it. Sometimes it will still leak, and sometimes it won't. I just keep wiggling the nipple and unscrewing and screwing the cap until it no longer leaks. I've had to change my son's clothes on many occassion from the leaky bottle. Just recently I had to purchase a new outfit for my son (including pants) because he was soaked from the leaky bottle. It is not just a drip when the bottles leak, but more like a constant small stream. The bottles are assembled correctly it's just a bad design. It appears from the other comments that this is a common problem. It doesn't matter how good the bottles are, they are no use if they contstantly leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaky mess!!!!","review":"Every time I would try to feed my 3 month old daughter it would end up down the front of her shirt instead of down her mouth.

They leaked everywhere. I thought perhaps I was putting the nipples on wrong or not tight enough...but that did not work. So I decided to purchase new nipples, that didn't work either. I would never waste my money on these again. I threw away $100 worth of these things...The playtex nursers are better...besides the liners are disposable and there isn't any stuck milk or formula powder to clean up.Don't buy these. You will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return this item","review":"I registered for these bottles and sure wished I would've returned them when I had the chance. They leak!! And we are not talking about a drop here and there. It is a stream of formula coming out. If you can get them to not leak they would be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good for Breastfeeding Moms","review":"I breastfed my son for 5 months and gave him occasional bottle with either formula or pumped breastmilk since he was born. He had problems with the Avent newborn nipple, the flow was too fast for him for the first month. The milk would drip out of his mouth. Eventually he got used to it, but he had problems with spit up so we switched to Dr.Brown bottles (less spit up). When my son was around 4 months old he refused Avent bottles and Dr.Brown bottles. We tried different size nipples, we tried warming the nipple, we tried heating the formula at different temperature. Nothing worked. For two weeks it was like that. Finally I tried Gerber NUK size 2 and I couldn't believe my eyes, he started sucking immediately. If you're switching between breastfeeding and bottlefedding save your money and buy the most inexpensive and the best bottle out there, Gerber bottles (especially NUK)."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LIKE BUBBLES AND LEAKS....","review":"I HAVE NEVER SEEN MORE BUBBLES EXCEPT IN A BUBBLE BATH!

I have a set of twins at home - how frustrating is it for the 6:30am feeding when your bottle leaks all over your children! Not did it happen once, but twice in the same day! The bottles don't just leak, they pour out! Plus, after 20 minutes of sucking, the kids usually fall asleep & have only taken half their bottles - only to get up a couple of hours later for more! I would never recommend these bottles to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bottles","review":"I've tried platex disposable, regular bottles, and avent. This is my second child. The first being 10yrs old. I love the shape and size of the Avent bottles. Easy to hold and big mouth openings. I started having trouble with nipples leaking and thought maybe I had over boiled the nipples so I bought more. Then sometimes they would leak. What I discovered is that if one begins to leak I remove the nipple and then then reinsert it and it takes care of the problem. Evidentally when you put the top together when it is still damp it doesn't always make a good seal. Since I've figured that out I have no trouble with leaking any more and I do love the bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avent bottles leak and poor customer service","review":"We bought several avent bottles and discovered that they leak all the time.

A lot of milk dribbles out...down your arm, onto your lap...all over your chair. It's really annoying, especially since these bottles are NOT cheap. You'd think they could design them better than this! And after awhile, just when you forget how much they leak...bam! It happens again. This is the second time I've used these bottles (I kept them for my second child because they cost so much I didn't want to replace them) and the leaking has annoyed me so much that I was inspired to get online and post this review! You'd think after all this time I would have figured out how to keep them from leaking, but no, there's no rhyme or reason to it. I would strongly recommend another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"I bought the Avent bottles and the bottle warmer. First, the bottles spill...my son had milk all over his shirt and there was a big mess.

I wrote avent informing them of the prooblem...I received no reply except 2 weeks later I received a bottle from Avent in the mail...tried it and it spilled. I gave up and bought its cometitor Dr. Brown...PERFECT, NO SPILLING AND A DRY WELL FED BABY! sECOND, i BOUGHT THE aVENT BOTTLE WARMER...BE CAREFUL THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD. The warmer light turns off but the machine is still on! There is no automatic shut off even though the warmer looks like it is off! Be carefull...I threw this out as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better BPA free alternatives available","review":"From a functional standpoint, I have no complaints. The bottles never leaked on us and they're easy to clean because the openings are wide. However, I changed all our Avent bottles to non-BPA alternatives about a month ago. (BPA is a chemical that is used to make some clear plastic bottles that could be potentially harmful to your child. Although the FDA is still conducting research on this issue, my opinion is why take a chance on something that can be easily corrected. As parents, we have so many other things to worry about.) I blame myself for not doing more research prior to purchasing these. I was at Target the other day and saw a few AVENT sippy cups that were specifically advertised as BPA free. This annoyed me greatly. Does this indirectly imply that AVENT knows that BPA could be harmful, but continues to sell BPA products? AVENT has definitely violated my trust. I will not be spending any more money on AVENT products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains BPA","review":"I had started with these bottles.

I switched to the Tempo Liner bottles and they work just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Dr. Brown's bottle instead","review":"The Avent bottle leaks, has nipple collapse because of the vacuum of air and my baby was swallowing alot of air. I have been using Dr. Brown's for 11 months, they are the BEST, no leaking, no vacuum, no gulping air, no more reflux! These bottles are the best for a baby with gastro/colic problems or without. They are the SAME price as Avent, so buy Dr. Brown's, your baby will thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Bottles!","review":"I only had thm leak once when I over tightened the top.

We were at Home Depot the other day and went through three different bottles and had milk draining profusely all down my daughters front and dripping all over the floor every time I tried to feed her. She was not able to eat a drop and we ended up racing home. The nipples are also shaped to where there is a space on both sides of the mouth when they are sucking. She was sucking in a ton of air and also had milk draining down her face through the sides of her mouth. AWFUL EXPERIENCE. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"Don't believe the hype surrounding these bottles. Everyone told us that these were the best, etc.... Well, they're not. They leak everywhere (despite using the fix outlined on the package) and their low flow nipples only work if you have an hour to spare for each feed. We have had much better luck with the basic nipple/bottle set ups from Gerber or Playtex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Nipples Worst We Tried","review":"Perhaps the bottle/nipple combination works well for some babies, but for ours the flow rate was so slow as to render it unusable. Changing to the #2 nipple with a faster flow rate did not change things. It might not have been the nipple hole size per se, but how hard it is to squeeze the nipple to get anything to come out. Extrapolating from 15 minutes, it would have taken our baby 75 minutes to finish a 100cc bottle. And our baby is a successful breast feeder and can eat from ANY other bottle/nipple combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the extra money","review":"these bottles are a nice sturdy bottle, but when my twins were about 6 months old the bottles started leacking from between the plastic top and the opening of the bottle a real pain..., and they do not prevent gas like they say they do, gerber makes a botttle with a contour design same idea as the avent I haven't tried them but it is the same concept for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had heard so many good things about the Avent bottles and I thought these bottles would be great for times when I was away since I'm nursing. My son hates these bottles. The nipple was too hard. My son also swallowed a lot of air with these bottles and was gassy and spitting up for the rest of the evening. I reccommend not buying an entire system. Instead buy one of a few different kinds of bottles and see which one your baby likes best. We switched to the Evenflo Elite, which was reccommended by a lactation specialist. This bottle is more similar to a breast, has softer nipples, and he doesn't swallow a lot of air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky!","review":"My pediatrician recommended these bottles as an easy transition from breast to bottle feeding, but they leak all over the place if not stored upright. It is so aggravating to go somewhere and find that your bottle has soaked your diaper bag and everything in it! My daughter also gags on the elongated nipple, and seems to swallow more air. We have since tried the evenflo bottles and like them much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected--made baby VERY gassy","review":"I registered for these bottles since I heard wonderful things about them...but they made my son VERY gassy.

It's extremely frustrating, especially when you are expressing your own breastmilk and every drop is like liquid gold. I thought I was doing something wrong but then my husband and a coworker both complained to me at different times with different bottles (so it wasn't just one defective one).

I tried these bottles but my daughter seemed to get more air and then became fussy and gassy. I suggest the Playtex Nursers over the Avent. Every baby is different so it may just be my experience so you should try a few different ones. The reason I gave it two stars is b/c I like how you can interchange all of Avent tops with every type of bottom they make. All of the lids and nipples fit all of the cups, bottles, storage containers etc. That is nice. I am glad I decided to register for the Playtex over the Avent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles with a tiny problem","review":"My wife and I bought these bottles because other bottles were causing our son to swallow a lot of air into his tummy. Subsequently, he would burp and a third of what he drank would come up. With these Avent bottles, he has a lot less air in his stomach, a rarely spits up his meal. If he does spit up, it is a very tiny amount. The only detracting comment I have about the bottles is that some of them leak from underneath the cap. I haven't figured out how to alleviate the problem but it is well worth it to us to have our son keep his meals down."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESIGN FLAW THEY LEAK.","review":"At first we loved these bottles (not many parts, easy to read) then we noticed that they have a tendency to leak milk by the seam. We contacted Philips and they said you must wet the seal completely to prevent leaking we tried that and they still leaked about 1/3 of the time. So we went out and bought Dr Browns and are giving the Avent away. The Dr. Browns are made in the USA and have more parts but our baby seems to like them better, less fussy and less drool while eating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for first 2 months and a nightmare thereafter","review":"These bottles are well recommended but I recommend everyone out there to NOT buy them. I called the company complaining about the continuous leaking and they said I was screwing them on too tightly. Whatever!

I am screwing the bottles on lose..tight....tighter....it doesn't seem to matter. It's very frustrating for me and my son. It's a tease to him when he thinks he's getting a bottle and it ends up all over both of us and then I need to go try and find one that won't leak \\"this time\\".

We immediately got frustrated by the amount of formula that would leak all over us and our baby! We tried everything, loosening the top during heating, pulling the nipple out and putting back in, tightening the top, and NOTHING worked. Or, it would work for a while and then leak again. I'm sure that some of you might want to have to fight with them since they are good bottles, but not me! Why struggle with a bottle when there are some out there you don't have to! We tried the Evenflo bottles, and LOVE them. No leaking, and they are angled for better flow. I don't see them on line, but you can get them at the store.

The first couple of times I feed my son with them I had no problems. Then they started leaking like crazy, I thought the bottle was cracked, but it happened with all of them. And he had such a problem with gas that these bottles did not help at all, they only added to it. so I tried buying other bottles (playtex ventair etc.) and nothing seemed to work (they just didnt leak which was good) so finally I bought those Dr. Brown bottles, and we just love them. No more leaks and no more air bubbles. I gave this 2 stars because they are easy to clean and good for freezing breast milk in.

I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle. The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple. These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings. They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either. They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS, LEAKS, LEAKS","review":"I bought these bottles because I had heard from others that they were the best. For the first few months we owned them, they worked great! Then the leaks started... at 3am when you are half awake, trying to feed your little one- it is really irritating to have formula, milk, juice-- running all over your baby and yourself. After screwing and re-screwing the top on over and over... it just isn't worth it. Not to mention, they are expensive.I am pregnant again and will be using another bottling system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' the Avent Bottles","review":"These are great bottles. They fit right onto the Avent Isis pump which is convenient. I did have trouble with it leaking once in a while, which is aggravating, especially when it's pumped milk you're losing, but I read somewhere that leaks happen when the cap is screwed on too tight. I've had fewer leaks since then. You'd think with such a pricey product, Avent would fix that, especially since everyone seems to complain about it.However, overall, this is a good bottle and I don't plan to switch anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand the leaking!","review":"Baby seemed to do well with these bottles (less gassiness), and the wide bottles were comfortable to hold while feeding her, but I couldn't stand the leaking anymore!

Someone recommended that I try the Avent bottle because the nipple is similar to that of the breast. I have to agree that my daughter has had no problem with the exchange. Unfortunately, the bottle leaks. You have to be very careful when screwing on the cap or you will have milk all over you and your crying baby. When the bottle leaks you have to take the cap off and dry out all the crevices. I can not tell you how frustrating that is when you have a screaming baby waiting to eat.

Please - all new mothers - spend the extra money and get Dr. Brown or ANY other kind of bottle! These bottle leak formula. I would say that 1 out of every 3 feedings results in formula dripping all over our baby. We have tried every way we can think of to srew the tops on and they still leak. My husband will screw them on so tightly that I can't even get them off and what do you know - they STILL leak!! The nipples on the bottle also clog with formula and breast milk and so your baby will be sucking so hard, trying to get food and nothing comes out! These bottles have some MAJOR design flaws and I would really think about going with something different, I know we will with our next child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on Avent bottles!","review":"Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups.

I had heard a lot of great things about the Avent system and decided to invest in it. They definitly did not help with my daughters colic and she would get so frustrated when they leaked all over her. She is on formula and so much of it turns to foam when she drinks that it is hard to tell how much she has acutally had. After trying so many different bottles she is very happy with the Playtex Ventaire system and so are we."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bottle for breastfeeding moms","review":"I tried several bottles and the Avent bottles are by far the best. The wide nipple makes it easy for him to \\"latch on\\" to the bottle without taking in any air. I too had problems at first with the leaking side, but realized after reading the directions that you HAVE TO put the cap on before screwing on the nipple top. Once it's screwed on, you remove the cap and there are NO LEAKS. It must be something with the suction of the bottle. It shows a diagram right on the direction sheet, but I, like others who have experienced leaks, thought I'd rush past them. Great bottle and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many instructions to keep them from leaking. try another system.","review":"If 5-star reviews are correct, and this is the best bottle system out there, then my husband is going to have to start breastfeeding to supplement for my three-month-old because these bottles are horrible. If you don't put the nipple on just right, or you tighten the ring too much, or you mix formula in the bottle with the nipple in, or you do any number of tiny little things, you will be left with a formula-covered baby.Even worse, when you call the company, they insist that you troubleshoot with them, but will not refund your money despite continued leakage because \\"there is no warranty on the bottles.\\"Parents of infants should not have to mix formula with separate equipment, then properly moisten the nipple, then tighten the lid enough but not too much....WE'RE TIRED!I highly recommend trying any other bottle system first. If those leak, too, then go with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Playtex VentAire instead","review":"We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time. We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings. The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings. So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants. Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great bottles - if they didn't leak!","review":"I started using the Avent bottles with my second child. They are great for reducing/eliminating gas, and are very easy to clean. However, they frequently leak, and not just a little, but a lot at times, particularly when removing the bottle from my daughter's mouth & turning it upright when taking short breaks in between feeding. She typically ends up very wet, and I've also wound up with formula on my carpet and/or furniture which is a real hassle. Regardless of how much care is taken when assembling the bottles, the leaking still occurs. Bottom line is that there shouldn't be a \\"trick\\" to preventing the bottle from leaking - it just shouldn't leak! I never had these types of problems with other brands I used with my first child, although I did struggle to find a bottle that eliminated gas. I'm now looking to switch to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to return them ALL","review":"These bottles are awful..I started by baby off on these with 10 in rotation since I was bottle feeding exclusively and wanted to do the \\"avent\\" thing with the bottles, bottle warmer and microwave steam sterilizer....The bottles leak from the collars all over the baby and also leak from the nipple as my baby drinksI am seeking a way to return them all, but I do not have the boxes anymore..

But with the wide mouth which we loved, we just kept adjusting the top time and time again to avoid having to buy yet another set of bottles... Finally, I complained at the store where we bought them and they told me the trick! You must pit the clear lid on the nipple FIRST and then put them both on the bottle, turning it to fit the bottle ONLY by using the clear lid NEVER touching the ring around the nipple. Once it has its perfect fit the clear top will just keep turning by itself - shake away and serve! We have never had a leak again!! I am not sure why this is not in the instructions!! Hope this helps! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great for nursing infants","review":"The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her. It isn't great for infants that are nursing...My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her. Not only was she gagging, but she just didn't like the nipple. I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it. I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since, and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with breastfeeding for us","review":"We bought a ton of these bottles before our baby was born. We had heard that they are the best choice for babies who are breastfeeding and don't use bottles on a regular basis. Maybe they work for some but they didn't work for us at all. So if you are buying make sure you only buy one to try before you invest and a whole set. The other problem I had is that the bottles did leak no matter how I tried to get the lid on. After trying many types of bottles our baby liked the playtex nurser system with the medium flow orthodonic nipples. Hope this helps and Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not vent air","review":"My baby tried these bottles and you could hear the air he was swallowing. He woke up that night much earlier than usual and had horrible gas. Dr. Brown's bottles are so much better and not much more $. Also, the extra nipples you buy with Dr. Brown's bottles come with 3, and the Avent come with 2 (doesn't make much sense if you buy a 3 pack Avent bottles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drip Drip Drip","review":"I purchased these bottle after trying the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which I did not like. While these bottles did reduce my baby's gassiness and feeding time, they constantly leak.You wouldn't think it would take a brain surgeon to screw the nipple/cap onto the bottle and not have it leak. But the majority of the time, the formula leaks from the bottle. In the beginning my baby was wearing as much of the formula as he was eating. I now find myself screwing, re-screwing and re-screwing the cap and holding it upside down over the sink as a test to see if the bottle leaks. And then, just when you think it's safe,..lookout, the dreaded drip is back. The last thing you want to do when you have a hungry and screaming baby is waste time testing the bottle to see if it's leaking. And, it's not just me who has a problem with the bottles,--I know two other moms who have encountered the same problem. Save yourself the aggrevation and buy another bottle system.This one has a MAJOR design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bottles leak too much","review":"I found these bottles to be very frustrating. If the cap wasn't put on just right the bottle would leak horribly.<br />Even if I did get the cap on without leakage, all my 5 month old had to do was bump the cap causing it to move a fraction of an inch and formula would be dribbling all over him. Then I would have to stop feeding, take off the cap, put on the nipple cover and put back on the bottle in order to get it closed just right again. The only reason I tried them was because I needed a wide mouth bottle with a medium flow nipple. These are definately not worth the money. If I could, I would rate them a negative 10. I find Playtex Disposable bottles to be the best......if only they had a medium flow nipple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Em","review":"I started using these bottles when my son was about 2 weeks old. I was having trouble with him taking the breast after having a bottle, as soon as I changed to these, I had no more problems. I like them because they are short and fat, now that he's taking 6 oz.Also before I swiched him he was having trouble with him spitting up all the time. He was on 4 different formulas and nothing seemed to help. I even took him to a allergist and he had no allergies to any of the milk. I love everything about these bottles. I have had no troulbes at all with Gas, spitting up or him taking the breast since I changes. They cost a little more then some bottles but there well worth the money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bottle all around","review":"I really like these bottles because they are easy to clean, they don't leak if you use them correctly and they are easy to hold. I think that the negtive reviews may have come from people using the wrong stage nipple because they come in various stages to use while your child learns to suck harder. Our baby is 4 1/2 months old and we've tried three different types. Advent 4 and 9 ounces, Munchkin Tri-flow 6 and 9 ounces and Playtex Vent-Air 9 ounces. I can't decide which ones I like the best because I like all three brands. I just wanted others to know that the Advent bottles are great.

Well it does considering that the baby does not get any of the formula in his mouth because it is to busy leaking out of the sides of the bottle. So there for, the less milk the baby eats the less gas he will have, right? No. My son had the same if not more gas while drinking out of avent bottles than any other brand. No mother has time to stand there and spend a minute carefully putting the top on a bottle so that it doesn't leak. You would think that the type of money we spend on these bottles the manufacturer would put a little extra effort in designing a top that doesn't leak. The avent bottles are the most expensive bottle on the market and they are not worth one penny. I have been very successful using Gerber bottles and playtex. I do not recommend this bottle unless you have a lot of patience and time to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I bought these bottles thinking they were the best for gas & spit up. I think they work well in these departments however, they LEAK all the time!!!

After breastfeeding for three weeks to a baby that always seemed hungry, I bought a Medela breast pump and switched him to the AVENT bottles and we both have been happy campers ever since. Occasionally I do have a problem with leaks, but that mostly seems to be when I do not insert the nipple under water. On average, I keep 9-10 bottles of breastmilk in the refrigerator ready to go and immediately wash or rinse the bottle/nipples after each feeding and have not had any problems with cloudy bottles or nipples. I did not purchase any of the extra supplies such as warmers, storage containers from Avent. To warm a bottle, I use warm water which will warm the milk in about 10 minutes. I would definitely recommend these bottles to any new mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast eater Bottle","review":"I got the Avent bottles from my baby shower. If you wash them with correct soap and don't tighten them to tight just right they won't leak. I like them because my daughter is a fast eater and bottles accomdate her she doesn't have problems like with other bottles. Also, bottles easy to assemble after washing. The only problem I have with them is that they are to fat, hard to fit into diaper bag. Nevertheless, very good bottles but every baby is different. My little girl gulps down her milk with very little gas and loves the avent bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy just one to see if it works for your baby","review":"This Avent bottle was totally wrong for my newborn. He dribbled formula all over himself and could never properly drink without sucking in a lot of air. As soon as I switched him to the plain old fashioned rubber nipple, those problems went away. I'm sure Avent works fine for other babies, so I can't say in general these are bad bottles--they just weren't right for our baby. Definitely buy just one Avent brand and test it out to see if it works for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Didn't like","review":"Wanted to use the Avent line, but baby just wouldn't take this nipple.

Well, we didn't have a problem with leaking yet, as we had only been using them for 6 weeks, but the problem is is that they let in so much air, that she had lots of gas bubbles in her tummy that made her very uncomfortable (and we would burp her after every ounce). You can hear the air squeaking into the bottle from the beginning of the feeding to the end. Another problem is the mess they make when she's eating. We tried the one and two hole nipples, and she would have formula all over her chin the entire bottle. We're on the hunt AGAIN for a good bottle. Maybe the VentAire I bought yesterday will be better? Or maybe Dr. Brown's??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Mom","review":"I purchased these bottles based on the advertisement that they are supposed to reduce air making them ideal for babies with colic or severe gas. My daughter has colic and did horrible with the Avent bottles. In fact these bottles created such a vacuum that my daughter wasn't able to eat without difficulty and caused escessive gas. They did leak occasionally, but that wasn't such a concern for me. I've contacted Avent and demanded a refund. I would not recommend these bottles, especially if your baby has colic.

I threw it away April 2010. From the first time I used it, I found the measuring cup difficult to adjust and difficult to read. The flexible rubber gasket that is attached to the inner tube is wide enough to hinder accurate reading and makes adjustment difficult. I followed the manufacturer's instructions, applying a thin film of oil to the gasket, but that only helped slightly. I started washing it by hand, hoping that would be easier on the gasket, but again, it only helped slightly. After less than three months use, the rubber gasket started ripping away, so now it leaked when used with liquids. Hard to adjust, hard to read and and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor design","review":"I really like the idea behind this, and it does serve the purpose of measuring sticky, semi-solid ingredients like honey, peanut butter and mayo without leaving half of it behind in the measuring cup. But the design does not work for me. You have to be very careful while filling it, otherwise the plunger moves around constantly and your measurement is no longer accurate. I find that being so gentle with sticky ingredients is a challenge, especially if you want to eliminate air pockets. I wouldn't recommend spending your money on these adjust-a-cups; I'd rather just use a small spatula to scrape out my measuring cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this item used it once and it fell apart the black cap fell off and the clear tube cracked.

They charge $30 and you don't even get a pound of bacon. Now granted, it is cooked so I'm sure some of the weight is cooked out, but you don't even get 1 pound.

He in turn slept with anything that moved and kept a mistress, which he slept with on his wedding night. Plus, he flaunted it in front of his wife.I disliked Sierna as she was so cold and dramatic. Even after Regan sailed for months to find her, she still didnt think he loved her.The ending was frustrating as you had no idea if anything really worked out between them.I have started the second book and it opens with Regan is someone elases bed and Sierna at home, still pushing him away.Fern Michaels is a very talented writer and I hate to give a bad review, but this book really was depressing.I will see what the second in the series holds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

It went from bad to horrible and yet I hoped somewhere there would be a turning point for the better. I never found it. I loathe Reagan. He and his promiscuous self slept with anything that had two legs. He is so superficial. Anything with a face and some breasts gets him riled up even his vile mistress Gretchen. How can you justify the leading man sleeping with someone else on his wedding night? He's a pathetic character. Yet he has the audacity to throw in Sirena's face the fact that she has lunches over the Spaniards house. Maybe it was just me, but I definitely missed where Sirena fell in love with him. What is there to love? On top of all that, the abuse of women was just horrible to watch. Beware. I should have looked at the earlier comments before i read this book. It was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most horrible book I have ever read!","review":"I love romance novels.

They provide multiple definitions of subject matter in different locations. Finally they ask questions in the quiz where there is no corresponding guide in the main body at all (e.g. Information Classification).The book was also edited fairly poorly.

This is a beautifully designed text but it is not an artsy text persay. My son has spent several hours studying the text and has said he learns something new every time he reviews chapters that he has already read.

The stupid thing set itself just fine the first time, but the battery that came with it died within 2 days of its arrival. So I replaced the battery, and watched it re-set itself--TO THE WRONG TIME. And I don't mean just to the wrong time zone, I mean it set itself to the wrong minute and hour. It has maintained this wrong setting ever since then, and there's no way to manually adjust it.I can't imagine what to do with it except throw it away...who would want a clock you can't set and isn't anything like at the real time?Absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This clock worked fine for about a month.

So I do know how to use one.This one, however, has been nothing but a headache. Upon set up it never did catch the signal, so we had to figure out how to set it manually, which is annoyingly difficult.When DST began, the clock did not change. Another headache resetting it.Today the thing went completely crazy and the hands just began racing around, never stopping. We took out the battery and reset it and then it began losing time.DON'T BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice clock with one flaw","review":"The clock was simple to set up right out of the box, just follow instructions. Attractive and fun to watch as it keeps perfect time. But a clock should not make as much noise as this one does; a loud ticking on the stroke of 12, 3, 6, and 9 by the sweep second hand. I can even hear it from my bedroom adjacent to the living room where the clock resides. I still recommend it though, the quality seems to be far superior to the majority of inexpensive clocks available today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk !","review":"1. Has trouble resetting the time once the hour changes due to daylight savings time.2. The minute hand strrted spinning around madly, only stopped once the battery was removed.

Yip, toss the piece of junk and buy a reliable replacement"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dead second hand...","review":"The clock set itself OK and keeps accurate time, but the second hand stopped working on this one like several others have commented after about a month of use.

I wanted a cute book for my daughter and her father to read together, but this was just awkward. He felt weird reading the book due to the wording, and she didn't seem into it. We listened to the CD, and again just felt that this wasn't for us. If you are looking for a cute, sweet father/daughter book, this isn't it.

I didn't bother reading it when I was at the bookstore because I assumed it would be cute. Today I decided to read it before I wrapped it and it is down right creepy in some areas.

I don't really find the whole \\"perverted\\" vs \\"not perverted\\" debate necessary... it is just a strange book. Not at all what one would expect. It isn't phrased in a way that reflects the way mainstream America would view a father/daughter relationship. Do I find the ordinary activities in raising my child special? You bet. But the phrasing was just beyond awkward. I think diaper changing was a very cute idea for a sentimental topic, but it was just poorly executed. I think what should be taken from this is that it is wise to actually flip through books when possible to make sure they resonate with the reader. This one won't be a keeper for us.

It's about eating bananas, dancing with the kid at a wedding and begging the kid pathetically to remember her dad when she's off doing things that adults do. hmmm. yikes.

The illustrations are beautiful, the rhyming verse delightful, and the sentiment is just as sweet and wonderful as a daddy's love for his daughter(s).I recently lost my father, and am a Single Mom... this book touches my heart & makes my daughter laugh out loud. Can't beat that in a board book. I just wish Garrison Keillor would create a SERIES of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $","review":"This is an excellent book! As a former teacher & now a Mommy, I love this book. I bought it as a present for my husband on Father's Day from his little girl. Our daughter is 20 months old & has loved it for a few months.

I love hearing the giggles & squeals as my own \\"big-legged\\" girl dances with her daddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I thought this would be a great book to give to my brother as he became a dad for the first time. However, when I read the book I just didn't feel comfortable giving it to him.A dad and a baby girl's book should be sweet and cuddly, but the image the words produced hit me slightly odd. Why should a dad talk about lifting his baby girl's legs and wiping in between?Perhaps I've been tainted by all of the devient TV out there these days, but it does sound a little Freudian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazed this got published!","review":"Seriously? Ditto to all of the 1 star reviews.In fact, this should have a negative star on it to warn others.I am surprised this was published.This is no children's book - there are words in this book that children would not understand nor would parents want to explain at that age (ie ecstacy).There are plenty of other great books out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book-true to life- not sickly sweet","review":"I was really suprised to see so many negative reviews here. My whole family gets a kick out of this book. When I first saw the title \\"Daddy's Girl\\", I groaned inside. I was afraid it was going to be sickly sweet and tear jerking sentimental. Instead it is very real to life- this is how it is to have little kids people! You DO talk about wiping their bottoms, because you have to do it about 5 times a day for the next 5 years!(ever heard a parent refer to their little one's cute little \\"tushie\\"? Did you ever think they were a sicko for saying it?)I recommend this as a great book for the modern day, hands-on, involved in parenting like he is supposed to be kind of dad.

This product caused my dog to break out in hives all around his ears and down onto his face/neck. He was miserable and scratching at the hives.We took him to the vet when he had trouble breathing. The vet said that many dogs can be allergic to homeopathic treatments and ours was having a severe reaction.Our dog is fine now after a series of shots, antibiotics, Benadryl, etc but I would STRONGLY recommend you purchase an ear wash from your vet so as to not risk making a minor problem worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear Wash","review":"My puppy came to me with ear infections in both ears, so while he was on treatment for it, I researched products that would help me prevent them from recurring. This definitely does the trick, and although my dog's ears do still get itchy from time to time (he has allergies), his ears have checked out fine and I have not once smelled that nasty yeasty smell that indicates infection. My pup enjoys getting his ears cleaned with this and will lower his head and stay still when I apply it. I believe that while also cleaning, it provides some sort of relief to his itchiness. I love that the ingredients are all natural, but the smell is pretty strong and stays on your hands for a while. I use it at least once a week for prevention and 5 months later still have some left in the bottles. There is way more Dry than Wash, however, which is kind of annoying like having conditioner but no shampoo left. No biggie, though; still a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and inexpensive!","review":"My cats both have polyps and are very prone to ear infections. We used to have to give them steroid based ear drops twice a day 5 days on, 5 days off and 5 days on again to clear up the infections.We were instructed to use gloves because there were steroids in the drops and a very tiny bottle was very expensive. They hate getting the drops in their ears and it always took about 3-5 days before they began to get any relief. I tried some of this veterinarian's ear wash and dry - I had discovered the miracle of clove oil years ago after having wisdom teeth removed - and it is amazing stuff. They still hate having the drops put in, but they get relief after the first dose. I don't have to do their ears day after day. It is about a tenth the price and it is so much more effective! I used to hate to see them keep scratching even after I had put the medicine in their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"These items were ok.

My opinion of this movie in two words- IT STINKS! The only parts worth watching are the short battles between Godzilla, Rodan , and Ghidorah. Otherwise the story is fairly boring and ludicrous. The idea of aliens trying to conquer earth using Ghidorah and/or some other monster(Gigan maybe)has been used in the series so much, the plots become very predictable, which of couse ruins the fun of the movie. Godzilla and Ghidorah did not fight as much as in this ones predecessor. And the acting was just plain bad. Godzilla did have some cool moments like the battle on Planet X when he does a funky and funny victory dance after roasting Ghidorah with his atomic ray. If you like cool Godzilla movies, skipping this one is worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool, Very Bad","review":"The Very Cool part is because this is Godzilla and Godzilla (Gojira in japanese) is ALWAYS cool. The movie is basically about some aliens that wants to borrow Godzilla and Rhodan to take care of a little King Gidrah problem that they have, however that is not quite how it turns out.

There are very few pieces that I'd call weak; even these 'weaker' pieces uniformly maintain a chatty, conversational tone that gives the reader a smile or two.Most of the essays are very well written. They provide snapshots of wildly different people who find common ground through knitting. Some of them knit as a form of creative self-expression, some of them knit to provide comfort to themselves or others, and some just knit to keep their hands moving. There are tales of joy and loneliness; there are triumphs and disasters; and for one special knitter, there are worms. While there are some pieces I wish had been longer, the format of the book is an overall wise choice. The brevity of each essay makes it a perfect excuse to put down your knitting for a few minutes and rest your hands while you read a bit. I recommend this book to every knitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road Trip Entertainment","review":"We take lots of road trips throughout the year and the last trip was extremely long. And because I did not wish to referee the entire 9 hours, I ordered this book. The kids loved using this book while on the road. They were engaged, entertained and never fought once(in the car)! The puzzles and pictures were so cute! I could see why they enjoyed them so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pencil & Car Games for Travel","review":"I've purchased three of the books in this series, one for each of our children for our upcoming trip. Of the three (Kid's Road Atlas, Are We There Yet, and the Best Travel Activity Book Ever), this one is mostly pencil-game oriented with a few suggestions for conversational games, songs, and \\"When you get there\\" games at the end.Highlights:*the pages are colorful and include a wide assortment of pencil games. Our nine-year old could complete all of them--our seven-year old could complete most.*Answers at back*Should entertain our seven-year old for awhile...good value for the money.

Being a child of the 80's this was one of my go to after-school shows...always loved looking for Orko during the episode. Anyway, if your planning on buying the completed seasons don't get this. The episodes on this \\"best of\\" will be in those box sets. However, if you want a few good hours, 2 discs, to remember the days of He-Man then this is more than enough to quench that thirst for a trip down memory lane.An excellent buy and a well produced product with hard plastic sleeves.

This is a wonderful alternative to buying the complete seasons...perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOTU","review":"I was happy to see that one more of the 80's cartoons was coming out. The animations are really nice. I didn't second guessed myself into buying it when i saw it. NOW, for those of you that grew up in latin countries like Puerto Rico, and watch the dubbed version, this set (and i'm sure the season release also)doesn't have the spanish sound channel which is a big dissapointment since after watching the dvd in english for the first time in my life, I think that Filmation or whoever dubbe the series in spanish, made a better choice of talent casting the voice actors for the show. Bottom line, if you only watch the series in spanish you are in for a girly Prince Adam?He-man and a silly Skeletor. i Personally wouldnt have bought this dvd if i had the chance of renting it and finding that there was no spanish sound version in it. Other than that If you only saw it in english you shouldn't think twice about getting this dvd or the whole season."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERES SHERA","review":"Dont get me wrong heman is great loved it but as a kid i was addicted to shera i love shera so when is she coming to dvd after all she was lots more successfull and lasted for lots more seasons then heman.

The little moral 'lesson' at the end of each cartoon was a nice touch.

And the creators of the series are right, there ARE a lot of female fans of this series, and I am one of them! I always asked myself if the writers would ever allow Skeletor to have the upper hand in at least one episode. He was so silly, you just couldn't help but feel sorry for him! All of that power, and all of that potential, yet he just didn't have what it took to complete his evil plans. My daughters and I LOVED watching this, and I am already in the process of purchasing all four boxed sets. Watching this left me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside with fond memories of one of my favorite childhood pastimes.

Noonan has included lots of far out unproven allegations she has lifted from Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. She wants us to accept them as fact. She has also put words in Mrs Clinton's mouth in the form of imaginary conversations. Peggy Noonan has invented conversations to prove Mrs Clinton is evil. What does that say about Peggy Noonan? She also has utter contempt for voters for not following her \\"wisdom\\". This book is not about Hillary Clinton. It is about Peggy Noonan. She comes across as another Marie Antoinette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noonan's Fiction","review":"This book was the worst case of editorial fiction I have ever read. Ms. Noonan, apparently snubbed at some point by HRC and out to get revenge, tells us why we (New Yorkers, in the short term, and the US at large in the long term) should not vote for HRC. However, Noonan does not present facts. She peppers the book with phrases such as: \\"Let us speculate\\" what HRC will do if she were to become senator (president). \\"Perhaps a conversation with HRC might go like this . . . \\" It is true that a few facts are included, but most are Noonan's very biased thoughts transposed as HRC's. I could not finish reading the book. I was tired enough of mud slinging from the recent campaigns. I did not need to read fictionalized bashing, whether you, me, or Noonan like HRC's political views or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thousand Points of Tripe","review":"Peggy Noonan, author of over-praised prose for Reagan and Bush, puts her poisoned pen at the service of George W. and Rudy G. in this hastily written, poorly-sourced, and totally irrelevant \\"anti-campaign book\\". If you've seen Peggy hawking this piece of tripe on the FOX NEWS CHANNEL, you know just how impressed with her own words this woman can be. But without the added spice of MS. Noonan's excricuatingly inimitable, dime-store charm-school delivery, her prose is exceedingly dull and uninteresting. The words sit on the page like dead, ugly things. Things to be hated, things to be despised.Peggy should give it a rest and get to work on her next project, a crypto-religious study of the Elian case and the \\"miracle of the dolphins\\". That should at least be funnier than this warmed-over collection of last-century's news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary the bum.

Oh, you poor, poor souls that lap up this garbage. You won't even know it when W finally declares a (formal) suspension of the Constitution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just another hatchet job","review":"Noonan's book on her experience as a Reagan speech writer was a wonderful book. One need not turn misty-eyed or view Sen Clinton thru rose colored glasses, to conclude that Noonan's book is just another vile tract from the \\"get Bill, get Hillary\\" camp of late-night cable TV right-wingers. Talk about \\"politics of personal destruction\\"! Hillary was dead-on accurate about the vast right wing conspiracy, judging from this unpleasant work. I hope Noonan will turn her considerable skills on other \\"character\\" issues -- may those on her side of the street: e.g., \\"W\\" getting rich off the Texas Rangers (just imagine what they would have to Hillary if she had turned $600,000 to $13mil with the help of her daddy's buddies; and the dirty job done on Sen. mccain during the primaries, etc. Gee, suppose Hillary had done what Linda Chavez did -- break the law, lie to the vetting group .... it would keep the late night \\"get Bill, get Hillary\\" crowd busy for years! Peggy: get a life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Truth And Nothing But The Truth","review":"Finally, someone speaks out and tells the true store of Clintonism. Peggy Noonon is a talented author who spent a great deal of time an research to uncover all of the devious tricks that have been pulled on us by the Clintons since 1992. I realize now why the people of Arkansas wanted the Clintons to move to Washington. This book tells the story like no other. Buy it now before its too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Indictment of the Clintons Yet","review":"With the precision of a prosecuting attorney and the eloquence of a Keltic bard, Peggy Noonan gives us the most well written indictment of the Clintons yet.

It was wonderfull to read this book, but sad that it had to be written.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for political axe-grinding! \\"Bring 'em on!\\"","review":"Now that the right wing has trashed the Clintons, who is gonna trash the Bush's?Who will be the first pundit to blame 'W' for aiding the Bin Laden's and Saddam Husseins while profiting Cheney's Halliburton?To be honest, I am sick to death of conservatives trashing democrats and liberals tar-and-feathering republicans. It is time for a leader to stand up and speak out FOR something instead of AGAINST everything the other guy represents.Noonan has, this time, told us what's wrong with somebody. I wish this were the last such tome, but I know better. Noonan usually is good with the quip but tedious when going beyond a two-minute sound bite. This book is Noonan not at her best, but, should please her fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for All Clinton Supporters","review":"If you supported the Clintons (as I did, initially), Noonan's clear-headed, albeit polemical, book will help you understand why so many people abhor them. As one who has seen Clintonian politics up close, though not in person, I believe this book paints an accurate portrait of HRC as a person for whom achieving power is more important than what might be accomplished with that power. Those who read hostility into Noonan's words would be well advised to examine their own emotions. The book appears to be well crafted, although the author relies on secondary sources. As a survey of what others have written about the Clintons, it is unsurpassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"peggy goes 'dutch'","review":"this whole book is full of inventions [just like edwin morris' much dissed 'dutch'], projections, and no solid reporting... to ask 25 beans for this is robbery.... but hey gotta make a buck somewhere...as for [gasp!] the idea that she might use her senate seat to run for president, why do you think that rudy is running?being a senator is not a executive job... it's more theory creating and speech making than decision making...."},{"rating":"1","title":"One More Piece of the \\"Vast Conspiracy\\"","review":"Having just finished reading 'The Hunting of the President', I am sensitized to the possibility that all too much of the media is out to make a political point rather than to create a truly informative narrative. \`The Case Against Hillary' unfortunately, is one of the most flagrant examples of character assassination that has ever been seen in print. The \`politics of personal destruction' is so evident here that it is surprising that anyone would take this book any more seriously than Professional Wrestling. When a book that pretends to give insight into the life of another, turns out to be just a long psycobabble speculation at best... It just isn't a book worth reading unless you are in the mood for a political trip into some fictional fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculation as Fact.","review":"I am glad that this book is in the library and I did not pay for it. I do not care if a person hates or loves the First Lady. But I do care when facts and arguements are not hand in hand. If lthe lies are such a big concern for her, where are the books to condemn Reagan and Bush? Where are the facts to back up statements. I believe in being fair. I think the Clintons have made some mistakes. But if Ronald or George had the same witch hunt going against them,and their wives, and on every aspect of their lives, what would we think of them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Just to clear the air I am politically what you would consider middle-of-the-road. As a voter in New York's upcoming Senate elections I therefore picked up this book with some hope of getting some insight into Hillary Clinton. Instead this book was just a diatribe against her without any new insight or new information. Clearly, Ms. Noonan (the former speechwriter of President Reagan)does not like the Clintons but what else does she have to say? not much. If you are looking for a book that intelligently discusses the impeachment turn to Posner's \\"An Affair of State.\\" If you are looking for a good insightful book on the Clinton Presidency and Hillary - keep waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"an indeptly-written vendetta","review":"Ms. Noonan hasn't gotten over her prediction that Bill Clinton would lose reelection.

Based on a few facts and lots of rumours and accusations this book would be considered libelous in many villages of the world. Why this group HATES continues to puzzle me. We can find \\"lies\\" from every politicien from Caeser to Clinton... in fact today's newsbite political arena almost demands it.This book will sell a few copies to the right wing and to a few 'open minded' types... but it offers no real information. You'd be better off to do your own research... Peggy Noonan can write, but she can't remove the personal venom based on her love of RR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One-sided Partisan Attack","review":"Or is it just personal (because of jealousy)? Its hard to judge emotion from the pages of a short book. Peggy was infamous for her support or Reagan and his lies (even if he was a senile puppet).You should consider the source.

She needs a reality check."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dilemma for liberals","review":"I appreciate Ms. Noonan's statement up front about herintentions in this book. It really is a must-read for all of usliberals who want to see good done for the left-out people of this country. With the Clintons, somehow our party has been hijacked, diverted from genuine compassion, and become devoted to self-serving politicians. Noonan is gentle and provides easily verified information for us to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"The emperor's new clothes don't look so good on Hillary","review":"This, like Barbara Olson's book, is one that Hillary's supporters don't want to read themselves and don't want you to read either. It is compact but full of facts and opinion nicely woven together in Ms. Noonan's very readable style. This book should push a lot of fence sitters off their perch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for the Truth","review":"Noonan has done a wonderful job of describing what most of us have come to know over the last seven years. I thank God that someone has put into words what Clintonism and its founders have done to this country. This is a must read for anyone who wants the unvarnished truth about Hillary Clinton, and without the left-leaning filtering that the media usually performs when it comes to the Clintons."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book?","review":"Vague nonsense. Air. A book like this that is not footnoted and documented is just another attempt to generate and propituate hatred of the First Lady-Candidate for raw political purposes. The words and sentences are pretty. Interesting contrast with the content. Know your author and the entity who funds the effort - Murdoch Group?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite hate, but resentment.","review":"After reading Ms. Noonan's featherweight work on Hillary Clinton, I am reminded of all the other right wing hacks who have come to hate the Clintons for being so successful. This country has rewarded the foward-thinking centrism of Bill and Hillary Clinton with approval ratings that put even Ronnie Reagan to shame. That is the essential dillema Ms. Noonan and her co-conspirators face. It's nice to know the American mainstream has rejected this uglier part of the conservative movement. I hope the John McCain forces can reshape a party that once had a proud tradition. Instead they've settled for George W. Will Ms. Noonan be on-board to write junior's cue-cards?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is just another GOP facist","review":"The author obviously has some serious personal problems against HRC.

No redeeming qualities herself so she has to lash out. Noonan, get a life!The Clinton years - the best in the history of the USA! I felt safe and financially secure until Bush took office and Clintons left. All you have to do is look at the state of the union during and after the Clintons. You can't argue with facts unless you are simply a propagandist not interested in the facts.Bush will destroy this country and the during Clinton administration it was never better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noonan Nooner","review":"This book, written with gusto by a creative phoney, is the latest of a long, never-ending list of books by those tiresome, monotonous Clinton Haters whose incomes seem to be dependant on the misfortunes of others. She tells us absolutely nothing that we did not know, except of course, details of the \\"imaginary events\\" she THINKS may have occurred. \\"BOO! Hillary's gonna getcha!\\" Her tone is snide, and her words are heavily dipped in the leftover aura of her obsessive love affair with the Reagans and the Bushes who probably put her up to this. I borrowed this book. Otherwise, I'd be asking for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine from sour grapes","review":"Former Reagan/Bush speachwriter Peggy Noonan is one of the manysore losers who should be spending their time apologizing for thecampaign of lies and unfounded accusations that have characterized their campaign of Orwellian \\"Truthspeak\\". Even Peggy's former co-worker, Ken Starr, with an unlimited budget, time, and agenda, could not find any facts or proof to substantiate the claims made in this book. But no matter. Peg has a job to do here, and she's not going to let a little thing like facts or accuracy get in her way. Recommended reading for right-wing ostriches who refuse to pull their heads out of their, er, sand. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can have your opinion, but...","review":"I love reading differing intelligent discussions of opinions on relevant issues, but this was not it. Noonan's assertion that she does not hate Clinton is a bigger bit of bull than everything she later says about Clinton. I pride myself on being a staunch independent, but this book could steer me from Republican opinions for years to come (nothing but partisan ramblings) not to mention the worse sin of the lot...it's boring.For all who think that this should influence us in New York, remember that the most popular book on her opponent is \\"Nasty Man\\". If you have an opinion of who we should pick, why don't you read the NY Times and see the headlines about what Rudy is up to before you tell us who we should or shouldn't vote for.You can have your opinion, but don't be so stupid as to think that it's worth my 20 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange brew","review":"Peggy Noonan's jihad on Hillary Clinton would be laughable if it wasn't done with such a serious intent to destroy. Last week, independent counsel Robert Ray announced that \\"There was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official,or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was involved in seeking confidential (FBI)background reports.\\" So, after years of investigations, spending millions of dollars, the special counsel finds no wrong. Like Ms. Noonan's book, it was all a waste of time and money--this witch's hunt is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps English is her second language . . .","review":"I am no fan of anyone named Clinton and I welcome any and all critiques of their activities, but seriously: this book is just so poorly written as to be almost unbelievable. I suggest that Ms. Noonan enroll immediately in a Basic Comp. class at her local community college.Also, and maybe this is irrelevant, but is Peggy Noonan not the most obnoxious human ever? I mean, has anyone seen her on television? Everything about her (especially her voice) is so . . . put on, affected. She is, as Holden Caufield would say, a phony.I guess what I'm trying to say is that this woman deserves to suffer a great deal of sustained pain. Not killed or maimed or anything like that. But someone should give her a big and hideous bruise, and then spend like 10 years straight just pushing on it. I'm sure there wouldn't be a shortage of volunteers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort by a good writer","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I admire Peggy Noonan's gifted writing skills and I certainly agree with the premise of the book. But, this book seemed to me to not present enough material to justify being published. I think she had enough good material to produce a very fine magazine article or series of 2-3 articles, but, I guess she and her agent had sold a publisher on a book deal. By the time she gets through trying to stretch her ideas into a short book, the result is not pretty. Was she just lazy or couldn't she come up with more solid material? The travel office material was very good, but, not much else was up to that quality level.Overall, a lost opportunity to speak out well on the issues and a lot of lost credibility for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"objectively speaking, a horrible book","review":"OK so I don't hate the Clintons as most of you reading this review do, but I'm no lover of them, either. I do, though, hate this book. Noonan, who has no business writing laundry lists, much less public speeches or books, is yet another snooty, upper-class twit who has it in for the Clintons. I read half of this book, became angry at the author's unfounded biases toward Hillary, and then I flung the thing across the room. A bevy of adjectives come to mind in describing this book: unimaginative, \\"superior,\\" elitist, narrow-minded, pro-wealth, jingoistic, mediocre, forgettable, cheap. And chances are that these same adjectives apply to the people who like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional ranting!","review":"Great writing, but where is the content? She tells us nothing, absolutely NOTHING, new. Okay, so she doesn't like Hillary's personality, appearance, friends, husband and so on and so forth, which is fair enough, but never ever does Peggy Noonan give us a good reason WHY. In fact, the only slightly interesting part was the fiction scene with the entertainment execs in LA. That was actually my favorite part of the book, because she surprised me - which the rest of the book definitely failed to do. I agree with whoever said this book deserves 0 stars. An extremely un-intelligent effort from an otherwise bright woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Startling!","review":"This book should be listed as fiction. Most of it is imaginary. I do not understand.

How did Ms. Noonan and the publisher justify this work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Over It!","review":"Peggy Noonan is one of a number of conservative women who just cannot get over Hillary Clinton (others include the highly intelligent Laura Ingraham and the late Barbara Olson). As a conservative, I happen to believe that their insane obsession cheapens the quality of conservative discourse in our country at a time when real issues need to be debated. Noonan is a fraud. Her mannered and affected way of speaking implies to me a desire to put real distance between her present and her past. She detests the Clintons for their morals, yet she was one of the biggest advocates of state-sponsored, political kidnapping when she insisted that Elian Gonzalez NOT be returned to his father in Cuba. That to me is not only inconsistent but perverse. She would prevent a natural father from having his son because of her politics. What a phony. I wish conservative women would GET OVER IT. Hillary is never going to be president. Move on to important issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cash for Slander","review":"The number of writers that would jump on the slander bandwagon is amazing.

It seemed more of a lamentation than a \\"case\\" against anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Short on facts, big on the author's imagined version of events, both past and \\"future\\".

Instead it is a hatchet job just like that Olsen book. What a hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinder, Gentler, Shallower","review":"Ms. Noonan's random, pretentious musings on the First Lady read like Sean Hanity with a thesaurus. What you get by the end of this book is a facile collection of built-up resentments and petty gripes. It's too bad Noonan takes the Clinton's so personally. It's not their fault Peggy, it's yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 points of idiocy","review":"Peggy Noonan hasn't ever recovered from her prediction that Bill Clinton would lose in 1996. The resentments that have clearly built up in her since then have resulted in this condescending, unbalanced, unintentionally-hilarious and ineptly-written diatribe against his wife. However, it could serve as the basis for a satiric monologue about a bitter and irrelevant woman jealous of another woman's success."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the hate mongers at work!","review":"This book is amazing in only one respect--does Peggy Noonan think we don't know her for her right wing agenda already? She clearly is jealous of our First Lady and tries to make her appear wrong or bad in every instance. This simply is counter- intuitive to anyone with an iota of intelligence. However, the hatemongers and vitriolic sorts will love this and buy it up!

Peggy Noonan is a fantastic writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the facts?","review":"Ms. Noonan's book about Hilary Clinton was very disappointing. I looked forward to reading it and by the end of the first chapter, I realized that fantasy scenarios prevaled. The author would state an event in the past and then project that into an imagined event in the future. Because of Mrs. Clinton's actions in the past, she will a certain way in the future. For instance, in an elaborate way, the author goes into great detail when she tells of Hilary's response to her election in November of 2000. As a result, the book left me very disappointed. Since Ms. Noonan had personal experience with Hilary, I was hoping that she would narrate these experiences only. Fantasy had no place in her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spew venom, call it editorial writing","review":"This bit of vitriolic character assassination gives readers an interesting perspective into a former Republican speechwriter (one hears that Noonan is a writer of achievement): she hasn't the discipline to do her homework or provide even a vague semblance of balance. This is like reading David Duke's considered opinion of Jesse Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to rayguns!","review":"I must say that the woman-woman bashing and back stabbing that goes on is more ferocious than any that goes on between men. Be warned-Noonan holds no bars. However, when she goes to make a case against Hillary I find that her \\"facts\\" are just not supported. I'd love to see a well-researched attack on Hillary because I think find her a conservative \\"Republicrat\\" who doesn't stand for liberalism like she should. But to label her a raging liberal? (As a liberal, I'm insulted!) Ms. Noonan should stick to writing worshipful \\"books\\" on the Gipper. They're not good, by any means, but at least that way her ... is benign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it to Beaver's version of psychoanalysis","review":"Tim Russert's interview with Ms. Noonan about her book and the book itself only confirmed my belief that the right has strayed very far afield indeed. The right's position has always been that if we, the American people, only new the Clinton's the way they do we would hate them as well. Well, after years of misinformation, so-called scandals and this latest foray into psychobabble, the Clinton's still rate very highly in the polls, much higher than Bush or Reagan. This drives the right and, apparently, Ms. Noonan nuts. Ms Noonan's thrashing around, hands in the air, psychoanalyzing Hilary and attempting to explain why the Clinton's simply must be bad people was amusing and revealing. Never has Hilary demonstrated the degree of condescension and conceit as has Ms. Noonan in both the spoken and written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting book, poorly written","review":"Let me first state that I am no fan of the Clintons, Bill or Hillary. I believe that he is both a liar and predator and that she is his chief enabler. Therefore, books (and articles) that are negative about either of them attract me.However, although I found Peggy Noonan's book very interesting (and quite clever in a few spots), I also thought that it defined for me the term \\"screed\\". It may be well researched but it is not well written. It has all the appearance of having been hastily dashed off to get to market in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was undecided on Hillary........","review":"The only thing THIS BOOK helped me decide is that Peggy Noonan is a very POOR writer and that she obviously has a jealous RAGE in regard to Hillary Clinton. Too bad she didn't use many FACTS but turned it into a strange diatribe about Hillary's clothing, gestures, and even went so far as to project 'WHAT SHE WAS THINKING' at key moments. If I were Hillary I'd get an order of protection to keep this nut at bay. I'll look elsewhere for a FACTUAL book written by a stable individual to help me make my mind up on Hillary.

As one reads portions of this book or watches her present herself on the Judith Regan show (as she did recently), one is just struck with how deeply this woman truly does hate the subject of her book. In spite of what she may say, her words speak loud and clear, not on the subject of Hillary Clinton, but on... Peggy Noonan. It's my hope that this book goes largely unread. Reading it feels in some ways like how it feels to read neoNazi propaganda: the reader is given a glimpse into how dark and irrational the human heart can become when it chooses to hate something or someone. The reader is left depressed and anxious -- and nervous that others may be actually taken in by someone so clearly full of hatred."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOP 101....Write A Book Which Psychoanalizes Hillary Clinton","review":"As a recent review of this book by Sean Elder points out, the book appears to be the required homework assignment of the GOP loyalty squad. As with the entire current genre of Hillary tomes, \\"The Case Against Hillary Clinton\\" adds nothing but speculation about the writer's obsession.Face it, the tries to peel away layers of the \\"real\\" Hillary. But how does it do this? On a slew of opinion articles written by mostly other GOP operatives.Ms. Noonan destroyed her credibility when she wrote President Reagan's contra speech. In it, you might recall, she referred to the contras as \\"freedom fighters...like our founding fathers.\\" Well, we have since found the contras to be more like our founding Godfathers. This book does nothing to restore her credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another hatchet job from the far right","review":"Hillary Clinton is a smart woman and Noonan doesn't like her. So what?

I learned nothing about Hillary Clinton reading this book. I learned a great deal about Peggy Noonan and it is not a pretty picture. Miss Noonan seems to have total contempt for democracy. She simply cannot accept the fact that her president was defeated by We the People. She has never gotten over it. The book is full of innuendo half truths and rumors lifted form Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. Miss Noonan wants us to accept lies from less than credible sources as fact. Ironically after reading this book I have more respect for Mrs Clinton. She is lucky in her enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Clinton bashing","review":"Predictable Clinton bashing by a right-wing patriarchal woman. She wants the Clintons to fade into the sunset and play golf like Ford, or go to Japan and sell themselves for $2,000,000.00 like Nancy and Ronnie Reagan... She finds it very galling that they actually want to continue to participate in the social process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the Source","review":"When reading this book or any other book by this author, please keep in mind that this is the believer in the \\"Miracle of the Dolphins.\\" Why anyone would give credence to anything written or said by someone with such a tenuous grip on reality is beyond me.

For a perceptive review of the book, go to Salon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan demonstrates her great talent and superb writing style. But good writing does not validate her case against Mrs. Clinton. On the contrary, this book is quite transparent in regards to the political agenda Mrs. Noonan is attempting to further. Mrs. Noonan miserably fails to provide the reader with an accurate account of Mrs. Clinton abilities and achievements in the public arena. This book is full of hate and driven by paranoia about an uncertain future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"Can a First Lady who has the temerity to not have an astrologer really replace Al D'Amato? Probably not, according to a former Reagan speechwriter. That is the latest theme of the new rash of anti-Hillary screeds to we are being besieged with.Noonan breaks no new ground here. We are left with picture of Hillary as a chronic underachiever who can do nothing right. However, if Hilary is elected she will singal-handedly take the entire country down the path of world socialism. (Easy work for underachievers).You would think that Clinton critics would haved learned one thing in the last eight years. Mainly that the Clintons thrive on the excesses of their enemies. While the Silly Billy Bennetts and Peggy Noonans rant on, Bill and Hillary keep right on winning elections. If Hillary wins or loses this fall it will not be because of this book.

I wanted more facts to back up my feelings for Hillary, but instead Peggy Noonan's book is filled with speculation about what Hillary and others are thinking at any given moment or situation. It is stricktly a good guess to put into dialoge what is going on in someone else head! And the chapter that was \\"a dream\\" clinched it for me! Unexcuseable! I'll keep searching for the info I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like Hillary but...","review":"Okay I don't like Hillary but this Noonan woman is bonkers. She actually writes thoughts in Hillary's head. Uh, pardon me? And she complains that Hillary could have done good things and instantly suggest some liberal cause as if it would be a \\"good thing\\". Heck that's just the kind of stuff I didn't want her doing! If Noonan thinks she is a Republican I suggest somebody better explain to her that means more than thinking Ronald Reagan is a nice guy. There are actual ideas involved.I gave up after a hundred pages but my wife stuck through to the end.I still remember when she finished the book, turned to me and said, \\"this woman's an idiot\\". And we're life long Republicans. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing betrays a tired rage","review":"I was hoping to read an informative, yet entertaining study on the history and impact of Hillary Clinton, whom I'm no fan of. But the author constantly digresses into a pendantic rage. And ruminations follow one after another on Hillary's powers and why they should be stopped. Yet she fails to make a case for why one should support or not support her views on Clinton. The final 200+ pages take the reader through a thoroughly boring, month by month overview of Hillary's duties as First Lady. By the final chapters I could barely keep awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinion, fiction, and little substance","review":"I should say at the outset that I felt so cheated by this book that I stopped reading half-way through.I was very prepared to enjoy the book, because I certainly share Noonan's negative views of the Clintons. But I found little to enjoy. As I read the first part of the book, I kept hoping I might find something new, something of substance.... Finally, I came to a chapter which jarred me awake--grabbed my total attention. I read and devoured page after page--in fact, this section went on for most of a chapter. At the end, author Noonan tells us that it was all a dream she had. That did it for me--bad enough that I'm wasting my time reading about fictional dream sequences, but when that sequence is also the best part of the book, I knew it was time to quit.Get \\"Hell To Pay\\", by Olson; much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Non-Fiction Book","review":"The most notable thing about this book is that it is a mix of fantasy (hallucinations?) and very shallow looks at stories that are already widely known. The story of the health care task force is related here but only in vague terms as in a student doing a current events assignment for class.However, the intro is a doozy as it is all fantasy. This could be considered a (lame) device to get the reader's attention if it wasn't for Chapter Five. This is made up as well although the author drags you through pages of made up quotes from Hillary before confessing at the end. If true, this would have been the only part of the book containing new information. As it stands it is only revealing of the author's mentality.The author yearns for Ronald Reagan of old..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Therapay session in book format","review":"Having recently read Ms. Noonan's book I was left wondering how this title was classified as \\"non-fiction\\" when so much of the scanty one hundred eighty pages seemed to be nothing more than Ms. Noonan's personal dumping ground of why she dislikes Hillary Clinton. Very little of the information that Ms. Noonan based this story on came from actual conversations or insider info that she received but rather through other publications by other authors and tended to read like a \\"friend of a friend told me tale.\\" If you are interested in reading about Ms. Noonan's opinions on everything from raising children to battling the Hollywood machine as well as her hearing her political views then you will enjoy this but if you are looking for any insightful information on Hillary Clinton it cannot be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever happened to objectivity?","review":"Another stream of poison adding to the vast river of irrational hatred against the Clintons.

The nation's? The disadvantaged? Her husbands? Or, her own?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculation as Fact.","review":"I am glad that this book is in the library and I did not pay for it. I do not care if a person hates or loves the First Lady. But I do care when facts and arguements are not hand in hand. If lies are such a big concern for her, where are the books to condemn Reagan and Bush? This book seems to be nothing more then bitterness in writing. Where are the facts to back up statements. I believe in being fair. I think the Clintons have made some mistakes. But they are small compared to the past two Presidents. They did not start a war to remove a drug lord that was supported strongly by the last two predidents. They did not sell illegal arms to hostile nations. Let us get a perspective. Hillary may not be a warm caring person but she is smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about socialism","review":"Although we can poke fun at anyone, Peggy Noonan's observations are more precise than not.

To have a book like this end the series the way it did was disheartening at best.

Morosly killing off Toby and Alexandra was not needed. Plus, all 3 main characters ended up wasting their lives.

Instead, years pass by with no real impact, and this book is a travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it!","review":"I, too, read the entire series but almost didn't read Awakening because of the negative reviews. Fortunately, I'm somewhat obsessive-compulsive and couldn't NOT read the closing novel.

Unfamiliar with this wild but lovely animal he sets out to discover all he can about its origins and along the way learns about Central Asia, Buddhism, our United Staes Senate, and the pleasures of living with nature and animals.This is indeed a captivating tale and the next time someone asks you to recommend something to read you will immediately say, \\"Read Forever The Wild Mare, its terrific and timely.

My legs felt better and were less swollen after wearing them for 8 hours a day as a nurse. The only porblem is that because they don't stretch out like normal pantyhose, they have a tendancy to creep down my legs. Like most pantyhose, the crotch wanted to be somewhere around my knees and insisted on taking my pant with them. Difficult to work like that. over all a good buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very comfortable!","review":"I tried these \\"medical\\" support pantyhose in my search for the perfect pair of support hose to help the venous return problem in one of my legs. I found them to be expensive and a little on the short side. I found them to fit poorly too. After wearing them for about 2 hours, they started to bag around my ankles and knees. I had to go to the restroom and pull them up every two hours try to reduce the bagging. They also didn't hold up better than the Futuro pantyhose I bought and I couldn't tell the difference between the Futuro pantyhose and the Jobst pantyhose when I took them out of the package!!They are fairly sheer, have a slight sheen, more like regular support pantyhose, if you are looking for a pair of pantyhose that offer sheerness without looking like medical grade support hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"lasted longer than most","review":"The nylons are less fine than some support stockings out there, so they aren't to be worn with dresses.

But he blew it. His writing is offputting and inaccessible to most. He seems more interested in parading his erudition than enlightening his readers. It's a poorly organized, convoluted slog through obscure allusions and flat attempts to be clever. Even William Buckley would give up on it.

The \\"everybody else\\" are those who don't fit into their ruling crowd. The names of these modern utopians are names like Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Roosevelt, Mao, the Kennedys, the Clintons, and now Obama. Although Obama didn't (or will) kill millions of people, his mentality is of the same structure of \\"I know best for all\\" and will use government power to enforce HIS, like the other names mentioned, well intentioned will. Without the mega sized government like China, Russia, WW2 Germany, and now the American government, he, like them, are nothing more than street corner preachers of good intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep walking...","review":"...right past this movie in the video store. This is the film that convinced me that, outside of Friends, I just don't care for Jennifer Aniston. For a moment, early in the movie, I thought, \\"Hey, she's actually playing a _character_ here.\\" But it passed, and she went back to her usual, low-rent routine. The script and story weren't bad, but a different lead actress (maybe Hope Davis) should have been the first order of business on this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"I beg to differ...","review":"It seems that many people think that this script was implausible. I actually feel that several of the situations are fairly true-to-life, ESPECIALLY the case of a straight girl falling in love with her gay friend.I think that it is true that most people do not believe that we can change a person's sexual preference. But I also think that when women get involved emotionally with a man, they naturally begin to have physical feelings for him as well. Nina's boyfriend says as much to George at one point.Some may think the script is clunky, and maybe it isn't smooth Hollywood romantic comedy at it's best, but that adds to the realism. This film is not a comedy, and to market it as such is probably what made so many disappointed viewers. This is a heartbreaking tale of modern unrequited love.Although the last ten minutes are EXCEPTIONALLY cheesy, I will admit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"People who complain about how \\"unsatisfying\\" this movie is TRULY DON'T GET IT. It's not about the happy ending, per se.

I ADORE the novel, by Stephen Mccauley and thought that Wendy Wasserstein would do his work justice. All that remains are that the characters are still named George and Nina and Nina is pregnant and wants George to help her raise the baby. Gone is Doran, the bane of George's existance at nursery school, and Paul isn't from Vermont, and his fiesty mother is gone also. In her place is Nigle Hawthorne, doing his damned best with a pointless character. Also, the wonderful Alison Janney is in here in a role that was also NOT in the book. Let's not even start about how they took poor downtrodden Howard and made him and obnoixious odious little man.Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd are perfectly cast and do their best to make something out of basically nothing.

Jennifer Aniston gives an emotional performance - she does a splendid job of making you really feel for her character Nina, who works with teens in a community center. This movie also features Alan Alda in a supporting role. Does Alan Alda ever shut up?!? Jeez! Furthermore, Paul Rudd's performance (as George the gay roommate) didn't have even a fraction as much emotion as Aniston's performance.

With a few exceptions, everyone behaves in mature adult way, doing their best to get their needs met without hurting others. It leads to an amusing entanglement of lives.There is not a lot of heavy duty drama, but instead real life give and take. There are no outright villains. You root for everyone.I enjoyed the realistic scenes of gay/straight interaction -- people of all ages and sexuality mixing it up without awkwardness or poisonous jealousy.The biggest problem I had with the movie was that three of the male leads look very much alike and they are presented over a period of about 7 years. It was often hard to figure out just who was who as each scene opened. That may have been intentional, to mirror the shifting romantic alliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"jennifer is great, movie is poor","review":"I thought the movie story line,was boring, contrite, and went no where.I believe jennifer aniston carried the movie.Her acting was great, and her comedic approach is always terrific.Why she gets bogged down in poorly written,close to idiotic story lines is quite amazing.her talents are wasted in a movie like this; whose talents are continuously wasted in poor and meaningless stories and pictures.Again jennifer is the best.She should find better roles to play in. jack purvin,m.d."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply unwatchable","review":"This could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen.

Wasting the talents of a guy like Alan Alda in a turkey like this, for example, is a sin. Rudd and Aniston give good performances, but they don't have good material to work.

It seems to be marketed as a sort of thriller, but I think it is much more a psychological story. Much of the movie is taken up with J.J.'s psychological counseling and his psychologist. This certainly is not a feel-good movie. Simply put, it shows how important a positive support system is for a juvenile who comes out of drug rehabilitation or some juvenile criminal institution. This movie would probably be best shown to families of kids finishing their time in the institution so it can be discussed. Hopefully, it would help some families (at least a few) avoid placing undo pressures on their child that will result in his or her self-destructive thinking. This movie shows how the relatives and friends created situations that put 'JJ' back on the path to more time in a juvenile institution, and, as he gets older, will result surely in prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable low budget film!","review":"This is not a typical horror film--great performances and truly creepy!

The characters are so engaging and interesting, you can't help but get drawn into every aspect of their lives. I suppose that comes from the fact that it's a soap, and if you're pretty exclusively into horror like me, you don't get to see this kind of thing that often. This tape include the point where I jumped on, and it's not that hard to figure out what's going on. This tape is part of the series where Barnabus Collins, the famous vampire of Collinsport, Maine, bites young Maggie Evans, with the intent of making her believe she is Barnabus' lost wife, Josette Collins, who committed suicide long ago.

It doesn't absolve them of the harshness that often makes up part of their lives, but it doesn't dwell on them either. I find it objective and balanced.The only real problem with the book is that, as others have noted, it is very out of date. The few pages added to this edition don't really cover the incredible transformations that have happened in the country since Ms. MacKey lived there. It really should have been re-written.A better, contemporary book is Thomas Lippman's \\"Inside the Mirage\\", current up to 2002.

I bought this book even though friends who lived in Saudi Arabia had warned me that I would be disappointed--that the writing was stilted, but most importantly, the author had missed too many important points about Saudi life. Actually, Ms. Mackey's distant observations made me feel she was out of touch with the real Saudi Arabia and with real Saudi Arabians.Once I realized that this book was written many years ago, and that the author had very obviously spent very few years inside the Kingdom and then has not been back for nearly twenty years, I was quite dismayed.As someone who spent many years as a guest inside the desert Kingdom, there are books on Saudi Arabia that I would recommend, including Robert Lacey's \\"The Kingdom\\" and Jean Sasson's \\"Princess,\\" but I would not recommend this particular book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate, not worth your time.","review":"I picked up this book a while ago.

I was thrilled when I saw this book. I was disappointed from page one.In my opinion, this writer did not spend enough time in the country to get a handle on it--a few years only--what I call parachute journalism--also, she writes that she lived closed in a Western compound. This is very limiting for a writer.The writing shows it. I felt I was reading what she had been told or had \\"heard.\\" I may be wrong, and if so, apologies.There are plenty of other great books out there about Saudi Arabia.

It is very readable andyou will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow read....","review":"While this book is quite informative and details interesting insights into the Saudis, I found it to be a slow read. The writing is very bland. I only continued to finish the book because I find the subject matter interesting, but it took a long time to finish, as my attention span wained. I chose to read this book after reading PRINCESS: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE BEHIND THE VEIL IN SAUDI ARABIA, by Jean Sasson. This book peaked my interest in Saudi Arabia. I was dissapointed to find that THE SAUDIS didn't provide the intense insight into the Saudi culture like Sassons's book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible","review":"I read this book while living in Saudi Arabia, across the street from where the author lived.

She lived so briefly in the kingdom and did not even live in a native setting, so I do not believe she is a person who needs to be writing about the Saudis. She is assuming to be an expert when in reality, that is rather a joke. I think of this book as giving me a chance to be an outsider peeking in, for about five minutes.

It's fine for background music for the trick-or-treaters. But for any other use it's flawed. There's only a single, album-length track, so no putting this one on \\"shuffle\\" for your Halloween party. The sounds repeat, so after 20 minutes of this, you start getting deja vu. And there aren't even \\"themes\\" in the album--no plots, which some of the more elaborate halloween SFX albums have (this is the \\"torture chamber piece,\\" this is \\"Alone by gaslight stalked by Jack the Ripper...\\"I'm going to wait for an apology from Martha on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let-Down","review":"First, let me say that I'm a big fan of both Martha's halloween ideas and Rhino Records (the label that released this CD). I was Very eager to hear what both of these talents combined could come up with. Sadly, both Martha & Rhino (names I Trusted) let me down. My two main complaints? 1. It's just a 5 minute loop!and 2. as another reviewer pointed out, this CD doesn't tell a story and take you from one scene to the next (because it's ONLY ONE SCENE- over & over). The reason I'm writing this review is in hopes that Martha with try again with a Vol.2. Martha, if you're out there: 60 minutes of many individual themes seemlessly segued (no looping!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very high quality Hallowe'en soundtrack...","review":"This one definitely fights off the cheese! The sounds are believable, spooky, and well-produced. Additionally, the one-long-track format is perfect for looping during Trick-or-Treat or an outdoor haunt. While some may find the repetetiveness of the various sounds detrimental, I thought it worked fine! This is because it allows you to pack the punch of an assortment of sounds over short periods of time, without the pressure of having to cater to a specific timeline or story that short-term visitors won't be able to appreciate. Hallowe'en makes us totally subject to en masse memory rushes, and so it's probably a good thing that this mix is dense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Excellent continuous-play album for the big night!

Although the quality of the sound effects are good, this CD is simply nothing we haven't heard before.

Simple sound effects CDs like this seem almost too cliche to work on their own anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"this should be titled sounds for weenie halloween.","review":"I think Martha should sing some sort of rap back up by a hard rock band. that'd be freakin weird. someone should remix this to a techno beat and use it at a rave!!

I do, however, have a very difficult time swallowing these because they are absolutely huge. I tried cutting them with the pill cutter but the edges were so sharp it hurt when I swallowed them. It's not possible to cut them and round off edges since they easily crumble.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT really is the Kingdom of God - ?","review":"A+ (This book says what the 1st book \\"Rediscovering the Kingdom\\" says, but he expands on it much more in this book.) Myles Munroe answers the 'what really is the Kingdom of God?' question we thought we knew before, but most never really did.He unveils what has always been in scripture but most of us have never seen nor understood before. It is exciting revelation to know what Jesus meant when he said \\"the kingdom of God is near\\". This is well written and will open the eyes of those who are willing to see beyond what they already see and know. A must read for all hungry Christians. We're buying more to hand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"Was looking forward to this based on his reputation and the subject.

Winding its way through the lives of the former prep school musicians who record a vanity album which is resurrected by a record collector who wants them to reform and hit the road, the narrative explores the failures and foibles of the guys in an effort to build towards that \\"big gig\\". I won't spoil the ending for those who still want to read the book, but there's plenty of reunions of old band members going on out there at clubs, weddings and the like and you'd be better served by going out and seeing the real thing....even if all you'll hear is a warmed over version of \\"We Gotta Get Out of this Place\\"...at least it's live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of book shipment/receipt","review":"Book arrived as promised, perfect shape, will order again no question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I really like this eye brow shadow.

The price for this is really great and works(for me) even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No To Rob Thomas","review":"This song is well-produced, catchy, and well-performed. But why is it so bad? Maybe because Rob went from the soul-less pop-rock schlock of Matchbox 20 to his new image as a shorn, ear-ringed, and hoodied poser. Unfortunately, even if you liked Matchbox 20 (I pity you), you probably won't like this.He sings music that he doesn't have the earnestness nor the authenticity to pull off; and maybe they should have had Usher do it, since he is actually talented.What does Rob want to be, a mere pop star and make a ton of money? Ok he is that and has done that. Does he want to make a musical statement that will endure and prevent him from being relegated to the annals of 'Whatever happened to this guy?' Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me Qualify That","review":"The music on this CD was not bad, in fact, some of it was quite good - however, I was extremely disapointed to find out that this was the solo effort of one, Rob Thomas - NOT Rob Lowe, which is why I purchased the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Loyal fan of Matchbox Twenty","review":"When did people start thinking it was ok to sell out, take the last nickel and dimes on the floor and run back to their Hollywood home.

I also cannot view the DVD portion on my iMac.This is essentially useless to me.

They are only hurting themselves in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Thomas Rocks!","review":"Just got the cd a couple of days ago and was pleased with Rob Thomas's solo debut. The first three tracks are great. This Is How A Heart Breaks, Lonely No More ( his hit song climbing the charts now and receiving tons of airplay), and Ever The Same. He also has some very relaxing and subdued ballads on the album such as When The Heartache Ends and My, My, My. One of my favorite tracks is All That I Am. It is very haunting and mysterious sounding. You can really hear the Asian inspired influences throughout the song. Overall, a really great album. Just go out and get it and you will be treated to hours of listening pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Effort !","review":"A friend introduced me Matchbox 20 years ago when they were nobody and I said to him, \\"This guy's voice is amazing\\", I was refering to the first CD \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\". Tracks like \\"Real World\\", \\"Long Day\\" and \\"Kody\\" just really sounded like these guys knew what they were doing.I told my friend that these guys would be huge. And that was back in 1996.Now, Rob Thomas' solo effort has done the band one better. Please don't be fooled into thinking that \\"Lonely No More\\", the first hit from this CD is where it ends.This guy is an amazing artist. His songs and his dedication to good music is very evident on every track of this new CD.\\"...Something To Be\\" is as fresh and new as anything I've heard in the past few years.Rob Thomas is a magnificent singer and you would only be doing yourself a favor by listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"rob rocks","review":"maybe if rob had a piece of anatomy removed, he would sound like jusin timberlake. justin does not have a patent on his sound, nor was he the first one to use that sound. rob ,as always, has great lyrics and a great sound, a little different on some of the tracks, but great all the same. rob is as far from justin, as britney is from norah jones. he is hot, talented, and if his tour hadn't sold out in ca, i would have gone. definitely give this a listen. also out is a companion cd at the store (red circle logo) were i bought this . it has some remixes and new songs as well. a great start to the summer music season."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album by a talented artist","review":"This CD is for those who like to listen to music and not just have background noise. The lyrics do not insult the listener's intelligence and the music is hummable. The variety of styles show that Rob is a talented artist who is unafraid to explore variety. The lead song \\"This Is How A Heart Breaks\\" is a great rocking beginning, and all through the cd until \\"Here Comes The Night\\" the listener is taken through a musical ride, not for a ride, finally ending on what can be considered a lullaby to rest with. This CD should attract MB20 fans, plus garner a new legion of fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad that there's more Matchbox 20 comming!","review":"The CD is true to Matchbox 20 just only Rob, so it's not as deep musically as the group. Still a Very Good solo effort. He has been quoted that \\"the band will be recording\\" later this summer, I can hardly wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"don't buy this cd if you plan to listen to it in a cd changer. It's got the \\"bonus\\" dvd on the same disc as the music, which makes it too fat to play in the cd changer. I spent the evening taking my cd player apart to get out the cd that I plan to return. Never got as far as listening to it so that I could write a review of the music.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I am a Matchbox Twenty Fan and a fan of all kinds of music in general, but this is a total step back from the potential I know Rob Thomas has. This CD could have been a hundred times better than it is... especially when you can pull in John Mayer for a track. I mean Streetcorner Symphony (The track on which Mr. Mayer plays on) is a campy and cheesey over produced song that any Mickey Mouser with time to kill could have made. The Bright spot on the album is the first single Lonely no more ( I love the dance feel of the track it came totally out of left field for me) and the song My, My, My isn't that awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only CD I Can Listen to Straight Through","review":"It is rare that you find a CD that you like all the songs. If I was stuck with a CD player that couldn't skip songs, this is the CD I would pick to play on it. WOW! He does a great job as a solo artist (of course, I hope he continues on with MB20 as well). He has got to be one of the greatest songwriters and singers of our time. This man is dripping with talent! If you like all the songs to sound the same, don't buy this album, because each song on this CD has its own personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought the CD just for the first single, but was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the songs that I found I liked after I heard it for the first time. The DVD part is also a very interesting addition. If you like Matchbox 20 I believe you will like this album too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great CD.Usually when u buy a CD you have maybe 1 or 2 songs that are good.But everyne here is good.Only problem i have is u cant pay it on a regular CD player.It only works on DVD.I can pay it on my walkman but not CD stero.Weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!!","review":"This is an awesome cd! If you are a big Matchbox Twenty fan, then GET THIS!! It's packed full of great songs...aside from the hit \\"Lonely No More\\", \\"Ever the Same\\" is going to be the big \\"radio smash\\" off this cd (it's the \\"Unwell\\" of this disc)...\\"Problem Girl\\" sounds like a hit for radio, too...The only real disappointment is the opening track \\"This Is How a Heart Breaks\\"...it's almost like a \\"filler\\" track and never reallt goes anywhere, imo...but overall this is a must have disc for any Matchbox Twenty fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different","review":"Rob Thomas' solo effort really is a 90 degree shift from the Matchbox Twenty sound, which I love. The songs are certainly \\"poppier\\" and some songs are more memorable than others. What I can say is that the Matchbox Twenty music has a better longevity (ie. I can listen to their albums over and over without tiring of them) than the songs on this album. It is still a fine album of songs, and has a few twists and turns which I enjoy. The DVD part is great, as it plays in DOLBY DIGITAL, as well as containing some behind the scenes footage of the album recording. Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to Be is excellent","review":"This CD came in excellent shape. It is both a CD and a DVD. Very much worth the price. Very entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to avoid...","review":"Rob Thomas is the Bryan Adams of the 21st Century. If you like bland, tasteless pop music masked to be edgy, then this is your man. He sings with horrible vowels, he can't dance (seeing his video proves that), and his songwriting is as predicable as a Bon Jovi song. If I ever find myself listening to music like his, then it is time for me to go to my eternal rest. So if you have any, and I mean any, musical taste, please don't buy this album and scoff anyone you see listening to, or even worse, enjoying this album. Get the new Feist album. That is some catchy, interesting music. And if you don't want to get that try something else. Heck, get a U2 album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Attempt At A Comeback!","review":"As a huge Matchbox 20 fan, this album disgusts me. I already have it posted up on ebay. Anyone want to buy it from me? I originally thought I would give this album a chance, because I also liked the song \\"Smooth\\" which featured a solo Rob then.Well this cd is nothing like that. Lonely No More is the only song worth listening to, and even that gets boring.PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My copy works great on iTunes","review":"An earlier reviewer mentioned that the dualdisc couldn't be scanned into iTunes. I ripped it last night with no problem.

However, that's the highest compliment I can muster. With the exception of \\"Now Comes The Night,\\" only b/c I burned it onto a compilation, I haven't listened to this cd since the month it came out. I wasn't looking for a Justin Timberlake-esque album when I picked this up. I just don't dig whatever direction Rob wanted to go in with his solo material. I find the stylistic inconsistency as a hinderance to the album rather than a selling point for his diversity. Next effort please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know what it sounds like because...","review":"it won't play in anything. I'm taking it back to the store and never buying DualDisc CD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop/Rock that works","review":"You'll want to crank this album. Rob Thomas -- a gifted, award-winning songwriter -- shows us he's more than just your average pop/rock band frontman. Generally a music buyer is lucky to get six great tracks off of one album, but Rob has delivered a dozen you'll want to listen to over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"just Ok at best","review":"Rob Thomas should have done this about 4-5 years back when He was rolling with Santana from the Hit song\\"Smooth\\". Thomas trys his hand at trying to flip the script of His previous sound with Matchbox 20&He is met with Mixed results. some of the material here is hit&miss but the biggest Problem is that Vocally He just doesn't add anything.His voice is always just kinda there&he lacks any emotion or anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"something to be","review":"I admit I cheated and listened to this c.d before it came out in stores..It made me want to buy it and buy it i did.Overall I think it is a solid debut album from a solid performer,but i still perfer the Matchbox twenty format.Sometimes i felt like He was playing it safe not steering away from the formula that has kept him well fed,which is not necessarily bad just \\"safe\\".My favorites are of course \\"lonely no more\\" which is recieving alot of airplay as his debut single,but careful it is almost killing it.\\"all that I am\\" is my absolute favorite and had the laugh when i read someone say it was just horrible.goes to show how different taste can be.and \\"now comes the night\\" oh also the title track \\"something to be\\" as i said these songs i may be drawn to by the relation of the circumstances thrust upon me in my life...i do wish however there were more up tempo songs because i kinda got bored with it.Overall not a disappointment worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUT","review":"I think Ricky Martin tried to make a comeback in disguise as Rob Thomas... or Rob Thomas attempting to make a buck by sounding like a Justin Timberlake knockoff...Whatever...Matchbox 20 was original, they did their own stuff. This album sounds like every other over produced pop album that attempts to pass for music. Rob Thomas, who now looks like Elijah Wood and sounds like Justin Timberlake. maybe he should take a turn on Surreal Life with Flavor Flav and Jose Canseco. Talk about a mad season...he needs one! If you're looking for something that sounds exactly like everything else out there then this cd's for you, but if you're thinking this is more great Matchbox 20 type stuff then run away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Embarrassing. Embarrassing especially for his MB20 band members. Complete and worthless cookie cutter music. Let's assume his manager and record company were holding his family or pet hostage until he produced this mindless piece of crap to fill their wallets. Hey Justin, Enrique!!! Watch out, here comes Rob!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Rob thinking?","review":"Although one reviewer praised this album as a breakout for Rob Thomas, I would strongly disagree. To have a breakout album, an artist needs to move into other music genres in an effective way. Rob Thomas has sampled other styles by doing a poor imitation of other pop artists. It is Mad Season meets Living in Vida Loca. Rob must have thought we were loco to buy this stuff. Rob Thomas had an engaging sound and style on Matchbox 20 albums. Some over zealous producer must have gotten a hold of him. The result is that Thomas has sunk to new lows in his career. I next expect to see him on American Idol singing old Bee Gee tunes. Save your money. This one is truly a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality bad and Dual Disk format CD won't play","review":"Although the sound quality of this CD isn't as bad as the Matchbox 20 CDs, it's still not great. I should have expected as much given the terrible quality of the Matchbox 20 CDs. Anyone with a halfway decent stereo and a good ear will be displeased with the quality of this recording, and the fact that even a LOUD volume can't drown out the obnoxious clicking of the CD as it spins in my high-end CD player doesn't help matters any. I would recommend that anyone who wants the music and has an mp3 player should buy the music from iTunes, since the sound quality won't be any better on a CD, and you'll be guaranteed to be able to listen to it. I wouldn't waste the money on the chance that your CD player will play it. I just wasted $20 on a CD that I'll never be able to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Thomas is one to watch...","review":"His singing style is very unique as are his lyrics. He has an eclectic mix of love songs, \\"we are the world\\" type songs and a few others on this album. He has the staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes. I loved Streetcorner Symphony! It is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me. Lonely No More is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in that one! Enjoy this album - I sure do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Rob!","review":"For a first solo attempt I think Rob did very well. I really like this CD. It's not MB20 although a tune or two has a little MB20 sound going on in it. However, for the most part it's not MB20, it's Rob Thomas. The album has some Latin/Soul flavor mixed with R&B and Rock. There are moments when I longed to hear the rest of the band with him, but I got over it. If you're a Rob Thomas fan I don't think you'll be disappointed by this album at all. That VOICE! He rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to see Rob Thomas Stretch Beyond the Angst","review":"I had heard Rob say in an interview that he was happy and wanted to write and sing songs about love gone well, not bad. I believe he achieved this on this CD. I like the faster songs such as the first track and the title track. I also find myself going back to Fallin' to Pieces. I would really like to hear him do more in this genre. Great dual disc info also. Recommend as a die hard MB20 fan and fan of Rob Thomas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was a big Matchbox20 fan, so I looked forward to listening to this disc, expecting to find music that was ver similar. There were two songs on this disc that were decent, the rest were below average to bad, including about 3 which consisted of a fair amount of yodeling (I am not kidding). It wasn't at all what I expected or wanted, and even adjusting for that, it wasn't very good.On the positive side, the disc does have some DVD content on it which will make for a better value."},{"rating":"2","title":"wanted","review":"i loved i loved real nice wanted sweet sweet sweet i love rob thomas good cd wondeful cd good good"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT AS EVER!!!","review":"I absolutely love this album. Rob Thomas' voice is so sensual and emotional and he never ceases to amaze me with his endless talent. This album was a little different than what I was expecting, but it is totally awesome! If you are hesitant about buying it, don't be. This will be a purchase you will not regret!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word... horrifying","review":"I must admit, I kind of like Matchbox 20. I never went out and bought their albums, but songs like \\"Push\\" and \\"The Real World\\" do bring back some good memories of the mid-to-late-90's (although the late '90s was when pop culture first began to truly suffer).But in the last year or two, I've been noticing a very annoying song, mostly on radio. It sounds like a Justin Gimplerfake \\"song\\", with its sophomoric keyboard beat, and its grating vocals, complete with the ultra-annoying \\"OH-oh-oh-oh!\\". I didn't know who bleated out this wretched abomination, I just assumed it was some hack like the previously mentioned has-been Gimplerfake (actually, scratch \\"has-been\\", \\"never-was\\" is more like it).Now I find out it's Matchbox 20 frontman Rob Thomas? Say WHAAA?!? How did he go from decent songs like \\"Push\\" to THIS garbage?!?Sigh. Rob Thomas is another casualty of the hellish 2000s. I'm done. NEXT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Matchstick 20, but softer.","review":"How did this guy get a record contract for this solo flight. It sounds like he took alittle bit of this alittle bit of that and formed a giant turd in the form of a CD. This stuff is so cliche it's beyond comprehension. There is no feeling or creativity in one second of this material. Everybody has their own likes and dislikes when it comes to music, I won't argue that. If you like pop music that is fine with me. But when you can't even come up with one idea on an entire record you need to be stopped. This is a guy that will be playing county fairs in a few years. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole CD is GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!!","review":"Rob touches on so much with this CD. My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit! \\"Streetcorner Symphony\\" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song. Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it! We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song! I can't wait for his live albulm to come out!

It isn't perfect, but it's still great as a debut album. Rob Thomas offers great alternative music, with my favorite song on the album being \\"Lonely No More.\\" The song is great because you can relate to the words of the song, and the song has a great beat to which you can dance to. He's probably more known for the song \\"This is how a heart breaks,\\" which was featured on the NBA on ABC theme song a year ago. That song is also fantastic, and also a song you'll love to dance to. After listening to this first album, I'm hoping that he releases a second album soon. This is a sensational album that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not the Rob that I love to listen to....","review":"Great effort, but I was really disappointed here. I love Rob Thomas' voice, but I just didn't hear a whole lot of it here. He has such a strong, powerful voice that is usually FILLED with emtion and personally, I found this album lacked his usual power!I think he is trying to appeal to the Justin Timberlake crowd - i.e., younger crowd and I find that not to be his style (this try-to-be-boy-band??). I don't like the new look and/or image. When I saw Lonely No More video, my very first thought was - \\"Augh... George Michael!\\" 2nd thought was \\"Oh, Rob, don't dance\\"!Get back to the roots, sing raw and with emotion! This album simply lacks emotion.Anyway... my 2 cents worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Woooh what is this. Damn Rob how low can you go. Embarrasing. I hope you stick to MB20 in the future..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it can be ripped","review":"I don't know what's up with that one reviewer but, yes, this CD can be ripped on to a computer. As for the music, I love Matchbox Twenty. This CD didn't knock me off my feet, but I appreciate Rob Thomas spanning his wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did This Have To Happen!!!","review":"I am sorry to say this to all you radio pop listioning teenie boppers but this is TRASH! I mean just look at the video he's trying to dance and look all suave or somthing (very tacky/cheesy). What happened to the Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 what happend to the good old days of the \\"Bent\\" video that was real music and it wasn't pop produced garbage. Please don't buy this and support the industry (it must DIE!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 stars if availble as non-dualdisc","review":"Apparently the new fad of the RIAA this week is DualDisc-only releases, such as Springsteen's Devil's and Dust and Rob Thomas's Something To Be. I personally have enjoyed releases that have included an extra DVD with some lil featurs or videos, maybe surround mixes of tracks or the entire album.But the Dual Disc is a double-sided disc with a DVD on one side and the CD on the other, which eliminates the label and also the DVD-side ends up really scratched if you use cd-wallets or booklets in your car or anywhere, as I personally do.Overall the album itself is decent, though not as solid an effort as Matchbox Twenty, though it has it's moments when he's not just sounding like a former boy-band member."},{"rating":"1","title":"a NOT must-have album","review":"I am a huge fan of Matchbox 20, but this solo album cannot be compared to it. It is not bad, but Rob Thomas seems to have some eastern influence on his music, especially on track 3 and 7. The melody on track 3 is similar to many eastern music melody. On track 7, one of the instruments used in the background is very \\"easternly\\". It is so not \\"Matchbox 20\\". The most catchy song is \\"lonely no more\\". The other songs are just okay. Even if you are a fan of Matchbox 20, this is a NOT must-have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the hype?","review":"People are acting like Rob Thomas is some sort of musical visionary. He only did that one song with Santana, and has like one hit with his other band Lifehouse. I listened to this CD with my friend Ill Bill last night, and I was sickened by it. It sounds just like the rest of the re-hashed crap on the radio of the sort. Oh yeah, nice dramatic close-up for the cover...dork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs - Will not play in my PC or CD Players","review":"A great set of songs with very poor implementation. The dual disk has copy protection and will not allow me to copy the songs to my PDA. I have never shared a song with anyone else, but this CD wont let me use it as I normally do. I finally decided to get out my portable CD player. It will not work with the CD or DVD side. The DVD side will not play in my DVD player nor my computer DVD drive. The CD side is recognized by my DVD player some times, but not other times. This is the last copy protected CD or dual disk I will buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with Age","review":"On first listen, I wasn't so jazzed about the CD, with the exception of \\"Lonely No More\\" and \\"Ever The Same\\", which were familiar from listening to the radio. The more I listened, however, the better the CD got. Some music that I listen to seems to get \\"better with age\\" or to improve over time; this was no exception. I plan to make the new Rob Thomas CD one of my favorites and I am actually really glad that I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Give It A Higher Rating If I Could Play It On My CD Player","review":"The music is great. However, I can't play the dual disc thingy on my CD player and I'm really upset about that. I have to listen to the music via my DVD player. That ain't right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello? Listen to it more than once","review":"If you haven't discovered yet Rob is an amazing musician and the song on the album are very mature and well produced you have to listen to it a few times to get it, but if you do it's great!!! It has a lot of depth compared to you average pop singer and the last song is work the money alone.Thank you Rob! You could have taken a break but music wan thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimenting beyond Matchbox 20","review":"Sure, there are moments when the leader of Matchbox 20 sounds like his band in this album. There are too songs that bring to mind Justin Timberlake. But Rob Thomas doesn't stop there. In a fashion similar to Gwen Stefani, he experients with a handful of musical styles to come up with his \\"Something to Be\\" album.Most interesting songs are the ethnic \\"All That I Am\\" (which blends sounds from at least three different parts of the globe), the R&B; \\"Fallin' To Pieces\\" and the party-starting \\"Streetcorner Symphony\\". Best songs, hands down, are the ones that remind the most of his classic Matchbox 20 sound: \\"My My My\\", bringing to mind other songwriters such as Josh Rouse and Paul Brill; and the closing \\"Now Comes The Night\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"dual cd not a plus","review":"This can be played on one side as a cd and the other as a dvd, but we just play it in our car and it has a hard time reading the cd.

The music makes one want to get up and move! He has some soft songs too, but overall it has good energy. I really enjoy it!

And it is written in a fun style. Good times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not the best","review":"This guide has accurate descriptions, up-to-date maps and a good introductory section. Its drawback is that it only has a very limited sample of hotel and restaraunt listings for many locations (like Monteverde). The descriptions are quite good but limited.I know it is impossible to cover everything, but I cannot deduce a strategy or a pattern used for including some hotels and eliminating others. This is a good guide for a person who is in Costa Rica for 7-10 days and is going to cover so much ground that too much detail would be overwhelming. However, if you intend to travel at a slower pace or spend more time in Costa Rica,there are better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Thought I would give some of Lonely Planet's competition a try, and I was sorely disappointed.

It is a definite must have in any photography book collection. Even though this is the \\"light\\" version of the book, it is still quite impressive. Still, the packaging for international shipping (I'm located in Mexico) was not the best for a product this size. The book arrived slightly bent in one corner. Not a show stopper, but it was annoying to have such a magnificent piece slightly damaged. This is the second time that large scale items sent from Amazon have arrived with minor bumps. I have never had problems with regular sized books. I would no doubt order this book again from Amazon since the savings are better than the damage suffered, but be warned.As for the quality of the pictures, it is simply and without a doubt worth the price.

My fingers have never hurt so much- the music inspired me to pick up my guitar again to try to play along with some of these songs- listening and singing along just wasn't enough- I needed more involvement in the music.

Your child can place the little frog's head into a hole on each scene on the wooden pages. The frog is secured by a string, so there's no burden of having to keep track of where the frog's head has gone off to. Great for very young children to develop basic skills.My son is only 22 mo. old, so I like to sit with him and let him practice putting the frog's head where he would like and then we tell stories of the froggie hopping from page to page, scene to scene. My son is a bit young to keep his attention for long, but it's well worth the time he does spend using his imagination and coordination skills.It is a wonderful quiet play book as well, so it's perfect for sitting through church services or waiting at the Dr.'s office. It is a perfect size to fit nicely in the diaper bag or even my purse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good price considering the $10 shipping","review":"The product price is $20.75 but the shipping charge by onlineRx is $10 ($9.99 to be exact).

I purchased the Diaper Genie 2 - and it IS all it's cracked up to be. We are nearing the end of our second refill and the diaper \\"pail\\" part of the diaper genie does NOT smell. The baby's room does NOT smell. It is soooo easy to use - one-handed.It's similar to how a Saftey First diaper pail given to me 3 years ago was supposed to work. The difference is that this really does work. I'll gladly purchase the refills in exchange for no smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"My favorite diaper system was discontinued, so I used just a trash can for a while and finally I couldn't stand the baby's room smelling so bad that I broke down and bought the diaper genie II (after reading all the reviews). I was so excited. I set it up in two seconds and we were ready to go. After 4 diapers and only one day of use, every time I opened the lid to push another diaper into the pail, a horrid smell came out of the pail. I emptied the pail the next day and even when it was empty and I put my first diaper in it, there was the smell again. I even put baking soda into the bag, and nothing helps. I nearly gag every time I open the pail. I would return it but I stupidly threw the box out already. What a waste of money! I'm sure it would work fine for newborns who drink breastmilk, since their diapers don't really smell much anyway, but my DD is a toddler. I am totally disappointed. This product is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"I loved this at first. But after two months of daily use the thing broke. I cant get it back together. I think I will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it away on Day 2","review":"We bought this before our son was born, and threw it away before he was three days old. I refused to give it to someone else, and subject them to such a terribly designed diaper pail. At first I was convinced that we were using it incorrectly. I couldn't conceive that someone intended me to stick my hand into a filthy bag to throw away a diaper. The trap door has a lot of resistance, so you really have to push against the diaper to get it in there. It's impossible to keep the area above the trap door clean, and the hole is pretty small, so even if you've managed to keep yourself relatively clean through the diaper change, when you go to throw the diaper away you'll have crap all the way from your hand to your elbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive crappy stinky plastic","review":"Thank goodness someone bought this off my registry, otherwise I would be pissed off for spending the money, but I am still angry that I didnt register for a better product. I also don't understand what other people are raving about with this product. I am a new mom to a one month old and I have had it with this piece of diaper crap product. My main complaint is that every time you push a diaper through it pushes more of the bag through to the dirty diaper section, so when you go to empty out the 15-20 diapers that fit in there you have 3 time the amount of bag than you need. If you are economical then you will want to use these pricy bags and therefore have to re-push the now filthy stinky bag back through the spring loaded trap. I will be looking for a better diaper pail now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well light your money on fire","review":"You have to give it to Playtex, they have this down to a science. They actually get you to pay $30 for this, then you have to pay $6-$7 for each refill which lasts 2 weeks.

If they didn't give you a gift receipt then just throw it away, you are ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get this","review":"This system is horrible, we received it as a gift and without a gift receipt otherwise I would have return this product. How they expect you to push through the spring loaded gate with a filled spoiled diaper is beyond me. This product should be discontinued and the design engineer fired.Skip this and get the Elite. It makes so much more sense with hands free step on to open the gate(just like most of the kitchen trash can.)It receives one star because it does trap the diapers well and there is no smell coming from it.(I disagree with other reviewers giving low stars cause you pay a premium for their proprietary trash bags, you know this buying into the product, it should be no surprise. In addition, this is how most company milk you for money, its an old business tactics modeled after the razor blade cartridges)"},{"rating":"1","title":"spring for the elite","review":"We first bought the elite and we love it. Thinking a second on another floor in the house would be a good idea, we grabbed this product. The differences, for 10$, are pronounced.The first two differences are quite cosmetic: the genie is a few inches shorter and it does not have a foot pedal. I didn't think this would be a huge issue. Boy was I wrong. This product forces you push the diapers through the opening. Now this doesn't sound bad until you realize that the mechanism used to keep the smell in is very stiff and requires some pressure. This really isn't the most hygienic method of diaper disposal. In fact in really messy diaper and you'll most likely want to shift the bag down some.The rest of the product is ok. Its quite easy to remove the diapers from the product. The razor to cut the bags is fine. The bag replacement system is well designed and easy to replace.

You have to push the diaper thru a tight hole and would be unsanitary. I put the poopy diapers in a separte bag and walk take out to trash. Design flaws are : 1) You have to push a diaper through tight hole and does not work for poopy diapers. 2) The refill bag cardtrige has a sharp lip on it and when you stick your hand down to push the diaper in...you have to watch because it scraps and can cut your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it.","review":"I love my Diaper Genie 2.

This is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks and gets poo on your hands.","review":"Whatever room you put this in is going to smell like a Mexican toilet. The trap-door spring mechanism is just not the right design to contain the smell of the old diapers, so all the rank air just wafts right out the top. Also, it's terrible if you have a pooped-up diaper; you have to jam it though the trap door and the bag doesn't slide freely like in the original diaper genie, so poop gets smeared all over the sides of the bag and it doesn't go below into the container. Also, the trap door is trying to close on your hand throughout all this. I really have NO IDEA why they discontinued the original Diaper Genie in favor of this piece of junk. Good job, guys, basically everything about your new design sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another option","review":"I used diaper Genie with my first child. With my second I am using a Simplehuman stainless steel trash can I got at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $25. You can also find them at Target. You can use you grocery bags in it. The lid closes tight enough, and I find it easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Genie II SUCKS","review":"I wish I had gotten another Diaper Champ but I didn't... I liked the idea that the dirty diapers would be bagged. I thought this sounded like a great product. I read some positive reviews. Here's how it works though. You change the baby's diaper. It's a messy, wet #2. You roll it up as best you can. Then you reach over to your genie. With one hand you open the lid. The other hand then has to push the dirty leaky poopy diaper into the genie. You actually have to push this nasty diaper down pretty far. The problem is that to get it past the stink gate, you have to apply force... causing contents to spill out onto your hand. It's disgusting. It's like they didn't actually test it on babies. My diaper champ is so much better. You drop it in the hole and flip the top for it to go down. Enough said. Diaper Genie II sucks. I regret the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Diaper Champ not a Diaper Genie","review":"We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie II.The Diaper Champ is by far the superior product. For starters - our Diaper Genie breaks about once a week - the spring inside that holds the clamps together pops off if I stick my hand in too far. Second it uses Playtex propritary refills - the Diaper Champ uses plain ol' trash bags ($1 for a box of 50 at the Dollar Store).I have found no perceptible difference in either product from the standpoint of odor control - they both do a fine job."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I just purchased this item since the handle on my Neat! diaper pail recently broke and so far the Diaper Genie II is living up to it's good reviews. I really hate to have to buy the pricey refill bags, but I can't stand having my daughter's room stink, so I think it's worth it. The first thing I learned with this product though, is to make sure to pull the bag out enough so when the first few diapers fall in, they fall down to the bottom of the pail. The weight of the diapers hanging in the bag from the clamp was preventing the clamp from closing tightly and letting the diaper smell escape. That seemed to do the trick and now there isn't any smell at all! I never had the original Diaper Genie so I can't compare the two, but this is very similar to my Neat! pail which I was very happy with until it broke. So I'm hoping this will be the last diaper pail I ever have to buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible diaper pail","review":"I hate this diaper pail. I had the neat safety 1st pail and the product was discontinued, there was never any odor from it at all when inserting a dirty diaper. I bought the Diaper Genie 2 after reading the reviews and am so disappointed every time you put a dirty diaper in terrible dirty diaper odors escape even if there are only a few diapers in the pail.Also you have to change the pail every other day. You would be better off just throwing the diapers in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it.","review":"I received this as a gift at my baby shower and I was really unimpressed. First off, it doesn't hold in the smell. Second off, the refills are somewhat expensive long term. I ended up using it only for wet diapers and not solid ones. What has worked best for me was just taking grocery bags and tying up the soiled diapers in those. I have also had friends who used this model and they got maggots and worms in the bottom of the bucket. I think there are other solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refills are a money pit and total scam. Other than that it works well.","review":"The Diaper Genie II does what it says and keeps odors at bay. Unfortunately when you factor in the $6 refills it's not worth the total yearly cost of $200+.

I've seen other products (maybe even earlier versions of this product?) that have complex mechanisms that flip over but the way this diaper pail works is very simple and straight-forward. There's not a lot to break and the mechanism/cutter works very well. We're getting a lot of mileage out of the diaper genie refills so no complaints there. The plastic housing itself feels a little flimsy/light. Other than that, it's a 5-star product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Odor Control!","review":"I am so happy with the Diaper Genie 2! You can easily use it with one hand and it's been excellent at keeping diaper odors contained. Many of my friends have either gotten rid of their diaper systems all together or have used their systems only for \\"wet\\" diapers b/c of the smell. I have used the Genie 2 for over a year now and have never had an odor problem in my daughter's room. The only \\"preventative\\" thing I've done is put a stick-up air freshener in the bottom of the Genie. The refills are easy to replace and last a while. I would highly recommend the Genie 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - Doen't hold in smells! They said it was improved over the original, but it's not!","review":"I bought this to replace the original Diaper Genie because it was rated so highly for odor containment... BAH HUMBUG! It smells every time you add a new diaper. Just ONE poopy diaper ruins the room. I could've sworn it said you didn't have to push down with the diaper, but you have to push it down through a trap door. Once that trap opens, out come the smells! I'm using our old one and donating this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, Simple to Use Diaper Pail","review":"This diaper pail is better than the original Genie, in my opinion. This pail doesn't require twisting, so the bag doesn't unravel and thus defeat its purpose of odor blocking existence. Second, the springs are pretty good (usually) on the closure mechanism, I had to fix it one time, but it's been 8 weeks and it still does just fine, and I usually don't have to worry about getting any icky diaper residue on my hands when I put them in there because I usually close the diapers up really tight when I'm done changing the little one. I also keep a bottle of Purell by the changing table. Overall, really good diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one minor problem ...","review":"I've had my DGII for about a month now. The only issue I have with these is that when the refill cassettes get close to empty, the bag starts to loosen around the rim. Then, when you try to put a diaper in, the bag kind of goes with it, so you end up using more bag than you really need. Otherwise, I really like my Diaper Genie II. The only real stink you smell is when you get the full bag ready for the trash; inevitably, I end up penny-pinching by squeezing out excess air so as to use less bag. But I can easily take the thing outside the front door to do this, so it's not really a big deal. It sure beats my old diaper pail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BUY!!!","review":"The Diaper Genie II works phenomenally. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a baby or is expecting.

I don't know why everyone says this one has no smell, I have both models (this and the Twistaway) and I MUCH prefer the original Twistaway! This one literally STINKS! It's awful! It smells SO much worse! If I have just one poopy diaper in there, you can not only smell it when you open the lid to put in a new dirty diaper, but you can still smell it after the lid is closed again! And I don't know how many times I have scraped my fingers on the inside trying to push the dirty diapers into the diaper genie! With the Twistaway Diaper Genie, each diaper is \\"twisted\\" individually into the bag, sealing in the smell. Also with the original Twistaway, the refills are lightly scented, with this model you get nothing. Nothing but lingering poopy stink! I'm ordering another Twistaway and giving this model to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lock, can smell previous diaper","review":"We own two diaper genies, one original, one \\"no. 2.\\" I agree that many things are improved over the last model....such as the cutting system for example.However, while it doesn't smell when it is just sitting around, whenever you push a new diaper through you get a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE smell from the previous diaper during the split second that the spring is open to push the diaper through. Then you get to enjoy that HORRIBLE HORRIBLE smell for even longer as it makes its potent way around the room. The old twistaway NEVER had any odor. I'm embarrassed to have anyone (parents, babysitters) use this one. It is horrendous.Also, the old version had a child-proofed lid. NO, I did not need two hands to open the old version. On the new one my 20 month old toddler can just open the top right up and put things inside.I also miss the handle that used to be on the back for carrying it around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks! I mean it stinks! AND.....","review":"First off we have twins. We had one of the older styles, which it appears Playtex has stopped supporting for refills, so we changed to this Diaper Genie Essentials Pail. What a terrible design! Trying to stuff the soiled diaper into this thing you can and at times do get pee and poop on your hands. Why? Because the flawed design forces you to push the soiled diaper between two flexible gates and down into the actual catcher, which means the pressure from the flexible gates compresses the soiled diaper and squeezes the contents out. This system does not, like the previous version, hold or reduce the smell either. My suggestion? If you can find a better solution get it! This solution is NOT worth the stench nor the crap on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Platex Diaper Genie...","review":"So, I have spent hours buying new products for my precious Angel Carlee who will be here in July. Her nursery is done and I was working on essential products. Someone recommended a diaper genie.. So I purchased one. The concept is understandable. Putting it together and getting it to actually work is another story. I think I will stick with the regular trash can, and just use the scented bags for the bad diapers.Please don't waste your money, from one mother to another.. its time consuming, expensive and a waste!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this, get the Delux","review":"I accidentally broke my Diaper Genie Delux so I picked this one up not knowing the difference between the two. I HATE it. While the Delux has its own set of problems, I actually couldn't live without it. But this version is just terrible. First of all, it's smaller than it looks so I can only fix a few size 6 diapers in before I have to change it. But the worst part is that without the foot pedal, you have to SQUISH the diapers down into the Diaper Genie, and my hands always get dirty. I don't see the point in even offering this model for sale. I hate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"I received this as a shower gift and at first really liked it. This works great for infant diapers but as far as toddler diapers go just throw the diapers in the trash. This works good for my daughters wet ones but if they are dirty I don't even put them in here anymore because they stink. When you open the lid to put a new diaper in, if you have already disposed of a dirty diaper you get the whiff of it. And you have to open up the container from the bottom to cut the bag for when you are going to dispose of the diapers and when you cut the bag the aroma of the diapers fills the air and the smell lingers for awhile :/ I think for my next child I'll have to search for a different diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"no smell","review":"I love the diaper genie II. We live in a 1 bedroom aptartment and Our daughter is in the dining room. (Long story we are moving at the end of the month) Anyway there is no smell and we have thrown out poopie diapers.

But otherwise no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but I'm going to try the Elite version.","review":"This diaper genie does a wonderful job of concealing the odor until you have to put another diaper inside. You literally have to stick your hand into the pail and then your hand comes out smelling like the dirty diapers that are stewing inside. Not a great plan: I looked at the Elite and you do not have to put your hand inside so I'm going to return this one and try the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"We used it for less than a month when our baby was just born. It held about 10 infant diapers, I cant imagine how many toddler diapers it would hold, 1? It was disgusting to have to push a dirty poopy diaper into that contraption. And in the end it still smelled. I actually returned mine it was so horrible. I would usually not return something my daughter's poop had touched, but this was such a horrible product I couldn't imagine supporting the company who made it.In the end we switched to cloth. They are amazingly easy to use and clean, way cheeper than disposables and they don't sit in a landfill for 500 YEARS! Thats how long disposables take to degrade. That is disgusting, great legacy for your baby to leave behind... I honestly feel guilty for even using disposables for a few weeks. SWITCH TO CLOTH!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"We registered for this product a year ago when I was pregnant with my son. I was excited when we received it, as it was deemed the latest and greatest thing on the market at the time. Well, it may have been the latest, but it has proved to be less than great. It was \\"somewhat\\" adequate in odor control before our son started solid foods (as long as we changed the bag every 2 days or so) but now, it fails in all respects as far as containing odor. Absolutely every time you put in a new diaper (and sometimes just opening up the lid) the smell hits you right in the face. My husband and I fight over having to change his diaper, but not because of the current change required -- rather, we just dread having to go in there and opening up the diaper genie to make a new deposit! Don't waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"go with the Champ","review":"Since I am not willing to cram my fingers into a poop filled diaper, I am no willing to use this product as planned.

But it has what I consider a fatal design flaw. When the bags run out, the last length just slips right out of the holder, and you end up with no bag left in the top part of the genie. If you're not watching, you can easily stick a diaper into the genie without a bag. I go through a lot of bags with my twins, so this has happened on more than one occasion. Really irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design!","review":"I am very disappointed with this new and \\"improved\\" diaper genie. Every time I open it up to put a new diaper in, the wonderful smells from previous diapers come shooting out. In my opinion, the old diaper genie was much better. At least it kept the smells in. I would recommend buying a different system that twists the individual diapers, therefore keeping the odors in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, easy to use, cost effective","review":"I really wanted a diaper pail and online they said it was the best -- and I really like it. It's also not a big thing, but very nice-looking for a diaper pail. The refills are $5-6, but I only need one refill (maybe 1.5) a month. You need more at the beginning because they go through more diapers. It is another one of those expenses that you really could eliminate, but I love not having to worry about where the dirty diaper is going. It's easy, you don't touch anything, and you only have to empty it after 15-20 diapers. Very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I bought this because I had the old Diaper Genie when I had my two other children. The old one worked great! We never smelled a thing.

She uses depends type disposible incontinence underwear. I ended up taking the spring trap off as it kept falling apart. With adult diapers there is more material to put in the pail so I agree with others that the spring load was not handy. I have found that the pail holds more since I removed the spring and I just use scissors to cut the bag and take the bag to the trash. One disk of bag material lasted 1.5 weeks. Even though the spring was missing there wasn't an odor after the door was closed. I admit I use my cat's litter box deodorizer to help with the odors.

I will give this to Wilson: unlike many fundamentalists, he's pretty open about his belief in patriarchy. The only thing scarier than this guy are the people who idolize him.

Another tip I found helpful for messy diaper changes - get 2 table pads and keep the second one under the changing table. If you have a midnight messy change - you will have a fresh changing pad ready for the next change and you can do the laundry and change the cover when you are awake.We are finally out of diapers, but these sheets really helped keep the messes and cleanup easier for us.

Good book for starting Linux. Includes Netscape Communicator 4.07, Red Hat Linux 5.2 and X Window System, also known as X. This book will get you started, but there is more to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"It should have occurred to me, when I foolishly purchased this book, that a handle like \\"Maddog\\" was not auspicious. This book is poorly written and its treatment of the subject matter is not worthy of a book devoted to Linux. The ancient copy of Red Hat hardly justifies the asking price. The instructions are incomplete and superficial. Insult was added to injury, however, in the section on the configuration of X-Window. \\"Maddog\\" suggested that if you were not successful in getting X running you should; \\"buy a solution\\", or \\"take a trip to the South Pacific\\". I was not amused. Someone who buys this type of book, to learn about an operating system on his home computer, wants concise information. I didn't expect a compendium, but the combination of glibness and lack of clear, basic information was more than I could tolerate. This book went back to the store!

This book was completely frustrating for me. I am an avid DOS/Windows user who wanted to give Linux a spin. Now, I consider myself quite knowledgeable when it comes to the inner workings of a computer, but I knew I'd need help with how Linux interacted with the PC. This book provided no help whatsoever. Every time I had a question about setting up any part of Linux, the author's response eventually was \\"Go find a Linux geek.\\" That's why I bought this book -- I needed a Linux geek to show me what I can do.

Example: on page 42, Chapter 4 of my edition, the book tells you to type \\"startx\\" to start the Control Panel (after installing XWindows). Inexplicably, it then doesn't tell you what to do next until page 107, Chapter 9!

Frankly that's the main reason someone may want to deal with Linux. The enclosed CD has an antique version of RedHat.Also, in a desperate attempt to be trendy some of the side bar articles are completely useless (ie 'Polish Connection', 'Alternative CD uses', etc.) They were out of place and a complete waste of time. The standard 'For Dummies' jokes are fine, but it should at least have something to do with the subject.There are a few technical errors, such as claiming NT isn't a multi-user OS (!) and a few minor hardware misprints.Bottom line: Great book to get you installed and started.

The bulk of the text focused mainly on installing and configuring Linux, which seemed like a repeat of the Red Hat installation docs (which are free).

I got more from the Docs on the CD, and as terse and cryptic as they are that is really saying something about the book. Like don't waste your money here.

It tells you briefly how to install Linux by jumping from A to Z and after that well it gets worse! Overall as you can tell I was very disappointed and I'm usually not a critical customer!!! Dummies books are supposed to make things simple, but this book leaves you with many questions. The publisher should include another flavor of Linux such as Caldera's to make it worth the price!

No. Therefore my linux system was useless as I had no network.

However, the characters were not likable, which made it difficult for me to identify with their struggles.More damagingly, one of the characters was from a Jewish background, but the novel is full of the most elementary errors about Jewish culture.

The book is a fascinating, intereting read, and goes by very quickly. It is at times amazing and at times ridiculous, combining to form an uneven, but highly entertaining read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rerun of Kane and Abel","review":"Like all Archer books this is a story well told but it reads so much like the Kane and Abel saga you could probably change the character names without any great loss.The characters are also so thinly disguisedon real press barons that the end is pretty easy to figure out well before the end,A good read but spoilt by the above so it was not hard to put down unlike earlier novels.Disappointin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable men battle for news empire","review":"Yawn. A tedious tale from the master of the formula novel. Both the central characters are ruthless, charmless men, with whom it is very difficult to relate or empathise. After a short time I stopped caring who came out on top, because both were so despicable.This novel has many similarities to Kane and Able, but lacks the human element of that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pages 100-680 could have been abridged into 100 pages","review":"Lubji's transformation into Player and Armstrong all made sense. But then Armstrong's character was divorced from early development. From clever and observant and linguistically talented, Armstrong became an ill-mannered boor with Henry VIII's eating habits . . . all without explanation. Great opportunity for character exploration was sacked. Keith was never a mystery, driven with an occasional hormonic urge. There was no need to jump back and forth between the early decades of their lives. I kept on looking for the purpose of the jumping around but there was none to be found. Crisp but empty. The only good lesson was about bargaining around page 48. I finished it only because I'm compulsive. After all that disappointment, cutesy ending was insulting. Those of us who survived deserved more. Lazy, lazy work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is wonderful. What is not to like about Jeffrey Archer's work!

She was crying, frightened, in bed, because the story had scared her. I confess I hadn't read it, but since it came home from her Catholic school, I assumed it was okay. It's a frightening, violent story, especially for a little girl. There is time to deal with the explicit stuff (torture, a lance through the base of her skull, etc) when children are older and better able to understand. I am certain our Lord does not want children frightened in this way. We can stick to the uplifting stories until they're past the age of coloring books, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not what I was expecting; I thought the music would be very mellow, but it sounded more like a movie soundtrack with a few bird trills and crickets thrown in.

I've posted a picture so you can see what I'm talking about. The bubbles, roughness and voids in the braising is what I expect to see in a low- cost Chinese bit, not one manufactured by CMT.I wrote CMT USA about this, but have yet to get a reply...also not what I expect from a tier 1 company.I need to add that this bit is cutting HDPE beautifully, but it better...HDPE is a very soft plastic.Incidentally, I need to add that the picture is incorrect.

It is certainly one of the best books in modern poetry--a landmark! Along with James Wright's The Branch Will Not Break, this book defined a generation of poets in the late 50's that decided poetry had become too dull and scholarly. These poems are alive and rich in vivid imagination.

He uses scripture to justify his claims and calls them truths. The author attacks key Chirstian political leaders and Christian groups and the people and/or groups they represent but fail to include himself in the same category. Do not be fooled by the hype! The author makes racist claims against the African American communities based on the behavior of Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton. The author is ill-informed concernings non-white groups in America. If Christianianity is about name calling and fault finding then I am not interested in becoming a Christian. This book is propagandic in nature and has racial overtones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprises in every story","review":"Three years ago, I got this book because of the Kafka tale in it.

For the first 6 mnths it worked fine. After that time period we would be watching a dvd movie and half way through the picture will go black, but you could still here the sound. If we rebooted the system, and jump scenes to where the trouble began, it would generally resume and work fine. Over the past couple of months this occurs 3 to 4 times each movie. When we finally get too frustrated and take the same disk to the back of the house and put it in our cheapo GE player...it plays fine. I would not waste my money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD Recorder Destroys 30% of Your DVDs!","review":"After reading an earlier review of this machine, I had to write. I had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I've burned about 60 DVDs and for those DVDs that have not been completed (finalized) at least one-third end up being DESTROYED by the machine!! I've lost episodes of TV series, my home movies that I converted (luckily I have saved the original tapes), and priceless events that I wanted to record (like the Olympics). It is VERY frustrating to spend HOURS on recording the DVDs and then go to finalize them (burn them so they can be played in other machines) and have ERROR pop up or UNREADABLE or CAN'T BE PLAYED. I wrote to Panasonic to see what the problem might be and all I got was a computer response as to where I could buy accessories.This is very disappointing for a company like Panasonic. They clearly have a bug in certain of these machines and their poor customer service is genuinely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I OWN THIS UNIT.I GOT THE REFURBISHED VERSION SINCE THIS MODEL WAS DISCONTINUED","review":"I CANNOT SAY MUCH MORE THAN WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS SAID.MY UNIT HAS ONLY ONE TV TUNER.THERE MUST BE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS UNIT.MAY I SUGGEST YOU CONNECT THIS UNIT TO A GOOD SURGE PROTECTER.A LOT OF THE NEGITIVE ISSUES MIGHT BE CAUSED BY POWER SURGES.THIS APPLIES TO ALL SENSITIVE ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTERS. 4 STAR RATING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Durability and reliability issues!","review":"This is my 3rd Panasonic vhs/dvd combo and I will never buy another Panasonic product again.I'm sooo done!

So, if you like to watch your DVD's flutter, go ahead and spend $400+ on this Panasonic trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"After having owned this for just over a year, the unit rejects nearly 3 quarters of all my Dvd discs due to the proverbial 'cannot read disc' error. I tried recording several vhs tapes to various dvd media without any success. This may simply be an isolated problem, but nonetheless, my previous combos (other than panasonic) lasted years longer, under rigorous use. I'm currently shopping for a new brand because it wouldbe cheaper than repair.

After 2 years, Ive dropped it down to 2. 6 months ago, the DVD player portion stopped working, it simply wouldn't play. After numerous calls I sent it off to panasonic for repairs, $130 and took 4 weeks. The until worked for about 5 months, then the eject button on the dvd player stopped working. Cant get it to open no matter what, so essentially it is now a $500 hard drive/VHS. Panasonic only has a 30 day warranty on repairs, which is ridiculous as Im sure they are using refurbished parts anyways. Not sure what to do now, as this think will have cost me $800 in the end if I repair it again. This machine has everything you need in one, but what good is it it wont work after 2 years. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be a good product if it only worked","review":"This could be an interesting unit if it worked.The original unit power button, VCR eject button, and remote sensor on the unit did not work. The replacement unit could not read any DVD (regular movie DVDs) or DVD-RAM, although it did manage to go through the setup and play VCRs.The mulfunctions were verified by Panasonic customer service. There is nothing to do but return both units to Amazon.Probably rushing to market too fast.Unfortunately, my recommendation is to stay away from this model until Panasonic gets it right.Amazon customer service was pretty good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GOOD ITEM FOR ABOUT A YEAR, THEN IT BECOMES A SURPRISE PACKAGE","review":"This panasonic DMR-E75S is a nice item, but beware it may only last for about a year before it turns out to be a surprise package and the owner's manual booklet can be better too. I also must alert you that the customer care center by phone sucks just like a straw, nothing like a recording telling you that the waiting time for your call to get answer is about 55 minutes and will be answer in the order it came in and all that BS. Give it a year or so then it becomes a surprise package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well....OKAY","review":"Pros: Features, Picture, Reliability, frame advanceCons: Sound,Sound,Sound,Sound SOUND!!!!!!This would be a perfect machine if the sound were as good as most of its sibling recorders.I SAY DON'T BUY THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE MUCH BETTER DVD RECORDERS (MAINLY PANASONIC) THAT PERFORM BETTER AND ARE LESS COSTLY"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD-Rs must be finalized","review":"I just purchased this DVD/VCR recorder yesterday from Circuit City, spent several hours and ruined one VHS tape and one DVD-R trying to figure out the one touch dubbing process. I finally made a DVD that played back in this machine, tried it in my other two DVD players and couldn't make it work. I called Circuit City; the helpful salesperson went over the directions in the manual with me, and I realized I hadn't finalized the DVD-R. I did that, and now the DVD works in my other DVD players. The reviewer who was frustrated because the DVDs didn't work in his other DVD players did not follow directions, which specifically state that the DVD-R must be finalized in order to play in other DVD players. I think this machine is going to be just what I need for transferring family videos to DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong model !!!","review":"I choose this product from the official catalog of ACDelco, then look on amazon, and both pages (Amazon y AcDelco) said that it was compatible with my Corolla 2002 but when I went to the mechanic told me that they were not compatible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny new book by a good author","review":"Mr. Chickee knows what he is doing when he gives Steven a bill that has fifteen zeroes, and the picture of the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, James Brown, on it.

When Steven starts to investigate whether this bill is real or not he quickly runs up against Agent Fondoo of the US Department of the Treasury, who is determined to get the bill back, one way or another.This implausible book, while keeping the setting of Flint with a black main character, is a departure from Curtis's other novels. Serious messages are out and humor is the focus of this mystery. Clearly intended to be the first of a series, those looking for a funny mystery, or just a plain funny book, will be pleased with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The glory days have passed.","review":"This album was not what I was expecting. This band has changed a lot since Kiss The Goat, Enter The Moonlight Gate, and the Unholy Crusade. Their style is closer to Death Metal than black metal now and it is rather boring. They have developped a strange obsession with fingerpicking generic and broing melodies. Listen for yourself, every song on the starts with fingerpicking. There are no blistering black metal riffs and very few blast beats can be heard on the cd. What happened to the Lord Belial that created the masterpiece Enter The Moonlight Gate?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Topper Takes a Trip (1939) VHS -- Colorized!!","review":"Beware! This is a wonderful film, not yet available on DVD, but at least one of the VHS versions being sold has been colorized--which is a hideous and disrespectful thing to do to a great old black and white film. It would be helpful if Amazon could include this information on its sale pages. (In this case, the reproduced VHS box cover does include the word \\"colorized\\", which I didn't notice.) Since they don't, before buying a VHS, if getting the original B&W matters to you (and I hope it does), then inquire carefully of your seller. I got a VHS from Video Treasures, it was colorized, and I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weak link in the trilogy","review":"There are three classic Topper films from the golden age of movies. The first, with Cary Grant, is a winner. The third, with Joan Blondell, is even better. But Topper Takes A Trip, the second in the series, is a complete dud. The script is simply embarrassing and wholly unfunny. The scenes (e.g. the bartender and the dog)are often pathetic. It took some doing to make a flop with the likes of the stars in this film. Even Franklin Pangborn is awful. But reading lines like that, how could he be otherwise? Best forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"solo longhair","review":"If you like purity, this is for you.

Ms. Mckillip has a very interesting way of writing - it's beautiful but sometimes i didn't get what she was saying. Otherwise, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ for any fantasy/Tolkien/epic quest fan of fiction. I loved all of the characters, especially Har and Morgon. Morgon takes an amazing journey where he is transformed from a simple prince into something much much more. I loved all the magic, all the powers each major character has, the plot twists and turns, as well as the setting of the book. A great read, and i can see myself picking it up again in a couple years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspired","review":"One of the greatest works of science fantasy.

It was hard to read more than 2 pages at a time; I didn't care about the characters; I had problems whenever there was dialogue because she made it hard to know who was speaking and the book needed to be edited down to 2/3 of its original length removing some of the sturm und drang.I've been told that McKillip got better as a writer after she finished these 3, but it'll be a long time before I pick up one of her later books. She should never have re-issued this volume without extensive editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"approach with caution","review":"The hero whines a lot, suffers inexplicably over things that don't seem too troublesome, and is loved unreservedly by every good guy in the book. The heroine is annoying, wanting to be present at all times and tagging along even when not supposed to -- this is supposed to make her a \\"strong\\" female character rather than the pest and burden she really would be?The young McKillip hasn't yet learned how to shape a story, develop characters, or create suspense; the story is choppy, episodic, and at times inexplicable. There is much -- way too much -- description of emotion, but no creation of emotion in the reader.I'm being a little brutal, but this is an immature work that will appeal mostly to teens and to those who haven't read much adult fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previous story?","review":"I love this series; land-law and riddle mastery are two truly original concepts. However, I've been bothered each time I've picked up my old paperbacks. I always feel like I'm coming in on the middle of something. Is there another book, that covers Morgan's riddle game with Peven, and his early relationship with Raederle, and his years at the college? (If not . . . why not?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down","review":"It just didn't make much sense. None of the characters captured my interest. I found them to be shallow, confused and confusing. I didn't get a real feel for them or their world. I finally gave up a third of the way through the final book in the trilogy. It's not the worst book I've read, but I would not recommend it as good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Series Ever","review":"This is the best fantasy series ever written.What I would give to write like Ms. McKillip!This must be read by anyone who claims to like this genre, and even those who don't.

And the people live and breath.I read this years ago, and still can recall the phrases and wording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This trilogy is ____. Fill the blank with the most positive adjective you can find (wonderful, amazing, perfect . . .) to make the sentence true. McKillip's Riddle-Master is, next to Tolkien, the most unique series I have ever read. And while being completely unique is indeed a rare find in the fantasy genre, Riddle-Master has the added bonus of being incredibly well written. I love this trilogy--and even now, after finishing it, I'm not certain I caught everything. If ever you feel a need to read an intelligent novel you should find your way to the Riddle-Master series. It's absolutely stunning. Go. Buy. Read. Now. . . . . . . . . . . Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I've been a fantasy fan ever since the Hobbit came out in the US. I've tried the first 60 pages of this trilogy and found it confusing and baseless.

I just couldn't get interested in the characters and thought at age 71, why waste my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this once -- read it over and over!","review":"What a strange, glorious story! Memorable characters, beautiful writing, and artful plot twists--nothing is quite what it appears to be! McKillip is a real wizard, and this is her masterpiece, as engrossing as it is odd. Celtic folklore enthusiasts should particularly relish touches like the Great Shout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jewel Re-discovered","review":"My mother read this book for the first time as a young woman. Always, when we discussed books, she would tell me about this book - how wonderful it was, how much she enjoyed it and how she wished she could read it again. I spent months tracking down out of print copies of the series but seeing my mom's eyes light up when I gave them to her made it all worth while. :-) I own a copy myself now, and like her I adore the books. In fact, I'm going to buy her another copy that she can read (and leave the rare copies alone!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I am a Patricia McKillip fan because of this series. She weaves the most intesting stories and I am always left asking questions after her books. She is a great fantasy writer but this trilogy is defenatly her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of a read","review":"Though McKillip's story is one that has been told a thousand times, she goes about it in a somewhat original way. The basic story is of an innocent farmer boy who is pulled into a quest he does not want to complete. Destiny forces his hand, the world is saved, and the boy attains unimaginable powers.As other reviewers have said her prose is dreamy. Many of the similes and metaphors could have been edited out, but some of them are brilliantly executed.The story itself feels a bit jerky, but it gets her point across. Her exposition is brief, but by trusting her readers to keep up with her, McKillip pays her readers the compliment of assuming they are intelligent.I would suggest borrowing the series from your local library before you purchase it. The story is worthy of reading, and some reader's will want a hard copy of the novels to keep on their bookshelves, but others will not find it worth the space or price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride of Place on My Bookshelf","review":"The Riddlemaster of Hed was the first of Patricia McKillip's books that I read. I was drawn in by the disarming simplicity of words combined with such lyricism, such beauty, such honesty, that at the end of the three books in the series I could not pick up another book for days.I reread the series once, sometimes twice a year, and am still left with a sense of awe when I finish. There is no other trilogy that I would recommend so highly as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasy trilogies/series I've ever read","review":"It's been years since I've read this series, so I don't remember the particulars, but I wanted to recommend it highly, because it's one of my favorite trilogies, probably right up there with Tolkien's and Michael Scott Rohan's. I've read numerous others, some of which I thought were just so-so. Give this a try if you like good fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better ways to reveal Maui.","review":"I think this book misleads people about the safety of the trips, The directions to get to these trips, and plus there is better places to go.

Insights which concretely and in a down-to-earth manner describe why Doughty recommends a particular restaurant or hotel or tourist site (or not) are always helpful. And he puts any biases up front so that the reader may decide if he or she shares the same viewpoint an can make their own decision about the reviewed subject. I have given or shared these guides to appreciative family members and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited to read","review":"The book looks great, can't wait to get into it a little bit more. The cover is slightly ripped but that's really nbd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I used this book for my honeymoon in Maui. I highly suggest purchasing this book if you want to explore the island. Def the ultimate guidebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for Maui visitors","review":"I ordered several of the books from the \\"Revealed\\" series and found all of them up to date and accurate. This book was extremely helpful during our \\"Road to Hana\\" trip. It offered several time saving and useful tips. Try and read up on the areas you are visiting in advance. If you are just out for the adventure, this book is also excellent and easy to use on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently useful and fun to read","review":"We have used Andrew Dougherty's guide books for Oahu, Kauai, and the Big Island. Our next trip will be to Maui, so there is no better guidebook with the inside scoop than Dougherty's Maui Guidebook. By now we are very familiar with how he organizes the sections so it is relatively easy to find something we are looking for. My husband (who also reads the directions for every product he buys) will read this book in its entirety prior to our trip and highlight what he finds interesting. I have been to Maui, so I will then follow up with what I know to be good and can arrange activities in a way that limits excess driving and maximizes fun. We both especially appreciate the humor interspersed with the facts, all of it made interesting by someone who obviously knows the territory he writes about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maui book","review":"I haven't read this yet as I'm not going to Maui for a little while. I just wanted the book to read for now since I've been there before."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be delighted, this is simply the best of the lot!","review":"The depth and quality of content in this guide delighted us for 2 solid weeks on Maui. Excellent reviews on restaurants and lodging, insightful guides to attractions - the exact opposite of the blatantly dishonest and cheaply done Frommer's Maui.We were steered to Maui Revealed by a local visiting Maine, and we were lucky we got it. A pity we used Frommer's Maui guide to book a week's lousy lodging and visit some cheesy overpriced restaurants!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST have for anyone going to Maui","review":"My family and I just returned from an 8 day trip to Maui and this book, Maui Revealed, was everything the book promised and more. The maps of the areas, the information/history of Maui, the hotel reviews, the restaurant/dining reviews, the tourist reviews and the entire book was just outstanding. Every place we ate (that was recommended as \\"ONO\\" in the book) turned out to be 100 correct.This is one of those travel books that is honest and the authors live the islands and respect the islands and know what is and what is not worth the time and effort. This book, in my opinion, is one of those \\"must have\\" books and I saw several other people while we in Maui using the same book. I only wish other travel books were as comprehensive, user friendly, funny and informative as this book.If you are going to Maui and need ONE book - get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful, well written","review":"I like the way this book is written. It is definitely thorough and very informative, but there is a personal touch. Very helpful. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maui is revealed","review":"Travelled to Maui a few years ago with this book. With it we found incredible beaches & waterfalls that we'd never have found otherwise. It's a must if you're going to take \\"the road to Hana\\". We passed our Maui Revealed to another couple we met in Hawaii. We're talking about going back next year and I ordered another. I've read through it again :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maui Revealed","review":"Andrews knowledge of the Hawaiian Islands make your vacation the very best it can be, and then some!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Planning Guide","review":"As a wedding and event planner, I use the Ultimate Hawaii guides when I plan Hawaiian honeymoons for my clients. I find them to be a great source of information. I've been to many of the places that are critiqued in the guides and, for the most part, their reviews are very accurate. I've only had a few occasions where I've found a review to be inaccurate. Overall, these guides are very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Before going to Maui we researched the sites, had a general idea of where and what there was to see. But after getting there we were at a loss of what to do. I guess all that research was lost on the way. We did not buy the book initially since we figured we researched enough and could just do our own thing and find the stuff on our own. NOT THE CASE. Alot of the stuff in the book would be very had to stumble across and even with the directions and descriptions at times were hard to find things.We purchased this book from the ABC stores on Maui and paid Full Price. In retrospect I wish we would of bought this book before and dog eared, highlighted, postit noted'ed the heck out of it before we got there.Some of the review say that alot of the information is old news which may be true but this book was well worth the 20.00 we paid and I seriously dont thing out Vacation would of been nearly as awesome as it was with out it..Highly recommended, Especially if its your 1st trip to Maui."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacation Planner","review":"Purchased this guide before our trip to Maui and it provided us with some recommendations and ideas that we never would have known otherwise. On the road to Hana it directed us to some great out-of the-way sights and waterfalls that made our trip unbelievably memorable. It is easy to look back and think of the many great sights that we would have missed out on had we been following the mainstream trip planners. It's recommendations were spot-on. We didn't use it much for eating, so I can't really comment on that aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maui Revealed","review":"We have used The Ultimate Guidebooks several times and think that they are the best in giving information the way it really exists. They let you know about many of the out of the way beautiful places and eating places. We have also used the book info to obtain condos or hotels. They say it like it is! That is what is great about the Ultimate Guide. We are again using the Maui Revealed Guide for our trip to Maui. Thanks for producing reviews that are honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Map the restaurant","review":"Excellent book. Enjoyed the humor as much as the useful tips and information. However, one critique I would have, is that it would've been alot easier to locate the eateries recommended in the book. A number, or a symbol right there on the map would have made it much simplier to pinpoint a restaurants location, other than just the address and phone numbers.David"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best guidebook for exploring Maui","review":"We are planning a trip to Costa Rica and I am disappointed that there are no books similar to Maui Revealed. My husband and I purchased Maui Revealed and the Frommer's Guide. Maui Revealed was the best - hands down. We traveled around the island - eating coconut candy, getting flowers from locals, seeing blowholes, and eating freshly made banana bread. None of this would have happened if we stuck to the Frommer's Guide. Plus - the pictures are awesome and the tips on parking helped tremendously. I cannot recommend this book enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Maui","review":"Just got back from a Maui vacation and I cannot say enough about this book! Our group of four had quite a few Maui travel books, but ended up only using this one. Very informative and humorous. It was especially helpful on the road to Hana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"Was not clear that the edition I was purchasing was the third edition and the book is now up to the 5th edition. Although I am sure the latest edition would have been fine, much of the book is out of date. Yes buyer beware, but it should be clear that the edition being sold is an older edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maui","review":"This was a decent guide for Maui. We were only able to spend a few days outside of Lahaina. Ka'anapali Shores Hotel was an affordable and comfortable place to crash. Java Jazz/Soup Nutz was perfect for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Beaches were beautiful. Everyone...and I mean EVERYONE was friendly. You won't regret your stay on the island. Even the airport was tranquil. Take plenty of pictures. Such a different experience from Oahu (both were great, but Maui is the best). Sugarcane fields, winding beachfront drives, crystal-clear waters. No other place like it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't have been the same without it","review":"I had a couple people tell me about this book when they heard we were going to Maui. The restaurant reviews were dead on and when they say it's good, it is! I think they were wrong about our hotel because it was the nicest we went to and we went to a few and they weren't as hip on it. Anyway get the book, eat where they tell you and say Aloha to your worries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have!","review":"We buy these books for everyone that is going to the islands. Doesn't matter if they have been there several times, we are always thanked. My wife and I have NEVER been disappointed by recommendations in these books, and it takes you places on the islands most would miss, these books get an Ono from us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely the BEST maui guidebook!","review":"My husband and I bought this and 4 other Maui guide books. this BY FAR was the best. super detailed. that overwhelmed me at first, but once I got the feel for the book's layout, it was GREAT! I spent about 15 minutes in the mornings leading up to our vacation drinking coffee and dreaming about our Maui trip. And the book's recommendations did not disappoint! great Luau recs, great dining spots, and snorkeling recommendations!I guess you get a great guidebook when the author doesn't take kickbacks for good reviews of a place! really unbiased - they did a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide to Maui","review":"Maui Revealed is an excellent guide book. Our family of 10 children and grandchildren (six adults) used the book and found the guidance to be fair and generally accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"This book was bought last minute before going to Hawaii, and it absolutely helped us make the most of our vacation. This book provides easy-to-understand information on everything you would ever want to see or do. It's actually amazing to see how many people use this book as you travel around. You look at the car next to you and somebody is driving, and somebody is looking at this book! Don't go to Hawaii without buying this first. Take the time to read it, highlight your interests, and make the most of your vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best guide for Maui","review":"I have been avid buyer of Frommers/Fodors for years. I also have the eyewitness collection for Hawaii. None of these substitute island-specific guidebook. This one for Maui is particularly good. It has a good description of the major activities and points of interest. Its descriptions of the beaches and of the Road to Hana are particularly good. They contain pictures and lots of info on how to get there. A valuable travel resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time","review":"I enjoyed this travel guide immensely. My only complaint is that its description of the Hana Highway drive is not altogether true. The second half of the drive is much more rugged than described and involves A LOT of unpaved road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go to Maui without it","review":"My only mistake was with not always using Maui Revealed before and during our visit to Hawaii. Whenever I struck out on my own to a beach, site, or restaurant, or followed a recommendation from another source, I was let down because the choice never matched the outstanding quality of recommendations in this book.Time after time, we found great local restaurants, exciting local shops, great things to do, and terrific places to visit based on this book (and based on the companion Big Island book as well). Having GPS coordinates for some of the destinations was especially helpful (yes, you should bring your GPS).Of all the resources available for my trip, including Trip Advisor and many tourist guides, this book was easily the best. I could have saved a lot of time by using ONLY this book, and I really should have paid attention when the authors suggested a 4 wheel drive on the Big Island and a convertible on Maui (Unfortunately, I did the reverse)."},{"rating":"2","title":"maui guide book","review":"being from hawaii i was a bit wweary of this book, but after using this book it was very helpful in finding some of the out of the way places. i was not very impressed in the restaurant guides though. we tried some fo the places and found them lacking in good local type food. we got better results talking to the local boys for they're reccommendations. also if the book says enter at your own risk but it would probably be alright don't go there. they are kapu( hawaiian heritage sacred land and the locals get very angry about ignoring no trespassing(kapu) signs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"A couple years ago my husband and I purchased this same book for our trip to Kauai. We didn't go anywhere without it. It has everthing you will possible need. Food, prices, beaches, secret trails, maps, etc. Planning our trip this year to Maui and had to have this book. I have already used it for booking our hotel stay. I am currently working on planning our activities now. Would definitely recommend for anyone going to Maui or any Hawaii island."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best traveler books","review":"It is great, big, lots of info., I personally highly recommend this book to everyone, from fist time traveler to expert travelers.Great pictures, maps and useful info about hotels, condos, attractions and more. One of the best for HAWAII.AAA+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maui Reviled","review":"This book has no respect for anything but itself. For example, it sends people across a huge lava flow to get to a secluded reef. That reef is a lively snorkel spot, but so are others that don't imperil the tourists, or put them in a position to leave trash in a pristine area & otherwise trash the place. This is a pattern. People on Maui call this book Maui Reviled. Other editions revile other islands. It's a very negative influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of paradise","review":"I live on Maui. This book and others like it are ruining what makes this island special. What used to remain secret and thus (private), has become widely known. This increase in foot traffic has brought; litter, excessive trail corrosion, as well as the crime that follows the tourists like flies to dung. What used to be a secluded retreat has been transformed into crowded public hangouts. Since there are no restrooms in any of these places, the woods have been reduced open air toilets, TP and feces have become increasingly difficult to avoid along with the stench of urine. THIS ISLAND IS BEING TRANSFORMED INTO A CESSPOOL (or at least the best parts of it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Children\\" should be taught to respect others","review":"Saw book in condo. We are long time Maui visitors (1965). Would not buy this book and have heard nothing but negative things about it. The authors showed a complete lack of respect to Hawaiians by advising visitors of places only known to the local people. There are plenty of wonderful places to go in Maui without invading other people places, many of them private.Much of their land has been taken and they have been made to feel as if the island no longer belongs to them and then these authors expose places only known to them for all the world to find. Their attitude seems to be that everyone has a right to see all the places on the island. Well, we don't. We are guests on Maui and guests don't go through private things belonging to our hosts. The word I hear on Maui is shame on the author and don't buy this book... and we won't .... and we tell everyone we know not to buy it and why. There are plenty of other good, respectful guidebooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE***********************","review":"Amazon claims this item is \\"In Stock\\". After I ordered, the e-mail showed the book may take up to 3 weeks to ship.If you need the book in a reasonable time, Barnes and Noble ships within 24 hours.Obviously this has nothing to do with the quality of the book (which I re-ordered from B&N;) but thought this info might be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maui Revealed","review":"This book made our vacation so much better as it covered every inch of Maui.

Can't imagine going to Hawaii without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Awful","review":"I didn't agree with all the positive feedback here. I expected a real thorough tour of Maui and got pages of tourist traps. Popular?? Fantasy pure fantasy. I think the Maui Revealed belongs in the fiction section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anyone except families","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation from someone who has been to Maui before with children. I should have looked it over more carefully before leaving, but I was short on time so I didn't get to really look at it until we were on the plane to Maui. This is a great book for discovering the out-of-the-way spots on Maui, and a true guide to the places to stop as you travel the island. But it is NOT for families. The only mention of kids/keiki snidely says something like \\"maybe this should go under Hazards.\\" If you need to know whether a place/activity is kid- or family-friendly, you'll need to look elsewhere. It's not a flaw of the book; I fault myself for assuming that this book would be great for us based on one recommendation. If you're traveling without kids, I highly recommend this book. But families or anyone traveling with children should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book to take to Maui","review":"This is the most valuable book you can take to Maui. The authors were right on. We had a wonderful time and they never steered us wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version don't bother","review":"As far as I can tell the kindle version is worthless as a guide book.

Plus it gives a good overview on what to do and what to see.

This hat is not worth anything. The brim is maybe an inch which gives ZERO protection! I guess if you have a bald head and are only looking to protect the top of your head from the sun this hat would work. I was looking for a hat that would allow airflow yet protect my face. This hat does NOT protect any part of your face when you wear it. A baseball cap would protect your face more than this thing would. Save your money and buy an Outdoor Research hat. It does cost more but you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three novels in one.","review":"This is an engrossing, at times chilling, novel, almost three novels in one. The first part deals with the \\"ugly\\" sister, Hekuba, who unwittingly falls in love with Seth Strummar, the irrestible rouge who is at the heart of all three parts of this novel. The second deals with Strummar's friend, Joaquin, and becomes almost a Cormac McCathyish quest-into-Mexico story. The third part is told from Seth's daughter, Elena's point of view, and it was this third part that put me off as a reader. I never connected with Elena the way I did with Hekuba and Joaquin. I also resented the short shrift given to Hekuba's death, when I had become so emotionally attached to her. But despite this and some minor anachronisms, particularly in the language, this is a whopping good page-turner which I have recommended it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, stark portraits of social inequity on the frontier","review":"I finished this book in the wee hours of the night--I couldn't put it down. I cried at the ending. Maybe because Elena might never race again, or because Seth was trying so hard to do the right thing, or because Hekuba lost so much. Most western fiction is concerned only with violence, but in the Seth Strummar series, the author asks all of the most probing questions of life. She certainly presents stark portraits of social inequity, yet the books are quite poetic. The continuing metaphors of the bullfight and macho were very effective in Breaking Even. I highly recommend all of Elizabeth Fackler's novels to anyone interested in character studies revolving around the great issues of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for budge lovers...","review":"The concise list of words to be learned by any serious student is worth the asking price of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best real estate books I've ever read!","review":"This is the first book review I've ever written, but I had to for this book.

Boy, was I wrong! All the information could be found by searching the Internet.

The trick is to replace one battery at a time and quickly to retain the settings.Negative #2: When placed behind you, say on a bed headboard, the display cannot be rotated enough for proper orientation while sleeping.

What made this book hilarious, was that it was not trying to be a wacky book. The Illuminati is a novel so poorly written (A ten year old has better grasp of the language), and so full of prejudice (Pat Robertson has it next to his toilet), you will find yourself laughing and groaing at the same time. One hopes that Burkett would crawl back under his rock and never try joining the literary world again.

The author certainly has a vivid imagination though - it is amazing (although thoroughly unbelievable) all the worldshaking events that he described happening in just the space of the next 10 years.The characters are interesting and well thought out, although the author has an annoying habit of giving ALL of the characters names, however important or unimportant they may be. This results in the reader reading half the book before he realises which characters are important and which are not.This book is however worth reading if you're interested in plots, conspiricies etc. Disappointingly, however, it does not tell you very much about the Illuminati."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should still read this book","review":"There are several problems with this story that might prove to be a distraction (which caused me to give it two stars). It is supposedly updated to take into account technology advances since its publication in the 1990's. But they missed a bunch. Also the book lacks characters that are compelling either in their goodness or their evilness. There is no apparent main character until the last few chapters so the novel suffers from point of view issues. BUT all that being said, if you are curious about how a super elite might come to power in the US and how this matches up with end times Bible prophecy, there is still great value in reading the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"This book is filled with Christian paranoia, and stereotypical references to youth, gays, other religions and government.Scattered with fantastic events but hard to believe any of them, from futuristic computers that can tract everyone in the country to super dooms day weapons and corruption of government. I guess if I was paranoid that the government was planning to out law Christianity I would really like this book, but as it is I forced myself to finish this book, only because I don't like to start a book and not finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and GOOD!","review":"Though I have to agree with others that there wasn't too much history on the Illuminati mentioned in the book, there was a good and necessary chunk mentioned. I also found it to be very interesting a read and the way it was laid out did have the 'perfect mix of fiction and reality' contained within it. I'm not quite sure where the bias against all liberals calling them monsters and evil people was(as a few others mentioned), if it was there I didn't see it. I saw a bias against the evil society running everything and even some of the 'liberals' that supported the society switched their view when things started getting too crazy, so I fail to see that bias. I liked the book all-in-all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, predictable conspiracy tripe","review":"Sadly, Mr. Burkett's book is merely a fictionalized version of a massive amount of Christian conspiracy literature out there these days. The common \\"New World Order is going to get You\\" genre is sadly all too common in Christian publishing these days. Indeed, Burkett's nonfiction (Coming Economic Earthquake) is based on Illuminati fantasies. Burkett, as well as others, appear to either be unaware or unconcerned that their theories are based on Facist and Nazi ideology, not to mention rampant anti-Semitism. Do yourself a favor, save some money and leave this book on the shelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction of the release date","review":"This book was originally released in 1991. It's been about that long since I've read it, but I do recall how amazed I was that it seemed like prophecy (even though there was a statement made on the inner sleeve saying it was not prophetic and was merely a fictional novel).I recall it mentioning \\"the net\\", a world wide computer network to accommodate a one-world money system and government. Sound familiar?If memory serves me right, I think there was a character named \\"Hussein\\"......interesting, huh?A prophetic book? Maybe......Amazing insight from a highly trained, respected, and revered financial guru? Definitely!I will re-read this book and be amazed at how many \\"prophecies\\" have come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's almost good","review":"This book has it all -- economic disaster, a tsunami, a bad guy named Hussein, Christians and Jews vs. Arabs, nuclear bombs, oil shortages, rigged elections, conspiracies, secret societies, assassinations, riots, and a computer \\"genius\\" hero. The characters and the dialogue in this book make Dan Brown look like a literary genius. It's bad. However, the plot is so ridiculous that it's somewhat entertaining to read.I must give the author credit for one thing -- his imagination came up with all of this in 1991, before things like $150/barrel oil, terrorism, and major tsunamis became reality..... and, before Dan Brown's novels brought this literary junk to the mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible writing","review":"The overall idea of this book gives you pause, especially when you consider all the things Burkett came up with that have actually come to pass. But what is with the junior-high writing? It seems that whenever any of his \\"heroes\\" is in a bind an implausible magic solution surfaces just in the nick of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"storyline goes nowhere","review":"This book started out okay for me, but the storyline never went anywhere. More than halfway through the book, I gave up and stopped reading it. The basic plot had lots of potential, but as I said, the storyline went nowhere and wasn't even close to keeping my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish, Selfserving and Trite","review":"It's disturbing to think that trees died so this could be printed...This is an incredibly weak novel, attempting to capitalize on the name \\"Illuminati\\". Horribly slanted from a right-wing, conservative, religious bias that is childlike in nature. The two-dimensional people in this 'novel' bounce around like puppets in a Punch and Judy show.....no, sorry, Punch and Judy's characters are more developed than that.Save your money to buy a sandwich, it will be more fulfilling both physically and intellectually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminati","review":"bought 3 copies of this book from 2 sources...both came in record time and were new or like new; everything was as promised and price was great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"action-packed but over-written; somewhat annoying.","review":"The book was a fast read but I was annoyed with the way it was written. I didn't like the charactors of the computer whiz and his girl-friend; made you root for the bad-guys. I liked the plot. If somewhat interested in conspiracies and Illuminati purchase the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ominously Hilarious","review":"Written at a middle-school level, this story is laugh-out-loud funny, until you realize how chillingly accurate it is at predicting the end of democracy. The author describes step by step the playbook our leaders followed to curtail freedom in America. The irony is Burkett got it backwards. That's right folks, it turns out The Illuminati are real. They're just not who the author thought they would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea poorly executed","review":"The central idea is wonderful: there are powers controlling the powers that we see. (Someone controls the president who controls the FBI etc.) Unfortunately after the being well set up in the first 1/4 - 1/3 of the book, the story degenerates into a lot of wild-eyed religious hand-wringing. Which is ironic because after the first part sets up the reader to think about manipulation and control, the heavy-handed remainder comes across as propoganda and causes the reader to wonder who is controlling the author. I would love to see other authors take the basic idea and craft something really sinister. This one, however, I would skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you see what would be?","review":"Perhaps the conspiracy buffs wouldn&#65533;t be so disappointed if the name of the book were &#65533;You asked for it, you got it&#65533;. As this book provides a truthful extrapolation of current events left unchecked by a people not willing to take stand against evil. The author isn&#65533;t &#65533;polished&#65533; in his writing style, but is very insightful in his understanding of human nature and social trends. The sequel &#65533;The Thor Conspiracy&#65533; is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it a little eerie, but I just couldn't put it down!","review":"I read this book for the first time just days after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake. Along with other world events of that time... well, let's just say that it was an eerie coincidence to read what was in The Illuminati. Yes, it's a bit paranoid and dogmatic, but it's rare when I read a book cover to cover without hardly stopping to even eat. I literally could not put this one down! Definitely worth the read and the consideration even if it is fiction (we hope)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry was right","review":"There are many things in this book that has happened since he wrote it and many things that could still happen in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Not nearly the quality I was looking for.. too flimsy and not very pretty in real time. Would not recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would not order this set.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I received this from the shipper! Unfortunately, I did not love the pattern. There were a lot of white sections and it was really leafy. I was looking for something paisley with bright and pretty pinks and greens. The colors were pretty & I loved the stripes; you could match a lot with it. Those leafy sections just made it look cheap looking to me, especially the comforter. Although I am in the process of returning the entire set, I would order from this seller again. The seller made the returning part very easy and understood that I did not like the set once I saw it in person. I gave 4 stars because the seller was great but the item was not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chibi Valance","review":"Great shipping and delivery time. Product arrived early, and was as described.

They really make the room stand out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy at best","review":"1 star because one can't give a rating lower than that. The authors do a good job of repeating trivial stuff over and over again. But when it comes to algorithmic or mathematical treatment of the subject, they seem to be at their wit's end. Consider this : According to authors, 2^56 + 2^56 = 2^112. Basic mathematics knowledge would have been suffiecient to calculate the above i.e 2^56 + 2^56 = 2*2^56 = 2^57.I think now one can start judging the faith one can have in the authors and the book. The authors make it apparent in the first few chapters itself that one should not expect any sensible treatment of the topic. I would recommend this book to all those who have never experienced frustration in life and are looking for a first-hand experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got it for a $.

Similarly, the implementation examples are very helpful to those actually implementing Java security solutions.

I bought it for a road trip. On the third day of my trip, the receiver was crackling and my dashboard lights and dials started to go haywire, along with my cruise control. I pulled over to a rest area and then my car wouldn't start. I unplugged the receiver and then my car started and ran fine. I plugged in later when I was home and my airbag light and brake light went on. I called JVC and they didn't have any answers for me and then I returned it to best buy and am waiting for a refund minus a restocking fee.

I have not even replaced the remote batteries yet!I drive truck at night and have a cradle for it in each of my personal vehicles so it gets alot of use.The only thing I do not like is the red colored screen. It is hard to read especially at night in the dark. Would of been better to have the font black instead of light colored or the whole thing blue. It is a little large but I like the larger buttons rather than small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I bought this unit almost a year ago now and haven't had any troubles with it.

Not just as a delicate flower but as a strong spiritual force in the body of Christ. This book is theologically sound and easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in expaning their perception of God!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As the Earlier Books","review":"I am starting to lose my patience with the Carrier series. Ever since the publisher started putting the books on a six or so months sched, the quality has really taken a nose dive.In this book, the character development is really poor. Instead of getting to know the odd aviator or seaman, they all seem to be interchangeable parts with similar dialogue. I can't tell at times whether Batman or Coyote is doing the talking.It seems that the plotting is out of control. In the earlier books, the secondary and diplomacy scenes helped the plot, but in this book they distract from the main plot.The last three books have been the worst of the series and I am at the point where I have almost given up. It seems when the author spent the time to write, the book was good. If you really want to enjoy this series, read the first eight books.I'd rather wait a couple of years to get a good book than get mediocre stuff every six months."},{"rating":"1","title":"still hanging in there","review":"this is fairly typical of the last few books in the series, unresolved sub plots, shoddy editing, implausible scenarios. But the next one starts getting the series back on track.The thing that disturbs me most is that the author barely mentioned an important recurring character at the beginning of book 16, killed the character off at the end of book 17 after not being mentioned anywhere else in the story, and then in books 18 and 19 acted as if the character disappeared in book 16 not 17. He's writing the books so fast he can't even keep track of his own characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Study Guide","review":"I used this book while pursuing my B.S. in Biochemistry and it is the best study guide I ever used.

It is a beautiful language, straight-forward and fairly easy to comprehend. I'm certain by using this book and tapes I will better enjoy my upcoming visit to Finland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and insufficient.","review":"This book presents a small amount of elementary Finnish, and it suffers the ills of small courses: not enough explanation of grammar, not enough exercises, not enough reading, not enough sound recording. It is visually attractive--but is that enough?Finnish is a complex language with exacting pronunciation, complex grammar, and an extensive network of internal sound changes that must be explained clearly and completely. The student cannot assimilate these structures without reinforcement from exercises and readings. None of these elements are sufficiently provided in this book.Compare this poverty of resources with the very fine course by Meri Lehtinen (books and recordings published by Indiana University) and with the two second-best runners up, the Foreign Service Institute's Finnish course, also with book and recordings, and \\"Finnish for Foreigners,\\" (books and recordings) published in Finland but widely available in the English-speaking world."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally misleading title","review":"I bought this book to learn some advance database programming specifically with Oracle which the book claims it does cover. However, what I found was a perl mysql programming book that has devoted half its contents to web site development (which I'm not interested in).

If you really just want to learn database programming using perl read \\"programming DBI\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not terribly factual.","review":"This is a very dramatic story, mostly because much of it is made up.Like another reviewer, I was a student of King's at the time all of this took place. There are so many inaccuracies in the book, I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be about King if his face weren't splashed across the cover (the version I read has a family portrait on the front cover).If you are looking for facts, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a decent book to pass the time, this will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be labeled \\"Fiction\\"","review":"I came across this book very recently. Although the actual events occured over 10 yrs ago, it still interested me.As the author presents it, this seems like a very dramatic, compelling story.

Tyler includes several plays which are interesting from both an academic and asthetic viewpoint. I would like to make the suggestion to readers to look up some of Tyler's academic papers in titles such as \\"The Noh play Matsukaze as a transformation of Genji Monogatari\\" in Monumenta Nipponica. You can search in Jstor.com at your university library for his articles by author. His work in academic journals is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful..but there is a better one!","review":"Will to murder was a wonderful book. I grew up in duluth minnesota about 2 miles from the glensheen mansion so i love to read about the murders and the mansion its self. But if you think this book was a good telling of Marjorie Caldwell LeRoy Hagen you'll love Glensheens Daughter. Its all about Marjorie and her life as a basicly money hungry, demanding, women, not to mention crazy (in my opinion at least). It tells about her murdering her last husband Wallace Hagen not only that but all the fires she started in arizona and over all her whole criminal life. It is great book. Even better than Will to Murder. I recomend it to any one who enjoyed Will to Murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long, detailed, and sensationalized","review":"I do have an interest in the Glensheen murders, but this book was painful to read. It was full of way too many details that didn't add to the book. I didn't need to know what the detective was doing that morning, and lines like \\"Little did he know that when he got back from his run, his life would change for forever\\" made me laugh out loud. There were NO margins, the type was very small and hard to read, and it was 400 pages long. It was also very sensationalized. I felt like I was reading a tabloid. Sure, Marge was a nutball, but we don't need every little detail and info from everyone she's ever talked to. Unless you dig reading entire crime reports, don't read this. I only got through half of the book. I was getting so impatient and wanted them to get to the point. There is a handy timeline in the back, so that gives you all the main points. We read this for book club and not one person out of 6 could finish it because it was too long and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Book Club Hated it!","review":"When I read the 5 star review, \\"My Book Club Loved it,\\" I had to laugh. This dreary recounting of this infamous crime bored me to death. Obviously, friends or relatives submitted the good reviews. I'm from Duluth and have a keen interest in these murders. I also know quite a bit about them from following them in the newspapers over the years. This is such an interesting story that I'm amazed that these authors who were involved with the case could present it in such a tedious and uninteresting fashion. I will generously give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written, lots of details you can't find elsewhere!","review":"I loved this book. I thought the attention to detail was what was so spectacular about it. I grew up in Northern Minnesota and I loved hearing every little detail about a story that I have been around my whole life. Who wants to read a \\"generalized\\" account of a murder? True life murder investigations and accounts are very detailed, as they should be and this one is no exception. It was great getting all of the extra information that you don't hear about on TV or in the newspapers. I love non-fiction books and I think this one was truly interesting to read. I couldn't put it down even though I knew the ending! Very well written. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effort to Finish","review":"I loved Kit from Celia's Grand Passion so I had looked forward to reading his story. But this book was so bad that I had to make a real effort to finish it. Kit meets up with Lucy (who calls herself Luke as she was pretending to be a boy) on the beach on night while smuggling. He was shot and she helped him escape and bind his wound. Diana (who I am guessing will figure in the story with the last brother) is the only interesting person in this draggy story. Nice to see Celia and Kendal again and their baby. But the romance between Lucy and Kit was flat and had no spark. The mystery was flat, too. A good romance has to have wit, romance, spark and an interesting premise. All these were missing from the regency. A romance between Kit and Lucy was forced and did not seem real. The bad guys, if they are such, are also not interesting nor dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leftist Secret Society Yale Graduates Plot Takeover Of U.S. Government","review":"A powerful group of Yales graduates come close to pulling off a takeover of the U.S. Government.

The secret left wing society of the title was absurd, and the way new members kept cropping up made the book seem more like cranky gassings than a real, complex thriller.If you prefer your villians Snidely Whiplash with a pink tinge, and your heroes out of the Fox News anchor mold, this is for you. Otherwise, wait until you just need that one more helping of the otherwise excellent McCarry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-Day Political Thriller","review":"A bombshell of a political thriller, the sequel to McCarry's The Better Angels. A tense and riveting tale of a struggle for presidential power, and the human and political consequences it leaves in its wake.

Even getting it used here on Amazon will end up costing you like $14. If your curiosity gets the better of you, I would suggest renting it before you buy.The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it seems to revel in its own manure like a pig, and it doesn't take itself very seriously. This movie is so bad, it's almost good. If they had cut the budget a little more and made the bugs out of paper mache, they could have called this the \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" for the new millennium.It's pathetic films like this that make people think of horror as low brow entertainment.

There was a hint of quality in this film thanks to Lance. The story line was, well, OK.

These films aren't loaded with much in the ways of a good story but they do pack a lot of laughs and entertainment.This one follows a group of thieves, some local authorities, and a really good looking lady who was taken hostage as they run through the forest to avoid sasquatch. That is pretty much it. It almost seemed as if the same scene was being repeated over and over again. One person would run, someone would chase them, the sasquatch would come flying out of nowhere and take them out. The laughs never stop due to the awful acting and moments where you patently await the next sasquatch attack.If you are looking for a well made movie then don't look this way. But if you are simply looking to be entertained by some good old horror b then Sasquatch Mountain is right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popcorn entertainment","review":"This DVD has the original, uncut version of the movie shown on Sci-Fi a few months ago, and interestingly enough, on the DVD, the title is Devil On The Mountain, whereas the box art has it as Sasquatch Mountain. The movie itself I give 3 1/2 out of four stars. The plot is pretty tight and the effects are great too. Tiny Ron makes a great Sasquatch, and the ever-reliable Lance Henriksen does a great job. The rest of the cast are Curb Entertainment regulars except for Cerina Vincent, Craig Wasson (Body Double) and Rance Howard, such as Michael Worth, Tim Thomerson, Karen Kim and Candace Racquel. There is a terrific behind the scenes segment which shows the light-hearted spirit on the set and the fun had by the cast and crew. This is a great DVD, and well-worth having in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 ft my a??!","review":"I purchased this product for installation on a stairwell door.

The picture makes this look like a regular size jar, .63oz, of Tiger Balm. In actuality, what comes is not the same thing as the picture. Also, i believe the seller uses grams instead of ounces to intentionally misguide buyers. What I recieved in the mail was a tiny red tin, about the size of my thumb, from the tip to the first knuckle. The amount in ounces is .14oz. I am really disappointed in this product and feel as if I have been , if not directly lied to, then at the very least grossly mislead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Retro Game for the Family","review":"To see something with the name Atari attached to it after all these years left me wondering what I was actually getting.

I hope the product is working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Programmer's Room?","review":"Stay away and wait for the Flashback 2.0, which looks much better. They really messed this one up. The sounds and graphics look like someone did them from memory rather than first playing them on a real atari. Worst is ADVENTURE. This has always been a favorite of mine, and was sad to see that the programmer's room was screwed up in the Jakks emulation, but here, it seems to not exist at all! There is something peculiar and thin looking about the graphics throughout and the gameplay is not the same at all (just try moving diagonally). The dragons don't so much chase you as simply impale themselves on the sword, and the bat's AI is very strange. I'd be curious to hear if anyone was able to find the dot or access the programmer's room easter egg in this version. Some of the other games were decent, but the klunky joysticks ruin the enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh,well...","review":"This atari isn't really bad,but the atari flashback 2 is way better.The console is pretty and has some good games(e.g. centipede),but desert falcon is HORRIBLE!Asteroids on the 40's machines was much better.I like \\"Centipede\\",\\"Air-sea battle\\",\\"Planet smashers\\",\\"Sky diver\\",and \\"Yars' revenge\\".I don't think some other games on this product \\"made it\\".It is really cool though.I personally like it,but there are many people who might rather buy an \\"Xbox360\\".So,my final verdict is:If you like 40's games,get this,or even better,get an Atari Flashback 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"I have very little to say: No Enduro, no River Raid, no Pac-Man and no Pitfall.The best games of the 2600 console are missing, making the hole product pointless.Sorry, but for me, it looks like a great idea was lost.

My daughter wouldnt take it because of the shape and its not something you can sterilize with out ruining it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby wouldn't accept","review":"I received this as a gift before my daughter was born and thought it was a pretty neat idea. After she arrived and I tried to use it one night, I found out quite differently! When I placed the pacifier in her mouth, if she'd been able to speak, she would have said something like \\"What is this?\\" and proceeded to promptly SPIT it out. I tried a second time and got the same response. We have always used the Avent pacifiers and this thermometer is shaped quite differently. If you have a baby that isn't used to this type of pacifier, buying this thermometer will be a waste of money. Ours is in a drawer and will never be used. We're sticking with the regular thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, but...","review":"This is a good idea in theory, however, it just didn't work for us. Our son took a pacifier with no problems, but he knew this was different and just didn't want to hang on to it. Even though taking a rectal temp is no joy in itself, it's the best way to get an acurate reading. It's all our doctor's office would really take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't they think of this sooner?","review":"This thermometer is great. Just give it to your baby like a regular pacifier. It will sound a tone when the temperature is taken, and shows it digitally on a lit display. If the baby has a fever, it will play a little lullaby rather than just sounding a tone. It also stores the last temperature taken. You can also be guaranteed an accurate temperature, unlike the ear thermometers -- and so much less expensive! A best buy in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young girl spends time in the outback of Australia","review":"A young girl disguises herself as a boy and runs away from an unsympathetic aunt and uncle, using their horse and wagon.

While the training methods seem very reasonable. This book is totally geared for the new puppy owner or even prospective puppy buyer. He states in the book that obedience training should begin at age 49 days. and actually has the arrogance to say on page 26 that a dog that is a year old is untrainable.

According to the book, I'm contradictory categories for being assertive and confident in some cases, but I'm a co-dependent leech for being attentive and caring. It also makes assumptions about different men's pasts which will automagically make them a \\"loser\\" without hope for recourse or repair. I put this book in the same category as DeAngelis books which match certain personality types and state that a relationship will or will not work according to some hard formula...which is rarely, if ever, the case. The saving grace is that yes, certain types of men/relationships ought to be avoided or removed from your life, such as with abuse. But I'll save my next reading for when I want to feel bad for remembering that my girlfriend likes coffee ice cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong idea","review":"This book is just too simplistic in its recipes for detecting the wrong man. Basically, it assumes that all women want to marry the same type of \\"ideal\\" man. Is this really the case? not very likely. Its pretty sad if you need a book like this to tell you who to date. Plenty of people who live with their heads in the clouds are going to go through life single, giving them plenty of time to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"This book is a load of crap.

Yes, some of whats in this book is true...but to be so generalized?If you are not completely PC, and want a MAN that you can be truly happy with, you may have to accept many \\"RED FLAGS\\", as anything w/ testosterone in it will have these \\"RED FLAGS\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Informative, and Eye Opening","review":"This book catagorizes people into types that are losers. Yellow flag losers may be worth the effort, while RED flag losers need to be weeded out. The book even tells you how to get rid of a loser.The book is FUNNY, but also informative. Although you know the guy is a loser, sometimes it is difficult to put your finger on what is wrong. This book helps. The book helped me see some similarities in the losers I have met. It also helps to educate you on how to get out of the relationship. Some losers are easy to leave, but there are others that you just can't run from either because they keep returning, or because they become violent.There is one loser that the book does not mention. That is the one of the selfish or stingy person.I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes","review":"i'm beginning to understand now...there are some things that you deal with and some things that are major character flaws that signal \\"game over\\" for that particular person.i'd recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Tales of the Jazz Age","review":"A great collection of short stories by Fitzgerald, very entertaining, along the same lines as his Great Gatsby, as well as insightful into early 20th century American fiction writing. \\"Benjamin Button\\" and \\"A Diamond as big as the Ritz\\" were my two favorites"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting book","review":"my friend recommended this book to me, this book is very fun to read if you are interested in the 20s America"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd and bad stories","review":"Some of F.

For $50 I didn’t expect it to be great, but this is pretty bad.

I’m guessing they will eventually begin to pull up after extensive use.The most disappointing part of the board is that the points are positioned off-center. So on one side of the board there is a gap and the other side doesn’t allow the checkers to fit without overlapping onto the next point.As I said, for $50 I didn't expect it to be great, but the fact that the points are off center along with being poorly attached to the playing surface leads me to a 2 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrong item","review":"recieved the wrong picture was not what was pictured in the ad. costumer service was excellent they was willing to refund me and or replace it with something else. very nice people to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away...","review":"This product ships in great packaging and it looks good, but the taste... horrible.

The section on the nature of deity is better than most, as is the section on circle casting. I also quite liked the suggestions on grounding and shielding, topics that many authors seem to find difficult to convey. The chapter on the Wheel of the Year is a bit disordered but I think that's hard to avoid, especially in an overview. Overall, a good mix of practical and theoretical information, and a tone that manages to be clear without being condescending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Place To Start","review":"I enjoyed this book as a simple intro to the religion. My favorite is still The Truth About Wicca and Witchcraft by James Aten, but this one is a very close second. It does give a nice history, as well as examples, and it's thoughtfully written.

This one's about a Writers' Circle--a support group for aspiring writers--of all types: fantasy, erotic poetry, even comic strips--so it reminds one of Lovesey'sBloodhounds (Soho Crime)about a mystery readers' circle. Foiled again! However, in this one, the protagonist isn't Peter Diamond (as in Bloodhounds) but Hen Mallin. I like her better than Diamond--she's less narcissistic & unnecessarily caustic. The mystery is intricate & engaging. True, the 1st part of the book centers on the Circle (establishing background or context) & the 2nd part on Hen & the solution. There are also some good lines such as on P. 30: \\"This announcement went down like garlic bread in Transylvania.\\"This is a fun read--but tough to figure out.

This, despite an absurd and annoying writing style (at least in this book). I suspect that Dr. Shuker is trying to be amusing and clever, but his style is only coy and distracting.

I like settling logs, but this event happens 20 times in 60 minutes, & twice it is startling--like a pile of books falling on your head. So too for the pops--5 of them sound like the report of a gun.However, the weirdest feature begins around 28:00, when the roar becomes an up-close static. The worst occurs at 39:00, when the grossest burst makes the disc sound defective. The static eventually dies away but not until about 56:00 does it finally disappear. This CD is a very bad choice for anyone who finds sudden noises unnerving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book.","review":"Don't buy this book. It is awful.

What was their mission? So much was unclear in the mish mash of multiple-perspective storytelling.Further there were several disturbingly violent scenes in this book which I found distasteful and unnecessary except for shock value.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but the most die-hard shadowrun fan. Its bound to be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful. Don't waste your money.","review":"This book is truly awful. I suspect that Mr. Bond and Mr. Koke intended to create a spooky technothriller combining the best aspects of Shadowrun and Anne Rice. Instead, the result is a cheesy, predictable mixture of dubious science fiction and B-grade horror- everything from the evil cult of vampires bent on world domination to the \\"I'm so EEEE-vil\\" mad scientist. It won't even give you an in-depth look at the Shadowrun roleplaying world, because this book often contradicts previous sources and novels. It's really a shame, given the inherent subject matter; this book could have been great. But as it is, it's just so much drivel. Don't waste your money on this book.

Lee for the Penguin Lives series. Historians have had their chance and now it is Blount's and he makes good use of many of their interpretations, in addition to his selective, yet effective, use of primary sources. All the facts are in evidence and the details feel right. The narrative is straight forward and moves at a brisk pace appropriate to the small format of this impressive series of biographies. The usual witty style of the author breaks through on occasion and he lets his best self come out in the appendices, including one on the humour of Lee and Lee's attitude to slavery. A biography of Lee still suffers a little as Lee never seems to come across as colourfully as most of the Civil War leaders but the author does his best to provide his own colour commentary.

Of course you saw him take off his clothes, but you never saw anything above the knees. He was wearing a bathing suit I'm sure. Child Services people are present at EVERY film where there are minors involved. End of that subject.This could have been a great movie if the boy had been just a little bit older. Even 18 would have done the trick. What point was it to have a 10 year old in that situation? The acting was great, but the whole premise was totally lost in the cradle and highchair robbing being done by the character of Nicole Kidman.Run away together? In 11 years you'll be 21?

This is a film where very little is said; there are long, annoying shots of winter trees, icy New York streets, etc. all amounting to abolutely nothing. Questions that are so obvious are not even touched upon, and Nicole Kidman comes across as mentally ill herself.It ends so abruptly, as if the director said, \\"Let's just end this thing and put ourselves out of our misery\\". This film insults the intelligence of any viewer in a way that is shameful. What a waste of an evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises much but delivers little","review":"A potentially fascinating plot - exploring the possibilities of reincarnation, is largely wasted by flat and painfully slow delivery.Even the usually dependable Ms Kidman just looks like she's going through the motions here, and the legendary Lauren Bacall is utterly wasted.A couple of inspired moments - the growing jealousy of Kidman's fiancee and, of course, the famous bath scene with the creepy Cameron Bright (does the poor lad /always/ play such roles?), raise the interest momentarily and just about save this from being a lone-star movie but, believe me, you will feel totally cheated by the (non-)ending.An opportunity wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I can't believe this film get so many positive reviews. For me it wasjust a boring experience.To begin with, the movie develops WAY too slow. Long pauses withnothing going on are quite often.The boy's character (Sean) is just crazy. And not in a good way. Ifyou watch a comedy, you can feel sympathy for crazy characters. Butwhen you watch a film targeting so called \\"sophisticated audience\\" youwant characters to make a bit more sense.Ten years after Anna's husband's death the boy comes along claimingthat he is the husband, Sean. Acting rather weirdly, and not makingany effort to convince anyone that he actually is Sean. If he reallywere Sean and loved Anna as much as he claimed he should've stayedaway from her. It's been ten years for her, after all. And he is afreaking boy who (apparently) spent 10 years in a freezer.Unfortunately this point was not voiced by any of the characters,which again raises question about their intellectual abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strange","review":"This movie just felt wrong from the beginning. The subject matter is disturbing, but that isn't even why I disliked it. It was just all very odd. The plot, the character portrayals.

More like abortion...","review":"I cannot remember the last time I saw a film that began so spectacularly well only to so miserably blow it in the end. The first half of the film is like an Anton Chekhov ghost story by way of Stanley Kubrick - creepy, haunting, gorgeous, mysterious, transgressive - and then at some point it suddenly careers off a cliff. I was waiting for it to go south all along (so many films disappoint) but it kept getting better and better and my hopes kept lifting. When it began to get bad, it wasn't even in the typical Hollywood ways that I had expected. It was worse. The air went out of it, the suspense drained away - it was a movie that needed to remain at least partially ambiguous, to be allowed to be allegorical. Instead, the filmmakers tried to finally ground it in reality and ended up killing it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Birth\\" of what?","review":"This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating! Can't we have something like a --100,000,000? I have to say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life to the extend that it has no real plot, no real acting, and no real substance at all. This has to be one of those \\"art\\" movies that no one understands, not even those deep intellectual spiritualists that prolificates on the profoundness of the spiritual world. The subject matter has been handled much better by others who at least had a plot in mind before they took pen in hand or stepped behind or in front of a camera. Don't waste your time or your money unless you want to sit in a theatre and eat popcorn and drink a coke and relish the dim lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer that with such interesting subject matter, they really did a laim job with this movie. not only are there parts of the plot that just dont make sense, but the whole movie drags along like a rake through honey. some of the scene changes are so awkward that it takes you a few moments to figure out what might be going on. The only reason I rented this movie was because it sounded interesting, and Kidman was in it.

There is nothing else. No ending, no logic, nothing. The two hour running time of this film is full of bad filler. Even bringing Lauren Bacall and Anne Heche into this cinematic disaster does nothing for it. It is ridiculous.

That scene alone should have been enough to assure that this film never saw the light of day.

If you have any intelligence at all--you'll have the plot figured out within the first fifteen minutes. Lots of filler--such as the scene focused on Nicoles face for about a minute with nothing happening--other than some uninspired background music droning. While not a prude--I found the scenes of Nicole and a ten year old boy naked in a bathtub together to be in very poor taste and simply an excuse for some cheap pedophile thrills--I'm sure if it were an adult male with a pre-teen female--there would have been more objections.If you want to see a good movie about reincarnation--though a bit of a comedy-I recommend \\"My Left eye sees Ghosts\\"--a far superior movie to this boring waste.

One noteworthy feature is Kidman's foot stamping, spoiled child performance, which culminates in a toddler-esque rant to the fiance she abandoned about how nothing is her fault. However, as this happens towards the end of the film, I suspect few will be awake to see it. Conceited drivel - it is telling that the only \\"quote\\" from a review they could find for DVD cover was from the Christian Science Monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!","review":"I love Nicole Kidman, I think she is a wonderful actress. She is a great actress in this part as well, and so is the rest of the cast, but this movie is so poorly written, it doesn't matter how great the cast is. Nothing is explained satisfactorily, and the scene of Anna naked in the bathtub with a little boy is just gross. And the music, UGH! Most of it was very good, and very fitting, but there was a low, base beat that just kept going and going until I finally muted it.

Besides for the gross-out kiddie porn factor the movie is slow and most of the dialogue is in a monotone. If it had been a male middle-aged actor and a 10 year old nude girl in a tub the whole cast and crew would still be in jail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Show!","review":"This is a very creepy movie. Does love extend from beyond the grave? I imagine that this was the question the movie tried to pose, and to answer, and the answer seems to be yes, whether or not reincarnation is a possibility. But there is an incredible sadness that overwhelms Anna, and it is not clear if this is because of her love for her dead husband, or in spite of it.As Anna, Nicole Kidman is as beautiful as ever she was, a down-under version of Isabella Rosselini, and while the movie is a downer, watching her certainly isn't.

Nicole Kidman, looking and behaving a lot like Ellen Burstyn in \\"The Exorcist\\", and the kid, pudgy Cameron Bright, are cinema's newest odd couple and given the strange sexual direction this film begins to take, I'm only thankful the two of them didn't end up in a cheap downtown hotel. Whew, darn close though! Loaded with bold symbolism of the concept of birth, the film fights itself, offering a logical if implausible explanation, but holding tightly to a supernatural element that never materializes. Lauren Bacall, looking as always like she'd kill for a cigarette, plays Kidman's gruff mom, and Danny Huston manages an effective jealous rage towards his ten year old rival. It's said to be the kind of movie that causes after-viewing discussion and we agree, because we're wondering if it's not symbolic of Kidman's marriage to Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less is more...","review":"I loved this movie. Not only was it beautifully shot, but the acting was superb. This film uses silence, and few words to make more of a statement than has been made in years.

Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to \\"spell it all out\\" in the script, instead of weaving the viewer into a more subtle human mystery. Nicole Kidman is lit, made up, and photographed like a goddess--but she does more for the character and for the movie than they do for her. Although beautiful, she's sort of playing it dazed here, a smart but tepid woman with a vacuousness about her that doesn't allow for inner fire.

The relationship between Anne and 10 year old Sean was verging on paedaphilia. The bath scene made me really uncomfortable and the scene in the restaurant where Anne asked if Sean had ever made love to women disturbed me.

I like the idea of Anna's dead husband returning as another person, but didn't enjoy him as a 10 year old boy.The bath tub scene really weirded me out. Nicole Kidman's character toed the line and never really does anything outright sexual with \\"Sean,\\" but it was close enough to make me very uncomfortable.The whole movie was totally unbelievable because there was never any explanation why Sean knew so much about the dead Sean and Anna's life together. How did he know they had sex on the green couch? I mean, the characters were ridiculously stupid not to wonder how in the heck this 10 year old stranger knew the intimate details of Anna's life with Sean.

The actors were delivering their lines like they only had an hour of sleep, the dialogue between the characters was simplistic and uneventful and the ending concluded horribly. Moreover, they could have kept that bath tub scene with Nicole Kidman and the little boy to themselves. That mess gave me the creeps and it really was uncalled for.

Unfortunately, this was not the case.Apparently, there has been a more recently released Speed Racer cartoon that has a techno soundtrack. This CD has THOSE songs.

There are actually some fairly cool remixes of the Japanese version of the Speed Racer theme song.

It is definitely an ironic example of WWII propaganda. In the film, Russian peasants live a beautiful happy idyllic life until the Nazi's invade. The film depicts the brutality of the Nazis very well, but it presents a totally false image of life in prewar Russia, which, in the real world had famines and purges and the mass murder of millions of people. The Ukrainian peasants were so brutalized by Stalin that when the Germans invaded them, they thought that they were being liberated. They found out that the Nazi invasion was not liberation in short order. Never the less, this film is so distorted as to be a cross between something to laugh at and something to vomit over. The sugary depiction of life in pre-war Russia is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive!","review":"In LITTLE GLORIA, Barbara Goldsmith has written the definitive biography of Gloria Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt has had a life that reads like a preposterous soap opera.

The fact that the focus of this well-publicized battle was just a single little girl too often is forgotten.

It is beyond annoying. I have never had any kind of allergic reaction to any skin lotion/oil product so this is an unexpected outcome. I'm sure lots of people won't have any problem with this product. That said, I highly recommend patch testing this on a small area before using it all over your body or using it on small children.

Of course, he would live through two world wars and see socialism rear its ugly head. Perhaps at the end he might have written a different book. Also, he disdains religion and his ideas on relationships fit into the '60s more than the early 1900s. Today, none of this would be shocking. His prediction of war between England and Germany would soon come true. His dislike of war is perhaps the only high point of this book. Controversal book then, but not so much now.

Card number 11 identifies the carpal bones erroneously (incorrect name and location). I contacted the publisher and they promised to correct the problem on the next printing. I thought the cards to be beautifully made, but as an Anatomy tutor, I can not recommend them since when you are first learning something it is extremely important to get it right. I did not bother to keep reading the rest of the cards, so I do not know how many mistakes there are in the entire deck. It is a shame that such a wonderfully crafted and useful tool contains mistakes like that. I will return it because I can not rely on the information given by the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect information","review":"I got this hoping that It would help me study for my exam.

The story is silly but that is par for the course with Torchwood and Dr. Who and I normally like it. When you combine it with the really bad acting here it really is a bad episode. It is ALL of the actors too so maybe the director just let his intern take over for the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great show","review":"I started watching this show on netflix, and I'm planning on getting all the episodes on blue-ray in time. If you like BBC shows, and like something different you should give this show a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by morons.","review":"Let's see...hmmmm...You have a female impersonator suffering from Don Juanism with whom all the girls want to sleep, who also has severe self-destructive tendencies (Latent homosexuality has that effect)who is also trusted to play with world destroying toys unsupervised. You have two women and one man who can't get their tits out of the way long enough to get anything done and a group of writers who give the impression that they can't go more the twenty minutes without some sort of sexual release. Add it all together you have 'Torchwood'. I watch it somewhat with the same eye that I use when passing a traffic accident. You don't want to look, but you still crane your neck a bit and keep watching. It is very sad. Doctor Who is such a class act, with a sense of wonder, while this is a bad dream from writers who are using a public forum to explore their own childhood memories of sexual abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I was anticipating so much the arrival of the DVDs and especially so after paying a bomb for it. When it arrived, I tore open the packaging and immediately started viewing. 1st espisode and I was telling myself \\"Ok, why don't I watch another espidoe?\\". By the second espisode I was ready to give up. The plot is so lame and the characters are so shallow! The special effects are soooooo bad! Personally, I think this DVD is overpriced! :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dr. Who, and not family frendly!","review":"I started watching this with Dr. Who quality in mind. Had to shut it off.

Next time I'll check the reviews FIRST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money or time.","review":"Awful, don't waste your time, the story doesn't make sense, the writers should find another job. This so called team \\"Torchwood\\", is so secret everybody knows them, they answer to no authority yet the Police (pictured as a bunch of puppets) drop to their knees for them. The lead actor John Barrowman is so bad he doesn't even qualify as an actor, he is not a bit convincing as a group leader of any kind. Now if you are into gay sex you might find it somewhat appealing as 4 out of 5 lead characters have some sort of homosexual AND heterosexual relationship during the show, as stated before by other reviewer this does not corresponds to reality. I thought I was buying a sci-fi show not a mediocre gay propaganda show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid little show.","review":"In any story or film you've got to have at least one character you like or sympathize with and in Torchwood you'll not have even half a one.

I saw the cover, read the description, and figured I would give it a watch. It was painfully bad, lots of overly dramatic acting in emotional situations. Characters were either completely emotional or completely unemotional from scene to scene. The exception is that the Captain was more well acted. Camera work is certainly sub-par, though it is comparable to others of the BBC in picture quality it is not in handling. Somehow I watched episode 12 rather than the 1st but I think this gave me the best idea of how bad it could be. While this is not going to matter to everyone the main character, the Captain, is gay and you will at least watch men kissing. I know that doesn't matter to everyone but if it does bother you there is the heads up. Overall I think the show is a overly dramatic version of Doctor Who"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Dr. Who's light heart.","review":"I bought this series having never seen it but it had Captain Jack and I loved him in Dr. Who.

Oh well I learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written.","review":"I can suspend disbelief with the monsters and aliens and all, but to stretch it to believe that this bunch are actually a part of a world saving organization, and that they actually save the world, is just too far out to accomplish. this is so poorly written that it is an embarrassment.

If you are a zombie and you can talk...you can breath...that is how talking works....so you can give mouth to mouth...all I can figure is they hired people with no education to write the shows.

The show is very dark and dismal. Could have been good but the agenda killed it. What ashame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappiest sci-fi series I have ever watched","review":"I am a huge fan of sci-fi. I love X-files and Firefly, for instance, and Torchwood is less than pale in comparison to these great sci-fi series. I get that sci-fi is supposed to cater to the improbable, but the acting and the story lines are so difficult to believe that I could not get into the series. I still gave it a chance by watching a few episodes, but then the drama between the characters started getting totally ridiculous. I would not recommend this series to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography disguised as Science Fiction","review":"For the most part, Torchwood is pornography disguised as science fiction. It's a vehicle for casual promiscuous sex, and the producer writers in their reviews seem to be very proud of it.The few episodes that were not about sex had an X-file feel to them, but in Torchwood there's none of that platonic love that you find and admire between Muldar and Skully.What's the worst is that you are expecting a Dr. Who chivalry aspect to Torchwood, and that's not there either.The immortal hero who can't die is pretty much the only cool 'gimick' that Torchwood has going for it.I collect Dr. Who. I borrowed Torchwood from the library to see if it was as bad as everyone is saying. It is as bad a they are saying. I put hundreds of dollars into Dr. Who. But, I'm not going to spend any money on Torchwood.At least in the new Battlestar Galactica series, the whole series isn't just about sex. The first season of Torchwood is pretty much all about sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-Files Meets Shagtown","review":"At first, I didn't quite like this series. Then, after viewing it, I really didn't like this series.The characters - from Gwen to Cap'n Jack - are so unreliable and so obsessed with falling in love or bedding one another (or regretting falling in love and/or bedding one another) that the entire series would only be believable if it was set in a small town coffee shop and its characters were over-stimulated 20somethings with nothing other to do than lie (either about themselves or with their co-workers).As for the alien threats, you have to stick around for the majority of the series until you hit an episode with a fear-inspiring foe and an emotionally-packed ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through the first series","review":"I tried to like this series but just couldn't do it. I read reviews saying it was Dr. Who but rejigged to appeal to adults. Well, if you're a gay atheist that loves corny science fantasy then you win because that's obviously who the producers are appealing to. Plots are very thin, characters are all sluts (male & female, gay & straight) and utterly lacking a moral compass. Perhaps series 2 and onwards improve (viewership in the UK must have been abysmal for this dross) but I won't be buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildy Disappointed","review":"Wow! Now that I have completed the first season I have to say that I am widly disappointed. I held out hope that the season would improve, but there were no signs of it by the end.While the cinematography and general sci-fi feel are OK, the characters (other than Caption Jack) are absolutely miserable. I kept hoping that they would all be killed by the end, but alas I knew I would be disappointed since they are in Season Two. Even Captian Jack was only a shade of his brilliance in Doctor Who.I can't believe that Russell T. Davies could be associated with this. My opinion of his writing has just taken a heavy hit. I will certainly not be buying Season Two nor watching it for free if I can watch The Doctor in a re-run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torchwood rocks!","review":"I have been a Doctor Who fan for many years and was curious when I heard about this spinoff series. I'd seen a few episodes on BBC America and was intrigued, so now, a few years later, decided to buy the first season. It's alot darker, but it grips your attention and won't let you go; it's also alot more graphic than your average U.S. drama. But that just seems to add to its appeal. If you like Doctor Who, or are already a Torchwood fan, I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad spin-off of \\"Doctor Who\\".","review":"\\"Torchwood\\" has a great concept, but is ruined with bad plots and way too much drama. \\"Doctor Who\\" is an action series, but \\"Torchwood\\" is nothing more than a drama with very lazy writing and very little suspense. It does have it's good episodes, but they're few and fare in between. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and edgy Brit Scifi","review":"I love Scifi it's my fave genre. I'm into anything that's cyber, fantastic, space faring, laser guns, aliens - whatever - as long as the storyline is good. For those who enjoy the tame fare of Star Trek, Eureka, Kyle XY, Babylon 5, BSG to a degree (although edgier and darker)and all the other family favourites (which I do totally) and you want something darker, different, adventurous then you've got Far Scape, Firefly and then go totally whack and you get Torchwood the fantastic Doctor Who spin off. And Doctor Who rocks big time. I grew up with Doctor Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf and other British fare so it's great to see this type of show.Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it for what it is.

This goes well beyond Dr. Who. Full of character driven scripts, this show does more for sci-fi TV than anything that's gone before. Be patient with this one because the end will leave you gasping for more. Now that Season 2 has aired on Sci-Fi, I can only say that this is a show that has a life of its own. Really, try not to miss this rich and rewarding series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifetime favorite...","review":"The problem with the US and the UK is that we still have different mindsets -- from current events to physical and emotional displays. Torchwood is one of the most daring shows I've seen to date. The storylines show innovation and feeling; no character's gender or personal attraction is singled out because of whom they interact with, whether physical or not. The Torchwood staff is unique team of real people who happen to have the means to protect the planet.While it was marketed as a spin-off from the [incredible] new Doctor Who series, this first season of Torchwood has certainly proven itself on its own with original characters realistically created. The show depicts a world in which exists newfound frivolity and homosexuality to losing new interests and old loved ones. Now that's real life, folks...why have we still not gotten used to it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One demerit to the DVD manufacturer","review":"Great series, but beware: If you watch all the features on the DVD disks in order, you'll be spoiled for episodes you haven't seen yet. And you should avoid the commentaries until you've finished the set as well. (Time saver: The post-episode behind-the-scenesers are, I think, entirely recycled in the longer \\"Torchwood Declassified\\" segments on the last disk, so you can skip these.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, loved it, loved it","review":"I should preface my review and tell you that I am a huge fan of Doctor Who and Torchwood. When I learned that Torchwood was going to be released on Blu-ray, I had to have it. Captain Jack's wit and sarcasm are glorious when mixed with the great sci-fi adventures of the team. To see Torchwood in all of its hi-def glory is such a treat for me. I loved the extras as well. Now, if only they will set a release date for Season 2 on Blu-ray..."},{"rating":"1","title":"They all need to die in Season 2","review":"First off let me say I'm a huge Scifi fan and I have all (that are available) the Doctor Who episodes on VCR or DVD. I actually cried when Tom Baker regenerated into Peter Davison. But all the characters on Torchwood need to die in the Season 2 opener and a new crew needs to take over. During the course of the first season I went from looking forward to each show to hoping one of the main characters fell into an abyss. The only one worth saving is Jack (of course he can't die anyway). The rest of them needs to go. The acting was pitiful and at some point you need to care about what happens to the characters in order to want to watch it every week. I can put up with weak plots and terrible storylines (the 1st season had both), but I have to care about the characters. Please BBC, Torchwood is a great idea but throw the current cast into a pit full of Cybermen and Daleks and start from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Show","review":"I was excited to watch Torchwood because I am both a Doctor Who and Sci-Fifan. I thought it would be as good as Doctor Who. I was in for a big dissapointment. The episodes are sub par copies of X-files episodes and other sci-fi series and lack in originality. The characters are uninteresting and the acting isn't that great. I'm surprised that this show hasn't been cancelled. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Trashy TV","review":"This is trashy TV. If you want something with foul language, loose sexuality, and graphic, bloody violence, this is for you.If not, stay far, far away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Children or Families","review":"This show is not for families or children. It is a sad attempt to cash in on the Dr. Who franchise. After wading through the first season I found the stories tedious and weak. It seems that the creators are attempting to push some political correct sexual mores into their stories since more often than not the characters are involved sexually with each other, as well other characters they come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Series","review":"I had high hopes for the series. Especially being a doctor who fan and it being a Dr Who spinoff. The actors were good but the stories often contained scenes and images that I can only describe as grimey, dirty, and ugly. A good scifi series should spark your imagination. This one simply left me wishing I could purge from my mind of the ugly things I saw. Do yourself a favour and don't go near it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torchwood, snoging the world, one alien at a time!","review":"Very rollercoaster. Characters have much potential that was, for the most part, unrealized in the first season. Too dependent on having seen all the episodes of Doctor Who in which the lead character Jack appears, as well as random monsters, unexplained \\"voids\\", and time rifts. Add to that the fact that there's apparently a whole library of books about Torchwood and you get a big jumble of characters and events jumping centuries as well as out of sequence. Whom the Gods wish to destroy the first call \\"promising!\\"Don't waste you money or time. You'll simply never catch up...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of British Slang, painful to listen to and watch","review":"Not sure what they are saying half the time, the other is sort of pretty cheesy sci-fi. Acting is subpar as well. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Know What? I Liked It!","review":"I picked this up because how can you not watch a show about a team of people lead by John Barrowman? I'm glad I did, too. It delivered. Captain Jack (Barrowman) is the head of Cardiff's Torchwood. It's a secret agency that deals with keeping aliens and time rifts in check. The show picks up when Gwen is recruited as a new Torchwood agent.Torchwood is darker than Doctor Who and for a slightly older audience. It does deal with some more adult aliens and has many innuendoes of adult nature, but it's all done in good fun. As was said by show runners and critics, it does seem to follow a format each week-- Alien comes, chaos ensues, Torchwood wins. There is some character development, but we get much more in later seasons. The cast is amazing. They all seem so natural and you'll find yourself becoming attached to them quickly.Overall, I give this 4/5 stars. I recommend continuing on with the series after this, as it just gets better and better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Torchwood, the best TV since X-files","review":"This series is the best on TV since X-files.

It is adult, gripping, scary, interesting and quite enjoyable to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, this is what passes for cops in England?","review":"This is the keystone cops meet pornography. And yes, the second episode is softcore porn. This isn't moralizing, it's noticing the obvious. In one of the episodes, no less than three of their team members have guns on the bad guys and they STILL get disarmed by their own incompetence (namely, one of the characters is having a conscience issue with shooting a self proclaimed mass murderer). The dialogue is idiotic and the plots are what you'd expect from a 6th grade sci fi fan (I'm thinking like beevus and butthead, \\"heh, heh, let's make a female alien who kills people with sex, heh, heh...).

He was great in Doctor Who, I liked a few of the episodes and there are too many half naked men, other then that I am okay with all the Homosexuality. My only other gripe is that Ianto should have been fired after that cyberwoman episode, instead of just getting a slap on the wrist.

Bravo! Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant series","review":"There's something about sci-fi done right that no other genre really captures. Torchwood has that something. It's the ability to take very human concerns (such as Gwen's quest to maintain her own identity in new circumstances) and combine them with ideas and plots that stretch the imagination to the breaking point. It's the things that move us set in a fantastical new reality. Some movies and shows do it better than others. Torchwood does it as well as it can be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try...","review":"Sorry, but I gave this five episodes to get better and I just can't get past the bad acting and horrible dialog.It's too bad too because the premise of the show is interesting albeit not too original."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so thankful for BBC America...","review":"For bringing me this show. I watched the first episode or two, out of sheer curiosity. Then I was hooked. I love the way that they have taken the time to develop each character showing both their strengths and flaws. The season finale actually made me tear up a little when everyone reacted to seeing Jack.The only reason I gave it 4 stars...ONLY reason, is that it relies so heavily on Dr. Who to get the full gist of what is going on. I found myself searching Wikipedia and fan sites trying to figure out what the deal was with the hand in the jar...and some other quirks. I have, however, ordered the three \\"modern\\" seasons of Dr. Who...in an effort to catch up before Season two starts...I would recommend it for real Sci-fi fans, and maybe not just for casual viewers and prudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed - Sci-Fi for adults","review":"Torchwood is one of the biggest surprises in Sci-Fi to come along in a long while. If you like shows like Firefly or Dr. Who, then you'll get a big kick out of Torchwood.Torchwood reminds me alot of the comic, \\"Batman and the Outsiders\\" - about a team of flawed super-heroes who spend more time fighting their own personal demons than super-villians. The protagonists in Torchwood don't have any super powers (except for Capt. Jack Harkness who can't die) but they all have alot of emotional baggage and relationship issues. Throw in some Doctor Who atmosphere and the result is a real winner.Torchwood is funny, deep, heartfelt and sexually provocative; sometimes all at the same time. A truly remarkable achievement. The best part: there will never be a lame American TV version of the show, due to the sexual exploits of the characters in the show.Getting this DVD is a no-brainer.."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the Mystery Science 3000 movies, this is for you!!!!!","review":"I read the other reviews here, and I'll admit it, they suckered me in. Mentioning CSI, and more importantly Firefly with this series is defamation of character. The special effects are so bad that I went back to look at the box to make sure this wasn't released in the 80's. The first episode was the best, after that I could only muscle through another 5 episodes, each one getting more stilted, and boring, and far fetched. I am a geek, so maybe a little tough, but REALLY, this is about the quality of \\"Earnest goes to (Space) Camp\\". Save your money, I'll give you mine!! Like I said, if you liked the movies on MS 3000 and couldn't understand why they were picking on them, buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"this sexy supernatural police force","review":"This modern TV story of \\"good zombies\\" of London-based Torchwood police force team fighting aliens and other supernatural creatures accomplishes five sequences, of which \\"Cyberwoman\\" might be omitted to spare a time.As accustomed in nowadays visual works, sex possesses a particular part in actions: a Torchwood leader is a homosexual character and some other team members are bi-sexual."},{"rating":"2","title":"torchwood S1","review":"Very imaginative scifi show. Exciting, fast pace, well acted and written. Keeping the world/England safe from aliens is the primary mission of Torchwood, a secret agency that seems to have always existed. A bit too much alternative sexual life style material for a scifi show which is unnecessary IMO. The story sells itself without the sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really tried to like this show...","review":"I've been favorably impressed with other BBC shows I've seen via Amazon Prime IV, so was looking forward to this one as well despite the difference in genre. [The ones I've liked recently are Bleak House and Downton Abbey, but I also enjoy sci-fi. Dr. Who was an old favorite of mine growing up, as was Star Trek Next Gen, etc. etc. - so this is not a genre-based issue for me.] I'm second generation American, but most of my mother's family is still over in Wales, so I was excited about a show based in Cardiff, and quite predisposed to like it. The plot sounded interesting on synopsis, and I like the main actress, who in my opinion does a very good job with a very poor script. The actual episodes are barely coherent in their plotlines, and create situations so ludicrously unrealistic and implausible as to make suspension of disbelief untenable. I gave up halfway through the second episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hungry for more!","review":"BBC has such great shows! I'm not sure which one I love more (right now it's a toss-up between Torchwood, Being Human and Primeval),. Great adult sci-fi drama with humor and occasionally hot scenes; but not for the narrowminded. John Barrowman has reprised his role from Dr. Who as Captain Jack Harkness and is the head of a covert team who hunt aliens and scavenge their equipment. Each team member adds his or her special talent to protect the public and foil the aliens (and sometimes misguided or evil people). Capt. Jack is my favorite character; an outspoken rogue from the future who cannot die, and is bisexual. He has more charisma and charm than anyone should have. Eve Mendes, who plays Gwen Cooper is my second favorite. Described as the heart of the team, she's an ex-policewoman with a quick comeback and the strength to stand up to Jack:I love their scenes together. The CGI effects, acting, storylines and beautiful Welsh countryside add up to great entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Character driven sci-fi fun!","review":"Torchwood is what got me into Doctor Who, which is now some of my favorite programming. As a fan of the Whedonesque shows, as well as other strongly character-driven things like Battlestar Galactica, it was easier to do a lateral entry into Who. Torchwood was perfect for this. The ensemble cast and the Jack Harkness character prepared me for the strange Whovian world. Great monsters of the week, great season plot arcs, brilliant dialogue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as all that.","review":"This episode presents real characters faced with daunting moral dilemmas in situations without any real positive solutions. It lays the groundwork for Captain Jack as a military man as well as the rogue he's been made out to be thus far and forces all of the team members to make hard choices. I also think that given these difficult choices and the characters conflicting motivations, the acting isn't bad. The cast members don't play the extreme melodramatic parts that this episode could have devolved toward, and they really seem to struggle to come to their decisions and to stick with them. There are a couple instances where the actions taken are a little too convenient to the plot line, but I think it showcases the characters in a way that the episodes before this one do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My family and I love the Torchwood series. We first watched Torchwood: Miracle Day when it came out on Starz. I then looked it up and ordered the previous seasons. If you were a previous X-Files fan, I think you will like this show. The characters are engaging, and it is a very entertaining show. I just wish the seasons were longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dark It is Depressing","review":"Torchwood - what a great idea for a Dr. Who spin-off! A little more dark than Who? Well, OK. Unfortunately the show is so dark it is depressing. In almost every episode someone close to a main character dies unpleasantly, everyone in Torchwood betrays everyone else, all beautiful things have horror inside, and as one character says \\"no one is nice, nobody cares.\\" Such a pity - it could have been fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful and awful","review":"Unless you like logical inconsistencies, lots and lots of whining, and some really terrible acting, you'll not like this episode. I'd recommend saving yourself some pain and skip right over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Torchwood were a drug, I'd be addicted.","review":"I'm a big fan of the new Doctor Who series, and when I heard that a spinoff called Torchwood was coming out, I wanted to see it... but I had no idea that I would actually like it MORE than Doctor Who! I think Torchwood is a bit different (and better) than most American sci-fi shows. It has very interesting and unique storylines, awesome graphics and special effects (especially nice to watch in High Definition), and all of the characters are great! The ONLY bad thing, in my opinion, is that there are so few episodes per season. Don't intend to watch it with your family though because it is not for kids, but for adults who want to see an awesome sci-fi show that's a little on the dark side with a some sexiness mixed in, and a few funny scenes here and there, I definitely recommend watching/buying Torchwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torchwood, first season","review":"Having seen & enjoyed Dr. Who & with the high ratings this series was being given, I expected a lot more from it. I loved the first two shows, but as I got deeper into the series I thought it deteriorated into specious ridiculousness. There was so much great material to work with & they could have done so much better. One thing I think was missing was an on-going touch of humor (humour, if you're Brit). Guess I'll stick with Firefly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to punch everyone in this show.","review":"Leave it to Jack to assemble a team composed entirely of incompetent, whiny little bitches. And then hardly be in his own show. I sat through almost the entire first season, really wanting to like it because I love Doctor Who. But this is not Doctor Who. It is an awful show that gets worse as it goes along. Never have I seen so much hormone-driven high school drama crap in a sci-fi show. I would rather watch Stargate Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"More miss than hit","review":"I don't quite know what this show was aiming for. I think an Adult oriented show for people that liked Doctor Who and over the age of 18.Sure, Captain Jack was there but he was not the fun rogue that he was on Doctor Who but a drull leader of a group called Torchwood. Pretty much everyone was so serious that they weren't engaging enough to hold your interest and the chemistry and writing were not there to suck you in and make it a real guilty pleasure.The Producers idea of being an adult show seemed to be throwing a sex scene in every so often for titilation purposes. Sex is fine but only when the story really calls for it and it makes sense for other reasons that just being there to be there.The last three episodes of the season did improve a bit and am hoping they continue with the writing similar to these last few episodes. One can only hope they lighten up a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DOCTOR WHO!","review":"Torchwood was a good concept based off Doctor who. But sadly it does not live up to it. This show clearly has an agenda. Trying to make something not normal seem normal. An agenda that no one wants to see nor care for. Captain Jack is a great character that is wasted because of this agenda. Its a dark dismal sci fi program. The agenda leads to many disturbing scenes not needed to see nor wanted to see. Its not Doctor who. If you want a tru sci fi spin off get the Sarah Jane adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD IDEA BROUGHT DOWN BY IMMORAL CHARACTERS","review":"I watched this show primarily because it was made by the producers of Doctor Who. The show starts off with a good concept and some very intriguing story lines. However, after half-way through the season it appears that all of the characters are nothing but shallow sex-craved individuals with little moral character. The stories appear to be just written around an excuse to get the characters into compromising positions. If this series was a typical prime-time drama that would be expected but since it is supposed to be a science fiction series I would expect a little more of a plot. In the end I found myself fast-forwarding through the episodes just to get to the end and see how things turned out. I will not even bother watching Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torch wood fantastic, scratched disks that kept freezing my Mac, the worst. Am returning it.","review":"See the title.

Is that enough words in the review now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more... but still fairly good","review":"I was very anxious to view this show once I received it but quite frankly, it wasn't as good as I expected. Of course being a BBC show should have been a clue to me that the cast would be British, therefore with British accent & expressions that I'm not custom to hear, which made it really painful to understand. As for the plot, well, I can't say that it was that great either. I'm just used to better quality than this. One thing for sure, I'm not buying season 2, and might not even rent it... Definitely not worth the asking price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"Online purchase through Amazon and Best Price Mirror on 12/30/09.

They were even worse. I honestly think they would be a decent band if they eliminated the trambone stylings of Dave(aka Sponsor Boy). The trambone is really out of place in this record. IF Flight 180 would release a non-trambone album, I would consider buying it. But until then, I think people should check out Slayer if they like this type of music. And NO..Slayer does not include a trambone in their intrumental line up. If you liked Fight 180's Lineup album you should also give a listen to Slayer's Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, and God Hates Us All albums. Slayer's musical talent is well and ranks high up there with bands such as Flight 180."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing sections","review":"The whole did not upload.

Just listen to this album of songs of Newfoundland and Labrador to experience the passion and pride that the members of Great Big Sea have for their homeland. Each song is evocative in its own way from the wickedly funny, to the wistful, and the sad. The arrangements perfect. Alan and Sean are in fine voice and it is great to hear Bob again since his hilarious 'Helmethead' on the 'Something Beautiful' CD. And if the members of the band ever read this, thank you for the personal sacrifices you make to bring this wonderful music to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Great Big Sea..","review":"Then you will like this album.

Without this book we never would have found Papa Rancon in the town of Borbon in the middle on know where. This book is a bit more exspensive but it is definitely worth it.

I am appalled that Carters, supposedly a good brand would have such a thing happen. There is no sign of the sheets having been previously opened, and the bugs (yes, more than one in each) were smashed in between layers, on the inside of the sheets, so I can only guess they were folded and packaged with the bugs on them.

The cheaper sheets just don't fit the bed as well as these. Some have elastic all the way around, making it hard to both get on the crib and fold neatly. None of them are nearly as soft as Carter's - not even after a few washings.

The big features of this book versus other guide books are great maps and numerous color photos. It is also fun to read. I was surprised to find restaurant and comprehensive lodging info included, particularly if you refer to their website for more info. They even have links to the properties' websites.The only drawback is the lack of detail on each of the hiking trails. Lots of description but the basic information such as length of the trail is often left out. It also seems the authors really want you to go to the out of the way trails. Many take all day or multiple days to do. Perhaps they are all like that on the Big Island and on Kauai (the other book in this series I've purchased.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and cheap at the same time!","review":"I bought this multimeter when it was only $60.

I decided on this meter for what I needed. The display is large, and backlit, the leads are decent quality, mine came with a decent quality hard plastic storage case. I don't care for the way the battery door locks in place, it just begs to break. The backstand works great, the leads require a good positive seating (I DO like that), and the fuse is easy to access and a common fuse, if replacement is needed. There is a bit of latency between lead application and display, but frankly this is a decent meter, especially in view of the great pricing.The included software is rudimentary but effective, and easy to use.Overall, this is a great buy, and I am very pleased with this meter.

I have not seen a data center that actually operates as the book describes. Also, the author has a relationship with Veritas, so how many of Vertitas' shortcomings can we expect from a book like this? The entire manuscript would have to have passed through Veritas' legal and PR department before getting anywhere near the publisher. So much for getting the real story.

The fault lies in how the community interacts within itself, the unwritten rules it has established, and the secret games it plays. To improve a conflicted congregation, one must fix the system and not confront any individual.Sadly lacking are biblical references that either support the \\"systems theory\\" approach to conflict management or show \\"systems theory\\" in use by God. In fact, a systems approach to conflict resolution is at odds with revealed Scripture, since Scripture places individuals on the hotseat for repentance, resolving their personal disputes, and making restitution.Assuming you value biblical methods for dealing with life, pick up a copy of Ken Sande's \\"The Peacemaker\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church Conflict: The Hidden Systems Behind the Fights","review":"This book is very boring and I feel that it is a stupid way to look at the church and to try to settle conflicts.

And what's worse, the lead character is almost saccarine sweet -- so much sentimentality!The writing itself is decent, but not good enough to overcome the poor characterization and the sentimentality.Great literature it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Amalie, there was Mathilde...","review":"It is a shame that I saw \\"Amalie\\" before reading this book. Though I loved the movie, I kept seeing that actress as the main character of this book. And though there are some similarities in personality, Mathilde exposes herself to our examination far more deeply than Amalie did.Many books have been written about missing fiances, missing lovers, war widows. This book takes those stories and binds them into a gripping mystery. This novel is NOT a tear-jerker and for that alone, it is wonderful. It is a novel about strength and love and a wish for what could have been. It is about who you would want to be if your lover was lost in the war. I will be buying this book for my mother and my best friends. It is something different. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross-Genre and Character Development","review":"This book was recommended by a co-worker and, boy, am I glad it was. The book is a bit slow getting going but I quickly found I didn't want to put it down. The cross-genre aspect (part romance, part mystery, part historical fiction) was amazingly well-done. I doubt that few authors could pull this off; Japrisot did so beautifully. The character development is also incredibly well done. Although you never meet many of the characters, by the time you're done reading the book, you feel like you knew each and every one intimately. I've recommended this book to a friend who teaches high school English as a study in Character development--she intends to incorporate this into her class next year! GREAT book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much ado about little","review":"Two people whose opinions I respect recommended this book to me - one even said it was the best book she had ever read, and she is a mature, intelligent and serious reader. So I approached the book with great anticipation. Sadly, after an interesting beginning, the book became quite tedious. Ultimately I finished it just so I could get it done with, not because I was enjoying it . Some prior reviewers have blamed the translation but the problem lies in the story itself. There is a very linear simple and obvious plot which is made overly complicated by a plethora of ancillary inessential characters and confusing twists and turns which are impossible to keep straight. In addition there is no character development - the characters are drawn once (very simply and always sentimentally) and never change, and are drawn with thick crayon at that. The depiction of WWI was well done, but other than that it is not a book I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible translation - read it in French I guess","review":"The translation was very choppy. Sentence structure was of an odd cadence that was hard to follow. I had a really hard time with the translation in general -it was too vague. I am still not sure how the book ended! How sad!The heroine is SPOILED rotten, and I felt NO sympathy for her. Poor little rich girl. She had too much time on her hands and used her wealthy Daddy's money to pursue her curiosity.... hurting others while she was at it! How selfish!The other characters were very real, but nonetheless boring. Eskimo could have been interesting, but the plot was so confusing who knows?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"War and Peace it's NOT","review":"This book is better suited for a short-story, as it's pace and meandering detours added nothing to the development of the characters or a plot. I never cared about anyone in the book, not even sympathy for the main character with her \\"disability.\\" The only reason I forced my way through the book was that it was my reading group's monthly selection. Try War and Peace instead: it might have more pages, but you will get through it faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Great but LIMITED Lifespan","review":"The sound performance out of this system is pretty good.

Excellent for PC use when matched with an appropriate sound card.However, there is a cronic problem with this system. The internal components have no air flow what so ever and the system will blow varistors and mosfets, which is cheap to repair if you're an electrician but Creative will charge in excess of $300 to do so.

But the information is poorly presented. I found myself craving some sort of context, an axis. The author relies far too much on quotes from WW's books and letters to fill the page, rather than using those sources to back up some sort of theory. In short, this is a badly written sophomore English paper. There is no logical progression of his age/place/time and WW's writing. We learn that WW updated and reissued \\"Leaves of Grass\\" numerous times, but what informed those changes, for example? The text jumps from one year to another, but the reader is never quite sure where he is in the \\"story.\\" It's a lot of disjointed notes and snippets that result in a fractured and unbalanced account of WW's life. I wish I'd started with a different WW biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure... to love those with whom you disagree","review":"This book is only worth one star, or even half. While the authors make a few thought-provoking arguments, these are obscured by the book's snide tone, sarcasm, and name-calling. How seriously can you take what it says, when, for example, one essay likens openness theologians to drag queens? This book is only fit for those who are convinced that the rightness of their doctrine exempts them from the command to love. Any Christian who is trying to make a serious assesment of open theism's claims would be well-advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage Door Opener works quite well and easy setting up","review":"Setting up was quite easy.

The review section is fairly comprehensive. It does leave out information such as demography and imperialism, in addition to a lack of information from the post-WWII period. It also needs more information on Eastern European nations. The practice test is much more difficult than the real test will be. I have seen many real AP exam questions on classroom tests during the year. They are \\"big picture\\" questions, for the most part. I would study from this book to understand the core information and use more sources to deepen an understanding of specifics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is a pretty good book, but it leaves out some important things. It is good if you had a bad teacher or something and you're starting from ground zero, but there's not enough detail- I thought there was too much emphasis on test taking techniques and not enough on the history you need to know.

Like other works by Mormons I have read,the Bible references were taken totally out of context when they refered to the subject at all. Most of the unusual Mormon practices were not justified with references to the Bible. This work uses words not in any dictionary and known only to Mormons, see in particular the pages on the three levels of heaven. Mr. Lee does not have enough knowledge of the Bible or Christian theology to understand the message of the New Testament. For this reason he claims Mormons are just another Protestant sect. This work displays clearly how different Mormons are from Christians.

Its reach is less than the larger controls.

The fact that it's written by a \\"woman\\" would have only made me more strident in my twisted beliefs. However, maturity and the fact that I have 2 daughters who needlessly suffer because of deep-rooted misogyny have forever changed me. I bought this book because I'm interested in solutions to the problem of subtle and not-so-subtle woman-hating.

We live in a society that increasingly sees men as inherently evil and women as saviors of the world. It seems that human nature leads us toward such polarization from time to time only to later discover that the power inherent in casting ourselves in the role of savior always comes at a price.Ms. Young's book merely serves to illustrate the price we are paying for the excesses of gender feminism, and provides some well reasoned thoughts on how to put things into better balance. If we do not do so, our sons are destined to become second class citizens in a world where they will be blamed for all that is evil and ignored for all that is good.Ceasefire argues that a world like that is one none of us will be happy with...Even those people who seem to want it so badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheesh.","review":"Reading some of the other reviews for this book has reminded me of the complete absence of anything resembling rational thought found in the majority of humans, particularly those of the stubborn, ideological variety that are sometimes termed 'opinionated'. When someone is lambasted by nutty extremists on both 'sides', that person is usually doing something right.

This woman is different,she actually offers a reasonable,workable solution to help resolve the problems between the sexes,to actually work together instead of in opposition to the other.

Her constantly qualifying her criticisms of feminism with criticisms of the right at first seems wishy-washy, but by demonstrating that conservative views on gender are at least as outrageous as the views of radical feminists, she provides an important warning of the danger of overreacting to bad experiences.

The previous reviewer does not say what card is in his system. I have an earlier version of this product. When first installed, it worked perfectly. Then my card (Soundblaster Live) died, and I replaced it with a generic cheap card, at which point Audio Cleaning Lab and various other programs either locked up or otherwise failed to work. I replaced the no-name card with an Audigy and everything works again, including Audio Cleaning Lab. I'm not trying to sell Creative products, but not all sound cards have truly Soundblaster compliant drivers.

I like the Spectral Cleaning option that, with some practice, allows one to eliminate specific noises (like clicks, static and other sonic pests).For someone new to this whole world of remastering and cleaning up old recordings, this package is a great tool with a lot of great features for the money and the analyzing wizards are useful for newbies.

I bought this from Best Buy, being that they had three Temptations CD's and this looked like the best collection of songs to me and it was reasonably priced. Well, people should be forewarned that these are not the ORIGINAL recordings. The music sounds cheesey and the voices are weathered. I had to skip over certain songs because they sounded so off-key.

I know a lot of people say they like grape jelly and oranges more than nectar but my Orioles don't - they LOVE the nectar. Right now all I have hanging up out there are 2 cheap (Wally World) Hummer feeders and they're attracting all the Orioles I can handle!

It has good, simple recipes for all the vegetarian classics, as well as some innovative and delicious variations and ideas. It belongs in all omnivore and vegetarian kitchens. I was rather surprised by the quality of the recipes, as I found the quantity-focused title off-putting, but I have used this book almost exclusively since recieving it as a gift four years ago. It is not tony gourmet (simpler than _The Vegetarian Epicure_) nor lowfat (thank goodness!) but yields excellent meals with great variety.

Some have been good- but I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavorless food.","review":"Sometimes I read reviews where the book was only given one star and I think to myself, could it really have been that bad! Well, I bought this book because I am a vegetarian, have been one since about the age of five, so it isn't like I don't know what I'm talking about. I was so excited when I brought it home. Wow! 1000 recipes! I looked in the index and the names of the dishes really did inspire me to believe they would be exquisite. They are the most bland tasting dishes I have EVER eaten in my life. Spices do exist (and I don't mean salt), anyone can throw a can of beans on some rice and call it black beans and rice. I highly recommend Molly Katzen, Moosewood, Laurel's Kitchen. Don't waste your money on this book. I couldn't even eat the meals after about 3 bites. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible let down for me","review":"In buying this book i hoped to have a real old-fashioned, fresh vegetarian meal, but I was deserted.

Her vegan recipes were frighteningly colorless reenforcing the notion that vegetarian cooking is bland, flavorless and strange. Why not put a little cornmeal on that tempeh before frying it, Carroll? Her adaptations of standard college veggie cuisine like hummus and baba ganouji were flat and lacked any real effort to make them her own.

Everything about it is stellar - the way the characters are first introduced, one by one; the way the story unfolds, slowly gaining momentum; the beautiful dialog... Seriously, this is what filmmaking SHOULD be.There's definitely a theatrical quality about the story telling that is very Brechtian... so the audience is always kept one step away from really getting involved with the story... and I could see that being a turn-off for some people. But, as a cautionary tale/examination of the human spirit, I've never seen anything half as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD deserved the Grammy it won!","review":"This CD is yet another side of an extremely talented musician, artist, poet. His ability to touch your soul with his music is second to none. I have had the pleasure of listening to his music since the 1970's, he is always improving and his music is never predictable.

The songs in these albums were unique and were colored with Bill Miller's Indian heritage. One of them has a really wonderful Indian flute instrumental, Wind Spirit. Each time, I looked forwarded to new releases from Bill. Then, one day it seemed that he felt guilty that he was denying his 'traditional' Indian heritage. From then on his albums, like this one, sounded like every other Native Indian recording. Sigh!!! The later albums are so ho hum. Bill, please go back to songs like Reservation Road, Ordinary Man and Tumbleweed. These songs and others on the other two albums I mentioned above, were drawn from your Native Indian heritage and are so far above anything you are producing these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"toxic substance in \\"non-toxic\\" recipes","review":"As another reviewer has mentioned, almost every one of the recipes in this book uses sodium lauryl sulfate.

I was surprised and disappointed to see it listed as an ingredient on page after page.I found this book at the library, and I was very glad that I had not purchased it myself.A waste of money as far as the recipes go, although the illustrating photos are nice and the author's comments about attempting telepathy as a means of insect repellent are amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic chemical - is not a herb!","review":"The main ingredient in this book is \\"sodium lauryl sulfate\\" - NOT AN HERB.

In the genre, you couldn't ask for a better read, especially if you're fascinated by complex personalities and what makes people tick. Having read it years ago, I still remember the vivid characters.

It really has an effect on emotions. Some things are lighthearted, some things are truly heart breaking, there's even a few laughs. Everything is described in much detail. I felt like, at one point, that I was Bambi running for the first time in the meadow, drinking in the warm air. I could hear the dogs barking, the hoofbeats, and the gunshots. I HIGHLY recommend it to nature lovers and fans of the film. Now I just need to read Bambi's Children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bambi - it's not about Disney at all","review":"Don't let the cartoons fool you. This book is an excellent afternoon's read. It is lyrical in its descriptions of both the forest and the animal personalities that abound there. You will no doubt find people you know mirrored through these accounts. I was very much touched by chapter 8 - only mature adults will truly appreciate it! The story is honest and thought-provoking. I recommend it to teenagers and adults. I don't really know that it is good for children to read until they are fairly advanced as it introduces death plainly and touchingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Disney Bambi!","review":"This is a very different book than the Disney movie.I realise at the time that the Disney animated movie caused something of a kerfuffle, since Bambi's mom is shot off-screen. In the book, things only start there. The novel, while well-written, is much more violent than one might expect, and is not especially appropriate for many children under 10.I do not recommend that people run out and buy this novel if their children thought Bambi, Farina, and Thumper were cute, the therapy bills will be astronomical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bambi -- for all ages","review":"I was very young the first time i read this book. I got out of it about the same thing Disney later captured in its movie. But there is so much more to Salten's book than that.I have read _Bambi_ many times, at many ages in my life.

This is pure trash looking for another suck up to buy it. No insight here, just a boring broad with an ax to grind about liberal Americans. Talk about hate mongering...this fool takes the cake. If this is the best and the brightest of the Bush Administration, our Country is in very sad shape...but then, who didn't know that already without reading this paper waste. This crap isn't even worth burning. Recylcle the paper already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Normal? Maybe. Painful? Definitely.","review":"Whoa. Karen Hughes has her own meaning of Normal and she comes off as a happy, well-adjusted woman. Good for her. I liked her honesty in telling her story and feel the writing isn't bad. It's not good--but it's not bad. One expects more from such a self-proclaimed successful former journalist and contributing speech writer for a god.In terms of a good read? Don't waste your time. This book has a single dimension: Unfailing praise for \\"her boss,\\" George W. Bush. She's like a groupie--or like Courtney Cox when she got pulled on stage during a Bruce Springsteen concert--thrust into the limelight and wondering how it all happened to her.It is among the most boring and self-aggrandizing memoirs I've ever read. Glad I only borrowed it from a friend. My apologies to the author. I wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inside Look","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book! It is like having an inside look into the life of our president and some of the people who work closely with him. It is easy reading and very interesting. It is also very inspiring.Happy Reading!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"family values","review":"While being no fan of Hughes, I was concerned when she left the White House. When an administration official says they're leaving to 'spend more time with their families.' is usually code for, 'I'm leaving because of unreconcilable differences'Now we find out that she left the White House to write a book about 'spending time with her family', (which in reality is just cheerleading pap for the bush administration)And she accuses Richard Clarke of political aggrandizement and profiteering?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bio since Lazy B by Sandy O'Connor","review":"This is so warm and witty, I wish I had written it. I also wish I had read it. I can not tell a lie, I have only read about 1/4 of this book while standing at Barnes and Noble. But that quarter was enough to make me fall in love with Karen and her book.I also saw her on TV recently and she is just as charming in person as she is in the book. I have been to Normal, IL, and could just see the trainman saying: \\"Ten minutes to Normal\\".Her intimacy with the president and her closeness to power is probably more genuine than any similar person, and come to think of it, even Condy Rice and Madeline Allbright lack what I will call her \\"Luminosity\\". For some reason, I compare Karen to the 19th Centruy writer E.D.E.N. Southworth in her writing style?I will be back when I have truly read the other 3/4 of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Dr. Laura say?","review":"Surely Dr. Laura must be having a fit, what with Ms. Hughes abandoning her teenagers, causing them to become latchkey kids, just so she can selfishly re-enter the rat race. It's not all about YOU, Ms. Hughes, your role is as a mother to your children. Further, when you stepped down as advisor to the president a year ago to return to your family, it's clear now that you spent all that time writing a book! A book! And now, a year later, the book finished, you're returning to the White House!As Dr. Laura says, children (especially teenagers) are in need of parental guidance, and a stay-at-home mom whose focus is on THEM, not professional aspirations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful communicator, Masterful manipulator","review":"Karen Hughes is a brilliant communicator and master of the anecdote and the parable. For those who have heard Karen Hughes before, this book will not have much of anything new. But I walk away from this book with the same sense I had walking away from her last speech. Be afraid. Be very afraid. This woman is brilliant, a master manipulator, and a fanatic. Her stories truly are masterful, often appearing as though they address an issue, and for the vast majority of Americans who do not stop to think and consider the logic, the manipulation and irrelevance of her story to her point is lost. As a woman, a parent, and a person who cares about having a habitable world, I can only thank God that Bush Jr. is not as smart as Karen Hughes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Mythology about the scion of old money from New England who pretends to be a good ole boy from Texas. She has obviously read her Herr Goebbels. The only way to cut through the illusions spun by this work of propaganda is to hold it in one hand with a collection of the writings of Joseph Goebbels in the other, and compare the two, since her book is so obviously informed by the great master of illusion weaving. It was Goebbels who said:\\"Admit nothing, deny everthing, make counter accusations.\\"Sounds like the Bush administration has absorbed that philosophy to a T."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know Thine Enemy!","review":"Bush's Dominatrix Hughes is a consumate liar and expert at intellectual abuse and manipulation. The ONLY reason anyone should read this book is to \\"know thine enemies\\"!The very idea that my tax dollars pay her salary let alone some moron publisher thought he/she could cash in on the ignorance of the average American is infuriating beyond belief. They KILLED TREES for this bimbo?This dumbed down treatise on her nauseating reveling in her personal arrogance and hubris is a perfect example of why this nation has become so detested around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and clear","review":"This is a ridiculously self-indulgent memoir, not worth the paper it's written on. The fat lady has sung, loud and clear.Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farther from Normal than that...","review":"This book is sinking like a stone on bestseller lists as people come to learn that's it's little more than a salivating lapdog's sycophantic apologia for a failed president. It's normal to look at George Bush and see a liar, a flip flopper, a man who treats war as though it were a video game and is in way over his head in the oval office. What's abnormal is for a reputedly intelligent woman to remain loyal to such a man. Hughes and Condi should join a therapy group!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrisy","review":"A poorly written paean to our Worst President Ever. A cheap suck-up piece.The one thing I learned from this book is that the woman responsible for the \\"John Kerry looks kinda French\\" smears that circulated early in the campaign was herself born in Paris.She looks kinda...Soviet...to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profiteering on insider information","review":"I am troubled that someone would sell a book, trading on their service as a government insider with access to our nation's most valuable intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems like a nice lady, but...........","review":"This book is just too shallow for me. I was hoping for some revelation into the inner workings of George Bush, and got fluff instead. At least she had sense enough to get out of Washington before this inept and totlly corrupt administration took hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure pablum","review":"I spent about an hour with this book at my local Borders. Its all fluff with no clear insight into the thinking and decision making processes of George W. Bush. Perhaps I was expecting too much, and no such processes exist in this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading some of these five star posts...","review":"...I think I'll save my money and wait until she sells the Ten Minutes from Normal book rights to the WB as a sitcom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission Accomplished: Send The Other Kids To War","review":"Hey Karen and George, you volunteering your sons and daughters for duty in Fallujah? Wow, I mean Karen Hughes is such a patriot -- she thinks everyone should fight for her cause except her own family. But what else do you expect from someone's who supposed to be more loyal than the family dog?After reading the book, my question would be how could such a smart woman worship such an ignorant, sheltered, phony that stumbled into being President. Is this the best our country can do, a pampered son of a former President who had a track record of failure in every other past venture? Or how about a corporate crook who sold his shares ahead of a bad earnings report and then failed to file with the SEC? Or how about a drunken driver who very easily could have killed your loved one?In any case, you'll get some clear insight into the mind of a Stepford wife, a blind devotee and true believer in the equivalent of a village idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I just wasted a few bucks on this book, and do I regret it. I voted for Bush in 2000, and I thought this would give me insight to the man. But all I learned is a bunch of wimpy nonsense. Why'd they even bother to write this thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Karen Hughes makes Janet Reno look straight!","review":"This woman is a true political hack.

To equate pro-choice with 911 terrorist is beyond the pale. Let's hope she goes from Ten Minutes From Normal to a Way Way Deep into oblivion and we don't have to ever hear another word of drivel from this shill's mouth ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"PR, PR, PR (stands for pointless rhetoric)","review":"If this book had ONE thing of substance in it, I'd be happy to report. Having known Hughes in a former life, I can testify that she is a master of spin (I think she even believes it herself sometimes). She can write in circles for pages and pages, and this she has done well. But this book has NOTHING of substance in it except perhaps to let the public know that Karen really REALLY likes geo bush and owes him a lot. If this book is her payback, he should be concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Crock!","review":"You know, I voted for Bush in 2000. I supported Iraq. I read this book. It's looking more and more like I made three mistakes, three more than Hughes says Bush has made. This book is nothing more than Hughes showing that she is Bush's cheerleader.If this is how deep this administration is, they've lost my vote. Unfortunately, I can't get back the time I spent reading this claptrap of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"why the book, why now?","review":"a.

A last opportunity to show off her spnning skills in a style of a crossover between a religious fanatic and an used car dealere. All the above"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes P.R. Folks look bad...","review":"It's really a shame that Ms. Hughes did not offer more insight into \\"her boss\\" and the inner workings of her political world. Instead, the book is primarily p.r. spin. While that was her job when working for Bush...one would think she would take a more in depth look once she left the White House. But, she could not get past her P.R. role...here is one p.r. person who really did believe her own press releases. A sad disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a loser!!!!!","review":"Anyone who can compare the ability of women to choose what to do with their lives to 911 and the war on terror is a terrorist herself. Don't buy this book and support this kind of mind set. What the bushies want to take complete control of your lives and to create rules of what we can and can't do.

Boycott her book and book tour!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"I got this from my sister, and just finished it. It is one of the worst politcal books I have ever read. As a republican, I am totally disgusted by these people who are supposed to be representing my party and my country. This whole thing is all about \\"the message\\" instead of improving the state of the country.In a word, it is junk. Whatever happened to real leaders like Reagan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda and junk","review":"Let's see, according to Hughes:1. Pro-choice folks are terrorists2. Only republicans are normal3. George Bush is our best president ever4. This administration is flawlessHere we have yet another attempt to dumb down our country. These are the same folks who left a mess in Texas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Achiever At the Top","review":"Remember the over-achiever in school who asked a lot of dumb questions but thought she was so profound? Well she is here. What's scary is that she is working for the Pres. advising him on what to say and do so he can appeal to the rest of us. Issues don't matter and cricism is baseless. The President and his annointed adviser are on the side of right by dint of their pure hearts, God knows. This is scary stuff. Is the President so insecure that he needs a cheerleader like this at his side? Would he have stopped reading My Pet Goat if Karen had only gone with him on that trip to Fla. It's not what you know that gets you to the top; vapid and selfrightous spin does."},{"rating":"1","title":"drivel","review":"What absolute useless drivel, why anyone would waste time writing this book is beyond me. There is nothing at ALL worthwhile or interesting anywhere to be found in the book.If you want to know about the weather or the scenery on any day you might be interested.If you want to know all the pinch me monuments she had you might be interested.If you want to know how her teenage son was always hunger you might be interested.If you want to know how supportive her husband, family, friends, the dog, the mouse in the garage were, you might be interested.A complete waste of time. I had to give it one star because that's as low as the rating go or it would be negative.To think this women was counsel to the president is truly scary! If she is representative of others giving counsel to the president, is it any wonder that the administration's message is so incoherent and confused.The only good thing about this book is that when you put it down you won't pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for this Bush campaign garbage","review":"This book is nothing more than window dressing for the worst and most dangerous President in the history of this country -- to revive the phony \\"compassionate conservative\\" theme just in time for the 2004 campaign. Incidentally, sales of this book will also put lots of money into the pockets of the author, even though she and her cronies in the Administration are always ready to claim that any author critical of George Bush is motivated only by profit. Save your money -- or better still, contribute it to organizations that support veterans and their families, who are getting the shaft from this government."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"This is a fawning, fan-letter kind of book that used to be published by Bananas Magazine in the 1970's. Only those books used to be about teen stars like Scott Baio and Willie Ames...and they were a lot more subtle and insightful.Karen Hughes thinks God chose Bush to win the 2000 election and \\"come to a royal position for such a time as this.\\"Karen Hughes thinks George Bush is so intelligent that his tongue can't keep up with his brain, thus all his speaking gaffes and inability to give a speech without looking down at his notes every third word.Karen thinks the Harvard/Yale educated, Maine raised son and grandson of prominent Washington DC insiders has a \\"disdain for East Coast elitism\\".Karen must think we are as dumb as poor George's tongue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book raises many questions","review":"I am sure that Ms. Hughes considers herself a Christian woman. She did return to Texas to be with her family and works with youth members of her church. The book leaves me with more questions than answers.What kind of mother leaves her son at Neverland while she trots off to campaign for Arnold Schwarzennegger? Who would allow a youth group to spend time together in a hot tub? What does Laura Bush think of her husband's relationship with Hughes?I will not let my children read her book. Parts of this book are offensive and objectionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Enjoyment Will Depend on Your Views of Bush","review":"I will dispense with my typical, reasoned review style for this book. Whether you should buy and read this book is actually a fairly simple question. Ask yourself this:o) Do you approve of Bush? If so, you will greatly enjoy this loving, insider look at him and his campaigns.o) Do you hate Bush? If so, this book will enrage you, and it's soft-focus view of the President will drive you wild.o) Are you undecided about Bush? If so, decide if the insider look will be enjoyable to you, or if the fact that that this book is too admiring of Bush will drive you wild.Hughes makes no secret of the fact that Bush is Her Guy; whether he is Your Guy will ultimately determine if this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"187 used & new from $0.02","review":"No one should let this book escape perusal, especially at this reasonable price! You've heard that Karl Rove is \\"Bush's brain?\\" Well, Ms. Hughes is \\"Bush's brain on drugs (with a side of bacon)!\\"To read her describe Dubya's mind as \\"laser-like\\" leaves no doubt in my own mind that when she worked for Reagan, she was a conduit for Dubya on the \\"Star Wars - Strategic Defense Initiative\\" project. I don't remember if that was his pre-cocaine or post-cocaine years, but it all makes so much sense now.I'm happy that after a lifetime of one political success after another, she took time off from her busy schedule for a sabbatical to bake brownies for her young, hungry son. I wonder if perchance, she has a recipe for a cake with a file in it?Now that she's back on the team with her traveling road-show thumping America's generosity and love for the rest of the world, I suppose her son will go hungry, but at least America will be safe from those naughty terrorists! Praise da lard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KoolAide Queen","review":"Every president needs his lackys, yes people, and media spinmeisters. Hughes is nothing more than one of these. If you want to read more lies like \\"Bush has never to my knowledge made a decision as a result of political pressure\\" which she said to Terri Gross on Fresh Air the day before he reversed his decision to forbid Rice's public testimony before the 911 Commission, then this book is for you. Most of the rest of the world will give it the \\"Washington read\\": look in the index to see if your name is mentioned, and read what she says about you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Spin?","review":"Karen Hughes book is similar to the writings of any anti-feminist; anti-woman. She gladly takes her backstand to all males- as conservative women do. Her description of GW Bush as having a \\"laser-like mind\\" is laughable and only confirms my suspicion regarding her lack of average intelligence.Anyone who can look at George W. Bush and not see a moron-is a moron herself.Hughes insults not only herself but all women who enjoy an above-average level of intelligence. Dont bother reading it unless you too, have such low self-esteem that you wish to degrade yourself and all women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush knew Sept. 11 was going to happen!","review":"Karen Hughes delivers a walloping new book that places her in the fine company of Leni Riefenstahl. George Bush loves America, but hates Americans. Karen supplants Karl Rove as the real propaganda mastermind in the Bush Administration. After orchestrating the smear campaign against Richard Clarke, she's equating pro-choice supporters with terrorists.Well Karen, as a New Yorker who lived through 9/11 I have just one question. Karen, why does George love the Saudis so much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless hagiography","review":"This book is worthless to anyone who wants to learn about the inner workings of the Bush administration. It is a very badly written hagiography with a lot of fluff thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.And no, I do not believe there was any such child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and Wonderful","review":"All I can say to anyone reading this is: please read this book.

To my absolute core.I was given my copy of this book when I was 17 (I'm 31 at the time of this writing). I have given away countless copies and I buy it whenever I find it, just to share it with another person.I knew Anna dies. It said so in the beginning. But when she died, the means, the way, the reality of it was too much for me. I vaguely recall screaming \\"Noooo!\\" and hurling the book across the room. It was days before I picked it up and finished the last few pages.I felt like I'd lost Anna.But I didn't because she stayed with me. Or rather, her wonderment, her curiosity, her fearlessness.To me this was not a particularly religious story. Odd thing to say. I take this book to mean that you should explore, and question, the world around you. Do not accept the answers you are given. Name things for yourself. Anna chose Mister God. I choose Nature.

I loved this book. I came across it from a reading list for my high school, and it sounded cute. Well, thank (Mister) God for reading lists! This book was great. Anna's theories, principals, and ideas are wonderful. She has gotten farther than most \\"successful\\" human beings in her research, all before the age of 8, let alone even the legal age of 21.

After each reading of this book (more than five times in two years), I have changed some of my attitudes towards God, towards Godliness, towards nearly everything. It is a \\"once in a lifetime\\" kind of book. The sequels to this book are also as good. The drawings of Papas enhance the quality of the book.

Scott Fitzgerald story is one of the best from the series as it captures the attitude of the times, the '20's. The teenagers are all affecting such sophistication. Bernice isn't used to this New York City sophistication, and is painfully shy at first on her visit, but finds herself prodded and pushed. The lesson is eventually learned, the lesson that it's best to be yourself since nobody else can do as good a job at being you as you can.Importantly, the lesson is given to us in a most entertaining manner. One who hasn't become acquainted with Fitzgerald should find this taste of his skills addictive.Well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follows short story perfectly","review":"I'm a high school English teacher and purchased the video to show my students after reading the short story \\"Bernice Bobs Her Hair\\".

I would still say this is a highly entertaining album, albeit a bit uneven. Some songs definitely shine more than others, particularly \\"newlyweds\\", \\"digging my lawn\\", \\"little children\\", \\"how do they know\\", \\"elephant song\\", and the bonus track \\"she is loaded\\". The rest of the tunes are pleasant enough to listen to, but seem more like addendums linking the stronger tracks together. As mentioned earlier, the loose narrative structure of the album ensures that this approach works. In all, this is a very interesting and entertaining album, with very worthwhile bonus cuts (\\"she is loaded\\" is worth the price of the album alone, alternate takes are interesting and quite different). This is a unique one off from a bygone era, one that I'm glad to have in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hookah Lost","review":"Not a bad CD, but lacks the voice and writing capabilities of John Mullins.

But, there is a ton of good information in the booklet with classic photos. The sound is not remastered any better than the last issue of \\"Diamond Dogs and that goes for the 2nd CD as well. I'm not sure why a silly song like, \\"Dodo\\" is here twice or why the K-Tel version of \\"Diamond Dogs\\" is included other than to fill up a disc. The \\"Rebel Rebel\\" (US Single) is a nice version if you don't have it already and the 2003 version is fantastic! If you saw Bowie on the last tour, this is what he sang! But still, this is a collector's edition and does not offer much unless you are a true die-hard fan like me. The truth is I can't wait until Bowie releases his next \\"Live\\" album next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"My aunt went to a yard sale and got some books.

It makes it very frustrating to read. Secondly, the impression you get from reading the book is the effort to discredit the works of MLK. Unbelievably all the book does is to attempt to 'cut him to size' so to speak. This is not a balanced book.It contradicts every book or story told about MLK. I do not recommend this book and wish I could take my money backI hate this book, yes I do"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible for the common man to read","review":"Mr Frady manages to use every big word in the English language, making it nearly impossible for this reader to get past page 25. Here is the final paragraph I read, before giving up in frustration: \\"As an accomodation of those two approaches, he took with huge enthusiasm to Hegel's idea of dialecticism: the continuous process in human understanding and history of a prevailing thesis inevitably invoking a contrary antithesis, the two then forming a synthesis that becomes the new thesis to be countered by its antithesis, an interplay endlessly progressing.\\" I'll find another book to help me learn about the historic figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretty Little Atrocity","review":"This book begins with a sentence fragment arguing that the age of white racism and Southern apartheid seems like ancient history. It ends by implying that it was really all for the best that Dr. King was shot when he was shot, as he was \\"passing irretrievably into decline.\\" The stuff in between these two whoppers is cribbed from a range of authors, all of whom are vastly more qualified than Frady to have written this book for Penguin Lives.Alas, I suspect Penguin is simply engaging in good marketing here. Yuppies buy most of the books, and this one is a perfect ego-stroke to yuppies. It lets you say you know something about MLK, without having your basic worldview challenged by a truthful presentation of his real meaning. Imagine Dr. King living to challenge our economic and political elites over several more decades. If you're smug and dumb enough to believe this wouldn't have mattered, you'll be happy to have Frady's tropes.The book is a serious miseducation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much too fast","review":"I had two years of high school Spanish, and another year in college. When my husband and I started traveling, I wanted to relearn some of my Spanish. Even with the background I had, this audio was much too fast. I have persisted with listening daily, but have not had the progress I would have wanted because relatively difficult and unusable sentences are repeated quickly, then I won't hear them again until I get back to that section of the day in several days(I'm listening on the way to work, so don't back tape up). Some sentences are not translated, and individual words have to be figured out by elimination of the words you already know. This is definately not a beginner course, but may be helpful for someone who had been relatively fluent in Spanish and now wants a review. I am in the search for another (and better) tape, hopefully oriented toward the traveler who will need to make hotel reservations, arrange train travel, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather frustrating","review":"It is difficult to understand quite a bit these CDs.

I found both the Berlitz and Pimsleur courses better than this one. I agree with all the reviewers who didn't like it. This course is too heavy on discussing grammar and vocabulary and not heavy enough on practicing dialogue. It's easier to learn grammar and vocabulary from books. Audio tapes are more useful for practicing dialogue and pronuncation. The section in each lesson where you are asked to respond is too difficult for a beginner, and at the same time not very useful for an intermediate student, and it's much too short. Now I am trying Pasos 2 which at least has more dialogue to listen to, even though the speakers use slang and are difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old news.","review":"It's interesting how Anspach presents all this information on Monopoly's origins as groundbreaking investigation when I read most of it in Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games (published in 1969) and in Phil Orbane's The Monopoly Book (authorized by Parker Brothers, no less). Anspach must have been really out of touch not to have known all of this - which doesn't surprise me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Color","review":"As a watch enthusiast, I can honestly say that one just doesn't find many yellow watches for women, which is what makes this watch all the more appealing. I would like to mention how pleased I am with the St. Moritz company for having the notion to make dive watches for women in as many colors as the watches they make for men. Well done.As for the watch, it's fairly standard. It has a timing bezel and date function, as well as very bright glow in the dark hands. I should mention that I don't scuba dive, so I have never tested the function of the watch at any considerable depth. I do snorkel, however, and so far the watch and the band have stood up well to salt water.Overall this is an attractive time piece. I recommend it for any outdoorsy sort of woman (or child, as another reviewer mentioned that he bought this for his son--I would have loved this when I was a kid) who can appreciate its eye-catching appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Textbook","review":"I really enjoyed this textbook. It is organized well and talks like a conversation. It is easy to read and the author provides lots of examples of the concepts she describes.

The movie was very well acted, and Adrien Brody does a splendid job of interpreting the character of the sadistic Harry. Maury Tierney also stars as the detective out to catch him.

I found it to be quite good. It's fairly easy to read and provides enough detail to give the reader a good understanding of the material.The exercises are challenging enough to be useful, but not so difficult as to leave the reader feeling hopeless. I don't recall coming across many (if any) errors in the text or in the solutions. Perhaps the other reviewers who found lots of problems simply didn't understand how to arrive at the correct answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd never guess it was the seventh edition","review":"The book was full of typos, just do a few problems and check the answers in the back if you don't believe me. I have never seen a seventh edition with so many mistakes. At times it was readable but more often it was not. I thought the last few chapters were very good, however. The flow of material seemed quite logical, but I thought some important things were not stressed enough. I just cannot justify giving this book less than two stars, or more than three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this book","review":"First of all, there are so many mistakes and typos in this book that you will be quite confused reading it. Also, there are very few examples, and many of the numerical answers to the homework are just wrong - sometimes by orders of magnitude! The book may seem deceptively good, but try reading it. I gaurantee you that you will be confused. Some things just do not make sense, not because they are intrinsically hard to understand, but the text was poorly written. He does a poor job with being consistent, which further adds to the confusion. Furthermore, the book is quite dull. If you want to beleive the other reviewer, go ahead and waste your money. There are many other great textbooks out there. I actually rate this book 0 stars. Nobody should have to waste their money buying it and end up suffering as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"This book is lousy. It reads like stereo instructions.

The risks of either being a pirate or serving as a sailor on a merchantman are discussed, as well as the types of ships that pirates normally sailed in. Accounts are also given of the most famous and most successful pirates. I've read many books on piracy, and this is one of the best. It's very well-written with some excellent illustrations. If you're interested in piracy in this time period, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look at piracy","review":"If you're looking to learn more on what real pirates were (most likely you were inspired by the POTC films), then this book is a great place to start. Cordingly very clearly and precisely seperates the truth from the romanticized fiction we all grew to ponder. It's quite an adventerous book that can be as exciting as a fictional film. It is well researched, too. I would suggest that children not read this nor any history book on piracy, however, because real piracy has a very violent and graphic image. They are not these Johnny Depp heroes that we see on the screen, they are far from it. None the less, this is a great book to start your own research on a great age of maritime history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact over fiction","review":"David Cordingly sets the record straight on who the real pirates were, i.e. nothing like the Pirates of the Caribbean Disney franchise. I learned they were despised, dangerous, and very often drunk. Details from every day pirate life, as well as historical adaptations are embellished in narrative style. The introduction was particularly good, giving small examples of actual pirate life and explaining how the pirates became romanticized through poems and novels, with much of our current conception coming from Stevenson's Treasure Island. I would've liked more info on Blackbeard, as well as more description of pirates in the Mediterranean and Pacific. However, despite some details lacking, this book was a great overview of several hundred years of piracy in the Atlantic and Caribbean waters of the Americas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book? Yar!","review":"Errol Flynn, Pirates of the Caribbean and Treasure Island and numerous other cultural sources have given us a popular and romantic version of the life of a pirate. But what were they really like? Did pirates really make people walk the plank? What about hidden treasures and X marking the spot?Under the Black Flag takes an in-depth look at the great age of piracy, focusing mostly on the Caribbean, Eastern United States, the African coastline and Madagascar (Mediteranean corsairs are only briefly touched upon). Major (or rather infamous) pirates such as Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Bonnet, Roberts and minor ones of note are discussed in-depth as examples as to how piracy really was using source material contrasted with the common stereotypes. The book is extremely fascinating and honest, and a book anyone should read who is fascinated by pirates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yarrgh.","review":"Tis a most excellent resource for tales of buccaneers and adventures.

The author does not have a very entertaining style, but his depth of knowledge makes up for any shortcomings. If you are serious pirate fan, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"This book was very informative about how pirates actually lived. It starts out with great stories but drags toward the middle and end with statistical information. The statistical information is good because it gives you an idea of just how prevalent piracy was, it just isn't as engaing a read as the stories in the early chapters. The book also talks at length about pirates in the movies and theater. This can become annoying if you are just interested in the facts. However, it gives great insight into the differeces between the romanticism and reality of pirates. The truth is pirate lives were hard. In general they tended not to live past thirty and died horrible deaths(drowning, shot, or hanging). Their typical career lasted around 3 years, hardly something to envy. Overall, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of western hemisphere pirates","review":"Under the Black Flag touches on every aspect of anglo pirates - myths versus realities, famous pirates and attacks, the sudden demise of anglo pirating, and what it was like to be a pirate or attacked by them. The subject of Oriental pirates was touched briefly, although piracy was and is more prevalent in that region than either coast of the Atlantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool cover","review":"The book is a overview of pirates. I was expecting a more in depth knowledge of some of the more famous pirates. Some interseting facts but not in depth enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"fiction","review":"I am not sure where the author got his facts or if he actually did any serious research elsewhere than on the Disney Channel, but there are so many historical mistakes and misinterpretations in this book that I find amazing it ever got printed. It can be entertaining, as long as the reader has absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about pirates, corsairs or bucaneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pirate book I have found!!","review":"A great history of pirates and the culture surrounding them. It holds your interest with just enough subtle humor to keep you involved but not enough to be cheesy. If you love the Pirates movies and want to know the truth you need this book! I cannot put this book down! I read it at work, I read it in bed! I look at all things piratically now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these shores...","review":"I agree with the previous pans of this book. Ridiculously repetitive, poorly organized, largely dependent on secondary sources, Under the Black Flag has little to recommend it. Cordingly takes an inherently interesting subject- the reality of the Caribbean pirates- and finds a way to make it boring. Furthermore, the ponderous writing style and endless digressions on the image of the pirate in literature, the stage or screen soon overshadow the few good stories the book contains. There have to be better books out there on pirates."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very informative and interesting resource.","review":"I used this book for a research project about pirates. i came up with some amazing information. The writing style is very engaging, making it very exciting book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"If you thought pirates lived glamorous lifestyles while hunting for loot and made their victims walk the plank, think again! And read this book! These are two of the myths about pirates the author dispells.The truth alarming enough! Readers will learn that England encouraged its sailorsto plunder French and Spanish ships and to that end granted pirates letters of marque to legitimize their actions (eventually the government got out of the business of granting letters of marque).The book also reveals that many pirates were indeed barbaric and took no quarter. As England began cracking down on pirates punishment was swift. Many were hanged at Execution Dock along the Thames River.An excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolly Roger of a good book","review":"Cordingly has done his homework on the subject of the pirates. The text is very informative, historically acurate, and an easy read.You will learn all there is to know about these sea rogues. The author seperates fact from fiction that helps paint a clearer picture of those who sailed under the black flag. He dispells a variety of myths that surround some of the most famous pirates including Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. Cordingly takes you back to a vanished age when pirates ruled the seas. You'll journey with them across the oceans and share in their adventures,living the life of a pirate. Tally Ho!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart-Yes ! Gutman-No !","review":"The style of writing of this book is so horrible that I gave it up after some pages. This is a shame because Mozart does not deserve it. I have no doubt that Gutman's intentions were very good. But when a reader struggles to find out or discern the meaning of almost each sentence-this becomes a punishment which he or she has not deserved it. It is better to read the monster volume of Hermann Abert on Mozart. At least he is very clear on the Austrian genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back pedal","review":"I used this book after I completed a week long NCLEX review session to test myself and evaluate if the review was helpful. I scored just as poorly on the practice tests before as after the review course. The questions are outdated and the strategies given to me by the review intructor were not beneficial in taking these particular test questions. I thought some the questions were flawed and the answers sometimes just plain incorrect, as well as typos, which makes one wonder if the correct answers were typos. Also, the rationales are vague and do not fully explain why incorrect answers are incorrect. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent way to prepare for the NCLEX-RN!","review":"I found this book to be an extremely efficient aid to study for the NCLEX exam. The book is written to simulate actual questions on the exam and is set up in a format that enables the reader to test their knowlege in order to focus studying only the areas that you are weak in. The book contains 17 tests of 120 questions each that are selected in the same content manner as the NCLEX exam. I reccomend this book highly in preparing to take the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably great back in the day...","review":"This book is too old today to be useful as prep for the current NCLEX-RN. It was published in 1999. The test was reformatted last year or the year before and is much, MUCH harder than it used to be, so most NCLEX prep books published more than two years ago have questions that are much easier than anything current. The best use for this book is for nursing students who are in the first half of their program, and have not had a lot of content yet. The level of the questions are appropriate for, say, a sophmore in a baccalaureate program. A better choice for someone taking the NCLEX-RN would be just about any NCLEX prep book published in 2005 or 2006. Only buy this book if you are starting a nursing education program and want some basic questions.My other gripe is that although the book boasts \\"over 2,000 questions,\\" many of them repeat throughout the 17 tests.

But, he spent it on the wrong side. Or so it seemed. While Darrow's legal machinations freeing his clients was a travesty, the author built his conclusions on history from the 21st century. By looking backwards, he showed how Hawaii profited from the lessons learned from this famous case. The consequences to the parties was insignificant compared to the growth in perceptions that led to the casting off of the chains of greedy capitalists who ran \\"The Big 5,\\" on the sweat of \\"locals\\" to the respect due all citizens of what became our 50th state. Would this have happened but for Darrow's misplaced brilliance? Probably, but it sure sped things up! Therefore, Darrow's reputation really is untarnished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor Killing","review":"Very detailed book sometimes the author adds facts not relevant to main story. I recommend this books to any one interested in true crime and the setting of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, funny debut","review":"This weddingland memoir takes the modern-day nuptial industry to task with a sense of humor and honesty that is unrelenting. By recounting her own experiences as a bride-to-be, Hana Schank illustrates how the \\"manufactured need\\" pawned by industry magazines, shops and web sites turns perfectly independent and cosmopolitan women (like her) into obsessive denizens of the commercial culture. The author's capacity for self-depreciation not only helps to illustrate wedding excesses and absurdities (she spends weeks tying fancy ribbons for her save-the-date cards), but it makes her a very likable companion for the book's 211 pages. This is a deft and entertaining read, whether you're married, single or somewhere in-between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychodynamics","review":"This was a mandatory book for one of my college courses.

I needed to study the instructions to get it right, and now I have every day programmed, the heat comes on and off twice a day. It's just what I wanted! I only gave 4 stars, because it wasn't obvious to figure out, but once I read it a couple of times, now it's easy to program and override the program, as I want. Very Happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thermostat, despite a few minor programming issues.","review":"As other reviews have mentioned, you have to really take your time with reading all the steps in the manual for programming, not because it is so difficult, but because it takes awhile to understand the overview of the way this thing is programmed and functions. However, once you do, it is VERY good, and and accurate. Warning though - DON\\"T accidently forget to enter the proper day of the week when you first start loading in the data. It is almost impossible to change later! Still, very worth the money and does exactly what it says it does. An excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell RTH7500D","review":"Honeywell makes fine thermostats. This is the second one I bought and installed on two different houses just to save energy. This model was fairly easy to install. I got it because I was replacing a thermostat on a Heat Pump with aux heat. That is a little tricky. I had to read the well written manual three times to get the wiring correct. Two things have happened since the installation, the monthly cooling bill has gone down and the darn thing changed to Daylight Saving Time all by its self! Good unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell RTH7500D - Excellent Product","review":"Had it installed few days ago. It is far better than my old Mercury thermostat. I like the programming feature.

I will order again if I need another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"This is my first programmable thermostat and I just wish I hadn't waited so long to get it.

I loved the description how to disassemble and old one, how to mark the wires etc and how to hook up properly the new one. 30mins later, everything was installed, setup and worked perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works beautifully","review":"This device has saved my apartment from a lot of fights over temperature and power bills.The initial wiring is the hardest part. Make sure you read the entire booklet. When I first hooked it up, I didn't know why the heat wouldn't come on. It turns out there are different settings for heat pumps. If you can't figure out how to wire it, a call to their customer service department will help. I'm pretty sure it's in India, but they have a fairly large database of wiring schemes.Programming the thermostat is fairly simple, once you get the hang of it. The only confusing part is the \\"temperature hold\\" setting. If you want to temporarily change the temperature, it will ask if you want to hold it. Opting to do it will put it on a permanent hold. Opting out will only leave it at the temperature you set for an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell RTH7500D","review":"Product exceeded my expectations.

Only problem was the LCD display looked washed out with poor contrast. I complained to Honeywell who told me make sure the battery was new, connections were secure, no corrosion on any terminal etc. Of course, everything was fine. Then they said remove thermostat from the wall and see if the display improved - i.e. running on battery alone. Nothing changed! So advised me to return the unit to the seller for a replacement. I returned it to Amazon and got a new one. The same poor quality display! I have another Honeywell model RTH6400D(installed on another floor) and its display is fine! When I put them side by side, it is easy to see that RTH7500D has weaker, faded display!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy product, even worse customer service","review":"Installed the product in December...by August the display had failed. Amazon said to contact Honeywell, so I did and it is now September 27th (almost two months later) and I still do not have a resolution to the faulty product! Multiple calls have been made with wait times upwards of 20-30 minutes each time. This product comes with a one year warranty...I guess it is going to take a year to fulfill the warranty claim. As is the case with a lot of American companies, their customer service and technical support lines all seem to be outsourced.If I were you, I would avoid Honeywell all together.

Install was a snap and got it put on the wall in under 10 minutes. I ran into a problem where the original thermostat was bigger vertically instead of being wide. So keep that in mind if you are looking at this or any thermostat. I will have to do a little drywall work to make it look perfect.Setup was a breeze. After installation another 10 minutes and I had it programmed for the week. I walked away, AC kicked on, and this morning I noticed it started automatically adjusting like it should. Extremely easy and straightforward installation and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Honeywell","review":"I looked up several reviews on programable thermostats and decided on this one.

Would recommend though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell RTH7500 works well on my Heat Pump System","review":"I didn't give it 5 stars only because I've only had this thermostat running for 3 weeks now with no hiccups. It's fairly easy to program for each day of the week and can have multiple daily start/stop times, too. I started by opening up the old thermostat while it was operational, writing down all the wire connections,(I had 8) and then emailing that info to Honeywell tech support. They responded within 2 days with the correct wiring for the RTH7500. Installing was easy. Make sure the power is off to the compressor/pump and no voltages are on any of the wires before you install this thermostat. Also, if there is a big hole where the wires come through the wall, make sure you plug it up as best as you can. This could cause your thermostat to turn on more than it should. Hopefully it will have paid for itself by the end of winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great affordable thermostat","review":"After lots of research, finally picked this thermostat. Got for a great price, and decided to buy this instead of the touch screen. The interface was easy enough to use. I installed and set it up in no time at all.One of the features I really like is the temporary temperature setting. While your schedule is running, if you want the temperature to be temporarily higher or lower, you just adjust the temperature, and it holds (i think until the next scheduled temperature change but I havent verified) The schedule is then followed as configured. You can also permanently set the temperature, which will ignore your schedule.Love the thermostat, would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Honeywell RTH7500D","review":"This is my second one Thermostat working excellent and customer service from Honeywell is excellent .Easy to install and setup"},{"rating":"2","title":"programmable thermostat RTH7500D","review":"I had two of these thermostats.

Dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very efficient","review":"It's a decent thermostat if you like to maintain a constant temperature, but you cannot program a temperature swing. That means your air conditioner and furnace are cycling on and off very often to maintain a one degree zone.The biggest strain on the air conditioner is the compressor starting, and this also is less economical because it takes more power to start. Do you notice your lights dim a little when the air kicks on, well these Honeywells cause it to kick on and off way too much.Also if you have an electronic or glow plug type ignition for your Furnace it's the same thing. This all adds up to increased electric use and premature failure of some equipment.I would prefer to let the temperature of my home vary a couple of degrees then have all that on and off cycling. It seems like excessive and unneeded wear and tear on the components to meThis applies to all Honeywell thermostats according to the support request I submitted to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"We got tired of our old mercury switch and decided to go with something nicer local box store had it for 87 got mine on amazon for 50 love the unit"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good!","review":"This was easy to install. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I replaced an old Honeywell thermostat. The system was exactly as was shown in the diagram on the instruction. It was easy to program - I didn't even need to read the instruction. You can program each day 4 separate times (wake, leave, return, sleep). You can program each day differently. Each time you program, you can choose to put a check mark on the days you want the same setting. Then you program the high temp for the cool, and the low temp for the heat. That's it. There is a back light so it's easy to check without turning on the light.This is a must here in Texas where morning temp in the winter so far can be as low as 30 and the high can be as high as 75. We don't need to keep changing the setting to heat or cool because it does it automatically.We love this so much, we're getting a second one for the downstairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell Thermostat","review":"The product fulfilled all expectations.

I was hoping to find something not as expensive as this product but Im sure its the quality of Honeywell. I have a heat pump system with aux heat and I was pretty much limited on which unit I can purchase, not too much out there my system is capatible with. Installation wasn't too bad as the wiring setup is very similar to my ole stat. Never done this before and didnt have too much trouble seting up the wiring, just read the instructions. Not using the smart response it comes on several hours too early to attempt to be at the temp and time you set, I just program it to be running an hour prior the set time to be awake and back from work, should save lots of dough with this stat, luv it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Thermostat","review":"Great thermostat. Have a heat pump with emergency heat, so it dramatically limited the number of thermostats that would do the job. Took the old thermostat off the wall, mounted the new base with wiring, and performed the initial programming before 'snapping' the base and the CPU/Display together. A breeze and much better than the standard Honeywell thermostat it replaced. I recommend this thermostat highly and Amazon was $20 cheaper then purchasing at Lowes. Hard to believe, the HVAC company wanted $500 for this thermostat and the labor to install it. Took about 60 minutes to install and program.

What I did make out was that my thermostat was broken and it was two months out of the warranty period, so \\"please purchase another quality Honeywell product\\".

It's been too cool to test central air but I don't expect a problem.Programmable options that influenced my purchase include: Heat/Cool Manual or Auto changeover, being able to turn off the Smart Response Technology and daylight savings for the 2007 standard.The only minor negative is the backlight can't be turned on as a night light.Overall I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"This was relatively easy. The product came. I installed it the same day. The only thing that gave me trouble were the tiny screws I had to loosen that were attaching the four wires.

It describes the fundamentalimbalance of the pH factor and the differential impact on awhole host of disease processes. The ideal diet should containa fair amount of foods in the alkaline category. Too muchacidity has been associated with many chronic conditions anddiseases. The pH level may stabilize at approximately 5.5to 7.0 on a scale of 0-14 with 0-7 being the acid foodsand 7 or more being the alkaline foods. Our daily dietshould consist of an optimal balance of the acid/alkalinefoods. The Baroody work describes this pH balance in considerabledetail. As such, it is a necessary part of the overallnutritional program for both children and adults.The standard diet of junk food tends to create a pH biaswhich is acidic rather than a representative balance ofacid and alkaline food groups. This aspect is further developedin the book. As such, Baroody's work is a valuable supplementto your nutrition planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"alkalizing made easy","review":"This was the only book, of all the books on this subject that I read on the subject of acid/alkaline, that clearly organized the variious foods and made it easy to locate them in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an informative book.","review":"I'm disappointed in the content. The subject is one I'd be very interested to get more information on. But, this book does not come through with any facts that I can take seriously.

I don't normally change my opinions or reviews however I was wrong in my first assesment. I do drink Kangen Water and love everything about it and what it has done for me.

The name of his book, \\"Alkalize or Die\\", is in itself a marketing scare tactic. As in similar books, I don't see much in the way of hard data to back up the claims made. There are a few pearls, but mostly sand, in this slim paperback. Most of the foods mentioned as being acid-reducers are known to be good for you anyways. I just don't see anything revolutionary. The last 37 pages of the book, the guy is trying to peddle questionable alternative health products. Clever marketing scheme, first I will scare you into buying my book, then I'll sell you a bunch of products to 'save' you from dying.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give less than one star if possible!","review":"I think for those people who gave this book a good review, they are new to the alkalize train and were not aware that this book is nothing more than in infomercial that does not give any more information than most web sites.

It doesn't try to be anything more than that, which is good - it doesn't have to be. September comes through in track after track with beautiful vocals and a strong, steady beat. I've listened to this CD many times since getting it, and I enjoy it every time.If you listen to dance music at all, chances are you've already heard \\"Satellites\\" and \\"Cry for You,\\" two of the standout singles from this album. Those songs were why I bought this CD, and they're as good as ever, but they're matched (and sometimes outdone) by the other tracks. The songs that really impressed me were \\"It Doesn't Matter,\\" \\"Looking for Love,\\" and \\"Sacrifice.\\" In each song September's voice comes through like a clear crystal bell, accentuating rhythms that make you want to move.I can put this CD on and whatever else I'm doing, I suddenly feel a little like I'm dancing the night (or day) away.

It's clear that John Sayles cared about getting the music for this movie set in bayou country right, and that he selected the music with the same care that he uses in crafting his films. The soundtrack includes a range of great uptempo Zydeco tunes as well as some haunting Cajun melodies by some of the best performers in these genres. Other songs included on the CD that were done for the soundtrack fit right in with these Zydeco and Cajun greats, unlike some soundtracks where the \\"soundtrack\\" stuff is just filler. The only bum track on the CD is the last one, Bwana's Garden, on which the CD first loses its authentic and rootsy feel and veers into bland Cajun-inflected pop territory. Definitely a good addition to any Cajun music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent insights for parents and teachers","review":"The author provides those of us who are not LD with a view into his world and the perspective from which he approaches life and learning.

I am interested in the subject, and you do learn more about what the world is like for a learning-disabled individual. It is amazing that this guy could write a book at all, even with a lot of help! Unfortunately, he doesn't appear to have had access to any kind of editorial services, so reading it is like reading a 200-page freshman essay: painful.

Even though all the songs except that one are in Russian, it is a VERY enjoyable disc! I would highly recommend it. His vocals are smoky, but pure and the sound of his singing in Russian adds to the exotic feel of the music. I went ahead and bought a DVD of his, too (haven't received delivery, yet), since I enjoyed the visuals of his performance during that one song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - broken after 1 fall off the table.","review":"My son was extremely excited to get this toy. He saw one at a relative's house a couple months ago, and he couldn't stop saying \\"Ninja Wheelie Time\\". On Christmas morning, we even heard him on the monitor saying it before we even got out of bed. To his surprise, Santa had gotten him one. The orange one. Just what he wanted. But after only about an hour of playing (and he's not really rough on his toys) he decided to push the button while it was on the kitchen table. It rolled off and to its death. From that point on, none of the buttons work. It's still, lifeless, and quiet. Physically, it is pretty sturdy. Even the \\"training wheels\\" that keep it standing appear to be made of metal. But the thing that makes it SO COOL to kids, the electronics, the wheelie, the noise of the engine, are cheap. And they broke much too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for any level, filled with nice projects","review":"This is a fantastic book for the craftsman of miniature furniture and room settings.

All the songs are perfectly toned down, of course, to a slower and more soothing musical beat, but fans can still reconize their favorite singles.

But we have a new house and it replaced a basic digital thermostat. The BIG annoying factor is the intuitive program that calculates how long it takes to heat or cool, so therefore it has it to the desired temp for the designated time. BUT for me, I wanted to save money so I want it off during the day and off at night. But I find that it is on for HOURS before it is supposed to turn on. I wished it was simpler and would turn on when I want it and be off when I want it. It's not saving me a dime in my utilities.

If Tayler makes you uneasy, Conrad will make you gasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book you get after a born stylist has risked his life.","review":"I read Facing the Congo several months ago, and finished it within three days, a rare thing for me, someone who sets a high bar for the style of what he reads. The story itself, of Tayler's trip with a local guide down one of the deepest, widest and most violent rivers in possibly the world's most dangerous country, guarantees interest, but it is his honesty about his reasons for taking the trip, and his varied and surprising writing, that make it a joy to read. One moment that stuck out for me is when Tayler and his guide are camping in the brush on the bank of the Congo, which is so wide and deep it seems to have tides, and in the black of night a storm breaks out and the river \\"turns into a violent negative of itself\\" when lightning strikes. There are dozens of such moments and but reading them without the book will not do them justice.I read a lot of travelogues, and this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a kick butt read","review":"This book is an intense good read.

Her laid-back, casual, writing style is personal and unpretentious. In a very readable and usable format, she offers an approach to ritual that is remarkably personal and effective. She shares with us some ways to love/learn/listen/understand our bodies more deeply and grow into the fullness of which we are capable. She invites us to explore our heart and to become our best lovers - She shows us how this powerful Magick is always available and in us always - Best of all she shares with us how to use this Magick once harnessed.I highly recommend this book. I will however caution that readers may require some measure of comfort with their own sexuality or at least a willingness to be open-minded about exploring this aspect about their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Get in touch with your inner sexy with this book.

It's not the kind of book I would usually read, but it was free, so I thought I would give it a try. After the first chapter, I was hooked! Nassise has created a character, Cade Williams, that immediately attracts the reader and makes you want to know more. The writing style is definitely \\"male military adventure,\\" and there's an occasional awkwardly chosen word or turn of phrase, but overall, it was well written, the characters are believable and interesting, and the premise (what would the Templar Knights be like in the modern-day world) is unusual and, I thought, well presented.

I wonder if it is worth finishing. The blurb sounded interesting, and initially the main character seemed interesting. I wanted to like this book, but as I read, the chance of that gradually diminished.I think the idea has potential, but the writing needs to be both cut and expanded, contradictory as that may sound.The thing is very wordy, partially due to the excessive use of progressive tense (i.e., sentences with endless strings of verbs ending in \\"ing\\"). The prose is often overly melodramatic. There is tons of description that really isn't necessary to move the story along. This is the sort of stuff that could be cut, especially during the agonizingly slow (and lacking in tension) action sequences.The characters could be more fleshed out, and some of the plot elements reworked to make them less cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Templars Taken to the Next Level...","review":"I finally got a chance to sit down and read this book, and all I can say is...WOW, what an amazing conglomeration of fact, fiction, legend and lore this book represents...If you are looking for historical Templars, you won't find them here. Other than a few paragraphs to set the background for the premise of the story, the task the Templar protagonist in this book is assigned is more akin to a \\"supernatural\\" search and destroy mission, than a purely military operation.This series has great potential; if you enjoy a fast-paced action-adventure novel (with a hefty dash of the macabre thrown in for good measure), then I recommend this novel highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure how this made it into my 'Historical Fiction' list.","review":"It's definitely fiction, but except for using the 'Knights Templar' as a stepping off point it had nothing to do with History.

When it worked, it was very nice. Ground lots of pepper with little effort, and I liked the lid thing that kept grounds from getting everywhere.However, the grinding mechanism would loosen itself slightly with each grind, so your pepper became progressively more coarse if you forget to readjust. The mouth to refill the pepper container is also quite narrow, so refilling takes longer than it needs to (though is not very hard).Then one day, after 5 months of moderate use, the pepper mill broke mid-grind as I was making breakfast. I gave it a couple rotations to see what was going on, and the grinding element and a load of pepper corns came streaming into my eggs. The apparatus that holds the grinding element in place inside the grinder is made of plastic, and it cracked in half.Not happy with the durability of this product.

When I called customer service about the recorder, which was purchased in December of 2004, all they could offer was $80 for labor and I pay shipping to California. What a joke! I can buy a new one for less than that. They make their products with either inferior parts, or inferior design schemes. After the 90 day full warranty is over, they will not last much longer.

What starts out as a simple French and Indian War tale of a daring raid on the St. Francis Indian village by Major Robert Rogers, eventually spans North America, Europe and the Mediterranean. Roberts' descriptions of wilderness warfare and survival bespeak his excruciatingly thorough research and knowledge of eighteenth century America, to the point where you might wonder if he was actually there. His battle scenes are unsparingly violent and brutal, even by today's standards, but the whole novel is infused with a quaint romanticism, that is usually avoided in modern literature. In Robert's works, warfare is bloody, and politics unsavory, but noble spirits and strong hearts prevail. Anyone who likes historical fiction, art history, or adventure travel, would do well to start with Northwest Passage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spencer Tracey Movie Misses, Book Doesn't!","review":"If you have seen the Spencer Tracey version of the movie then you must read this book.

Stunning detail and well done characters really get the reader involved in the story mentally and emotionally. I actually felt like I was traveling along on the adventures of the Rangers because of the excellent writing abilities of the author. I was actually sad when I read the last page knowing my adventures with the Rangers and the lead character Langdon were at an end.

The author claims the stories philosophy originated in Tibet. All the teachings such as crystal gazing, aura reading, and astral projection are unorthodox meathods and have no validity to Tibetan Buddhism which condems such practices as distractions to the true objective of enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhism recognises such practices as western occultism seeking eastern influences, much like Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening Journey","review":"I found this book to be very insightful although I am not an expert on Tibetan religion or philosophy. It is an enjoyable read and rather thought provoking in areas. What if????? Cave of the Ancients is a story about one man's journey, not a complete guide to the Tibetan way. I recommend reading it and deciding for yourself. Analyzing a book completely destroys the context. A book is to be read, absorbed and then digested. Everyone's interpretation is different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"The book was in Okay condition.This is a must read book.This is a journey with Lobsang through his education in the Tibetan monasteries.I actually visited the monasteries after reading so, I could really relate lot of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH MY SECOND READING","review":"I read Lobsangs books in my late 20's and remembered them well I thought.

Most of these short stories were about strange appearances of someone or something or strange disappearances of people or things. As far as I could tell there weren't any aliens or supernatural life involved in any of the short stories. These kids in every story just seemed to happen upon something while they were moping because they were depressed or angered about their \\"destructive\\" families. The even weirder part was that at the end of the story, after all of their strange happenings most of them were still sad and/or upset. Oh and if you were wondering this is in the genre short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnaflow 15881 Review","review":"I have had the following exhaust setups on my 2007 Mustang GT (beyond the stock setup):1.

From warp engines to wormholes, from teleportation to tractor beam's, Dr. Lawrence Krauss explains how these marvels might and might not(!!) work within the constraints of the universe as we understand them today. Dr. Krauss credits Star Trek's writers not only with getting much of their science right (at least in theory) but also with frequently making up terminology which is prescience in its accuracy. (Who would have thought that \\"anyons\\" really exist.) In addition to pointing out the most egregious of the gaffes like sound waves in space and the subtle problems of quantum theory, Dr. Krauss also enumerates the mind-boggling magnitudes of energy that warping space and beaming folks around would consume. All in all a quick, fun read, especially for the \\"hard\\" science fiction fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly dry and tedious.","review":"I had high hopes for the book after hearing the author on the radio but I found the book to be really heavy on physics and lacking in references to Star Trek. Einstein's own writings are lighter and more enjoyable to read. I recommend the Technical Manual instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plausibility","review":"This text is very enlightening for the Star Trek viewer. It gives technical answers to questions concerning warp, transporters, worm holes and other technology and phenomena that do not have the opportunity to be addressed on camera.

His interpretation of how warp drive works for instance is not even close to how it really works. And all his assumptions on the technology is using modern day physics, which is portrayed by the author as the absolute truth to the universe. 500 years ago it was impossible to circumnavigate the earth, 50 it was the sound barrier, I suprise a scientist would say that anything(such as warp drive) is impossible no matter what improvement in physics. If you want a book on physics, get a brief history of time, if you want a book on star trek get the tech manual, just don't get this book for either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trekers Delight","review":"This is a most awsome book!!!

Many parts are clichéd, the only crime in this being that the clichés do not even seem to connect with the writer on the level suggested, let alone a reader. I thought Kahn used too many words; conveyed an expectation of the reader to devour and accept rather than to read. The entire collection screams 'read me, analyze me!' but analysis proves disappointing. Not poor, but I definitely thought the work was 'trying to be' rather than just being. Perhaps he writes too close to home."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"this book is really dull... sorry, just had to say it. a complete bore, no poetic passion.. a tiring, sleepy pretentiousness may be a good way to describe kahn's book.

All three of these books are over 50 years old, and can seem dated in their prose style [not a problem for me - maybe since I am also over 50], but the material is very fresh and timely, if a bit depressing.

The book will show you the change of Japan as the most important market and the portal to Asia into new era, but will tell you the principle of multicultural marketing that has not changed, as well.

One of the best features is that it grinds from the top, so it is no-mess. The design is compact & simple yet modern ... an added plus.I combined this with the matchingOlde Thompson 5-1/2-Inch Bavaria Peppermill. The salt mill is superior to the pepper mill, but you still can't go wrong with the pair. 5*!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I went to Target which has the bigger version of this in stock.

You look in the owners manual for instructions on changing the flat. The manual says, \\"there is a jack and lug wrench in the car for changing tires.\\" Nothing more. This example relates to many sections of the book. Take, again for example, \\"Kudzu Hardware Detection\\" on page 286. This section states that Kudzu detects your system hardware each time you start Fedora. Okay, so what if it doesn't? Not a word on how to make it run, how to make it detect hardware, or what to do if it fails to detect. This lack of real information is repeated throughout the book.

It's apparent this book was produced at the behest of someone other than the author herself. Normally, she fills her books with thoughtful and apt turns of phrase, showing us the highs and lows of various lives, coloring and shading with rich dialects. While this book has the characters we've come to know, it rings hollow. It's a shame, too, because I felt a real let down while reading the book. I'm halfway through it and don't really have the inspiration to finish.

Perhaps you feel that you have been there, done that in previous works dealing with Mitford. You will not be disappointed for there is absolutely nothing new or added in this book.

I do hope that the author will eventually get back to the story and I do not anticipate buying the two books coming out this fall(\\"Father Tim's Favorite Quotes\\" and \\"The Mitford Snowmen: A Christmas Story\\" unless one of them actually continues the story of these most beloved characters.

It was a very weak story that should have unfolded two books back. It had no indepth description of her characters as her previous stories had. I was looking foreward to catching up with all the characters I had grown to know and love only to find the book a complete dissapointment.

We came to care about Dooley, Father Tim and Cynthia, and even Barnabas, the dog. Jan Karon's new book, A Common Life: the Wedding Story, is a poor excuse for a book. It serves up cardboard characters, very little plot, and a rehash of what we've already read in the previous books. It even calls into question Cynthia's sanity. In previous books, she was portrayed as endearingly unique, but in this book she doesn't even take the time to comb her hair before her wedding. Does that sound like normal female behavior? While this book measures the same size as its predecessors, the actual printed page is much smaller, easily read in one sitting. It makes one wonder how they dare ask ... for such a sparse volume.

Hopefully, it there is a next book, it will leave me feeling warm & fuzzy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I feel that the entire content of this book would have made an extra chapter in the one to which it relates. There is not much that is new here. All of the new information, if extracted, would take up 25 pages (without the art work). There is so much border art, it is obviously intended to take up space & make the book look longer. Jan Karon has a very faithful following for the Mitford series. I am disappointed that Ms. Karon thinks so little of her readers, that she would trick them into buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for commmercial purposes?","review":"Having read all the previous books of the Mitford series, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the latest installment. When I learned it was to be a prequel telling the story of the wedding, I became a bit concerned. After reading The Wedding Story, I must say that I consider my concern justified. I found the book boring, disappointing, and frustrating. There was no new information, no mystery, no conflict. It was obviously written quickly and did not require much creativity. I can only conclude that Ms. Karon wrote it to capitalize on the previous success of the series -- this is, to make money and to appease fans who were tired of waiting for the next installment. I, for one, am far from appeased. This book did nothing to further the Mitford series or, in my opinion, Ms. Karon's reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely novella!","review":"Jan Karon did a wonderful job of tying this novella into her series of Mitford books. I loved reading about how romance had found its way into the lives of so many of the other characters, as they recollected their own loves and romances. I also believe that the main characters of Father Tim and Cynthia were developed even further, as Jan Karon gave us a glimpse of their deepest fears and hesitations even as they celebrated and anticipated their wedding day. I started crying around about page 67 and didn't really stop until the end, and the reading of it only took a couple of hours. This book was never touted as a continuation of the series, but rather a novella and an additional joyous piece of Mitford. I'm looking forward to the cookbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"I was anticipating the arrival of book six...what a disappointment. First, take note that it does not pick up the story where we left of in the fifth book...it is confusing to stick this book in the middle of the series and make the reader go back in time.

Please, hurry and get the \\"full\\" novel finished, so we can once again revisit the town of Mitford. P.S. The picture of Jan Karon on the back cover was almost startling to me! That is almost exactly how I pictured Cynthia to look, in my imagination!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down ...","review":"Though the book claims to be in the 180 page range, it's really much less with its HUGE margins and blank pages separating the chapters. It skips around A LOT -- doesn't cover the whole summer that they're engaged and says NOTHING of the actual reception. Which could have been such a pleasure to read! The only good part of the book is the deeper look into Cynthia that you get. If you're a diehard Mitford fan, you're going to buy it no matter what. Just DON'T expect Karon to keep up her track record. And it seems it'll be quite some time until we get another Mitford like we expect -- in the spirit of J.K. Rowling, Karon will be publishing two mini books this coming Fall which will only take away from the next full size Mitford novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Extraordinary to \\"Common\\"","review":"A Common Life was just that - nothing extraordinary here. I was so eager to have this next book that I purchased it without doing my homework. All the reviewers who expressed disappointment were correct - this looks like Jan Karon sold out. She wrote a short, quick, easy story (the plot was already crafted in a previous novel), just to get the income. Though I had been eagerly awaiting the next in the series, I would certainly have waited longer for a quality book. If you are compelled to read it - at least wait for the paperback, this book is not worth it.What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really disappointed!","review":"I bought this book without opening it. I love all of the others and I was anxious for a little more Mitford. The margins are large, there are a lot a blank pages in this book -- and -- it is extremely \\"wordy\\". It appears that Jan Karon needed to turn in a paper for her \\"middle school\\" English class and it needed to have a certain number of words. She must have opened her thesaurus periodically to just write down descriptive word, after word, after word. This book was definately NOT up to the standard of the others. I would not buy it - check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. It is NOT worth adding to your book library with the other Mitford books. Trouble is, now I'm not sure I want to buy her next book - I'll have to read the reviews first next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad disappointment","review":"Like many others, I, too, was terribly disappointed with Jan Karon's latest episode from wonderful Mitford. I did want to read about wedding trials, tribulations and joys of Father Tim and Cynthia, but found a lot of white space and fluff instead.And I also found a glaring mistake. When the second novel ended with the publishing of the banns for the couple, the Main Street Grill had been forced to close due to rot in the basement. Ms. Karon seems to have forgotten this as the Grill was going strong as A Common Life begins. It would not have been open again for two months. Shame on the editors and on Ms. Karon for missing this important detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pause that Refreshed","review":"Jan Karon promised her fans a novella about the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia and she has delivered a keepsake to be treasured!

I can hardly wait for the next volume in the Mitford series! Hurry Jan, write faster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ug!","review":"Fortunately for me, I was able to read this book between book 2 and 3 and not at the end of the series as so many disappointed readers have. Too bad that didn't help make this a worthwhile read. I noticed that the page numbers were obscured by a clever scroll put over them; an attempt to hide the scant number of them no doubt. Heavy paper stock, wide margins and large type makes this short story SEEM like a novel but it clearly is not. I will finish the series glad that the worst of them is behind me. Rehashed events and lengthy prayers do not a novel make. Borrow, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karon disappoints this time.","review":"A Common Life was a big disappointment after loving the rest of the Mitford series. Seems like Karon threw together a new book to capitalize on recent success. A Common Life lacked the familiar details of the characters we had come to know and love. The first five books in the Mitford series were wonderfully detailed about the community of Mitford and its residents. A Common Life wasn't a horrible book just a quick and simple read. If you don't already know and love the Mitford characters, don't bother with A Common Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I didn't particularly mind that this book was \\"out of sequence.\\" What I did mind, however, was the quality...or more to the point, the lack thereof...of the writing.

This really was an appalling piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated!","review":"I have loved the Mitford books and eagerly awaited the latest one. It arrived today and I've already read it!! I have the feeling that Jan Karon felt pressured to come out with another book but didn't want to spend the time to really develop a plot, so she simply rehashed what we've already read. The story of the proposal, the wedding plans and the wedding are sweet and it's nice to revisit the familiar characters, but I felt she churned out something with the least amount of effort possible just to get it done. I was ready to learn more about the lives of all the people we've come to know and love and what they're doing now, not going back and devoting a whole book (I say that with a wink) because this book is more like a short story.

I was excited to find a new book in the Mitford Years.... but then to glance through it and see it is a rerun of what has already happened. I for one did NOT purchase this book. I love Jan Karon's writing style, but am uncertain why she would allow this book to be released two years after Tim and Cynthia's wedding had been in publication.

It wasn't as good as the other 5, but I did enjoy it. We go back in time to the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia and how he proposed to her. Jan Karon is such a talented writer, and as usual I hated to see the story end. If I were going to complain it would be that the book was too short. I was listening to it on Recorded Books Audio and out of the blue the narrator said, \\"the end\\". I was so surprised as there was still one whole tape left to listen to (which ended up being an interview with Jan Karon). If you have read the other 5 novels about Mitford then this book is a must, but a reader might not get much out of it if they start with this book.

I love weddings and this story was all about planning and attending a wedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Father Kavanaugh: A mush-puppy?","review":"After being thoroughly delighted with the Mitford series and it's refreshingly innocent view of American \\"down home\\" culture, I was thrilled to hear that another book had been added to the \\"middle\\" of the series. However, my disappointment was tremendous when I read the book. The characters are transformed from real, likeable people into insipid, romantic mushers. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemies! I hope Karon's next efforts revert to her previous talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was so excited to get this book and settle in with the characters from Mitford. How disappointing this book was. Dooley was back to 12 years of age! This book lacked the usual warmth that I enjoyed in all the other books. It was hard to read about Miss Sadie, knowing that she had died! Don't purchase this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!!!","review":"Clearly Jan Karon was trying to satisfy Mitford followers with a new book. I feel ripped off! She should continue the story lines instead of looking back on a given event.I hope she will see fit to honor her loyal followers with a good #7 book picking up where #5 ended. I'm still trying to understand the Hallmark hype with snowmen, even names Murphy, Bucket Head etc. when no such things ever existed in the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this was marketed as a book vs a short story","review":"This is a major disappointment. Expecting to savour something special I instead discovered a \\"short story\\" and small review of past events. How could these publishers put this out as a book- maybe it could have been a \\"novella\\"- then it would have had more than a paragraph per page of large print!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's missing in this book?","review":"Like millions of others, I have read all the Mitford books (twice actually) and so when I first learned that the next one would be published in April, I pre-ordered it. I thought the cover was beautiful, but there was something missing...the plot. There isn't any story here. After reading it I didn't feel as if I knew the characters or the town any better. There were people we know and love missing from book..surely they would have been at the wedding. The next time we meet, Ill be expecting a lot of news and stories from Mitford!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A MONEY MAKER????","review":"I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS BOOK CONTAINED SO LITTLE SUBSTANCE.

I have so loved the Mitford series, this new book read too quickly with no substance, even though the Wedding was left out of earlier books, I anticipated this to be about Dooley and Lacey and their wedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S GOING ON WITH JAN KARON","review":"I love the Mitford series. I recommend them to everyone. I, like most people, were left out when there was very little mentioned of the wedding in her last book. Unfornateley, this book left me very dissapointed. She really should have included the wedding in the last book. There was no plot. It only gave daily descriptions of what the characters were doing. There was no story line, or a plot. I kept feeling like Jan Karon, just hurry up and get to the wedding. Everything else was filler. I am so glad that I got this at the library and didn't waste my money on it. I will still look forward to her other books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not up to Jan Karon's usual standards","review":"I read all five of her first books and absolutely loved them. I was so excited to see another come out that I ignored the reviews and ordered the book immediately. Having just finished the book, I walked away wanting. This latest look into the life of Father Tim didn't have nearly the character that the first five books had. The citizens of Mitford were barely visable and I really don't understand why Ms. Karon chose to write the next volume smack in the middle of two previous books. I didn't miss the wedding when I was reading the other five. I would have much more enjoyed to know what Father Tim and his followers are up to now. It seems like Ms. Karon didn't put much thought into this book. She just pumped it out to keep her readers happy. This certainly won't stop me from buying the next book. I just hope that Ms. Karon gets back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrary to others, I loved it...","review":"Okay, so this wasn't a long missive about our beloved Mitford and its wonderful inhabitants.This was a glimpse into a brief moment in the life of Father Tim and Cynthia Coppersmith and their joyous wedding.Maybe the story was published out of order and maybe it was too short but to me, any story of Mitford is better than none.After reading this little book in one sitting, I felt even closer to Father Tim and the love of his life....and I felt a deeper understanding of Father Tim's spiritual life.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan Karon does not disappoint!","review":"Jan Karon proposed (no pun intended) this book to be something different than the previous \\"Mitford\\" books. And different, it is. Jan Karon's style is prevalent, as is the charm of the characters in Mitford, but is an intendedly uni-dimensional story covering events surrounding the wedding. Everything is as Jan Karon promised - no more and no less. Thank you Jan, for creating a marvelous place that millions of people love. I look forward to every word in every book, regardless of margin widths or length! 5 stars, hands down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book in about an hour and a half. The story added little to developing the wonderful characters I've come to love through the other books.

The Mitford Series was delightful and I was so looking forward to Jan Koran's new book, but I am highly disappointed that events are repeated. Dooley went off to college in the series. This book takes you back to where Dooley is a young boy living with Father Tim and wondering how he will feel about the marraige.Deja vu! Been there and done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHECK out this book!","review":"Thank you, reviewers, for the great advice of checking out this book from the library, rather than purchasing it! I, too, am a great fan of Jan Karon; one who has purchased her books as gifts for friends and relatives; however....this book is a simple \\"easy read\\" which, I am grateful, I got it from our local library, and not a bookstore!! Please, please Jan Karon, bring back Fr. Tim and Cynthia to Mitford--let us know how Dooley and his mom and the other parishoners are doing!! We love your books, and want to keep reading about the adventures in MITFORD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish that I could have given this one a zero!","review":"I have been an avid Mitford and Father Tim fan since the first wonderful volume. My disappointment in A Common Life is tremendous. why was this rerun even written? I sincerely hope that Jan Karon's Muse has not died. However, judging from this sappy retelling of a wedding that took place volumes ago her muse is indeed gone. I hope that it returns soon, for I am a true lover of all things Mitford. Jan, I sincerely wish that you could explain what has happened here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not up to the standard of the rest of the Mitford series. Lacks an exciting story line. Strictly for those readers who like wedding stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy read!","review":"I enjoyed my visit into Father Kavanaugh's little world once more. He was enchanting and winsome....Cynthia was sweet...and they both deserved each other. This is how love should be. And the other characters were believable in their behavior....Jan Karon takes us into their thoughts....jealousy, dislike, infatuation, insecurity, stubborness...those very human emotions.While I enjoyed the story very much, I think \\"The Common Life\\" would have fared better written in two or three chapters of another story. Entertaining though it was, it lacked the richness of the preceding \\"Mitford Years\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The marriage =","review":"Finally Father Tim is saying his vows - what a lovely story.

Very pleased and will use this web site again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life","review":"I fell in love with the Mitford Series and thought of Father Tim and the rest of the town as family. When this book came out, I raced to the book store anticipating another great book - I was so disappointed - I wish she had included this within the series - I didn't like going back (Miss Sadie had died already) I wish it had just continued from the island and included more of Dooley and what happened to him. I really hesitate to buy the one about snowmen - So sad in Indy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"After listening to and enjoying the audio tapes of the Mitford series on my way to work every morning, I was really disappointed in \\"A Common Life\\". Too much thinking from the characters and not enough story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book was a major disappointment - I considered it \\"filler\\" and not much more than a rehash of the prior books. I really expected more after waiting so long for a new book. The book could have been written \\"in order\\" and would have made a great deal more sens."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment - not up to par...","review":"...okay, so Jan Karon said to expect a 'novella' rather than a full blown 'novel'. But, I found that this was a total letdown. The soul, richness and depth inherent in the other Mitford books is lacking in \\"A Common Life\\". Like many others, I preordered this book - not only for myself but for my mother and mother-in-law as well. I took my copy along on a trip to the UK, hoping that it would last me the trip - only took a few hours to read.Something else I missed - the wonderful illustrations that are so much a part of the earlier books. The bouquets throughout the book are nicely done, but I would have liked to see Cynthia, Fr. Tim, Dooley, Barnabas, etc. decked out in their wedding finery!Of course, most Mitford fans will purchase this book regardless - but I suggest you wait and get it at a much lower price. This book should have been list priced at less in my opinion. What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Karen fails Father Tim and his readers","review":"Having read the first book of the Mitford Series in 24 hours and the next four within two weeks, I preordered \\"The Wedding Story\\" months in advance. What a disappointment!! It appears that Ms. Karon has succombed to money and making her publishers happy by pumping out a book rehashing old topics and leaving the reader wanting. Her advertisement at the end regarding a book of Father Tim's favorite quotes further fuels the impression that she's on a capitalistic turn rather than a literary one. PLEASE give us more of the good father and his adventures!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so disappointed! Why did she bother, oh yes, $$$$","review":"This is the laziest way to write a book I've ever heard of. Jan Karon has more integrity than this, please restore my faith in a great author. Write a \\"BOOK\\" not an epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and sappy","review":"Though I love the Mitford series, this one is a waste of time. Additionally, while I found the other books in the series quaint, I found this one just plain sappy. I hope Ms. Karon takes the time to write an interesting book next time, rather than selling out to her publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get DUPED","review":"Jan Karon is capitalizing on the success of the series to put out books in the SERIES that don't take place after the latest plot developments. If you know someone who hasn't read the series, recommend they read this book in succession."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disapointed","review":"I too was hoping for a longer story but it was after all, just supposed to be about Cynthia and Tim's wedding. I did enjoy reading how each of the townspeople prepared for their part in the wedding, even if they were just part of the congregation. I hope the next book in the Mitford series will be back to its usual length and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"I had truly enjoyed the Mitford characters in the first 5 books and anxiously waited for this book's release. However, as other reviewers have stated, I too bought the hardcover thinking it was a continuation of the other books. This book reads like a marketing ploy ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book, but expensive","review":"I knew what the book was going to be about, and did enjoy the story, but felt that for $20+ list price, it was rather expensive for such a small book. (Yes, the graphics were beautiful, but I'd rather have had a smaller price tag and less artwork.) If I could, I'd give it 4 stars for story and 1 for value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"It is hard to believe that Jan Karon needs money badly enough to have written this book. It is the only reason I can derive for what is an elaboration of a story line from a previous book. After eagerly awaiting the publication of a new Karon book, to say that I was disappointed is an understatement. Like other fans, I hope that a true installment of the Mitford story is in the works. If Karon yields to commercializm, in the vain of Grisham and other popular authors, she has lost this, here to fore, devoted fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff!","review":"I ordered 4 copies prepublication, for myself and three friends who are devotees of the series. Next time I will wait until I can peruse a copy before ordering! \\"Common Life\\" is closer to novella than novel, with its double spacing and chapter illustrations attempting to stretch a work rather lean on true material. I was disappointed that it did not further the Mitford saga, but merely expanded on a small retrospective piece. I hope Jan Karon has a more substantive novel in the works for her fans, or her following will greatly dwindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"What a waste of time. Pressure to publish? Can't think of any other reason for this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED, CONFUSED AND A LITTLE MIFFED TOO!","review":"Okay, I know this book was promoted as a short novel about the wedding but what was the point in writing it in the first place? If Jan Karon wanted to write about the wedding then this should have been the third book. Most of us Mitford fans were looking forward to a continuation of the story and this is not it. In my opinion, this book was disappointing, shallow and seemed to be just a way to get another book out there for us to buy. I hope Jan gets back on track and continues the story ( the next two books don't sound too promising either- Father Tim's quotations and hymns and the Mitford Snowmen? What snowmen ( never mind, I don't really care ) just get on with the story. PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I knew before buying this book that it was about the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia. But I was still very diappointed in the shortness of it, and the skipping over Ms. Karon seemed to do for a lot of the characters. There should've been more in the book of the people and their thoughts on the wedding. There is no real substance to this book compared to her others. It's almost as if someone tried to write this in Ms. Karon's place. And, for as long as it took for this book to come out, you'd think she could've done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Common Life: The Wedding Story","review":"I loved this book, as I did all of Jan Karon's \\"Mitford\\" series. I have read them all. It just proves that a good story, well written, stands on its own and does not need profanity and sex in order to sell. If Jan writes any more books, I wil; buy them and read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"This book, about a third the size of the others in the series, appears to be something left over or deleted from about the second volume. \\"A Common Life\\" is way out of sequence and just isn't very interesting. It deals solely with the marriage of Father Tim and has little to do with Mitford or the other characters. I found the novel (it is scarcely that) a real disappointment, compared with the first four books of the series. If the author felt that the information therein was significant, why was it not included at the appropriate place in time? The question is never answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"An After-thought?","review":"Having read & thoroughly enjoyed the first five Mitford novels, I was anxiously awaiting book six. A Common Life is disappointing & certainly not up to Jan Karon's usual quality writing.The fact that it is out of sequence makes me feel it was an after-thought or that it was hastily written in response to readers' disappointment with lack of detailed information about Fr. Tim & Cynthia's actual wedding. Whatever the motivation, the story lacks character development, plot, & substance.If read at all, it should be read BEFORE book five!That being said...I will definitely buy In This Mountain, the seventh in the Mitford series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I gave my mother a book gift certificate for Christmas with a note that she should use it towards this book when it was released in April. She bought it as soon as it was released and read it right away. She called to tell me what a disapppointment it was and after reading it myself I agree. I didn't want to go back in time , I wanted to move forward with further character development. (What happens to Dooley?) We have already lived through Father Tim and Cynthia's engagement etc. I was ready to move on to the next phase in their lives and their friends. Going back was a huge disappointement, especially after having waited so long for this book. I hope the next book in the series no longer leaves us hanging....in the meantime I am going back and rereading the first books in the series so I don't forget all of the people in Mitford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting","review":"After reading the first few pages of A Common Life, I knew this was not the sixth book of the Mitford series that I'd long been waiting for. Instead what I read was a pretty little book that, for someone who's read the series twice, contained nothing but yesterday's news. My recommendation: Buy this book as a gift for a friend who's never read anything by Jan Karon. It's a sweet story and a new reader will love it. As for the rest of us Karon fans - all we can do is hope that our book is still out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a tired Jan Karon or an indifferent committee?","review":"Compared to her earlier Mitford books, this one was a major disappointment. Not much text even though the hardcover book was 186 pages long: too much white space including wide margins on each page. The character sketches seemed more like outlines than in-depth discussions by and about the people we thought we knew. The quality of writing that I'd come to expect simply wasn't there, but perhaps the author was responding to pressure by the publisher to get this book out in a hurry. What a shame, since she's already proved she can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off from the Book of Common Prayer","review":"A large portion of this book is taken from the Book of Common Prayer; much of the rest is pulled from her earlier books. I've read all of her books & have enjoyed them except for this one which is different in narrative voice from her other books and really does nothing to further the story line. The book is printed on very heavy stock to give the impression that there is more to the book than there actually is. Buy this book if you like heavy stock, not if you want a good story of the caliber of Karon's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned - This is a Huge Disappointment","review":"I approached this book with enormous anticipation, having loved the previous books in the series, blew through it in less than two hours and will not keep it because I cannot ever imagine wanting to re-read it, as I have done all of the earlier Mitford books, again and again. Jan Karon, having already beautifully told the story of the romance between Cynthia and Father Tim, here retells it with far less grace and almost no charm. The peripheral characters, whom all Mitford readers have come to love, are almost non-existent. What a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Common Life","review":"I've been waiting for this book for 2 years, and was a bit disappointed at its content. It didn't have nearly the depth of Jan's earlier books, and I wish it had been written in sequence. But -- all the lovable characters are there, and it was a pleasure reading their thoughts about the upcoming wedding. It was as if Jan felt she needed a \\"filler\\" to keep her readers happy. I didn't get full enough! I hope the next 2 anticipated books (Father Tim's quotes and Mitford Christmas) give us a little more to chew on! Keep writing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A teaser","review":"Let's face it; if you're a diehard Mitford fan, you've got to read this book, no matter how short it is, and despite the fact that it's not in sequence. Everyone we love is in it, although the visit may be very short. And Jan's writing is as soulful as ever. It just doesn't have all the delightful twists and turns (it does have one or two) that we love in her books. This is a teaser (or appetizer) to get us along until the next BIG book comes out; not til 2002, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Lie, The Wanting Story by Jan Karon","review":"There is nothing really new in this tale of a wedding. Readers of the Mitford series are well versed in the storyline. Well, there is one thing new ... I've never seen such an abudance of blank space on the pages of any book, about 25 lines per page. The pages are 5.75 in. across and the print covers 3.75 in. That's 35% of nothing - in addition to the double spacing. Maybe the book is supposed to be poetry, but it certainly isn't tree-friendly. Good-by Viking Press and Jan Karon, enjoy your money while it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want more!!","review":"I have been anticipating the next Mitford book since finishing reading the last one. This book is a disappointment to me, as it is not what I was expecting. There was not the usual depth of characters. I did not feel like I was involved with what was going on, but was merely an onlooker. I think, to be fair, that if I were to read all the books again, and read this one in context between volumes 2 and 3, it would be alright. It took me less than a few hours to read; I had been hoping to savor it for a week or two, as I usually do. I hope this is not the last of what we hear from Mitford - I need to know what is going to happen with Dooley and siblings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment in Mitford","review":"Though the characters are still charming and unique, this poor, thin excuse for a book proves Karon has been bitten by the commercialism bug. This book belongs in a chapter in chronological order where it was sorely missed. There MUST be a continuation of the Mitford story...we have to know what happens to those we have grown to love and that all is well. . . AMEN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life Review","review":"I have read the entire Mitford series by Jan Karon and loved them. I was very excited when this new book came out. However, I was very disappointed when I read it and found out it was just a review of all the other books. The author did not go into character development, so if this was the first book I read it would not have drawn me in to the lives of all those in Mitford. I was very disappointed. I will think twice about buying another Mitford Series book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff!!!!!!","review":"I am deeply shocked at the lack of quality in this book. I guess Ms. Karon thought we were all well hooked into her series and this would allow her to skate through with a nice fat paycheck. I haven't even finished this latest (lack of) effort from her. I LOVED the previous 5 books and nearly embarrassed myself with Joy while in the bookstore at seeing this latest edition. When I got it home, I was deeply confused. Didn't they get married already? Did I mistakenly pick up a previous volume and had just forgotten the name? And didn't Miss Sadie die in #5??? I kept looking at the front matter trying to find out just where I went wrong. It was greatly comforting to come to Amazon and find out that I was not the only other lost soul! Ms Karon...what a mistake you've made!! I feel taken advantage of and will think twice at buying or even looking at your next installment. IF you even bother to write one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary and weak installment in the series","review":"I wonder which was the bigger driver in producing this book: Karon going for the green, or her fans sending her letters telling her how disappointed they were not to have been able to read about the wedding.No matter which, this is a book that should not have been written. It detracts from, rather than adds to, the series. One reviewer called it \\"sappy\\", and I agree. Did Father Tim suddenly enter his second childhood? Gone is his dignity, replaced by mushy dialogue. I almost expected Tim and Cynthia to start calling each other \\"Pooky\\" and \\"Snookums\\". Or did they? I'm not sure, because I was unable to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A common dissapointment","review":"The richness that you found in all the other Mitford books was unfortunately lacking in A Common Life. The book does provide some additional insights into the much loved Mitford residents, but I found the book lacking in many areas. It would have been fun to read about the wedding arrangements and the reception. Also, I would have liked to read about the reaction that Edith had to Father Tims engagement. I hope that Jan Karon publishes further stories in the Mitford series that are as rich and enjoyable to read as the previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very common life . . .","review":"Disappointing for Ms. Karon's readership -- very mundane and you could skip this book entirely and not miss anything with the Mitford happenings. This is not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It took me several chapters to realize that the author was backtracking to a wedding that had been eluded to...two books ago in the series!! This ruined the suspense for me since I knew it had already taken place. I did not feel this book was up to the author's general standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"A common retold Tale","review":"I always look forward to NEW books in the Mitford Series.

But I really didn't care about the who what and color of the flowers or bridal suit.....bring on NEW stories please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in 5 minutes","review":"Not sure why Jan Karon even wrote this book. It gives you nothing new to the story. It was written as if her publisher wanted something new so she wrote this in 5 minutes just to please her publisher. This book is so unlike her other books. She's a wonderful writer with stories that just sweep you off your feet and characters that find their way into your heart to stay. As far as this book is concerned, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a common, boring, disappointment...","review":"i should have believed the poor reviews but had to find out for myself...the book was an absolute bore...i kept reading and hoping that something/anything was going to happen...this is such a common, boring, disappointment to an avid reader of life in mitford...but this will not stop me from buying/reading the next book in the mitford series - i can only pray to the lord's chapel that jan karon returns to her familiar format and cast of characters that most of us have grown to know and love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother to read this one, it stunk!","review":"This book stunk. It was to mushey. I dont get what took her this long to write it. This book comparded to all her other ones stunk. Father Tim was actting like he could not live witrh out his wife.

I have enjoyed all of the previous books tremendously and was eagerly anticipating the next installment of the lives of all of the characters. I bought this book at a local buyer's club at a discounted price. After looking at the book when I got home, I was very glad that I'd gotten it at a discount. The book is only 186 pages long, has huge margins on each page. The timeframe of the book is several years earlier than the last book. While it was great to again meet all of the characters of the town and be involved in the actions and thoughts of their lives, it wasn't enough. This book is like a good short story or perhaps a couple of good chapters the usual Mitford book. I've been reading it for around 1 hour, and have only 20 pages left. I need more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper","review":"Waste of time. Boring. Slow moving. Love the author. If you are a HUGE fan and have to read everything of hers, then read it. Otherwise, move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"While the information on the jacket implies that this sixth book is a continuation of the story, it backtracks into an event not previously covered in detail. Moreover, this is a short story packaged as a novel - with large print, lots of white space, and little to say. Definitely a disappointment. It appears that the author ran out of original ideas but needed to make a deadline (or more money from her previously loyal fans)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"Any faithful reader of the Mitford series could have written this book. I love the first five books in the series dearly and highly recommend all of them to everyone. But, A Common Life: The Wedding Story is not in the same class. There is precious little really new in the book and the writing doesn't look familiar. Perhaps it is because of the various view points. However, that approach could be interesting and give us new insights into the supporting characters. But, it gives us very little.We love you Jan and we'll be waiting for book 7 (and 8 and...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Common Life","review":"Great book.

I love Jan Karon's Mitford Season, and can't wait until the next ones come out. The characters have become so real to me, I feel like I've known them all my life. It's hard to find good Christian fiction, which are loved even by those who do not usually read Christian literature, but these fit the bill! I give them for gifts to many."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I just received the book and haven't even read it and am VERY DISAPPOINTED. I too, as so many other readers, was expecting this book to pick up where the last one left off and not a re-hash of something that happened in her other books. I do hope that Jan Karon receives some of the reviews that have been written so that she knows her readers are expecting something new and current from Mitford. I was so anxious to get this book, I didn't pay attention to the reviews. If I had, I would not have ordered it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent","review":"If I could return this book, and receive a refund, I most certainly would. How disappointing to find Karon resorting to an adolescent review of the marriage event. This indicates to me that she is out of material, and has given us this poor substitute in lieu of a true sequel. Unfortunately, this too often happens when an author has enjoyed financial success with previous books. They start to churn out dribble that has dialogue that even a thirteen year old would find laughable. Oh for the days when an author only published a work that reflected work, not speed. I will not buy any more of this author's books. Based upon this latest \\"effort\\", I see that she has nothing left to give that is worth my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life","review":"Was looking forward to the release of this book. At first I was confused. Why would Jan Karon re-do the wedding like it never happened? I found \\"A Common Life\\" by Jan Karon very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown!","review":"The Mitford books have affected my life in such a positive way, and I felt somewhat cheated after finishing this book a day after starting it. There was little plot, and while the character insights were nice to read, there was nothing to hang on to, nothing to go back to time and time again like every other Mitford book. I've read the series many times over the years when I'm feeling down or needed to be inspired, and this is one volume I'll skip in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Beef????","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this book, even though I knew it was not the next one in the series. I knew it was to be a book about the wedding, but I am really disappointed and surprised at the 'lack' of story. I have to agree with fellow reviewers; the short pages and the margins make it appear as a 'short story' rather than a book. For the price, it is very deceiving!! You can easily read the book in a little over an hour's time. Although, it was nice to be with old friends again (Father Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Emma, Uncle Billy and Rose, etc.), they only appear in very minor ways. I want my Mitford friends back! I want the strange ending of A New Song wrapped up and let's go home to Mitford for the next adventure in the series. This book seemed like it was just written on a whim without much thought put into it. I'm a huge Mitford fan and have loved every book in the series; I am really disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life: The Wedding Story","review":"I was so disappointed with this book that after the first chapter I returned it! I'm insulted that one of my favorite story tellers would re-write and attempt to sell what she already sold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i hadn't bought it","review":"Like the last two reviewers, I purchased this book on the strength of the previous Mitford books. This book is so sappy and lacking in plot that I will think twice before buying the next installment in the series. If I could give this book less than one star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life: The Wedding Story","review":"I was so disappointed! Why is the author going backwards instead of forwards?? I was so excited when the new book came that I bought a copy for my daughter too. This was not money well spent on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could give it no stars","review":"so bad I could hardly pick it back up after taking a break. sappy, shallow, clealry only a ploy to make some more money from a story that was already told. from what it looks like, we're in for more of the same--the christmas story and the book of quotes advertised in the back of the book. I wouldn't even consider buying more of the same drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING AT BEST!","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the first four volumes of the Mitford series I was very disappointed at Jan Karon's exploitation of her reading public with this volume. It was obviously done hastily and not with the same warmth and passion of the previous ones. I trust that she has seen the error of her publisher's greediness and will present our Mitford friends in another volume with the warmth and passion she is so capable of giving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're reading this review, it's probably too late","review":"All of us who love Mitford (\\"I KNOW I've been to this town, I just can't remember where it is...\\") bought this book sight unseen. We love Jan Karon, we love Mitford and we would have bought anything to learn more about Father Tim and Cynthia. I will never be this careless again! Jan Karon and her publisher saw a way to make money and they took it. It's damaged her reputation with many of us. Like many reviewers, I am a librarian and will not recommend this book. I hope SHE reads these reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly bewildered","review":"To say that this newest Mitford book has confused me is too simple a statement. Beyond the vague details and sketchy facts contained in the body of the work, the syntax in which this wedding story appeared in the overall scope of this series leaves devoted readers trying to remember which events had happened at the time the wedding occurred and which had yet to unfold. Hadn't Dooley already bonded with Cynthia? Or was he still surly and unforgiving? Reading this installment had the exact opposite effect of the others--it made me tired and addled where the first five have been a balm to my soul every time I have lost myself in them. Sadly, this one will most likely not be revisited as often as the first five. I look forward to the next trip to Mitford, whenever Ms. Karon is ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I always wondered why the wedding story wasn't covered in its proper place. Obviously Jan Karon didn't want to write about it and this is even more evident in this book. It is a brief look at the wedding without any real depth into the characters or insight into the many events, decisions and thoughts that led up to the wedding and could have included the wonderful citizens of Mitford. Each book in the series has gotten shorter but this one at 185 very skimpy pages seems to be nothing more than a way to exploit the many fans of Mitford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated!!","review":"I received an email from Amazon to let me know that Jan Karon had a \\"new\\" book out in the Mitford series. I should have read the reviews before ordering. Rather than a continuation of the series, this short story disguised as a book, goes back to between the second and third books. What a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life - A Big Disappointment","review":"I loved her other books but feel this book was put together just to have another book. A big disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Common Life","review":"This book appears to have been written simply to hold the readers until the next book in the series (hopefully with some substance) is released. I should have had a clue when I saw how few pages the book has. Definitely not pn a par with the previous 5 books. I, as a reader before me suggested, would recommend that those reading the series check this one out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't bother to buy this book if you are waiting to see what happens next! This is not the continuation of the fifth book, but simply a review of past events. Very short, quick read that probably could be skipped. I think this was just a marketing ploy and I will certainly look closer before buying another Jan Karon book and I really enjoyed all the other Mitford books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I have been hooked in Mitford since book one. I could hardly wait for the books to come out. I felt the same about A common Life. I was the first one at the store to buy it. As I sat down to read it I was so dissapointed. The book was short and had no interesting story lines. We all knew that they were going to get married. I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithful Readers Have Been \\"Had\\"","review":"Shame on Jan Karon, AND her money-hungry publishers! I am appalled that an author who KNOWS she has such a following would stoop so low as to wring every penny out of her readers. Hell, I myself could have written this book! I certainly expected more from Ms. Karon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Ms. Karon's Usual Standards","review":"I am a huge fan of the Mitford series, but this latest entry is a real disappointment. Rather than carrying the story of Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia, forward, this book is a return to the story of their wedding. After reading this slight effort, I came to the conclusion it was written more for its marketing than its literary value. I think Ms. Karon wants this book to become a stand-alone gift book for weddings, much like the Dr. Seuss book on age is a perennial best-seller as a graduation gift. But if you aren't already a fan of the series, this book won't mean anything, and if you are a fan of the series, this book is a disappointment. If Ms. Karon wanted to write a wedding book, why didn't she write about Dooly's wedding and move the story along? Not her best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library... I would have been very upset if I purchased it! This book should not have been listed as \\"the sixth book in the bestselling Mitford Years series\\" as it implies it is a continuation of the prior books that are written in chronological order; somewhere the words PREQUEL should have been included. Details provided in this book could have been included in a previous book of the series; A Common Life was too wordy and too religious giving this reader the impression it was written to fulfill Jan Karon's contract. I enjoy reading about life in Mitford, but will thoroughly research future books in the series before reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing...Don't Bother","review":"With the use of maximum margins and a large font the minimal content of this book is nothing but fluff.

My son, who was 1-1/2 at the time we were reading it to him, loved it. The portrayal of the changes in Mom during the pregnancy and the fact that she is busy with the baby afterward helps prepare the children for the reality of a new sibling. The book reassures children that they are still important to Mom, even if her lap is full, and that she will still make room for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book you might like: On Mother's Lap","review":"If you like this book, I recommend \\"On Mother's Lap\\" by Ann Herbert Scott.

I kept it because it was difficult to return and with a couple of other pillows it works to some degree; but finally I actually went out and paid $80 for a different shaped wedge at my local 'relax the back' store.

I'm a relatively tall man with about a 31 inch inseam. All I can say is that this leg rest does exactly what I want it to do--it really takes the pressure off my back when I lay down. I love the extra width. It's a perfect size. It's nice and firm also which is good. I recommend this. No complaints. I have a twin bed, and this covers the width of the bed without going over the edges at all. There's maybe an inch or two to spare on each side. Definitely get this one for the extra width.

Instead, this one focused on the route to the south, over some incredibly varied and inhospitable terrain. The movie follows a caravan carrying tea leaves as it goes to Tibet.Stunning visuals, and a great look into daily life for some of the minority peoples along the route.

There are several typos (not like the editor had more than 3 or 4 lines to deal with per page!), and the story makes no sense at all.

They usually publish high quality books on interesting subjects. I hope they fired whoever put that deal together.Another reviewer got it right when he or she said that the book shouldn't be tossed aside lightly but hurled with great force.

There are interesting details about Chinese and Asian music, but the anti-African stance is both irrational and blatantly racist. It reports absurd rumours as if they are facts, for example that the Soviets were secretly financing western music as they 'knew' it would cause capitalism to collapse.

In one sense it is true that \\"we are what we eat\\", since our bodies are composed by the substances we partake of as food. But, most of us do not realize how we are influenced at the psychological or soul level by the music that is a part of our lives.

The author doesn't try to jam any particular viewpoint down your throat. He's great! There are probably some inaccuracies and flaws in this book that \\"Shakespeare-is-the-Straford-man\\" proponents are going to pounce upon, but I would argue that it's impossible for anyone to write a biography that doesn't get a few facts wrong, so give Bertram a break.

This game is undoubtedly flawed because of an improper save mechanic(When you die you start from the beginning of the stage), and some sticky platforming sequences will frustrate you from time to time. This is yet another little unknown gem for my Super Nintendo, and if you like out of the ordinary platforming games this one is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great companion to a fantastic film","review":"Like the film itself, the soundtrack to \\"Lone Star\\" is complex and thought-provoking. It's a good introduction to a variety of musical genres and plays well. I would have liked the album better without the music composed for the film; it's distracting and takes away from the melodic, melancholy works by Lydia Mendoza, Ivory Joe Hunter, and even Freddie Fender that so evoke the pensiveness of the movie. (I'm a little surprised that a Tejano movie soundtrack didn't have Flaco Jimenez on it, though.) Still, most of the songs are great. It's one of the few movie soundtracks I am glad I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music good; quality BAD","review":"If you are like me, you buy a soundtrack because the music really stood out in the movie, and, usually, you enjoyed the movie, so the music brings back a little of that good memory. John Sayles used the music in his movie as a transition between scenes and it was very effective. The traditional music is excellent. The reason for my 2 star review is the fact that the production quality on the CD is extremely bad. Granted, most of the songs were probably somewhat obscure and the original media may not have been top quality to begin with, but from the first song you really hear a hiss in your speaker like you are playing a tape recorded to another tape. This CD really needed some digital enhancement. Don't get me wrong, the music is excellent, but if you are one of those people who buys a CD for the reason that it is supposed to sound better than a tape, then, in this case, you would be just as well off purchasing the cassette and saving a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent soundtrack!","review":"This soundtrack really evokes the movie's many moods very well. Renewed my interest in Tejano music as well as traditional Mexican music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get it","review":"i got the cd expecting something truly out of the ordinary. instead i got very bland music. i'm fairly open minded and have wide musical tastes, but this was pure garbage (no offense). as a matter of fact i tossed the cd in the garbage at work...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum is crap!","review":"We bought this vacuum hoping to have it for a long while. We had been going through vacuums pretty quck, guess we just have bad luck. I was dissapointed right of the bat. The suction leaves ALOT to be desired. We had it for a little more that a year and it stopped working, it simply wouldn't turn on anymore. We got a Dyson and will never own any other type of vacuum. It is worth every penny!!! No other vacuum can even come close to a Dyson, so save your money and buy one instead of this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its really good.","review":"We got a Bissell 3576D this afternoon, it works very well.

I downloaded the manual just to check which HEPA filter to buy for backup replacement, and was startled to read that the power cord contains LEAD and you are urged to wash hands after handling. For others, this may not be a big deal, but in my household of 3 small ones, it is simply unacceptable. No vacuum is worth the remote possiblity of brain damage and the other risks from lead exposure. I love Amazon, not so sure anymore about Bissell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifetime","review":"When I first bought this item, the suction was great but it lasted only one or two months. Then it started to blow dust back on the floor. It was a gift so I didn't have the receipt. I couldn't give it back. AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies within one year","review":"Like many of you, I was very happy with this vacuum, until it died on me last month. I've only had it for about 10 months. It overheats easily, the rubber belt burns and starts to smell, and it stopped sucking. Even before it died, I had to take it apart and unclog the tubes many times. While it was a good vacuum while it lasted, I would definitely recommend spending more money on a vacuum that will last you longer than a year. No more cheap vacuums for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb vacuum!","review":"I just received my vacuum today, and putting it together was a piece of cake, all you need is a screw driver and some common sense. At first i was hesitant because the vacuum was inexpensive as it came with tools and such, but wow, it was worth every penny. I just vacuumed my living room, and to my surprise, i had more dust and hair then i could have possibly noticed if i juss used a broom. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful vacuum, useless tools","review":"This vacuum is powerful. It works well on big area floor. But if you want to use those on-board tools on hard-to-reach area or furnitures, it will be very dispointing. This is a big design flaw of this vacuum. There is a floor brush on the bottom of this vacuum. The brush works efficiently to loose the dirts from carpet and let the hose, which locate behind the brush, to suck them up. When you want to use those tools, you have to pull the hose from the bottom and connect it with the tool. However, the floor brush still works! Now you can imagine what will happen. The powerful high speed brush throws all dirts from floor through the bottom opening and these dirts happily fly over in your room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to be disgusted by the dirt this model will pick up","review":"This vacuum is amazing! The carpets in my studio were professionally cleaned before I moved in, but I wanted to vacuum just to pick up any remaining dust. I was surprised by how much dirt and dust was still in the carpet! I have no pets, take my shoes off at the door, and am hardly home, and yet this vacuum picks up an incredible amount of stuff each week. Generally, I fill up 1/3-1/2 of the cup each time I vacuum my studio. This vacuum is probably better for use in studios and apartments rather than a home. The only drawback to this model is that it functions better if you clean it after each use. The filter can take a few days to dry if the weather is cool. Overall, this vacuum is excellent and worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned my carpet","review":"I have had this vacuum for a month now. Last week I had the wand attachment hooked up and I was vacuuming a shelf. It didn't take long, but the motor got hot and the vacuum tipped slightly back burning a hole in my new carpet. The irony is thick. Be wary of the hot motor. Other than that the vacuum works well so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER belt problem!","review":"As was mentioned several times, the cleaning power of this machine is awesome (even with 2 long haired cats) but it just doesn't hold up. The 1st machine I purchased had the roller seize up and the belt burning the 2nd time it was used. Thinking this was just a fluke, I returned it to Walmart and got another one. This time the plastic piece holding the roller brush disintegrated and the belt burning smell occurred after 2 months of use. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived","review":"This was a great vacuum....for about 4 months. After that, it started making a wheezing sound and now if I don't clean it after every other use, the hoses get clogged. Judging from some of the other comments, this vacuum has major design flaws. Save your money and purchase another vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"EASILY BROKEN","review":"I have owned the product for one month. While using it one day, I smelled what I believed to be rubber burning (the belt). I took off the bottom piece to check the belt and a large piece of plastic fell out. I replaced the contraption and tried to use the vacuum again, but now the belt will not stay in place, causing more damage. The vacuum worked well for the month I had it, minus the noise and weight. I contacted Bissell and they basically told me \\"too bad, so sad.\\" Good luck returning it to the place you purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for the first several months....","review":"I, too, loved this vacuum when I purchaced it. There was nothing it couldn't pick up. I have had it for almost nine months now, and it does not pick anything up anymore. I am so sick of going over the same areas again and again and then finally getting on my hands and knees to pick stuff up. I have changed the filters and the belt brush, and nothing works. This vacuum is a rip off. Save your receipt!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Vacuum Doesn't Suck... Literally","review":"When I forst got this vacuum, it worked well for about a month, but that's about it. While the vacuum is light and easy to maneuver, the attachment hose suction is terrible. I have to go back over and pick things up by hand after using the attachments. The other problem is when picking up the vacuum to move to a different part of the floor (from throw rug to throw rug), a little pile of dust and dirt is left behind. Why bother with a vacuum when you have to clean up after it?Even though this wasn't the most expensive vacuum on the market, it is not worth the money. After 8 months, I switched to a different brand, with great results. Do your research before buying this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rated 1 for price","review":"This vaccume works well. it is light duty and seems to suck well.

I was looking for a product to give my hair some shine, and found this at a beauty supply store. I absolutely love it! A few drops distributed on my damp hair gives my hair a really nice shine, plus, it makes it so smooth and easy to comb & style! And it doesn't add any weight or greasy feel. This product is a keeper for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Hoover was deeply motivated by others","review":"The documentary on Larry Hoover was pretty good and detail. I thought it would have more interviews with Hoover, but the ones that was illustrated was good. The information of the Gangster Disciple Organization being 4th on Fortune 500, blew my mind. I'm hurt that our brothers' and sister are being caught up in the game with gangs and drugs. This is a good DVD on the history of Chicago's most empowered gang in our history.

I don't understand how Johnny A. garnered the press he did, while this CD flew beneath the radar;and, 'LAVA' was released earlier!!!Steve Vai should've been a bit more observant in his artist search...Duke is the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"To be watched twice!","review":"Antz is a very fun movie, and well created considering the computerized production as in A Bugs Life or Toy Story.All of the above three films each have a much larger content than their obvious humour and nicely rendered animations. Antz certainly stands as tall as its computerized colleagues, with its well captured environment and characters.Although the movie follows the clicheed \\"the little hero guy\\", it brings out other sides, especially socialogical ones, and maybe hinting a bit on modern society? I think so.First time you watch it, laugh and enjoy, second time, look closer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Movie","review":"I thought this movie was VERY funny. The Jokes where great the animations where incredible but the plot lacked something... Don't get me wrong it's a very good movie but there was just something missing here. I do reccomend it to adults and kids and I hope they enjoy it just as much as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bug's Life is for a younger audience.....Antz is for an older audience","review":"If you're thinking of showing this movie to the kids, you better reconsider. This is a 3D-animated movie that is made for an older audience. Adult humor, mild profanity, intense action sequences, and characters that might not be interesting to little kids. Don't get carried away by the anthropomorphic ants in the film. It's not A Bug's Life (which I believe doesn't even come close to Antz). It's an animated ant film that has better dialogue, better humor, and better-looking animation. It's doesn't try to take itself too seriously, nor does it try to be too goofy, either. In a nutshell, this movie is fun, hilarious, creative, and very entertaining. Even though I still have a few problems with it (such as some questionable voice acting), I'd still recommend it to friends and family members.Grade: 8.1/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Great graphics. But come on--it's the nineties. Everyone has great graphics. No, I couldn't stand the movie. It's not tasteful for the adult viewer, and it's totally inappropriate for younger viewers. I'd give it a low score on all counts. The plot was self-righteously mundane, the humor was crude, and the rampant swearing added nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very High-Quality Animation/A little violent maybe...","review":"I thought the movie was great as far as the computer animation.. Even better than Bug's Life in that regard.. I would have reservations about letting my kids watch it until they were old enough to realize that some of the characters in it are a bit negative and have a somewhat more violent type attitude than those in Bug's Life.. Overall however, it contains a good message of heroism and devotion to one's family group.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't no kid's movie","review":"Images of bloody, ripped up ant and termite bodies spread across a valley. A friendly wasp is flattened by a flyswatter. A few soldier ants are disentigrated by light beams. A decapitated ant dies in our hero's arms. With all this violence as well as the occaisonal four letter word, ANTZ seems less like a children's movie and more like some kind of obscure version of Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE ANT. Parents, a word of advise: If your kid is eleven or younger, don't let them see this movie. It helps reinforce the idea that death is funny, and we don't want our children turning out like morbid bullies. Adults, on the other hand, may be mature enough to like this film- the only reason I gave it less than 3 stars was because I was thrown off by the adult mood of what I thought was going to be a delightful children's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS FOR KIDS?!","review":"tHIS MOVIE WAS A BORE!

For all its claims of raising deeper issues and sophisticated allegories, what's the big deal if it doesn't bother to explore any of those issues? All too often, the filmmakers touch on things and then move on, ultimately saying nothing. The message of individualism especially seemed compromised by the \\"everybody join together as one\\" finale. The celebrity voices were distracting, and the battle scene was a bit ridiculous. Plus, why is Z's name an abbreviation for Z-and a bunch of numbers, while every other character in the movie has an individual name. Why is he the only one with a generic one? Too many plot holes, and no, it's not for most kids. I'll take \\"A Bug's Life\\" any day. Next time Katzenberg decides to steal an idea, make sure he has a better way to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown and Boring...","review":"I was totally bored by \\"Antz.\\" The story was an insult to the audience as it straddled between it's lame attempts to be an\\"adult\\" film (whatever THAT is! How about just making a GOOD MOVIE!) and it's fear of losing the family audience. The animation lacked any individuality, and the design was repulsive. Trying not to be Disney should not preclude good taste!

The story line is a rather straight forward boring one...'Spend the whole time plotting what they're going to in secret, then in 3 minutes at the end the resolution takes place!' All drama's consist of EXPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT, CRISIS & RESOLUTION; Antz has EXPOSITION, RESOLUTION! Although the all-star cast helped the movie along, it does not compare to the genius of Disney.

In this movie I want to take out a can of RAID. The ants were ugly and nightmarish. The animation was good. But the way the movie was presented turned me off. There are scenes, especially the decapitation scene, that would give small children nightmares. This film is definately not for small children. The movie even made me squimish.

By far one of his least funny films. The animation, though well done, is nowhere close to the quality of Pixar's.Those who like this film should at least give a viewing to ABL, as it's far superior in the voices/animation/story department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was for kids - thought wrong","review":"I just bought this video because I thought it would be a good one for my son.

Woody Allen stars as Z \\"he never looked better lol\\", an ant who has his own dreams and is tired of having to be the same as everyone else. He falls in love with a princess (voiced by Sharon Stone) who is tired of the same ole thing as well. She is to be wed to a general voiced by Gene Hackman who has a big scheme to drowned out the whole colony of ants. Z gets into a whole lot of trouble when he kid-naps her and leaves the colony to find a place called insect topia where bugs can live with no rules.The result is a charming and funny movie with great one liners by Woody Allen who I usually find annoying. He's less annoying when you don't have to see his face lol. I liked him a lot here, he's very funny. Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone are also funny. Gene Hackman and Christopher Walked do good as well as the more serious characters of the movie. Some people say the film has no moral but it does. It's about thinking for yourself and living your life as you choose to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Adult Language for Children","review":"If this was supposed to be a kids movie there was too much profanity. It has an allstar cast, Stallone, Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, etc... The story is a bit slow. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen. The story concept \\"finding Nirvana\\" away from the colony was not one for an exciting story. The \\"Evil Villan's\\" plot makes no sense as to why he would want to do what he wanted to do. If you want to hear the voice of the stars in animated Ants then this is movie. Otherwise its not worth the money. I have no desire to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult movie disguised as kids movie","review":"If you are looking for a movie for your young child this is not the best choice...Antz has nice animation, and a okay plot, (even though the movie gets into the plot too soon in my opinion). Definitely not a kids movie, Im sure kids hear bad words from strangers, TV, ect, but if you try to monitor what your children watch (especially toddlers and young children) DO NOT BUY.If you decide to buy this movie, I recommend that you watch this movie with your kids and explain that certain words are not appropriate.Sample of words throughout the movie, hell, bi#*%, crap, idiot, dam* and a$$.I expected better from this movie, however it is a reoccurring theme throughout Pixar, Disney & other so called kids movies.

Of all the words they could have replaced it with like stop complaining/ stop being irritable, difficult, unreasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute film, more mature than A Bug's Life","review":"Both films came out around the same time, but this one is definitely darker than the other movie.

First night aligned the finder and used manual control, only using 47X Jupiter was beautiful and moons snapped into view nicely. Over all image(s) look Good to Very Good, nice and compact stars as they should be ! 2nd night (using Autostar) able to align on the 3rd attempt, viewed more in 1 hour, infact lost count ! Was locating many from horizon to horizon, simply amazing feat ! Noisy in operation and dislike the small finder and needs more info on use, otherwise would give 5 stars !! Was Pure Fun, LOVE IT !! Update, now just over a year viwed nearly all the Messier Deep Sky Objects 107 !

Without polar alignment capabilities you can forget about photography. If you insist on buying this model then go ahead and order an angled finder scope for another $60. The straight through finder scope that comes with the ETX-90 is useless since you can't see through it while aligning on Polaris.The optics are excellent with no noticeable color fringes.The AutoStar locator/tracker leaves much to be desired. After spending many minutes performing a polar alignment, the AutoStar reset itself and \\"Initialized\\". Did the alignment again, moved to Mars for some photography and the AutoStar \\"Initialized\\" again. I found that a light tap on the side of the scope caused it to initialize - losing all alignment setting. Apparently there is a loose connector/cable inside it!!!I suggest buying a Celestron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect small scope with gorgeous optics","review":"This is amazing. I took this out to a dark sky area (which I can't do with my other giant scope, since i own a tiny car) and the results were breathtaking. You can get some nice wide views with this, and the variable motor control is so good. It is rather startling how good the optics are in this-when peering in, it looks like the quality of a slightly larger average (5 or 6 inch) scope.The downside is the Go-To is persnikkety at best. I have not got it to work, and others I know have had issues with this model. But, for grab and go and optical quality alone, its totally worth it.Bonus: I highly recommend getting a solar filter, Telrad, and focus motor for this as essential add-ons."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent telescope but not as represented","review":"the reason for one star is not the telescope it self or any part of it .... i like it its an excellent choice for a bigennerbut the offer represented above is only the etx90 with the autostar controller(497) with out the Tripod(884)beware if you pay 499$ for this offer dont think you will get the whole set, no.even if you complain they will replace with the same orderbuy them separate , it would be betterpoor amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to read","review":"I think \\"Dogger is very unfair on his review\\".

I learned so much about this time period as well as what life was like \\"out west.\\" She has great historical details. It is a bit slow at times, but you still can't put it down. This is not a book that ends happily ever after, or that ties everything up in the end. It is as real as real life. The characters are multi-faceted with multitudes of various feelings.

The novel is set in two different locales..New York City and Montana. It cleverly recounts the events in the lives of various individuals who inhabit these two areas. Ms. Winsor gives us fully \\"fleshed out\\" characters with distinctive qualities and personal traits that intrigue us. You find yourself wanting to know more and more about what's happening to each of them. The authors way of advancing the storyline and leaving reader with little \\"cliff hangers\\" at the end of selected chapters, keeps you reading until your eyes literally burn from lack of sleep. This is a book you cannot put down.....and you don't want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Forever Amber and wanted to read more of Kathleen Winsor.

The weight of society, the tender affection, the impediments to true love. Saying this book has no plot is like saying Moby Dick is a book about a fish. The construct (young woman forced to take to the stage in order to save her beloved home) sounded trite in the brief description here, but the main character's actions are made clear and admirable and the love she shares with the hero is delectably real. There are no lost letters or crossed wires; they must simply and honorably overcome the very real barriers to their happily ever after. I also appreciated lots of timely references to politics, international relations, and economics of the period. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate and moving","review":"This is a typical Joan Wolf regency plot, in that the hero and heroine face some very real life issues and obstacles to their love.

Adam is a boy who treats Vicky like a little child when she is ready to become a adult, but he also offers her a chance to work with dolphins.Now I should mention that this book is very much a book for all of you dolphin lovers.

Also, if you have a liking of poetry, this book is for you. This is a beautiful book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most wonderful books I ever read!","review":"This book was soooo good! Vicky Austin is growing up and facing a world of death, her poetic mind and soul pull her out with the help of her oneness with the dolphins. Everytime I read it I feel like I get more and more out of the book.

One day Vicky goes to meet them , and she figures out she can talk to dolphins telepathicly.

There are so many reader comments here that this is probably redundant, but I wanted to contribute my feelings on this wonderful book. Madeleine L'Engle writes with amazing eloquence and sensitivity about the struggles of a teenage girl growing up filled with seemingly unresolvable feelings of joy and sorrow. There is something for everyone to relate to in Vicki's struggle as she experiences tragedy and sadness and must find her way back to the light. L'Engle paints an enduring portrait of Vicki and her wonderful, human family and friends. I will always have a copy of this book on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great book, about a 15 year old girl.","review":"This Book, A Ring of Endless Light, has a very good story line. I felt for Vicky, as I was reading, because I knew,that my grandfather was going to die, just like Vicky. It was hard to deal with because, like Rob, I was younger when it happened. I absolutely loved the parts where Vicky worked with dolphins. I love dolphins too, although I have never worked with them. I like the way Vicky handles her life. She seems to have everything under control. She can hold on when her insides are tearing apart. That is why liked this book so much. Thank you Madeline L'Engle, this was a story that you couldn't put down. I rate is a really good nine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"This is is by far one of my favorite novels by L'Engle.

Before, I had only read Many Waters. I was so impressed with Light that I went to the library and checked out all the books L'Engle wrote that were available. I already finished the Time Quartet(Time, Door, Planet, and Waters) and I am now reading An Acceptable Time, one of the books in the O'Keefe series. I also have the first book in the Austin series, Meet the Austins. I love all the books, but Light is so incredible, it made me want to cry and laugh at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 10, and I've read it several times since.

Madeleine L'Engle used symbolism and metaphors to represent life and death. She brought it out in the open in terms everyone could understand.

This book is amazing and it keeps you reading and makes you think about the events going on in the world around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first favorite book","review":"Of all of Mme L'Engle's glorious fiction, this book stands out in my life as my ultimate favorite. It was the first love story I read as a 12-year old and remains dear to my heart now that I am twice that age.

Everyone who reads this book will be instantly drawn into the confused adolescent world of nearly 16 year old Vicky Austin. As she \\"grows\\" wiser in the story, so did I . The content is so vivid, that it paints a picture in my mind. I've read some other of Madeleine L'Engle's books, but I think that this one was the best. No other non-L'Engle books I've read can compare to the vivid reality of \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" either. This book is an inspirational read to me, so I suggest that anyone who likes deep thinking should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"I have read all of Madeleine L'engle's books for teens and I can say that without a doubt, this book is the best of them all. I love of of Madeline L'engle's books, but this one is exceptional. I have always been in love with the idea of swimming with dolphins, and this book made it seem like a very real possibilty.

The book focuses on Vicky Austin, a girl who's just growing up and is dealing with all of the twists and turns that life can take. There's fear, loss, love, fun, and confusion, and all the other things that come along with being almost sixteen. There are themes of life and death, and joy and sorrow. It really makes you think about what's important and about how precious life and love are to all of us. Vicky and her family and friends all seem very real to the reader. None of them is perfect, none of them is all bad, but each of them is unique. They make the book come alive.I absolutely loved A Ring of Endless Light, and I am sure that it will touch the hearts of all readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I picked up this book about 6 years ago and I still love it.

While I enjoy the occasional romance novel, I am wary to pick up a book by a cross-genre writer like Vella Munn. Its the story of a young woman Twana who has a special power to be able to locate animals, and even in one case, talk telepathically to them. Twana's mother disappeared many years ago, and both she and her mother have been surrounded by abusive, conniving men. Until the insipidly instant love of her life kidnaps her, and together they are able to work through their past traumas and live happily ever after.There! You know the story and that's about as exciting as it gets. It's very negative to most of the men in the novel as a way to make the main male character more attractive and lovable to the reader.This book isn't worth your time or money.

However, Wilson was not about to give up on the fame and fortune she had enjoyed, and reinvented herself as a fake Holocaust survivor, Laura Grabowski.It's hard to say what combination of mental illness, lust for fame, or criminal greed motivated Wilson's exploitation of past victims and present suckers.

The Holocaust, of course, did happen, but when \\"Fragments\\" was exposed as complete fraud, Lauren's story fell apart, too.

The only complaint is that the disc's overall sound is somewhat subdued (compared to her live sound, which is more dynamic) and at times is glazed over by the production of the disc (a couple of the songs, the lazier, more ephemeral tunes, like \\"Sister,\\" the production actually enhances the song), but the quality of the songs more than makes up for it... she is a truly gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Great book, I really and truely recommend this book to all the adults out there looking for suspense and inspiration from a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love conquers all---long or short distance","review":"I really like Miss Ottey's writing style.

The joint-grooves of the cans are somehow already stripped, causing one of the three lights to point limply at the ground.So, we bought junk knowing it was junk.

Thankfully, we never got tested on it. This book was trashed as soon as school was over for the year and if this book ever went out of print will be not a day too soon.I do not know, as an adult, if any of us would \\"choose\\" to read it for pleasure.

From oats to grits, farro to quinoa, it's all there, with recipes from around the world to illustrate how each is used.Note that even though it's about grain, normally the province of vegetarians, this is not necessarily a vegetarian's cookbook. Many of the book's recipes include meat.This book could be especially useful for those who've decided to cut back on meat and change the focus of their diet to grain, but it would be handy on any cook's shelf.

The major drawback of the book is one that Gay could not avoid, you can only imagine Mozart's compositions in your mind as you read. Gay tries to paint the picture of how magnificient, truly unmatched Mozart's gift was, but words only go so far. The positive thing along the same lines, however, is that I can't wait to play \\"Jupiter\\" and piano concertos like no. 20 and 21 and soak in their richness, which ultimately is Gay's goal.

After 6-months in my truck for a full Vermont winter, I used the power jack feature to power a radio every day for two-weeks in the sugar shack without needing a re-charge. Let it charge for a full 24-hours however when it does discharge to fill it back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One fine product","review":"The Jump-N-Carry has suprised me with its terrific power output.

Sometimes I have to hook the negative cable directly to the battery node instead of the block.The absence of an on/off power switch wasn't as much of an issue as I thought because it comes with plastic covers that clamp on and off pretty easily. The voltometer guage is color-coded, so it isn't hard to figure out when it needs charging.The slim design makes for easy storage, but also means that it doesn't stand very well on its own without tipping over. I also would have appreciated an extra foot in the cable length (5' instead of the supplied 4').It feels pretty powerful to carry something like this and not have to hunt down another vehicle for jumping off. I'm definitely pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"BY FAR BEST JUMPBOX EVER ...","review":"THIS JUMP START BOOSTER IS BETTER THAN ANY SNAP ON, OR ANY OTHER BRAND THAT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.

I jump started 8 cyclinder engine at least a half dozen times using the Jump-N-Carry 1700, and the engine fired up first shot every time. I started the truck several times off the same charge, and it's still reading green. Yes, it doesn't have a fancy air pump, bottle opener, or toothpick, but it does it's intended purpose VERY well.

It has good CCA power to start even the toughest trucks. we have jumped several dual battery diesel trucks with these packs. (I have two) I like the charger on these packs too if using an extension cord it does not seem to over charge the pack. The cables are nice and long and have nice clamps. the only thing that i would change on this pack would be to lengthen the cables a little bit so they are not as tight storing the clamps on the top. when putting the clamps back to store it often marks up the cables and i have a small cut in the ground cable now. But i also use my packs sometimes up to 4 and 5 times a day in the winter. this is a great pack you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product if you live in a cold climate.","review":"I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for someone that has problems with their automobile during cold weather. I thought it would be great if they could carry a charger in their car to avoid having to ask a stranger for a jump during the cold weather of Wisconsin winters. When reading the directions I was surprised to learn the charger should not be stored in an area which is colder than 50 degrees. Seriously? Why would you need a charger if its warmer than 50 degrees unless you are foolish enough to drain your car battery because you leave your lights on.Not sure if the charger will be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jumpstarter. No extension cord included!","review":"Great jump starter. Comfortable to carry around.Key points:1) They are selling new models now. These models do NOT need to be monitored while charging! Once charged it'll automatically turn the charger off and will not damage your battery2) Clamps are always under power! You have to be very careful if you want to put it for storage on the metal shelf: it may easily short-circuit over the shelf, since protective covers only cover the tips of clamps.3) There is NO AC charging cord in the package. This is a standard AC extension cord, it is available everywhere, but you'll need to buy one. There is only DC charging cord.4) The unit ships discharged.5) The unit has voltmeter (and percents) to display the remaining charge. In my case, after the first charge it is around 13V (higher than 100%). Not sure what it means though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Upgraded with overcharge protection!","review":"This jump starter is the cats! and any of the starters made after july 2010 have the upgraded led lights to tell when its charged and charging. No more worrying about overcharging the unit. The description doesnt say that you are getting the upgraded version with overcharge protection but when I opened the package to my delight. It was indeed! The unit automatically goes into a maintenence mode once it is fully charged. I also recieved the coupon that allows you to replace the unit for 75$ if it breaks or the battery dies regardless of how many years the original owner has it! Thats amazing! I used heavy duty packaging tape and folded up my reciept and coupon and taped it securely to the back of the unit so it wouldnt get lost. Just put something between the paperwork and tape so it doesnt ruin them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two things to consider","review":"This is a great jump starter because it's consistent and reliable. There are only two issues to consider:(1) There is no indicator to let you know when the unit has been fully charged, so you have to keep an eye on it.(2) The unit MUST be stored upright. Otherwise, the instructions say it could leak battery acid. This is a little more inconvenient, if you want to store it in your car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for hot wires","review":"I did not realize the cable would be live/hot all the time.

I LOVE this jump starter! It has worked beautifully and quickly for me at least 6-7 times already, including in below-freezing temps. I previously went to an automotive store and bought a different $60-70 model which also had a compressor. It did literally NOTHING to jump my car when I needed it, and I tried several times. The most I could get out of it was weak clicking of the starter. With this model, my car started right up once connected. Plus -- it's easy to use (I'm a girl and have jumped my car using this, by myself -- not hard at all) Love it. Needed it again this weekend.

This book not only entertained, with its story of a young lawyer investigating a World War II-era suicide, it also educated. How many people are aware that 52,000 Italians were interned as potential enemies during this period? Many of these were fisherman, but they also included poor slobs who had the bad luck to be working on cruise ships docked in U.S. ports when the war broke out. Thanks, Ms. Scottoline, for both writing a terrific read and shedding light on a little-known chapter in our history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer Smile","review":"Certainly not one of Scottoline's best and not the mystery I was expecting. I've read her previous books and enjoyed them, so I was eagerly anticipating reading her latest.Managed to get 1/2 way through, when I had to call it a day. Character of Mary was somewhat stupid...especially for a lawyer. Her actions (e.g. breaking into a crime scene and stealing evidence, only to have it stolen from her purse?!!! And, that's just one example...there are too many to list) I was so disgusted with her stupidity that I couldn't force myself to read on any further.I haven't given up on Scottoline though,I'm hopeful that her next release will be a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"I was looking for a new author but I don't know if Scottoline is it. I got to page 182 and dumped this one. Too much history and not enough intrigue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last","review":"This the first of Ms. Scottoline's books I have read and it will most likely be the last. Poor writing and a totally implausable plot had me shaking my head. With so many good thriller writers out there I can't see myself giving this one a second try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting history, but. . .","review":"It might be good if Ms. Scottoline sticks to history or the law, then uses a ghostwriter. Her discussion of the treatment of Italian-Americans is very good; her treatment of the protagonist is poor. The protagonist is a genius in one sentence, then a dolt in the next; not a believable character. The plot deserves a 10, the history deserves an 8, the legal writing deserves a 7, the writing deserves to be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read her previous books which had some legal and professional basis. Killer Smile has neither. The idea behind the plot is intriguing but he dialog and events make it more of a comedy than a mystery and some of the legal maneuvers are a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and Cliched","review":"This book has 140 interesting pages. Unfortunately, it's 352 pages long. It starts out great - with a unique plot and some thought-provoking mystery elements. However, at page 141 it turns into a typical thriller novel with every possible cliche thrown in. The plot twists in the wind well beyond my ability for suspension of disbelief. I skipped through the last 3/5 of the book, wishing that I hadn't dropped $20 for the hardcover. My advice is to borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scottoline's best effort","review":"I am an avid fan of Lisa Scottoline's novels. I usually read her books within a day or two of publication. However, this book was not nearly as compelling a read as previous books. I could take it or leave it--not becoming very involved in the story line.Very little of the book concerns the \\"girls\\" at the firm. I missed the \\"lawyering\\" that takes place in the other books.If you've not read Scottoline before, don't pick this one as your first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I've read a few of Lisa Scottoline's books (Look Again, Legal Tender) and found them to be good reads. I thought this one was so bad, I couldn't even finish reading it. I kept waiting for something significant to happen or what the end game was going to be and it just never happened. Didn't seem to have any point at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller about heritage, history and family","review":"The girls of Bennie's firm are back, this time with Mary DiNunzio taking the lead. She's devoted to (obsessed by) a pro bono case, getting justice and remuneration for an Italian-American fisherman who died in an internment camp during WWII. The story takes her all over Philly, and even farther away from home than she's ever been before, and there's a lot of intrigue, and quite a few convenient coincidences. (The latter is a Scottoline weakness.) But still, the character development is solid and some passages were genuinely moving. (Especially the one where Mary takes her father's arm.) A few of the plot twists were genuine shockers. And the backstory about people like Bandolini is serious and deserves telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Smile","review":"This is a pretty good light mystery book. The heroine is at least differnt from the run of the mill super detective that you usually find in these type of books. The story centers around Mary who is still recovering from the death of her husband (in a earlier book?) and is working on a pro bono case invloving the death of an Italian business man that died in a internment camp during WWII along with trying to fend off her well meaning friends and family that set her up with blind dates. As Mary investigates she begins to find more and more evidence that the man was murdered and did not commit suicide which sets in motion a series of events that has Mary fighting for her life.The book moves at a good pace and has a sense of humor through out. Also has no sex scences, so you dont have to skip through those parts to get back to the story.All and all a good book if you like fast paced mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Killer Read","review":"Others here have detailed the plot line of this most entertaining book. I had not read this author before receiving an unsolicited ARE (Advanced Reader Edition) from the publisher with an invitation to read it and review it. I was aware of her and wondered if her works were like Janet Evanovitch with her Stephanie Plum novels, which are light and frothy chick detective novels. Scottoline, in my opinion, delivers a more hefty effort. The story is interesting, the mystery takes some time to unravel, the characters are well drawn and when the plot turns dangerous it gets a bit compelling as well. Add to that the information contained in the book about the Italian American internment camps and you have a bit of a learning experience also. A pretty interesting mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeek! Yikes! Argh! Eeeek!!!!","review":"These are a few of the commonplace expressions of the supposedly mature, educated, intelligent female protagonists of the author's series of books about an all-women law firm in Philly. The problem is, it's not an all-women firm: it's a girly firm with actions, dialogue and clothing more appropriate to an eighth-grade clique than to college-educated, seasoned professional women. Despite the occasional interesting plotlines and background, I can never get past how silly these people are and how they never seem to grow past their eeks and yikes. Come on, Ms. Scottoline: stop dumbing down your characters and raise them to an acceptably mature level - it's way past time for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line but ...","review":"This is the first time I read a book by Lisa Scottoline. The story is very interesting about a lawyer obsessed with a murder case in the past.However, I found it very unreal to have a practicing lawyer who would break the law to remove evidence from a crime scene, and so easily trust some reporter and spill her guts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and sassy","review":"Attorney Mary DiNunzio becomes obsessed with an old case involving a WW2 internee, Amadeo Brandolini, who apparently suicided in the internment camp following the death of his wife.A trail of clues leads to the involvement of the descendants of one of Amadeos' fellow internees, Giovanni Saracone and the murder of the attorney whose firm dealt with the Brandolini estate, inexorably points to dirty work at the crossroads! Soon Mary is so involved with the case that her life is threatened and she is actually kidnapped in an attempt to silence her.It's a slick, pacy story- very modern- with a very likeable heroine who battle on, even while admitting that she's really a great sook at heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast fun book","review":"Exciting, moves along the way a quick read mystery needs to for me.....yep, that's my genre, quick reads that momentarily take my mind of life's woes because the writing is witty, story somewhat probing, just unbelievable enough to not be too scary.

Its just the right size for little hands to pick up and take along with them too. The only things missing, I think, are a record button and a music sheet that kids can use to play along with.

In todays world of hi tech audio, this was sadly lacking in production. The actors sound like they are sitting on stools reading into a microphone. There is no feeling of action or excitement.

In addition to the quiet games, there are neat craft projects to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I ordered this book because it got so many stars and such great reviews. It is a good formatted book, easy to read, but a little juvenile. If you are used to planning larger, adult parties, this book is not for you. This is more for kids or children's parties.

If you like to shock or scare you partygoers, Martha Stewart probably has more scary ideas than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly disappointing","review":"I had much higher expectations for this book based on other reviews I had read.

Easy to read and to understand, this should be the first book you pick up when you want to help someone through tough times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a winner!","review":"Finally a book that specifically discusses the very important topic of availability. The book discusses how to address each layer of an infrastructure from the data layer, network, application, etc. with an emphasis on availability requirements.

Personally she should have made this one the short story and made Dark Descent the longer version. Alex was ready to give up her life for her brother, than becomes a real sissy the rest of the book. I still liked the book in other ways, with the battles and Aidan's relationship with his servants and Alex's little brother. So it was worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Gold - 24 karat","review":"Dark Gold, the third in the Carpathian saga, was a wonderful book.

At the time, I didn't know it was a series, a friend of mine loaned it to me and I fell in love with Christine Feehan's style of writing. However, once I started reading the other books within the series, I realized they become repetitive.

I've read hundreds! But, for some reason I had never heard of Christine Feehan. One day, I decided to do a search of the top authors in paranormal romance and came across her name. I was surprised and excited to see the long list of books in this series. Lots of reading material! I got the first book and drudged through, thinking that books written early in an author's career are not as good as what will come and i was just getting the scenery and back stories of the next great books... and the second one in this series was an improvement to be sure, but still lacking, so I had hopes.... I am now in the middle of this third book in the series and I am so bored to tears, I can't stand it! Can we please get away from women in these books not having control of their bodies so that they are essentially forced into sexual encounters?

She has created yet another unforgettable Carpathian male and spunky heroine. While having a different feel then her previous two books (Dark Prince and Dark Desire), Dark Gold still packs a powerful punch. How can you not feel for the heroine, who must struggle to understand and accept what she has become, and yet at the same time fight off her growing attraction and love for a being she fears. The hero in this story, Aidan, is different from the Carpathian males we've met, while just as arrogant, possessive and powerful as his brethren, he is able to put his needs and wants aside, and allow Alexandria the space and time she needs to grow. Definitely another keeper. Fans of paranormal romance, and romance fans in general will love this book.Also recommend Dark Prince and Dark Desire"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst author I've read in years....seriously","review":"I wish I could give this no stars. I don't know how people can enjoy this woman. This is by far one of the worst published authors for this genre of books, I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I've read only two of her books (the second one, was just to give her another chance) and they were just horrendous.It's the most repetitive, ridiculous, unbelievable cheesy dialogue imaginable. It's almost insulting to the reader how horribly vapid the writing is. I thought I was reading a Ann Rice-wannabe/Harlequinn Romance hybrid abomination.I just can't even express how awful this author is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Heroine","review":"Both the main character and the plot were pretty disappointing. Particularly the author's clear lack of understanding of any of the things it takes for a person to support herself as an artist (let alone her little brother, who appears to be merely a plot device, instead of a character). Now she's going to be a game designer? She got this interview how? But I digress.The love story was forced, the girl was much too perfect, and for crying out loud, if she's going to be an artist, you could have the decency to give her a day job and some paint under her fingernails like the real thing. Also, what is with the totally generic mansion? They need a ballroom why?

Alexandria is hysterical through the first 3/4 of the book. Aidan seems like the nicest guy in the world and I get soooo tired of her resistance. I finally stopped reading this at page 299 and have not regretted my decision. My favorite books in the Dark series are 'Dark Fire', 'Dark Magic', 'Dark Legend', and 'Dark Celebration'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Gold","review":"Great Book! I would highly recommend all of Christine Feehan's books. If you like Gothic Romances, you will love her books.Aidan Savage is an Ancient Carpathian, 800 years old, one of the oldest living Carpathians. All Carpathian males must find their lifemate or they will eventally turn to evil, lose their Carpathian ways and turn into a vampire. Aidan has found his lifemate Alex. Alex is not Carpathian she is human, a human with physic abilities. She fights to stay human and continue her everyday life with her brother Joshua. Since the death of their parents, she has raised Joshua on her own, and has a hard time dealing with the love others are willing to give to them. She fights the love Aidan, Stefan and Marie give her and Joshua. If she will only give in, she will find happiness for them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO ADIAN","review":"Loved it, i found it facinating because Adian lived with humans and trusted them, not like other Carpathian males.

I'm truley hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Gold from The Bookdragon Review","review":"\\"Feehan once again provides a book that stands well on its own, but is infinitely stronger with its companion novels.

I LOVED the first two in the \\"Dark\\" series. But i couldn't even finish this one, i'm jumping ahead to Gregori's story. I absolutely hated Alex. Just like everyone else was saying, she was snobbish, and selfish. I kept reading, hoping she'd get over her \\"hysterical\\" period and finally LISTEN to Aidian about what she'd become, but she kept pushing him away, and being what i thought was really closeminded about the whole thing. I couldn't stand her to the point where i was reading with my teeth gritted, so i just put the book down. i'll keep reading the rest of the series b/c i adored the first two. I just hope the rest to come are far better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great at All","review":"I basically felt this book was force. I was forced to believe that these two would fall in love, but with the whole Carpathian lifemate thing working and the ability to mind read, you don't ever get the chance to listen to the characters share their fillings, their past or their fears. Since they automatically know each other. I felt I didn't know anything about either character and this made it even harder for me to enjoy the book. Anything about them was a blip compared the physical attraction they had for each other and then to top it off the sex scenes were often quick and annoying fix its to the story with Aiden Savage asking for more afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Read!!","review":"This was a beautifully written story. Liked the fact it took Alex ages to come around to the hero, Aidan, and not accepting the 'Carpathian' changes in her so readily. I also liked that it was almost halfway through the book before they finally made love. The chemistry between them was great.And I definitely like the fact, Aidan, being centuries old, didn't use modern day endearments, which in this case would have worked because of him living with and interacting with humans through the centuries.A great tale!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, nor the worst of her books","review":"As others have said, this installment in the Dark series can pretty much stand on its own as a separate story.Alex, for me, was at least the spunkiest of the females thus far. I know that I would NOT be pleased to find out that I couldn't eat chocolate or sit in the sunshine ever again, no matter how hunky the tradeoff. The whole concept of a mono-diet is so unappealing. So any female who resists 'conversion' for a long time has my vote.Anyhow, Alex resists and tries so hard not to accept who and what she has become. Gradually, she does come around, but the chemistry between her and Aidan isn't quite what I'd hoped for. Still good, but not great.Her little brother is a nice touch, as well as the human servants. Like someone else said, its nice to see the 'vampire' world expanded a bit to include, well, 'us'.Good read overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Gold","review":"As always another great read.

I spent the night of the first dose in great pain, throwing up a very strong acid bile that burned my throat and mouth for hours. The diarrhea was just as painful and it took several hours to clear my system. 3 different bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. Just beware if you are a first time use of Ox Bile, to take a smaller dose, start out with 125 mg and work up as needed.

The Clans are so much more Advanced, has the Inner Sphere caught up that quickly? The Trial of Refusal on the Invasion could have been a whole novel in its self. Then came the second half! There was twist after twist that just kept you guessing. A lot of politics were played out, but that is the other half of the whole Battletech Universe, and it left you asking, \\"What will happen next?\\". Michael Stackpole is definately one of the best when it comes to the Batteltech Universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inner Sphere will never be the same!","review":"A good book. Not the best from Stackpole, but it does show that he continues to be THE BEST writer in the BattleTech series/universe. The beginning chapters describe various battles in a Trial with the Clans, and, while obligatory to any BattleTech novel, they seemed a bit too much at once, and a bit forced. Stackpole's done better battle scenes; however once the mech combat is out of the way, Stackpole's true genius comes out, and it's what makes him my favorite BT author. The political manuevering in the second half of the book is vintage Stackpole, and well worth the read.

Besides being the typical Michael Stackpole style of 1% mech action and 99% boring politics of the inner sphere, this book felt like somebody said \\"I'm bored with the Clans, let's get rid of them and start something else\\". The casual way that the inner sphere defeats the Clans to stop the invasion left me thinking that Stackpole or maybe FASA just want to end it. So what are the Clans to do now??? Their whole reason for being has melted away, and with barely a tremble from the khans. This book just doesn't jib with the BattleTech universe. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The BT universe is dead! Long live the BT universe!","review":"This abomination truly would deserve nothing more than -5 stars. Stackpole and FASA have apparently decided, that the only way to advance the plot is to shake it up, each time with more \\"surprising twists\\".Their latest bungling has resulted in neutralizing the clans, recreating the STAR LEAGUE (for gods sake... The whole mythical \\"grail\\" of BT accomplished with few cheap words.) and virtually eliminating all conflict between houses Davion and Kurita.The whole TOTC-series was yet another colossal mistake on FASAs part, the final one for me.

The lpot is not true to Miss Austen at all, and not a whit of it leads to the plot, structure, theme, language or depth of \\"Mansfiedl Park\\". And like all Janeites out ther, let me point out that the youngest Miss Ward's first name is not Harriet (Hatty); it's actually Frances (Fanny). Our Heroine in \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price, and she is the eldest daughter, and in true Jane Austen fashion, the eldest daughters and sons are usually named for the parents.

I found myself wanting to throw this novel away halfway through, when Hatty was being falsely accused of all that nonsense. Blah, blah, blah. I decided to persevere, and found it interesting, though as others remark, too, too Dickensian.But that ending!!! WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? What a let-down! Ending up with Godwit? Pullease! It certainly made Camber look even more an idealistic fool than before. And that letter with the reference to Hatty dying young--why even include that? We all would rather just have her drift away as part of that time period without being forced to contemplate mortality. And why that letter from the present anyway?

It was extremely frustrating to step on a scale one minute and see a weight and then step on the same scale the next minute and see a weight that was completely different. I wanted to accurately track my progress as I was getting healthy, so I needed a scale that would be dependable and would not make me angry and upset. This scale has not dissapointed me yet because, as opposed to the other scales that I've used, the readings are consistent, it is well constructed, and it matches any bathroom decor because of its predominantly clear base. I have made an investment in my house and an investment in my life by purchasing this aesthetically pleasing and dependable scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate scale!","review":"This scale was a major disappointment. I was excited to order this scale, especially being a Weight Watchers member-- hoping to watch my progress at home.First, the scale weighed me fairly accurately when i stepped on it for the first time (it was around +0.5lbs). I stepped on a second time and it weighed me +2lbs. I stepped on a third time, it then read +4lbs! And yes, a fourth time showed my weight +8.5lbs!! All 4 weigh ins were done in the same half hour, with no food or drink to vary my weight.I then asked my husband to step on the scale and weigh himself-- and it sent up a \\"error\\" screen every single time he attempted to weigh himself. He weighs around 275lb, and has weighed that consistently for a number of years. I was VERY disappointed because this scale was supposed to be able to weigh up to 330lbs-- hence, why i got it!Thankfully, Amazon excepted my return easily... but it is making me think twice about ordering a weight watchers scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate scale","review":"I bought this scale for myself and a family member both the scales are inaccurate.

You get varying thunder and rain instensity with birds and frogs mixed in at times. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of a strange noise that occurs a few times.

However, if you are the type of reader who likes, lots of hard-edged, foul mouthed in your face tough stuff, this is not the book for you. If you like to see detectives actually detecting with thier brain (rather than other body parts) than this is a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most enlightening book I have ever read.","review":"This book is a brilliant analysis of a side of human nature that we might like to pretend doesn't exist. This is one of the most insightful or enlightening books I have ever read and I am now 71 years old. Although radical Islam wasn't in the world's spotlight when this book was written it certainly applies to what is happening today. I read this book years ago, in fact I can't remember exactly when but my copy looks old and beaten up even I bought it new. More than anything else this book ought to convince you to think independently and not become a follower. What the books points out is that a cause in combination with a charismatic leader has unleashed some of the worst evil the world has ever seen. But more than that the book goes into the psychology and appeal of mass movements and how they get started and why people become part of them. Everybody should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most memorable book on fanatacism I have ever read.","review":"I first read this book while writing my doctoral dissertation, \\"The Fundamental Protestant Radical Right: their views and influences on public education.\\" Of course, I read many other books as well; but Hoffer's small, easily read work stood out from the crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"old but timeless","review":"Although written in the early 1950s, you'd swear it was written last year because the observations on human behavior are so timeless.This book is not about politics, but it belongs in the library of every independent and independent-minded conservative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking, Jolly Good Read","review":"This book is a must for students of political behaviour. His insights are profound, clearly stated and well explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE","review":"Right on when I read it in the '60s and still right on today when there are more true believers than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important","review":"In an age of electing people based on star qualities, Hoffer shows the parallels we share with the Europeans (and Americans) of the 1930's. Hoffer shows that emotion is misplaced when it comes to charting the course of a society, yet is always present in generous measure in those societies that fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic deserving far more attention and respect","review":"Eric Hoffer was not a member of the university snob community---and the latter will never forgive him for writing a book far beyond their pathetic talents. The True Believer transcended the categories of right and left wing. Extremists of either stripe did not have a friend in Hoffer.In fairness,however, I must concede that there are often advantages in acquiring a formal degree. Few can overcome the deficiencies resulting from being a drop out. I would hesitate in flippantly recommending this lifestyle. The Eric Hoffers, admittedly, are always the statistical aberration, never the norm. Nonetheless, when the iconoclastic outsider does it right---they can accomplish greatness. Eric Hoffer did it right and was a giant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound and timely","review":"This copy was to replace my previous copy of True Believer that I loaned to a nephew.I would urge everyone to read The True Believer now to help them understand the jihadist movement we are witnessing in Islam. This book could not be more timely. Eric Hoffer was a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of many reads","review":"Although Hoffer focuses on the tendency of humans to rely on an outside authority, he ends up describing many ways that we limit ourselves and opportunities we have to expand into greater possibilities. He is remarkably concise and pithy. I found many single sentences that struck me with insight into ways I operate from greater freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Pertinent","review":"Length:: 7:59 MinsEric Hoffer was a great man. This book was written in 1951 and it remains instructive and enlightening today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Believer","review":"Read this years ago and it was a mind blower. A clear, concise, well written book that is as valid today as it was 30 yrs. ago. A Philosopher that all can read and understand. His view on the world at that time. Not an author who is trying to impress academia but a brilliant man reaching the masses, at least those who read. Recommended for all thinking people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here but Assertions","review":"This book has many disconnected thoughts and ideas about \\"mass movements\\" but nothing really sticks. He never seems to have compelling arguments for his generalizations. a book on modern social psychology has much better explanations for his concept of \\"mass movements\\". He spends a lot of time dividing people into categories and classifications. If some of his generalizations don't fit some of his examples, he simply dismisses them. The last paragraph of the book, the capstone you might call it, blew me away. What is he saying? The jews, and later the christians, invented 'this malady of the soul' called fanatacism? I don't know what to think or say. Here we go again with \\"the jews started it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably a fine book, if I had the philosophically-oriented mind to fully appreciate it","review":"I wish Hoffer could have lived and written 60 years later than he did. As examples of \\"true believers\\" he mainly had to cite the Nazis, the communists, and the Christian crusaders. I would like to have seen his take on the more contemporary true believers, particularly the jihadist Muslims, the Tea Party, McCarthyism, evangelical Christians of today, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A penetrating insight into the psychology of mass movements","review":"Eric Hoffer offers a penetrating and deeply troubling insight into the psychology of those who allow themselves to fall under the spell of fanatical mass movements --- something to which we are all prone to a greater or lesser extent. At several points, though, I feel Hoffer could have showed greater sensitivity. I simply cannot recognize Hoffer's blanket characterization of Christianity as a mass movement, although there are pathological manifestations of 'religion' with exactly this character. Hoffer wouldn't be the first writer that failed to make the crucial distinction between true religion and organized neurosis. But this at least throws the reader a challenge: Hoffer should make us think very carefully about our motivations for what we 'truly believe'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps some answers about Fort Hood","review":"Following the horrific tragedy at Fort Hood, I felt the need to better understand the mind set of a fanatic (or a true believer) The book by Eric Hoffer offers many insights and has answered many of my questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Selfishness","review":"This book is written from the perspective of our liberal selfish culture and ridicules the idea that people could do more to improve their situation in life by cooperatively working to improve their corner of the world than by working for selfish gain. It is no surprise that this book is so popular given that we live in a selfish liberal culture. My one star review reflects the fact that I am not part of that culture. Numerous books written before the liberal cultural plague explain the value of cooperation. Examples include de Tocqueville, Hobbes, Machiavelli's Discourses, Livy, and of course all religious writing from the Bible to the Analects.Note - I only read the beginning and skimmed the rest since I found it intolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel","review":"I buy books like this for the ideas and insights they they might provide me about people. I got absolutely nothing out of this one. Eric Hoffer over-uses flowery vocabulary which causes his writing to have poor flow. This makes the book unpleasant to read despite its short length.The entire book is a list of pontifications, and I found no eye-opening revelations in any of them. It's a book that leaves you feeling like you could have written it better yourself. I can imagine no point in the history of mankind where this book would have been considered insightful, useful, or necessary. Pure drivel.To be fair, the title does say \\"thoughts\\", and that is all it is; a collection of thoughts that could as easily have been yours as Hoffer's. The references used are good for little more than allowing you to cock your head, raise an eyebrow, rest an index finger across your lips, and say, \\"Hmmm\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"why men will do the unthinkable","review":"Mr.Hoffer explains the conditions under which men are able to accept philosophies like communism. fundamentally, it is a result of sheer hopelessness. He makes his case very well, and the book has withstood the test of time. Mr Hoffer was a longshoreman, and becam famous during the Presidency of J.F.Kenned"},{"rating":"2","title":"We ignore this at our peril","review":"A society in which this book is widely read would be a far safer place than a society trained in diversity classes. The biggest cure for group hatreds is general prosperity. If our current prosperity should end, we will need to understand this book to rationally work against mass movements. The most important chapter, for those who look down on participants in mass movements is the discussion on the care and feeding of intellectuals. Given that Sartre supported Stalin and Heidigger supported Hitler, we might want to be cautious about our own susceptibility to mass movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late 1950s LeGrand...HOT!","review":"The \\"editorial review\\" shown above is inexplicably mismatched and half of it has nothing to do with \\"LeGrand Jazz\\"! The first \\"listener review\\" is the correct one. This classic session is from circa1958--not the generation afterward. Very swinging; inspired arranging. The finest jazz musicians on the scene (in a significant year for memorable jazz records)--you'll hear them on this session! Michel from early in his career. Short tracks are the only drawback; musically, it wails. This music was first released on vinyl LP, long before the digital era. That may explain the typically brief length of the pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Too few people know Michel Legrand, and half of those don't as a jazz musician. The understated name this master has mostly came from 1960s soundtracks:The Thomas Crown Affairis most well known.Legrand's arranging is indelible. He has American swing and European elegance. We now think of crime jazz as a cleche, but Legrand's work of the era showed that cloak and dagger, swingin' pad sound really did exist. Just ask his horns.On Legrand jazz, his stamp is put on standards. This album was made in the 1950s, before he wrote the sophisticated structures for his brilliant film scores. \\"Night In Tunisia,\\" and \\"Round Midnight\\" are here.To me these sound more like cool jazz. It does have dramatic flair: not as much as Legrand developed in the 1960s. The arrangements here remind me of Gil Evan's. Not surprising: my copy has Legrand sitting next to Miles Davis."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a huge disappointment","review":"I can't believe that I am only the second 1-star review; this book is a complete waste of your time and money! I expected to receive a book filled with diagrams and instructional pictures and this book has neither. There isn't even a mention of how to install the engine and transmission and important items, like installing your pedals, is limited to TWO paragraphs in the whole book! This book is great for learning about the history of hot rods and seeing some cool cars, but if you're serious about building a hot rod, you need to find another book, this isn't the one you need. I'm just SO disappointed in this book - the 4 & 5 star reviews on this book are completely misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely helpful","review":"I'm really glad that I read this book before I started building a hot rod. In addition to all of the technical advice, it prompted me to ask myself some important questions about what I really wanted to build. The layout of the book is very good and is very well written and illustrated. Unlike most magazine articles and other books, it even has a pretty thorough listing of parts and prices for a sample hot rod. That gave me a good place to start when I was trying to figure how much my hot rod would cost to build. All in all I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in building or having a hot rod built."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same as Boyd Coddingtons - but a little better.","review":"Boyd Coddingtons Hopw to Build a Hot rod\\" is a 99% word for word copy of of this and you won't notice unless you read the fine print at the top of the page. A few photo's have been changed (same cars in different colours) and some big pictures have been added between chapters. I think this \\"the original\\" is better as it has an extra paragraph here and there and also has some costs that are not included in this version. Boyd Coddington had nothing to do with the other book except writing the intro. Although a really good book it is not really that comprehensive, they show you how to build certain types of chassis. As an intro to rods even if you are not building this book is easy to read and a good read at that. I did like \\"How to Build a Traditional For Hot Rod\\" by Mike Bishop and Vern Tardel is not as pretty and although at first I didn't like it, after more reading I found it has a lot more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't a Low Budget Guide","review":"This book has some very good information, but it is also written for those with far deeper pockets than mine. I believe a person could copy what he sees and come out with a decent Hot Rod, however it seems the majority of the work is dropped off with a shop and a blank check with the directions Make it pretty. I can see where the Rat Rod Rebellion comes from, this is a high dollar endeavor where the thickest wallet wins."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book","review":"This book does not show hot to build a hot rod, just differnt types. no real techincal data. pass on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pooh and Tigger too!","review":"Both child and parent friendly.

Also, I use only corded mice because I'm on my laptop almost all the time and lose the mouse if it's not attached ... (I know, I know...)The reliability is so bad that I have taken to buying 4 at a time and just tossing when one goes bad, it happens that often. Am on my computer all day so it does get a workout, but it's not unusual to have to replace in 6 months. I don't mess with warranties but figured I should have a box in the corner of my office and one day ship all my dead mice back to Logitech and see what happens.But - I really do love the mouse and it's worth the replacement cost to me - nothing else comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac Mouse is horrible.

If you plan on leaving your computer on for extended periods of time and then coming back to it to do some work you may find that your scroll wheel no longer scrolls pages. I have had to on several occasions unplug and replug in my mouse in order to get the scroll wheel working again. This is absolutely UNEXCEPTIBLE Logitech! What happened to Logitech?

It's much stiffer than the middle button on Logitech's other mice and may give you a bruise if you try to use it too much.Also, the acceleration was very different from most mice. It can undoubtedly be adjusted in software preferences, but I fail to see the justification for a mouse that doesn't work out of the box these days.After trying this mouse for a couple of hours I returned it and got myself a trusty MX-310. No surprises there, just a good mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mouse","review":"This mouse replaced one which looked very similar to it but was an IBM mouse. I replaced the IBM mouse with this one because my system would frequently boot and the mouse would not work and I had to unplug then replug it in. This mouse does not have that problem. I love it! It is very accurate in moving around and it just plain works good and it fits my hand nicely with it's ergonomic design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Navigational Ease and Comfort","review":"The Logitech MX 400 Performance Laser Mouse is by far an ergonomically superior tool.

It it not as heavy as those bricks which are so popularly called gaming mice. I have tried a Razor before and it was I constantly kept feeling its weight. This one, you will get used to soon and then later on you would definitely want to look at the thing under your hand when even you are not using this mouse (like working at a lab or someone else's computer) because this mouse will pamper your hand like a glove and make you used to its comfortable grip and design that you would feel that grip on this mouse is the only way a mouse should be used, the weight also disappears.

I expected the writing to be good, but it's nearly perfect. Robinson has created highly believable characters and a story line that grips from beginning to end.

It was a great visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as hoped","review":"I read this book in hopes of giving to my Grandma as it sounded like somthing she would enjoy. In the end however, I found it trite and frankly boring. The characters were far too one-dimensional for me to dredge up any sympathy or interest.

But that's just me :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"This was an interesting attempt to tell the story of a woman's life and loves. I thought the parts in the present, about her marriage to Paul and visit to his family, were excellent.

That being said, so are Settle Up, Dislocation, Bark No Bite, Oceans of Envy, Made to Be Broken, and basically the rest of the album.It's a completely different sound than anything else they've done, and I think they took a turn for the better.

But I tend to favor songs that don't make it to the radio to be played over and over and over agian, and that's why this CD is the best. ALL of the songs are phenomenal! I've waited a while for new stuff from the band, (It seems like FOREVER since Economy of Sound was released), and every song on DIS/LOCATION is just awesome.

Basically, anything without words works for me, but I especially like the mixture on this of classic music and subtle nature sounds (crickets, rain, waves, etc.) I suspect this would also be good for meditating and sleeping as it is very relaxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift","review":"This was given as a gift to someone in another country.

The shipping was top-notch, and expedient. One question I had was if the hand guard was also metal, and it is. The blade is standard steel, and painted black. It's weight is 4.5 lbs, and the handle is well-wrapped, as playing around with it has not affected the wrapping in the slightest. The chain in the back also does not feel like a \\"cheap imitation.\\" If you're a fan of bleach as I am, and you're even contemplating this sword, you really should give it a shot. It's a great buy for the money, and it's guaranteed to wow your friends, especially if they are under 5'8\\" (the length of the sword). Hope this review helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would rate it 4.7/5","review":"I agree with other positive reviews such as:Very well made, worth the price, etc.Adding to that,From what I received:What I didn't like was the word \\"china\\" inscribed on the blade (near the hand guard). It would have been better if it was inscribed behind the hand guard or somewhere else besides the blade.Other note:There's some difficulty in taking out from the sheath and putting back into the sheath.68\\" ver.

When the box arrived I noticed it was NOT solid. I oppened it to find another box inside that was in poor shape. I opened that box to fin my sword. The blade was all dinged up, the handle was snapped off, and to top it off the sheath was completely shattered. A total waste of money. I regret even opening the page let alone ordering it.Bottom line, there are better things to buy than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fabrication.","review":"I just received my slicing moon sword and after reading the other reviews my expectations were high. After I opened the box I pull the sword out and the chain was not the style in the picture, it was held on by a key ring. The chain links are also a different style, and there is an object that looks like a lions head on the end of the chain also held on by a key ring. The handles wrapping was very poorly done. The blades quality was also lacking. I am very disappointed in the overall quality of the sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed replica!","review":"This is possibly the best replica I have ever seen, and now that I own it I can say without a doubt that it is of high quality. The blade is as black as midnight and came sharp enough to maim anybody who crosses you, so long as you're outdoors where it can actually be wielded! The blade goes all the way to the end of the handle where the chain attaches and it has four pins holing it to the handle. The protector is metal as well, though the red handle beneath the wrappings is plastic. Still, it bends very little (maybe a half inch when held sideways) and is quite sturdy. This should not be a gift for a minor or anybody dumb enough to try using it because it CAN hurt somebody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tensa Zangetsu","review":"All around good sword. The only complaint I have is about the giant crack in the sheathe. The crack looks like someone grabbed the sheathe then tried to break it over their leg but was unsuccessful in the attempt.

Not only was this book badly written, but even the professor was frustrated with the terseness of the material. My opinion is that if this is a textbook, one should not need a PhD to read and understand it. Unfortunately however, the authors assume that either you already know everything there is to know about the subjects that they are trying to explain, or that you have read all of the papers that they have ever published and are familiar with their work (from which they draw most of the examples of the book). In summary, if you want a good textbook about forest ecosystems, you will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition","review":"If you already know about the civil war in Lebanon then this book is a wonderful way to get a different perspective.

I use it while on the treadmill and it keeps me motivated and going. The only con (although I reach for this music each time I workout) is that after listening to it for a while it feels a bit monotonous and you can't tell when one song has ended and the other started as it is not in English. I tend to use songs as cues to see how far I am in my workout, so with this one I just lose myself in the music and keep on until it ends! And, that's one long workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm conservative and I DISAPPROVE of this book","review":"Sorry Limbaugh boy, but calling the media liberal even when it supports rightwing lunatics is nothing more than blissful ignorance.

There will no meltdown of the liberal media because the conservatives DESPARATELY NEED the liberal media to survive to keep third party candidates off the ballot, and dupe the masses into believing that modern Liberalism and Conservatism are different political ideologies (they both came from the same philosophers, Hegel and Machiavelli). Writers such as Bozell, Liberal or Conservative are merely pawns of the Demopublican/Republicrat elitists.

In this story he develops two protagonists with a possible third player, but to even try to describe the story beyond the basics may be difficult.Killing people for hire is not easy..or simple. It apparently takes training. There is a craven, smart, well trained killer for hire out there whose effort becomes understood and appreciated by criminalists in our midst.

Perry writes well, but sometimes too much - you'll hit a couple of slow spots, but should be able to skim through/past the extraneous detail easily.

I found this book contains far too much background and theory and far too little of the straightforward solved examples.Although this may be a wonderfully written book for a graduate student or professor to \\"brush-up\\" on their knowledge, it lacks in its ability to start from scratch and actually lay out the fundamental technique.

This is always a bit disappointing; one prefers to be surprised in the end.

Most of them are really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her better books.","review":"I've read about 7 or 8 Poirot mysteries and this one just didn't impress me much. Character developlement was weak, plot was muddled, and the story lacked the intensity that I have seen in many of her other books. I found myself missing the excellent quality of her 20's and 30's mysteries. If your a big fan, you might as well read it but don't expect anything like The ABC Murders or The Mysterious Affair at Styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"One of Agatha Christie's worst. Painfully obvious who the killers were, and the middle was repetitive and not very interesting. It beats some other books, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcover?","review":"The description clearly states this is hardcover. But the book that arrived is paperback. I'm disappointed as I would have preferred hardcover and thought that's what I was ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A particularly uncaring and sociopathic villain in this one.","review":"The choice of murder victim in this book is a little different than most Christie victims. The scene is an English village and the murder occurs at a Hallowe'en party for pre-teens. The murder victim was a 13 year old girl, who was known for talking too much, and for making up untrue stories. Aridane Oliver is at the party and when the young girl is found dead, she calls her old friend Poirot to come to solve it. Poirot discovers a killer who is totally without normal human feelings, and more people die or are found dead before he unmasks the true villain. This is late-Christie type fair, but the plot line is tight and there are a number of red herrings to keep the reader guessing. It's interesting to read Christie's take on young people of the late 60's too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the personal touch","review":"I love Fall Guy, but I still miss her boyfriend and his wonderful German shepherd.

I had read some of her earlier books, but this is her best to date. She weaves an interesting mystery -- it's not cookie-cutter like so many of them out there.PI Rachel Alexander is chosen by an NYPD detective as the executor for his estate who tragically dies in a fatal gun-cleaning \\"accident.\\" Rachel barely knew the cop, which adds to the overall mystery as to why he chose her.I found that they mystery became more and more intriguing and the ending was quite a surprise. A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Shadows of One Mind","review":"Zane Bond has the unique ability to wander through the fields of his mind unhindered by all the mazes, between sunny knolls & mud flats, through happy times and those which are painful. He has allowed his reader the chance to not only get into his private world, but to see, first-hand the workings of a mind teetering on the edge. With the help and support of his loving family, friends, and a few total strangers he has managed to not only survive the nightmares of his bi-polar disorder, but to enlighten us all. Many thanks to this courageous man."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fast-forward ride!","review":"A life & death struggle to survive the mental illness of manic/depression.Reviewing a memoir about a manic/depressive's story is a challenge. Be forewarned this book is one helluva fast-forward ride!I guarantee during the time it takes you to read A PROPHET OPERATING AT A LOSS, you will not see your life in the same way, & perhaps, never the same way again!For the most part, Zane Bond is coherent & articulate - until you think about what he has written & then you get a whiff of seething synapses & the taste of burnt brain cells.Zane Bond has a way with words & has been considerate of his readers by keeping his paragraphs short, even though the leaps between them sometimes seem like black holes. His chapters range through a forest of memories, philosophies & insights.While I occasionally became lost or overcome, A PROPHET OPERATING AT A LOSS is a remarkable effort that will leave you breathless & thinking! What more do you want from a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"out of the box\\" reading!","review":"This book offers an interesting perspective into a distorted mind, similar in fashion to the movie \\"A beautiful mind\\". Normal people have a hard time imagining the way a schizophrenic or manic depressive mind operates. This book opens a window into the thought processes of Zane Bond, who suffers from manic depression and an odd sense of humor. He frankly discusses his travails over the years to overcome the urges. Zane Bond is not a genius like John Nash, but nevertheless if you found the Nash story insightful, you'll find this one equally so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It took me only 30 minutes to read this short selection of mother-in-law tales of woe.

This particular 1987 CD is remastered from a fascinating source, and we are all indebted to Dr Robert Seletsky who has provided so much information relevant to Callas. The source here was a tape copied directly from the original for tenor Kraus right after the Lisbon performance, without any EQ errors. Kraus first gave it to a record producer who issued it on LP in the 1970s and later sold it to EMI, who issued it on LP [EMI and Angel] in 1980. I have these LPs are they are the best live recordings imaginable - a revelation. Dr Seletsky continues: EMI transferred it nicely to CD in 1987 [the recording listed here on Amazon] though ruining it in a dreadful 1997 remastering.This 1987 CD is out of print and rarely appears for sale, and should be snapped up when available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"We received this order on the same day we received the notice of shipment after we had waited several days for it.

The pots look nice and are a nice weight but we are returning them because they are useless to us without the lids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This album's main flaw is that it has no substance. I can understand his genuine effort to make good folk music. However, his songs are just plain bad. Being that I am a musician, I hate to criticize others who have passion, but that is clearly lacking on this album. The guitar work is nothing to brag about, and the vocals are usually annoying. Songs like \\"There's a Last Time For Everything\\" leave you wondering what you were just listening to, while \\"Je T' Adore\\" makes you wonder what in tarnation he was thinking. I suppose this album is Bob's attempt at showcasing his hopeless romantic-turned partially gifted storyteller qualities, but it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"when nature calls, you resond with FORCE","review":"Do you remember when that woman in tie dye puts up her left leg in that one tide commercial??? That's EXACTLY what this whole movie is like. Sandra Bullock, as usual, put up a very strong performance, but Ben Affleck (who in this movie was KINDA HEAVY AND NOT TOO SWEET) was a weak point. But anyway, back to the Tide analogy. So in the commercial, the woman gives a little scream, sways back and forth, looks like she's going to be sick, and then instead pulls a rabbit out of the dryer. Just like this movie because it's not that good until the end, and then JUST LIKE A MAGIC TRICK it all works out in the end. Still overall, I would call this a weak movie that should best be avoided.... unless you use tide and love rabbits like ME!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forces of Nature","review":"A good cast but appaling film. It was unbelievable and predictable, I fast forwarded most of it. I mean, who has a weding in a middle of a tornado?

The two have zero chemistry together; Steve Martin and John Candy had a lot more in the similar-themed Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), which was a lot funnier as well. Even a scene where Affleck dances in a gay bar, which has potential for laughs, falls flat. At least Steve Zahn, as Affleck's best man, is funny.

The plot seems ok at first but as the movie progresses it doesn't really build up to an anticipated climax. The relationship between Bullock and Affleck is forced and does not come naturally. It seems as if there is not much passion or forbidden love between the two the way the movie builds it up to be. I think Affleck made the right choice at the end though, because the girl he chose was prettier and seemed like she would be more stable and faithful to her man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I have a beautiful home theatre which I spent over$50,000.00 on.

If you're interested in a good travel-hishaps movie, do yourself a favor and check out the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"PeeYew","review":"Totally exaggerated humor. Bullock, as always, is very pleasing to look at. However, her acting and plot in this film are dependent upon the extent that the viewer is willing to believe in a world without values.

What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete mess!","review":"Forces of Nature is probably my least favorite film of Sandra Bullock's career. There's nothing wrong with her performance, she is funny and brilliant as always but to me Ben Affleck's wooden acting ruined this so-so film. There are parts of this film I like and parts I do not. The film has a week premise and never takes float, the ending is disappointing and the writing is sloppy.

However it seems dave has returned to some of the stuff he was doing in the 80's. by that i mean the sometimes overuse of all these synth sounds.....he is becoming less acoustic. The solos are obviously great but the actual melodies are sometimes lacking. but the addition of a horn section is great. The best tracks are 1,2,4,5,10,11. the rest seem to just wander into the neither here nor there basket.

It isn't very funny or entertaining. These two characters go through a series of adventures that aren't interesting. The big running joke is that one character can never get anything to eat. How funny is that? There is also an embarrassing, juvenile storyline about one of the characters prowess with women and his beautiful wives.

But whether you like the film or not? This Chinese import version is HORRIBLE! The picture looks as though someone turned out the lights during filming, and the scenes are so dark, it's nearly impossible to see what's going on at all? The sound quality is even worse than the picture, with at least a two to three second delay between what you see on the screen and what you hear? Meaning that you see the actors saying their lines, but have to wait a few seconds to hear what they actually said. I'm not sure when, or even if the movie will finally be released to DVD by a legitimate, region 1 studio? But do yourself a favor and wait it out. Because having this version is far worse than not having it at all, no matter how badly you'd like to add it to your collection? (2 used & new from 78 bucks?

Alternately stilted and maudlin, frequently jingoistic, it hardly bears any resemblance to the witty and brittle Noel Coward we're used to. It also seems a filmed play rather than a work intended for the screen.The one thing the film has going for it is its evocation of period, but then, 1933 wasn't so very far away from the historical events depicted in the movie. The little musical hall styled vignettes seem authentic enough.This isn't a gloriously restored print but it's adequate.

Can't wait till I get rid of this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The little vacuum that couldn't","review":"I have had this vacuum over a year now, and I hate it.One of the first things I noticed was that the motor wasn't powerful enough to keep the roller spinning over carpet. The roller stops if the carpet level changes any. Within the first month the roller broke and I paid $17 to replaced it. It still gets caught on carpet. Not only that but it doesn't fully sweep in a track. By that I mean you can see the lines where it misses. You have to go over, and over, and over to get everything up.It's also very heavy. The tubes are way too short and the hose pops off all the time. The filters get clogged awfully fast and I have to wash them every 5 vacuumings. The suction spits kitty litter out the back. It's loud and noisy. The cord is too short.The whirlwind action in the receptacle cup doesn't work and dirt flies up into the filter clogging it. Just the other day the carpet height level mechanism completely broke off!!I just simply despise this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I've had this vacuum for one year and had to replace the roller brush 4 times! The 1st 3 I got free from the company and the last I had to buy for $25. They claim the roller is not covered under the warranty. The roller will seize up and melt after about 3 months, the last one I got has lasted me one month. I will NEVER buy another Bissell product again. There customer service stunk and when I took it to an authorized dealer he told me thats what happens when it picks up hair.... uh, duh it's a vacuum, what is it supposed to be picking up... fairy dust? Don't waste your time or money on this hunk of junk! I just went out and bought a Hoover, I hope I have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many things I DON'T like...","review":"This vac is great if you want one that will work wonderfully for about a month. The filters clog weekly, we bought an extra set and need to rinse them often. We have cats... when you try to suck up cat litter or any thing like sand or dirt, this vac spits some of the granules out the back. It's also crummy on uneven surfaces. Our house has 1853 wide plank floors that are not perfectly flat and this vac misses everything in the depressions. The hose is very short, not long enough to do a normal flight of stairs without having to lug this heavy thing halfway up them. The tools are rather cheap, the brush scratches everything. This vac has so much LESS suction than the 25 year old Kenmore canister we bought the Bissell to replace it's really surprising. BUT, what did I expect when I bought a $89. vac? I'm saving up for another Kenmore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum for the price","review":"I bought the Bissell 35932 vacuum for $79.99 at Amazon.com. This is a great vacuum for that price. The suction power is amazing. Works great on bare floor as well as carpet. It got a LOT of dirt from my clean looking carpet. The equipment comes with a free replacement HEPA filter too - in case your first one wears out too soon.The only complain I have for the vacuum is that the dust container is not easy to clean. Its plastic, and so you can not clean it too easily - if you clean it with a wet sponge, you have to wait for it to dry before you use the equipment again, since paper towels do not usually do a good job on such plastics.Assembling was very very easy. All I needed was a screw driver to connect the easy-to-fit handle with the base unit.I highly recommend this to any one looking for a vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meltdown","review":"This vacuum seemed to be a great deal when I bought it, First thing went was the belt, you can smell it burning. I figured thats OK since it a wear out item. Next the side of the roller started to burn, and smelled up the whole house. I figures I would buy a roller but when I opened the bottom, the roller assembly was also burned, so you could not put another roller in it. I just put it the trash. Didn't bother calling Bissel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially Useless after 6 months use.","review":"I would not buy this vacuum if I had to do it again. I had the same problem that other customers reported with the roller getting stuck. Even after checking to make sure there is no hair caught up in it, it still doesn't budge. I went over a carpet patch where there was a small but visible ball of dog hair lying loose on top of the carpet and even after going back and forth over it MANY times not a single bit of it was picked up by this vacuum. Plus, each time I use it I spend(waste) an absurd amount of time cleaning every filter, the roller and even unscrewing the base to clean it out = hoping it will result in greater suction but the performance has still been declining since the first use. These are the reasons this vacuum is cheap, but if it only lasts for six months before losing all suction I think you'd get more for your money by saving up for a more expensive vacuum that lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vaccum ever","review":"I concurr with the other reviews.

An inspirational classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've turned to this book for 22 years and I love it!","review":"In 1982, my freshman college roommate saw that I was going through a rough time, and bought a copy of \\"God Calling\\" for me (I had been reading hers). I have turned to this devotional book constantly for more than 22 years! I have given copies to my sister and to my mother, when they were facing difficulties in their lives. Whenever the need to hear God's voice arises, I say a prayer and open this book. I often feel that God is talking directly to me through the words that I find in \\"God Calling\\". The encouragement and assurance offered in this book has carried me through many ups and downs. I will continue to share \\"God Calling\\" with anyone whom I feel is in a \\"place\\" in their lives to accept God into their hearts. If you wish to hear God's voice, you will find it within this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book has Turned My Life Around!","review":"Chronically ill with a degenerative bone disease, I was depressed and beyound hope. Nothing held meaning for me. The Bible seemed too harsh and I had a hard time relating to it. Then a friend gave me a copy of this book, and it has completely turned my life around. I have given away dozens of copies to friends and family. And they all constantly tell me how much it has meant to them and also buy copies for their friends!

It is my all time favorite book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"I was given this jewel from a friend last year.

My readings are my daily gift to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to God","review":"Daily examples of what you might hear if you quiet your mind and wait upon God's voice to whisper in your ear.

Avoid this deceptive book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is highly deceptive!","review":"If you read the two prefaces carefully, you will note that the second one refers to the \\"two listeners\\" receiving physic messages through automatic writing or channeling! This is cleverly hidden in one sentence. Therefore, the \\"sweet\\" messages one may receive from this book may NOT be from our Lord, but the angel of light. Why? Because there is little substance to the book itself. It keeps one from reading what the Christian ought to: the Bible! Dear Christians, use your discernment. Don't waste your time on this book when the source is so questionable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next To Bible BEST!","review":"God Calling is the most precious book I own next to the very Word of God, the Bible!

This book is truly inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's way of talking to us.","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a way to have God speak to you. Everytime I read a passage I find that God is talking directly to me.

As a counselor, I have many books, not all read in depth, but intending to. I brought God Calling to my bedside table and spent time the next morning going through it. I must tell you honestly, as a long term student of the Course in Miracles, this book has taken equal status. I do not start my day without it. How profound to hear the words that go immediately about their job of opening my heart and helping me to listen to the wisdom , not just listen but to feel it. I have always asked for help from God, now I feel very genuinely answered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is a must for people that don't have much time for reading Bible studies.

I just recieved this book and after only reading a few insights from the Lord, I knew this to be the real deal. I am a fundamental Christian who is skeptical toward outside sources other than the bible and this not only correlates with scripture, it seems to fill in some of the cracks I had regarding my faith. I believe the Holy Spirit lead me to this book at a much needed time in my life. This book is very inspiring and it lets you know if you ever had any doubts that the precious, most beautiful Lord Jesus Christ is absolutely head over heels in love with ALL of us!! Maranatha!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very presumptuous","review":"This book is based on \\"revelations\\" given to two women that were reported to the author. The author and the women considered them to be direct revelations from God, so the passages are made to sound like they are authoritative as if from scripture. There are examples in almost every passage. For ex, today (April 14):\\"My Children, I guide you always. The walking in the way may not be always carried out, but the guiding is always so sure.\\"This book is the height of presumption- as if these words are God's words. Typical of most mass media protestants, he says things that sound good at first pass if you are predisposed to like it; but if you reflect on what he says it often doesn't mean anything and when it does, it's not very deep or thought provoking.The author and the receivers of these revelations needed a dose of humility."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timely Word","review":"This journal speaks a fresh word to me each day. It is as though a prophet of God has sat with me and ministered to me a fresh word from the Lord. I would recommend this book or journal to anyone who is seeking God, or who may be going through a difficult time in their walk with Him. Our God is a very present help in time of need and this journal is just one tool He uses to give that help."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been a blessing in my life.","review":"This inspirational confection has given me great comfort in times of need and has guided me in my mediations toward an attitude of joy and gratitude. It should be noted that these daily meditations were used as the basis for the writing of the 24 Hours A Day book (published in 1954) used in many Alcoholics Anonymous meetings throughout the world. I intend on giving this book to as many people as possible to spread the Word throughout the fellowship of mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! It's Magic","review":"I bought and read this book. I found it mesmerizing and very magical. However, this book is not of God. These two listeners \\"channel\\" a spirit to deceive the readers to think they are hearing from God."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have great concerns","review":"What struck me odd at the beginning of this book is statement, that writings in the book are not verbally inspired. And at the same time they write in first person meaning it is Jesus Himself speaks. So it is: \\"Thus saith the LORD...\\". How it can be not inspired?\\"Jesus Calling\\" was inspired by this book. It is full of Scriptures. That's makes it different, more useful.And why meditate on something that is not inspired?Other reviewer said right: meditate on inspired Word of GOD.

I'm giving Barbour Publishing, and any other publisher that is printing edited down versions of this book 1 star or less. I have a paperback edition that was printed by Jove Books in 1978. I just got a new hardcover edition printed by Barbour in 2000. I was going to throw out my tattered paperback, but I did a coursory comparison of a couple entries and discovered the new Barbour hardback entries all had entire paragraphs removed. And from a spritual point of view, they were VERY IMPORTANT paragraphs. Upon investigating, MANY of them have had sentances and paragraphs removed. You're better off going to a book store, and looking for an edition that that says \\"this book contains the complete text of the original hard cover...\\". The passages have completely new meanings when you read the full text as God intended.

This journal has been such a source of encouragement to him and he revisits it often! The two listeners are 2 women who seem to really be in touch with God's heart. They use God's Word, but the way they convey His principles . . . it is so easy to comprehend. The journal is beautiful and the words are so encouraging and meaningful. We purchased a replacement copy for my husband - FINALLY! - and purchased 2 more for dear friends who are going through difficult times in their lives. This journal is a must-have and has been such a source of encouragement and truth!!! Perfect for a man or woman, the words ring true with God's Word, but written in a way we can all understand, thus making it easily applicable to our lives. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Communication from the Lord","review":"This little book is surprising in its Spirit-led content.

He loves it although it does tend to fall apart. But here is the kicker: after seeing it online and at Toys-R-Us for around $50, I found it at the clearance display at my local Wal-Mart for $2.50. That's right--$2.50! They had over a dozen, along with a bunch of other Star Wars Trilogy stuff from last year. When I asked the clerk why these were $2.50, she said they were told to clear out all of last year's Star Wars stuff to make room for the new toys coming out for the new movie in May 2005. So shop around first before plunking down big bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Our 7 year old son purchased this toy after saving up his birthday money. $50 is an expensive toy for a 7 year old, but he decided that it was worth it. After all, the TIE fighter his brother bought with his birthday money has been a great toy.Unfortunatly, the Millennium Falcon did not live up to his (or our) expectations. Almost immediately after putting it together, we realized that there was a problem. Anything that was supposed to open wouldn't stay closed. Parts were literally falling apart every time the toy was moved.Long story short, within the first hour of opening the box, the toy had gone back into the box and my son had written a letter to Hasbro outlining his disappointment. The next day we returned the toy to the store for a refund.The good news is that our son learned a life lesson- things are not always what they look like on the box. The bad news is that other people might actually waste their money on this sorry toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. As soon as I started helping him put it together, I could tell it was a piece of junk. Everything you touch falls off. The landing gear can't even support the weight of the ship. The gun constantly falls off. It's nice to look at, but if your child expects to play with it-don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"What a piece of junk. My 4 1/2 son has been begging for this ship. How disappointing it was for my husband and I to explain why Santa gave him a broken toy. None of the pieces stayed on. My 2 1/2 son wanted it also. We thought it would be too old for him. So, much to our delight, we found a Millenium Falcon made by Playskool. It was much for durable and all pieces stayed in tact. We will be taking back the one by Hasbro and buying the Playskool one for my 4 1/2 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Landing gear falls off very easily. The bombay door doesn't even attach. I took it back to the store and tried five other ship and could not get one of the bomby doors to stay on.The good part is the sounds and lights are excellent. Lots of space. I prefered the original over this one though, better constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but very poor qualilty!","review":"We bought this spaceship for our 4 1/2 year old son. Pieces literally fell apart before he even got the Star Wars figures inside it. The gunner won't stay together, the large hatch door would not stay connected and the landing gear wouldn't stay attached. Overall it was very frustrating and disappointing considering how much we paid for it. It would be great fun if it would stay together. We traded it in for the Hasbro's Junior version of the Millennium Falcon which was a big hit and seems to be much more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bucket of Bolts","review":"My six year old son was so excited to get this for Christmas, he had been wanting this for about 6 months and he was thrilled to have received it.Unfortunatley due to the poor quality of this toy after about 2 days this has been stuck in the closet due to his frustration. The pieces keep falling off. The door on the bottom of the craft cannot stay attached and the gun on top falls off as well. The toy itself looks great and has nice detail but unfortunatley its sturdiness lacks.The X-Wing Fighter is a much better toy.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a great toy!","review":"this is a very cool toy, it has a opening cockpit and back. plus a secret floor board for them to hide in! overall it has lights and sounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Falcon delivers again","review":"After reading many mixed reviews for the new Millennium Falcon ship-i decided to go ahead and buy it. I found some of the parts to be a little flimsy but overall an excellent piece. the decals are good-keep in mind-no toy is designed to be an exact replica so if you are one of those people who demands perfection this is not for you. the electronics are awesome-it really is not meant to be played with as some pieces do tend to fall off-but for 39.99 you won't find a better value for this ship-buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It","review":"This book tries to cover as much about Rexx as possible in one book. It succeeds well considering the challenge.PROS: Thorough coverage of the Rexx language. Lots of coding examples, good tutorial, very comprehensive reference material. Covers some special topics like interfaces, programming style, error-handling techniques, and portability issues. Includes a lot on Windows and Linux. I had fun with the section on how to program my handheld using Rexx -- yah!CONS: Contains two-plus chapters on object Rexx, but some more advanced material would be helpful. Found some typos, but nothing important.CONCLUSION: Just about every Rexx programmer would benefit from having a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"Being a programmer (rather new to Rexx), I would recommend this book to New and Intermediate programmers of Rexx.

This book is well worth the cost and a great companion to have along side with your other programming reference books."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the true romantic!","review":"The story is a very clever twist on the traditional King Arthur legend, telling the story as it might have happened in real life. It describes how these people could have become the enchanting legend we all know today. It uses splendid storytelling and characterization; the men are sharp and believable, the women are beautiful and sincere, and the action is captivating. This book alone turned me into a great Joan Wolf fan, who is a consummate story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me Cry!","review":"I love a story that can make me cry. Arthur and Morgan's touching love was so heartbreaking. You realize just how easy it is to screw up your life.

Evil.","review":"This movie is the most frightening film I've tried to watch with my [...] daughter. It is NOT suitable for very young children. I was rather horrified by just how creepy it is. The juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary \\"spirit\\" is truly bizarre and could;ve been created by someone who in fact HATES children. If you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80's, but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children, be forewarned. This movie is not only bad, it's kinda 'bad'. Like, not in a good way. If children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80's or getting some really weird gift for a friend, then, you know, maybe you'll dig it. I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"After reading the negative and positive reviews, I understand now how unfair the editorial department from amazon were with this movie.I watched it young, I watched it old, and I will have my daughter watch it too! If in any case she needs me, I will be there for any advise and guidance.80s animations(cartoons) are almost unbeatable. Plots were more interesting and far less anoying. Music was really good too. Tv shows were not as well animated, but the movies, and openings really rocked.The Care bears movie is a good example of superb animation, plot and music. It is also a movie that takes kids seriously! I grew up with all these good messages from the past, and plots that made you think!Being a Christian Roman Catholic I can say that the message is inline with what I believe.I highly recommend this movie as a must watch for today's kids that only have bad tv shows to watch today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is one of the best children's movies I have ever seen. I was obsessed with the care bears when I was younger (wallpaper, stuffed bears...everything). Now that they have come back, I couldn't help but fall in love with them all over again. I even asked for the DVD for Christmas ....The movie itself is very cute. It has all the great characters and even their cousins. It makes you just feel warm and happy (like Disneyland). Definitely a great movie for kids, young and old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to be in that care bear family!","review":"I love this movie. this movie was the stuff when I was younger. I saw it recently and it was still good. A classic! The carebears have such a positive and beautiful message to tell children. And that is to love everyone. I love the carebears. they were the best thing in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-rending...","review":"A heart-rending vision of life in the wake of WWII.

I was ecstatic to find it on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for commercial use, but teaches lessons","review":"I totally agree that Amazon's review is VERY sarcastic! It's not right to degrade the movie that teaches children lessons in caring, sharing, and friendship. I watched this as a young child and remember my parents taping it for us to watch. Sure, the animation may be a little sketchy, but who doesn't love the Care Bears? They teach you lessons on friendship and that caring is not something to be forgotten. I loved the care bears and the cousins and wouldn't trade them for the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"I saw this movie when I was about 4 years old. It was a great movie and I recommend it to the little ones. They'd love it. I remember that we only borrowed it and i couldn't part with the movie so we bought it. I'm 12 years old now and i still watch it. That's how good this movie is. I hope my review will help you in making the desicion to buy this heart-warming movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first is always the best","review":"As with any movie the first one is alwayse the best, and this is the case with this Care Bears movie. It is a great video to have and relive some childhood memories of watching the once great tv show. Also it is a good movie that will keep young kids/toddlers interested without any negative messages. All in all a very nice wholesome and entertaining kids movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"My three year old son loves this movie. I read reviews that talked about how walking on clouds was impossible and we should not put these thoughts into our childrens heads. I also read a review that just went on and on about technicalities that do not even matter to kids. The fact is, most children cartoons are based on things that will never happen. Monkeys don't talk in Spanish, but everyone loves Dora. Kids don't care if the words are off with the movement of the mouth. My little boy has watched this movie about 10 times in three days and I watch it with him a lot. I think it is a cute movie. I just want to pick up a care bear and give them a hug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy story, kinda cheesy","review":"I'm not a big prude or anything, but I thought all the stuff about evil forces and possession were a bit much for my 4 year old. I can definately see this causing some nightmares - Especially the part when the \\"possessed\\" or whatever child is chasing the other kids around the old abandoned carnival.... And this is all besides the obvious cheesy-ness of the movie itself. My child loved it, but I was uncomfortable with some of the themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has a scary character","review":"I bought this because our 3-year old gets scared really easily. I thought this would be safe but was I wrong! The evil spirit is really scary and the character, Nicholas, becomes a bit evil under her command. I think the story line is horrible and I dont think kids really learn anything about friendship or anything else from this. I have hidden this movie and I hope our child forgets we have it. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for target audience.","review":"I honestly can't remember the movie itself(I saw it when I was about 6), but I can remember having awful nightmares after seeing it. I guess the villians really got to me, I dunno. IMO, this movie is not appropriate for the audience for which it was aimed.(3-10 possibly) The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars was because it must be fairly memorable if I can still remember my nightmare after all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too scary!","review":"I do not recommend this video for any child under the age of 10. Anyone 11 years and older won't be interested. Too many bad dreams!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexplicable and So Slow!","review":"First, let me say that my 2 year old received this as a gift and really loves it. However, no one else in the family can stand it. The characters are generally mean spirited (except of course for the bears) and no one really cares if they get redeemed. Further, the story moves VERY SLOWWWWLY, and I cannot emphasize this point enough. The story is very convoluted and does little to demonstrate to children what good storytelling can be.

They both loved it and watched it all the time. It was their favorite movie until they discovered Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Now that my children are gown, I have discovered the movie in DVD and have given it to my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it and drives her mother (my daughter) as crazy wanting to watch it again and again, as she did when she was little. I highly recommend this movie for the younger aged children maybe 3-6 years old. It's entertaining for children and has a wonderful story with a great moral at the end. Adults may get bored quite easily, but the time spent sharing the movie with your children will be priceless.

It seems he strays, and avoids staying with scripture for revealation/meaning. This changes the book into a story more about him (author) than God.

I linked it to my cell phone, and it works well for that, but listening around the house this stinks. Drops out constantly, even if you are near the transmitter sometimes.

My hope is that the level of reading is just hard enough to be a challenge but not too frustrating, and this seems to be the case. He is able to read these now with only occasional help.The story line seemed a little thin, leading me to think that some important details were left out of the original. Pictures were OK. And the fact that there are both older and younger characters seems to broaden the appeal of the story, giving each reader someone with whom he or she can relate.I do think these are expensive for the length, but will probably buy some of the other Boxcar books later when he needs more reading matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter Thinks this is Pretty Good","review":"My daughter told me about this book and how she thinks it deserves \\"4 stars\\".

However, the training assumes you have access to a 50-60 ft. round pen, or some other enclosure that could subsitute for one (though it's hard to think of what a good substitute to a round pen would be for these exercises). The DVDs did convince me that a round pen would probably be a worthwhile investment, but until that happens there isn't much I can do.

Seeing GaWaNi go through each step while explaining exactly what he and the horse were doing was extremely helpful - I finally \\"get it\\"! No bells or whistles, this is in to-the-point horse training at it's best, I recommend this DVD to any equestrian ready to move into the most common sense approach I have ever used - and the results are amazing to see.

I was not looking for a rote recital of historical facts and happenings but a top down explanation leading to a general understanding, historical and operational, of the system.

It finds creative language to talk about the hardships of trying to find friends when you are shy and the dangers of being manipulated by more confident children. It is one of the only children's books I can think of that uses an unreliable narrator. It also is unusual in that it deals with friendships between boys and girls and between children and the elderly. The descriptions of the main character's love for the animals in her life are very touching.

If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed.I realize that a film can't replicate a book, but it should at least have an understandable plot and make it clear how the characters fit into that plot. This film fails on both counts. Scenes flash by so fast you barely have a chance to grasp what's going on. Characters appear out of nowhere; you have no idea who they are.Too bad, because this is one of James Lee Burke's most dramatic books--Dave falls off the wagon when his wife dies.

However, it is curious to me why amazon didn't list Alec Baldwin, Mary Stuart Masterson & Teri Hatcher as actors in this movie! However, they do list Baldwin as a producer.The acting is tremendous; the atmosphere is chilling; the opening music score brings the bayou into your living room. And the story is remarkable.

The novel is the second one published (1988) about main character Dave Robicheux. Alec Baldwin as Dave positively nails the complex, achingly human character. If you saw the movie but never read the book, treat yourself by reading the book now, and then watch the movie again. Without exception, all actors cast in the movie accurately reflect their respective characters in the book. I'd love to see a movie version of \\"Tin Roof Blowdown,\\" published in 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pretty Solid Modern 'Noir'","review":"I guess you could call this a \\"neo-noir,\\" which is a modern-day film noir. It has that atmosphere, especially in New Orleans which seems to always be pictured on the seamy side in films. After the devastation that took place there a few years ago (\\"Katrina\\"), perhaps filmmakers will be kinder to the city in future movies.Anyway, a seedy-portrayed New Orleans, some good blues music and five varied-and-all interesting lead characters make this a very watchable movie. Alec Baldwin, Kelly Lynch, Teri Hatcher, Mary Stuart Masterston and Eric Roberts all contribute with good performances All but Roberts are the \\"good guys\\" in this one.The movie keeps your attention and has you involved for most of the two hours. The action is well-dispersed. My only complaint is a small one: Baldwin with the southern accent doesn't sound natural. Otherwise, a good modern-day crime story."},{"rating":"2","title":"back to the bayou","review":"Pretty good damn flick.

Hang in there through at least the first couple of chapters, and if you have any taste you'll love it. :)Wish Modesitt would write more books like this.

The alternate history dimension is the setting in an alternate world where North America is split among Quebec, New France (Mexico in our timeline) and Dutch-founded equivalent of the USA, and Europe is dominated by a ruthless Austro-Hungarian Empire. The fantasy dimension is that ghosts exist, a reality something like the Eqyptian Ka, and can be manipulated by electromagnetic fields. The existence of ghosts is responsible largely for the historical divergences between this history and ours. The suspense thriller aspect is the plot. Unfortunately, while the basic idea is clever, this book is disappointing reading. The plot is rather mechanical, the characterization is thin, and the writing pedestrian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good background but very very boring...","review":"I bought the book because I liked the clever alternate history background in which the story is set.

That prevents any sort of aerobic exercise.It also advertises that it folds up and rolls, which it does, but it's too large to fit under most beds even then, and too bulky and unstable to just lean against a wall.Don't waste your money on this.

I was looking at HSN at the Sprintmaster, but that was over $200. Then I found this which looked exactly like the Sprintmaster for a much lower price. I purchased the Cross Trainer Pro and found out that it was the exact same thing as the Sprintmaster, it just had a different name. The machine is great, and the videos are great as well. As corny as they are, they are motivating and help you get the most out of your workout. I would definitely recommend this machine to anyone. Set up wasn't too bad.

Those books had memorable characters (who can ever forget the corrupt cop, McGregor?), compelling plots, a keen sense of place, and an anti-hero protagonist we could care about. The same can be said for his Alo Nudger series.This book has none of that. It's like a script from a bad TV movie. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the plot is utterly predictable. The final scene is completely illogical. The prose style is prosaic and simplistic--very much unlike the wry, terse style in the Carver books. It wouldn't surprise me if this one was ghost-written.Lutz has won many awards for his earlier detective novels. I suppose he's moved into mass-market commercialism so he can bank some money.

Well, at last. This one is really good looking but much more important, accurate and very easy to read, large numbers on a blue background. It has a leveling dot which floats in the display until you are standing balanced, so that each time, the weight is taken correctly. I haven't programmed it yet, but you don't have to unless you want to track your weight, otherwise it's just a regular scale.

In one remarkable case this morning, I stepped on the scale, got one reading, and stepped on once more and got a reading that was eight pounds -- yes, EIGHT pounds -- higher than the first reading. I have never had such joy chucking an object into the dumspter as I experienced disposing of this horrid piece of crap that took $50 of my hard-earned money and did nothing of what it was built for.

I had actually expected (with a mixture of anticipation and dread) that the book would be mostly about the over-the-top parties of the type we see in the recent movie Keeping Up With The Steins.

The author also introduced 20+ characters, gave each a backstory and started several possible plot lines, but not much else happened.

There are some color photos located in the center of the book. Also the information is repetative and not presented in an interesting way.

To start there are many misprints or typo on several rate constants for the given equation: PV=nRT. The form in which the units are represented can be misleading and at times confusing. Compared to the 7th Edition it is more difficult to answer the exercises and problems at the end of each chapter. Most of the time one must assume ideal gas behavior to answer the questions, however, the instructions do not advise or inform the student they must assume ideal behavior in order to correctly solve the problems or exercises.

First of all, nobody buys a textbook unless they're enrolled in a class that requires it, and my class does. Unfortunately, my instructor is also a former colleague of Atkins, who, by his admission was a madman. Atkins uses notation that no one else uses, words questions in a way that is nearly unintelligible and generally does a poor job of explaining what should be at most difficult - and I get A's in physics, math and chemistry. If you are a professor contemplating using this book for your class - I beg of you, on behalf of your students, please, don't torture them like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Example Problems Please","review":"This book covers basic physical chemistry well as far as I can tell. I am a college junior taking 1st semester p. chem. The problem with this book is the complete lack of any example problems in the text. Doing any but the most basic of the questions in the problems section at the back is a horrendous expierience. Now, I know that there should be difficulty but this is ridiculous. A few well placed sample problems worked out in the text would provide the student with an opportunity to learn the process of approaching these problems.

For that price, it's well worth it.The Kindle edition is poorly typeset, with figures often appearing far from their proper location, and formulas often scaled too small to read without zooming in on them individually. Still more are unreadable due to missing fonts or characters.

This is less than 3 months after the publication of the text. In addition the quality of the derivations, while somewhat better than the 7th edition, are oftentimes difficult to follow, Steps are skipped and it is often assumed that students are not only familiar with mathematical concepts beyond the scope of the course, but that they have the ability to apply these same advanced mathematical abilities to new concepts. In addition many of the problems require you to look up values from non related sources such as the CRC. The solutions manuals have numerous faults and oftentimes use entirely different methods of solving problems than are presented in the chapters.

I thought it would be very much like DW, but with Japanese history and characters. In many ways they are alike, and in some ways they are different and that's still good. The \\"musou\\" attack in SW is sort of a time freeze where you are still in control of your character unlike DW. I thought that was a nice change, although I still like the Musou attack in DW also.In SW it feels like I am constantly trying to figure out where I need to be and I never seem to be close to the right place. The maps are more confusing than DW. It shows an X marking where I need to be, I begin heading that way and find a closed off gate. I am then forced to backtrack, losing mission time.The game is pretty cool in some ways, but I find myself yelling at it more than enjoying it.I would rather play Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...I liked it","review":"I have never played any of Koei's other games, so I have no idea how this one compares with Dynasty Warriors.Personally, I like this game quite a bit. The controls aren't complicated, the hack-and-slash aspect is awesome for those of us who are of a \\"killing first, mission second\\" gaming mindset (like me), and gameplay is not impossible, but also not painfully easy. There's a wide variety of characters (once you unlock them), and the graphics are very lovely.I think some of the character designs could use a little work (like Kuniochi in her sports bra and cargo shorts, or Oichi in her cutesy jailbait anime girl get-up), but all in all, I think the pros outweigh the cons."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever bought in Amazon","review":"The author only writes about him, the book and companies who work around the art world and writes very less on what I think the book is written for: profiting and collecting fine arts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful book of little to no substance.","review":"Aweful book of little to no substance; therefore, it is certainly not worth purchasing or even borrowing.

These filters are not washable or reuseable, so you have to replace them and toss the old one. I love that my Bissell has this filter on it because it keeps my vacuum from kicking up dust, which means I can dust then vacuum and the room stays clean! My only issues was that the replacement filter took a bit of effort to put in into my vacuum, which is good for the seal so dust does not sneak out, but I think it was harder to get in because it was a bit warped.
