His scholarship is impeccable, I can attest to that. His knowledge of ancient Athens, and his ability to make connections between seemingly disparate areas of knowledge, leaves me amazed and humbled. Phillips is doing philosophy, in both a practical and scholarly sense. He makes me realize that you cannot really do great scholarly work without actively engaging in philosophical inquiry, as he does, with people of all walks of life all over the planet. I can see from some of the other comments here that some react hostilely to Mr. Phillips, and I admire him for taking on these people, who remind of the types of ignorant souls who have stood in the way of all redemptive and forward-looking work in virtually every human endeavor. \\"Senor Phillips, ojala un dia tenga la oportunidad conocorlo.

After 3 years as a university professor, I can attest that the path he took is the path I should have taken. This book of his is the book I hoped to write myself. The only way to write a book like this is to chuck the security of academia and throw oneself into the world, engaging with people everywhere, with humility and curiosity, and methodical rigor, as Mr. Phillips has done.

The groups he gathers are largely those who can be fairly described as leftists or liberals in their political thinking. As a result, the entire book is a prolonged rant against the ubiquitous \\"them,\\" the rich, the powerful, anyone who doesn't believe that what they have earned or owned is theirs alone.All of the copious references are to others whose views are similarly skewed.The Socratic method requires active debate to illuminate all viewpoints. This book provides a single, well worn \\"we're oppressed\\" view.

It can hold heavy objects as long as you have no intention of rolling it or moving it while they are inside. For myself it ended up being just an overpriced storage trunk with the added advantage of wheels(that were not strategically placed for anyone over 5'2\\" to pull), and the place for a lock (keep in mind plastic used is NOT durable, so a metal padlock I'd imagine would break through the plastic with a couple good twists.

The \\"hard\\" composite leather feels more like the rubber used for cheap outdoor basketballs, and the \\"soft\\" variety feel much more like real leather.This football is the \\"hard\\" variety, and I can't say I would recommend it unless that happens to be what you are looking for. To it's credit, it is holding together well and came as described. It throws well, but is relatively difficult to catch because of the poor-quality composite it is made with.Having been spoiled by owning a leather ball for so long, I just couldn't stick with this one.

This unit is thin, light and beautiful. You can easily carry it in your shirt pocket and wont be bothered by its weight or size. Screen is bright enough, no problems there. The only reason i have given it 4 rather than 5 stars is cause sometimes it would hang on me and i would have to reset it.

After a single use, or two for the really bad scratches, the discs played perfectly without a skip or hang! I believe the bad reviews must be due to mishandling the discs, or misreading the instructions.NOTE: The big red warning on the disc holder is there for a reason!

I used it 2 times and on the third use, itdid not heat up for at least 5 min. When it finally did heat up it did not feed properly and back flowed glueinside the mechanism. I took the gun apart and cleaned it out and on the next try it gummed up again. Don't by this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but harder to find glue","review":"This product works very well, once you are able to find a place that sells the glue sticks. It has a good handle and feels sturdy. The stand comes with a pad that makes drips easy to clean up.

The unit is flawless, however, when I dump a large load of glue out, sometimes I have to give some time to catch up with the heating more supply. I should have bought two of these, and would definitely purchase again should the need arise.

I put in several sticks of glue but nothing came out. I figured perhaps it was a fluke. Now I finally got around to trying the second one I received and the same thing. The glue will not come out. I cannot imagine I am supposed to put in 10 glue sticks to get this to work. Unfortunately its too late to return it yet again.

Consequently their voices are echo-y and the words almost impossible to understand even you speak French. Why are some products released like this?

For example, the write up on higher-order circuits is just too superficial and left too large a gap to follow up into the examples or homework in my opinion. This treatment of subject areas seems to be the norm rather than the exception. This book is not incomplete and has many classical examples but it's just difficult to follow. There are better books. Its probably best to have other references in hand such as Schaum's, Charles M. Close, Ralph J. Smith, Johnson/Hilburn/Johnson and a good set of class notes to fill in between the gaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Horrible Textbook Ever","review":"I used this book in my sophomore year Intro to EE class and it has to be the most horribly written technical textbook ever. I read from the book only once the whole semester and spent the rest of the time learning from tutors and lecture notes. The examples are cryptic and poorly explained and the chapters are haphazardly organized. I pity those who're forced to buy this for their EE classes, but if you have a choice, you can definitely find yourself a much better textbook than this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow, ...","review":"This book is to hard to follow, with bad examples and explaining things so you can't tell what is going on.

In a word, terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read the first chapter online somewhere and thought it was fantastic. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book. Unfortunately, the novel did not live up to its promise, mainly because the protagonist is such an unsympathetic jerk--a caricature of a Clint Eastwood-style hero. I guess some people might be impressed by a sociopath who forces guns down women's throats, but I found him repulsive. By about page 100 I was starting to wish that Rex had been shot in the face rather than the guy on the other side of the river.

Each time I picked this one up I fell asleep. I tried again and again, but just couldn't get into this book (either story). I'm a HUGE fan of Andrew Robinson's \\"A Stitch in Time\\" and I think Cardassian stories have the potential to be great (that book reminded of the old Jack Vance novels about the Knume).I'll pick up the Trill and Bajoran stories (I loved the additional insight into Trill society we found in \\"The Lives of Dax\\". Hopefully they won't be as boring as this one...Now that Enterprise has been canceled, it's up to writers and fans to keep all of these stories alive and kicking. Let's make them good so that fans feel engaged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 stars for Cardassia, 1 star for Andor","review":"Una McCormack's Cardassia story is a solid effort, with a welcome back into the fold (sort of) of the O'Brien clan. The politics of Keiko's project on Cardassia are interesting to watch, and it's always great fun to see Garak and Gul Macet. I liked the writing and found the story engaging and tense. 3 starsHeather Jarman's Andor story, though, was written with the romantic sensibilities of a 16 year old girl and the political sensibilities of a high school class president. The story is dull and the writing is confused, with ridiculous onomatopoeia, over-the-top writing, and wandering points of view. If not for the continuing DS9 story, I would have skipped this one after about 20 pages. 1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I found it difficult to even finish this work. I think Ms. McCormack has potential but her writing resembles that done for college level creative writing courses. Overly descriptive with a sophomoric 'breathy' quality. Characterizations tended to thin out. I'll wait and borrow her next one from a friend rather than purchase it myself. I had high hopes after reading Ms. Jarmen's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Home Run","review":"This book is wonderful!! Kudos to whomever is developing the plot of the DS9 post tv show books. This feels like the beginning of Season 9. Season 8 was all of the books from A Stitch in Time until Unity. Wonderful character development. Engaging stories that grabbed my interest immediately. With all of the mediocre stuff out there today, it's nice to have something that consistently satisfies. Two thumbs up for Ms. McCormack and Ms. Jarman."},{"rating":"2","title":"mostly good","review":"When I got this book, i thought i would enjoy the Andorian part better, but it turned out to be the oppisite. I really like how Cardassia was brought to life and I got a kick out of Miles and Garak's characters. Ah, Andor was okay. There were some really great moments, some boring, some annoying, but mostly good. The last scene with Shar and Prynn didn't make any sense to me...not the decision he made, but how fast he changed his mind. Seemed a bit rushed to me, but whatever. Hope they continue with these storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trombone Ensemble at its best!","review":"This outstanding album shows off the unique and powerful sounds of this first-rate trombone ensemble. An easy listen, this recording displays the tremendous ability of all involved; composers, conductors and performers alike.

Sure it hold the DVD player and has two side pockets, but it can't hold a typical portable DVD player inventory. With my 7\\" Audiovox came, 6' power cord, an A/C to D/C converter, an auto power cord, an adapter for the battery pack, S-Video link for a TV, RCA plugs link for older TVs, remote control, and earplug type headphones.

Iused to enjoy her books, but with this one I believe she was just out to make more and more money. Anyone who reads her books has already read these stories......not in this condensed version. I think authors who are only out there to make $$$$ should give it up.

I am an avid Ann Rule fan - it's hard for me to find a book of hers that I don't already own. When I saw this one (at Target, no less) I was suprised and bought it right away. What a disappointment! I already owned 90% of it in other publications, and really felt that I had been scammed into buying something. I rated this with 2 stars, because as always, Ann's writing is superb, and if you aren't an avid follower, this book would be great for you. But if you've already read most of her work, don't get suckered into buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"Obviously, you are not allowed to give an honest review if it is against Ms. Rule. I reviewed this book awhile back, and now I see it has been deleted. That's pretty sad since I buy my books from Amazon. When I bought the book, I didn't realize that it was about stories that were previously written. While there were three new stories, the stories are over 30 years old. I'm a fan of Ann's, I just wish we weren't sold short on this one. I know this will be deleted again...but I will state my review again: the book is dull, and a repeat of stories previously written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Ann's best","review":"This is compilation of older stories Ann has already published.

Breathing Tornadoes sounds like Ben Lee trying hard to be older, and he gives me something that might be enjoyed more by my parents. The only songs worth more than one listen are Cigarettes Can Kill You, Nothing Much Happens, Feeling Tornadoes and Ship My Body Home, and those aren't that good.

Those are real, old-fashioned honky tonk and remain among my favorites of all time.

However, as you soon find out, the game is monotonous. Apart from sailing port to port and engaging pirates there is, honestly, nothing else you do in the game. And, the engagements/attacks against pirates are boring themselves. All you do is try to out maneuver the pirates and blast away at them. (not hard, and after a few engagements, not fun anymore!) There is no swashbuckling, there is no interaction with your crew, there are no dangers from sailing in general. The game needs no manual because there is nothing creative you can do in the game. This game should have just been available as a free download because of its lack of complexity or creativity.

My roommate smells my shirts because she says my perfume smells so good on my, lol. Whenever I wear this, I ALWAYS get compliments! Highly recommended. I've just bought my second bottle!

I don't agree that it is heavy. I do agree that this perfume is so elegant, sensual and complex, I will mostly reserve it for evenings.Love it.EDIT: This scent is still amazing, but it doesn't last!!!! you really have to drown yourself in this one to smell it on yourself.

I couldn't even smell it when I held my wrist to my nose. The second time, I decided to apply more. I must've used 6-7 sprays and still, only a lingering aroma.

I don't agree with other reviewers about this book. Liu's approach is typical of a photojournalist, who takes as his own reponsibility to expose the more disturbing and the more marginal. Some Chinese readers may feel offended by Liu showing to the world the sick the dying the uneducated the imporverished and the uncultivated...but Liu also showed their joy their dignity and their humor and their hopes. Chinese, and especially oversea Chinese, tend to have this self-esteem complex and always want to boost their own ego by showing only the glittering side of their own country, but a true patriotic can look at his own wound without shame and make his own efforts to better off a society as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liu Zheng: The Chinese","review":"The images and information provided by this book is outdated and very misleading to the western readers.

I thought that's what I was getting. Instead, what I have is a narrator who is not Beth Moore reading the book version of this title, not the study itself. I also bought the workbook that goes along with the Bible study sessions. Now that I've opened the shrink wrap to listen to the 30-seconds that told me I had the wrong CDs, I can't return the set.

These three are not anywhere as heavy or as raw, but each are 4 star release's.

Music today sucks for the most part, but thankfully early Van Halen still rocks as hard today as it did decades ago. The guitar playing is still amazing and you can see how it opened many eyes & ears to Eddie Van Halen 30 years ago.

It means that the sound quality is better then ever, also meaning \\"get rid of your old VH CD's and get the Remastered versions with all ORIGINAL ARTWORK (YOU KNOW THE ARTWORK FROM THE VINYLS)\\". It was in mid September that i found out that Warner Bros recently did this (they did the samething with Dire Straits as well too), i was upset at first because, i now had to replace my old VH cd's and get the 6 remasters (at a good price too). If you are a Die-Hard VH fan, you must replace your old VH cd's and get these, they are worth the buy, and sound so much better making old VH blasting their way through the 21th Century for generations to come.

One is about sex and the other is about a girl who wants a relationship and ends up with a one-night stand. Also, \\"Ice Cream Man\\" is a slow song, but it is also a really good song if you realize that he's not really singing about ice cream.\\"Eruption\\", in my opinion, is one of the greatest guitar solos EVER. You would almost buy the album just for this, BUT the whole record is superb. If you have any interest in hard rock, check this out.Also, to the Van Halen \\"newbies\\", anything before 1985 is with singer David Lee Roth. Between 1985 and 1997 is Sammy Hagar (who sings VH's REAL love songs). And finally, the singer on the album \\"3\\" is not worth mentioning because that album sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van halen","review":"This is a great album sounds good and it's cheap. I was looking for this cd. It is remastered. Van halen is one my all time favs. I love every song on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saved Rock Music?","review":"Some people are saying this saved rock, Are you kidding me? i'm left confused and dumbfounded as to how this saved rock. This band along with Def Leppard, single handedly destroyed hard rock/metal for the entire 80's. They basically gave birth to pop metal with this album, all of the Jovi's,Ratts,Wingers,Crues and poisons that plaged the 80's with there bull$hit music owe thanks to this album. I give it two stars because i repect eddies musicianship, but the damage done by this album was horrendus. After this, it was suddendly cool for bands to start writting insipid songs about partying, rocking out and girls amoung other juvinile subjects and start dressing in spandex. Who knows, maybe metal might have been a respectable gendre in music if this has never came out, metal would not have to be disgraced by being associated with motley crap and poison in the ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fine Debut","review":"With songs like \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", \\"You Really Got Me\\", and \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\", you have to acknowledge Van Halen's self-titled debut album, as one of the best debut albums of the the 70's. \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", arguably Van Halen's best song, and \\"You Really Got Me\\", arguably one of the best cover songs of all time, were the hits that propelled not only this particular album, but also Van Halen's career to success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen - Still One Of Their Best And One Of The Most Influential Albums Of The Late 70's","review":"When Van Halen hit the record stores and airwaves back in 1978 it was truly something unique. Today there are hundreds of guitar wizards out there who have copied Eddie Van Halen's style, but back in the day there was no one else who sounded like this band. I never really became a Van Halen fanatic over the years, but I have a lot of their stuff and have always enjoyed pulling the albums out for a listen now and then. This their debut remains one of their all time best in my opinion. The album spawned 4 hit singles but with the exception of \\"Runnin With The Devil\\" it is the lesser known songs that I think are the best here. \\"I'm The One\\", \\"Atomic Punk\\", \\"Ice Cream Man\\" and \\"On Fire\\" are my fave's here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa","review":"This album literally made me go WHOA. David Lee Roth proves why he's an entertainer. Michael Anthony proves why he's a great background vocalist, and bassist. Everyone on this record proves who they really are. Feel your love tonight really stands out to me out of all of them. Your question, why so? Because, when I play it in the car, the party emotions kick it. Dave sings it in that great way. Great album folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first, the best","review":"I owned this on vinyl...but bought the CD after seeing the reunion tour. It doesn't get much better than this. Simply put -- a classic, all-out rock and roll album. Makes it clear, they were destined to be huge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The record that started the 80's... two years before","review":"Van Halen's first album is a pure classic, and certainly a milestone in rock music. On this album, Eddie Van Halen shows all his talent, starting the \\"Guitar Virtuoso\\" fame, changing the face of hard rock music for the years to come...All songs on the album are great and David Lee Roth's voice was really original for the time. It's tough to believe this album was recorded in 1978, sounds really 80's...Well, it's a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen is sick!!@!!@!!","review":"If you don't like these guys your not AmericaN.

This was one of the cds that made me want to play guitar. Eddie is an amazing guitar player, but this isn't only for guitar players. Altough i think that if you don't play guitar, 1984 is probably a better cd. Anyways, back to this one. This was their debut, and in my opinion their best album. It starts off with Running With the Devil, a great opener, and a great song. Then comes Eruption. This blew my mind the first time i heard it. It's about a minute and a half of classic Eddie Van Halen riffs. Next is a cover of You Really Got Me, I forget who it's originally by, but i like Van Halen's version better anyway. Ain't Talkin Bout Love is another great song. I'm the One has some of the best riffs on the whole album. the bad news is, this album gets a little boring after this. With the exception of the last two songs(which are amazing!!!) the second half is just average."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated cd","review":"the only good tracks are you really got me,ain't talkin bout love and ice cream man.when ever i listen to this cd these are the only three tracks i listen to,the rest of the songs are not very good at all.david lee roth is a very overrated singer.this was the first and last van halen cd i'll ever buy.don't waste your money on this cd ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most OVERATED Singer Ever","review":"David Lee Roth ruined this whole album. I loved Eddie's guitar playing, but I just can't listen to this because of Roth horrible voice. The only songs I find remotelly listenable are Runnin With the Devil and Eruption every other song, nomatter how good Eddie is, sounds like crap thanks to Roth. DO NOT BUY, unless you want to listen to the most annoying singer of all time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy guitar playing for posers","review":"I can't believe people listen to this junk. This lame hair crap was never cool. There's a reason the great musicians you see on MTV don't dress or look like this. Anyway, the guitar work sucks. This Van Halen thinks he's so great. People say he pioneered a so-called \\"technique\\" (a REALLY bad one) called \\"two handed tapping\\" or something. When was the last time you saw great guitar players like Avril Lavigne, Ashlee Simpson or Kurt Cobain use this \\"technique\\"??? Never, because - like Van Halen - it sucks. This song \\"eruption\\" or whatever the hell it is, is nothing more than amateur wannabee guitar playing. Now for REALLY good guitar playing, check out the aforementioned artists.

Newer Metallica stuff is awesome, it doesn't need solos.Is the only reason people like this because of the fancy solos?Solos are lame and fill up precious time in songs.Liking a cd only for solos is like liking a movie only for the sex scences.For a good metal cd, check out Metallica's St anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on flesh, short on metal","review":"Just another girlie mag.

This model is user friendly with easy to follow directions. The Samsung website has fabulous tutorials of how to work this camera too. This is selling for a way lower price than I paid.

It's very powerful and has several different speed and speed combinations. The bowl itself has three speeds. So, why the low rating? Because the mixer I got was used. I don't mean it had just been taken out of the container. This mixer was used enough that the surface is scuffed. I would mail it back but various factors make that very difficult at this time.

Like two of my other favorite British mystery authors, Philip Rickman and Sarah Rayne, Hill offers that sort of mystery populated with characters so realistic in a setting that is so clearly painted that it becomes more absorbing than many of the American shoot-'em-up thrillers. There is a lot of set up and lot of detail, so the middle lags a bit, but once the climatic ending starts, you'll be eagerly anticipating the remainder of the series.One oddity that really struck me was that the series main character is treated more like an enigma here than any of the other characters who have such a more flesh-and-blood feel to them. But I am hoping that the remainder of the series will rectify this issue. The ending certainly left me speechless and was so completely shocking that I can hardly wait to begin the next book in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Fraya Graffham is a likeable protagonist. Unfortunately, we can't spend much time with her because the narrative shifts from one to another of multiple characters' points of view, making it difficult to develop empathy for any of them. We are forced \\"into the mind of a killer,\\" a hackneyed, unpleasant device for readers who enjoy a murderer's gruesome and perverted thoughts. Simon Serrailler gets lost in the pile of characters. Hill creates laughably villainous characters from the alternative health community: a psychic surgeon and spiritual counselor. Ostensibly, she attempts to balance them with an acupuncturist who defers to traditional doctors, who are dedicated and altruistic. This wouldn't have smelled so much like an agenda if Hill had, for instance, mentioned the yearly 72,000 deaths in the UK due to medical error, per the UK's Commons health select committee. All in all, conventional, stereotypical characters and plotting. I won't be getting another book by Susan Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mysteries I've read","review":"I've read all of the Simon Serailler mysteries in the last months, and I was completely engrossed in them.

Very good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite...","review":"I was so excited about this book, after I read the reviews. The book flows well, but leaves the reader hanging. It really is not a mystery or crime novel, because although, crime does happen, the ending hangs. The bad guy is not caught, there is not closure. I guess this probably reflects real crime situations, but we read these books to get away from 'real crime' and find some measure of justice. You will not find this in this book. I will try the 2nd novel to see if it is any better.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this book...","review":"I tried to like this book, but i just didn't care for it.

Thus he is in charge of the case when women start disappearing from Lafferton. His high-achieving family and the market town where they all live are painted in with colourful brush-strokes. This provides a fine contrast to the central mystery which concerns a serial killer with an unusual motivation and a personable exterior.Because Susan Hill spends time building up her characters, we do care when the psychopath starts murdering his innocent victims and the last death is a shocking body-blow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"This promises to be a good series.

Incredible, that this would be missing on a computer in this price range and perfomance.I also found that the power supply is only 250watts. For a pentium 4 class computer this is a cheap way to degrade an otherwise good design.If I had purchased a bargain basement computer from a local supplier I would have concluded I got what I paid for.

The heavy duty cover is not in the same category as the original. Be careful in reading reviews, as some people think the covers that come with the racks are the heavy duty one, not true. I think the material the heavy duty covers uses is similar to what is used by Weber for their grill covers. I like the split zippers as it makes removing wood easier. I always had problems getting the 8 foot wide flap to stay up. The covers do not say \\"LandMann\\" but I really do not care. I'll post an update after the winter.

The only problem I had was making sure I stacked pieces on the bottom layer to form a base, them stack on some of the shorter cuts. Same thing applies to the sides.

It was only a week old and this happened? As I write this I am contacting Landman for a full refund.

It is now is totally ripped. The straps were the first thing that ripped off and the cover tore shortly after and is now 'blowing' in the wind and we have to find a replacement tarp. If I had known how how cheaply the cover was made, I would have purchased a rack without the cover and purchased something more heavy duty. It seems as if the material cracked as soon as the temps dropped down to the 40s and the cracks then allowed for the material to tear even more.

The rack is in a protected location with little wind. After our first snow several days ago, the entire side began separating from the top each time I opened the cover to fetch more logs. Now I see that there is a huge rip on the other side too.It's too early to tell how the rack itself will hold up, but I don't have high expectations. The design seems flimsy and I'm afraid the hollow tubes will end up rusting through and/or falling apart in a season or two. Would not purchase again. Unfortunately, we did not keep the original box.

If you're going to store a 1/2 cord of wood outside, during the winding winter months, heavy spring rains this product is not for you. If you are going to store a 1/2 cord of wood in the garage or near a wall, fence on a level floor that can block the wind from tipping this rack over, then buy this rack.The issue is balance, or should I say lack of balance.Needless to say, you get what you pay for.

The material used is lightweight but it's holding a full stack of wood so I guess it does what it's designed to do. I do like that I can adjust it to whatever length I want. Right now it's just over 5 feet and it's holding fine with the ends leaning out from the weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things have changed","review":"I ordered two of these racks about two months ago. They were pretty nice with the Landman logo screened on the end rails and on the cover. The rails were a nice quality black finish. This prompted me to order two more and took delivery on them about three weeks ago. Totally different rack. The bottom rails were rusting through the incredibly thin, flat finish, no logo on the rails or the covers. The covers were a poorer grade than the first two I received to the point that one of them ripped up the side while covering the rack, using no force whatsoever. You can tell the difference in the materials just buy looking and feeling them. I would have said to buy these two months ago but now I say to buy American. These are not worth the money any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!","review":"Since these covers work (cover your wood from the elements that is) until it gets cold, I guess they deserve 1 star. However, once it gets cold and snow/ice starts, forget it. They rip VERY EASILY. Don't even think of using the zipper in the cold weather. Its infinitely easier to rip the cover, and you will if you try to use the zipper. I had two of these covers. Put them on my wood in October, and the first one went in the garbage in December, the second in February. On a lighter note, when the first one ripped, I left a piece of the tarp outside (didn't get it all off the rack) and later I saw a squirrel running in my backyard with a piece of the tarp!! Go get yourself a middle of the road tarp locally. You'll be supporting your local retailers, and save yourself some aggravation and $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied !","review":"Well constructed medium-heavy-duty full 8 foot log rack.

This rack is more expensive even in BJ's club. Assembly is very simple, mine is standing on concrete pavers. With the first row of logs laid on rack becomes stable. I have it piled up over 4 feet and it holds logs already the second season, no rust no problems at all. I agree, that cover is flimsy and the first wind tears it. But that's a minor thing. I am giving to rack 5 stars anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works Fine","review":"This is a good product, extremely easy to assemble, lightweight but sturdy, and fully up to the task of storing a fairly large amount of firewood.Its only drawback is that it is fairly narrow front-to-back and the feet are too small to stand stably directly on a dirt or grass surface -- the weight will make them sink in when the ground gets wet. It's easily wide enough to hold the firewood but if you don't stack the firewood carefully it will tend eventually to lean forward or backward even when it's set atop pavers, which you MUST do unless you put it on a hard surface like concrete. This might not happen if the feet were wider platforms and were flared out slightly to give it a little bit wider stance.But this is a good product at an excellent price and I actually bought a second one when I felled a tree and it resulted in my having too much firewood to stack atop the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great product. I actually made the max. recommended 16 feet wood pile. It worked perfectly and looks absolutely awesome. I bought 4 2x4's plus a connector 2x4 piece for the middle to give it more stability. Home Depot sells special metal connectors to fasten the middle piece. I had a huge tree cut down and was glad to pile a good portion of it onto this rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid firewood rack","review":"The firewood rack was easy to assemble and holds about 1/2 a face cord. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the rack could use some sort of support connecting each side. It feels solid but the weight of the wood (I loaded it up) seems to make the ends slightly bow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent woodrack","review":"This wood rack is OK. It's adjustable up to the length of 2x4 you can obtain. I used screws to attach the rack to the 2x4's but I'll be replacing them with nuts and bolts as soon as most of the logs get used. For what you pay(around $35) , it's worth the money. It's light and sturdy. Although, the longer you make it, the weaker it becomes because of the weight pressing against the top; especially if you stack unquarted pieces in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Fitted Cover","review":"Rack is fine.

Well guess what, this might be their best album. It's definitly their most consistantly heavy album (only Could This Be Magic is mellow), it also contains some of the coolest EVH riffs and hooks ever. The intro to Everbody Wants Some has more cool guitar work than most rock albums combined. Then there's the blistering Loss of Control and Romeo Delight, the goof ball Take Your Whiskey Home, and the hard rock love song In Simple Rhyme. Fools, the instrumental Tora Tora and And the Cradle Will Rock fill out the album in fine fashion. It's heavy, dark and funny all in one. This album just rocks from front to back and puts most other Van Halen stuff (even though it's all outstanding) to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"vanhalen women and children frist.","review":"first off diverdown and 1984 and fair warning get so much more attention than this cd. i was maybe 7 or 8 at the time. later on i heard it. its one of my favorite vanhalen cds. and so underated. there are so many classic songs. and maybe now that time has passed maybe this cd will finally get the attention it deserves. diverdown in my opinion was just awful . and fairwarning i liked like two songs off it. so pick up the cd already. and be ready to be in awe. the boys are in there glory. and its before the tensions that started to mount in later of 1981. into 1982."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Van Halen Album","review":"The songs may not be as compact and focused as on the first two, but this one's my personal favorite. Leadoff Cradle Will Rock is still a radio standard, In A Simple Rhyme is killer rock, Take Your Whiskey Home starts of slow then smokes, and finally Could This Be Magic, the silly acoustic sing-a-long is great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Interesting Dave-Era Album","review":"I think that this is the coolest VH album of the Roth-years. They seem to go off slightly in a different direction on this effort. It seems to be a darker, but in a good way, it is by no means a depressing effort. \\"Everybody Wants Some\\" is a killer cut with the tribal drumming and the dark and heavy riffing. The album-rock hit \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" is one of their all-time best cuts. My favorite overall from this album is \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" with its slightly funky riff and that very cool Michael Anthony bass line (Rum-Bum-Duma-Duma-Bum-Bum) that plays under Eddie's solos. \\"Fools\\" and \\"Tora Tora\\" also shine. Don't leave this one out of your VH collection !"},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Remasters Will Rock...","review":"Woman and Children First is one of the Van Halen remasters listeners will notice clear improvements on. Little David Lee Roth vocal nuances and backround noise are clearly audible on the Cradle Will Rock, Eddie's first jump (sorry) into the electric piano.Van Halen broke away from their shorter tight song structure on this recording, delving into blues and acoustic numbers as well as end-of-album extravaganzas characteristic of 70's lps. In A Simple Rhyme closes the set and is a tune that would make the Who proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VAN HALEN CLASSIC!","review":"This album kind of sounds like the boys were all drunk when they recorded this, but; it sounds awesome. The music is just good straight ahead rock and roll with nothing fancy thrown in. Dave's lyrics are always worth a listen and has some classic lines on this one. EVERYBODY WANTS SOME is one the best VH songs ever and THE CRADLE WILL ROCK is awesome. I also love the album cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen does it again !!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"With songs like Fools, In A Simple Rhyme, and Rome Delight, it's no wonder I keep coming back for more !!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To Heavy Metal!!!","review":"The third album from Van Halen, Women and Children First is a great record. After Van Halen 2 came out, Women And Children First came out and blew everyone away with the first song on the cd, .....And the Cradle Will Rock.

There's less warmth here than on his previous works, and the tracks run together, forming a larger picture, rather than discrete moments. The \\"Going Sailing Refrain\\" triptych, for instance, has a bit of musique concrete to it without a traditional melody. \\"Books on Tape\\" is similarly spare, with a throbbing beat, 2 or 3 chords, and a modified vocal sample. But that's not to say that the album is completely devoid of warmth: \\"Homemade Debris\\" is bathed in it, with a moderate 4/4 beat to ground the gentle synth washes, until it floats out on a pure ambient note. \\"Concrete & Plastic,\\" as well, glides on its suspended tones, whlie \\"Fractures & Fissures (Part 1)\\" seems to take a note out of Tim Hecker's notebook. \\"Edit Edit Edit\\" closes the album with a quiet grace.

I never really saw a valid reason for the heroine's animosity toward the hero. All the internal and external man-bashing--typical of the Karen Robards novels I've read so far (only 2 to date) makes me cringe. I felt so sorry for this hero. If a woman begged a man to make love to her and then so brutally rejected him afterwards, he'd likely devastated. And why? Because *she* refused to take responsibility for her part in it! Not the mark of true womanhood or heroism, imo. But I suspect this is an old novel (1980s?) pandering to the editors' calls for angry conflict instead of story conflict. Sigh. Well, I'll read one of her later ones, but if she hasn't evolved with the times, then it'll be my last Karen Robards novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I've read and enjoyed two other Robards books, which I would recommend over this one: \\"Shattered,\\" and \\"Obsession.\\" She is a great romance author who knows how to write an engaging story. Unfortunately, this particular novel falls under that frustrating style of romance that was inexplicably popular in the 1980's: characters who hate each other, and yet inevitably fall into the sack together... Bleh. She made the characters so ornery and opinionated that they were too hard to love. Jack is tough, yes, but he is so mean to Clara that he comes across as a jerk. And Clara is tough too (in her own way), but her vindictiveness and inexplicable motivations make her equally impossible to love. Puff was fun, but even he wasn't enough to save this book for me. I put it down after page 157.It wasn't poorly written, and I will still recommend Robards as an author, but this particular novel was not for me.I suggest her more recent material, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? People actually rated this 5 stars?","review":"I rarely find a book that I dislike as much as this one. Clara was a pathetic, unfulfilled, horny character who gives romance writers a bad name and McClain was an arrogant jerk who was always being rude and insulting to her. Puff the cat was the highlight of the book and he shouldn't have even been in most of it because what idiot would kidnap a cat with their victim when they could leave it behind? I can't in good conscience recommend this book but judging by the ratings of other reviewers I am in the minority, so you might enjoy it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really really great book","review":"This book has adventure at every single turn of a page. it was awesome. the adventure was sick. the love relationship between Clara and Jack, it was cute. It was very heated at times. lol. but i think the story was well written. if you want adventure and love, then read this. if you arent even looking for that, still read this book!! you wont be sad. i had make myself put it down because i read half of it in one night. i didnt want it to end. the ending, now it was really good yes. but i still wish there was more to it. i was reading and i was like, \\"how is this going to end when there isnt that many pages left?\\" but all in all, it was good. and cute. and just read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Magic","review":"Night MagicLike author, will read a lot of her books in the immediately future.

It's funny, and charming with the best kitty sidekick I've read about in a long time: Puff. In defense of this wonderful novel by Robards, it is not Deja Vu from Hunter's Moon(not Harvest Moon), this novel was released in 1988, way before Hunter's Moon in 1996. So Robards decided to recreate some of the Magic, but this original is still her best.so if you want to read about an irresistable alpha hero; a smart and sassy heroine and their adorable, and lovable kitty sidekick Puff then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not consistent","review":"At first I was very pleased with this type of product.

I particularly like using this book's recipes for my cocktail parties (I first saw it reviewed in Playboy of all places, because they loved the sexy dishes for two that are featured in the book), since the whole idea behind this guide is simple, appealing, small treats that you can cook up without a lot of fuss. It emphasized improvization. Stocking a few key items (even some new ones that are very versatile). And having fun with this quirky, miniature meal. And the writing is just as fun-loving.

Patterson Hood's sermon, \\"The Three Great Alabama Icons\\" is simply stunning, and worth the price of admission alone.

I don't recommend this album unless you really want to hear it. Besides all that, the CD case is a cardboard case without plastic CD holders, very cheap looking.

I find some of the songs ok, but most are blandly produced with the main flaw being the vocals which sound like someone who lost their voice but decided to keep singing.

It is bewildering that Rubinstein had to arrive nearly to the age of eighty before he could find \\"his\\" string quartet, after seventy-five or so years of extensive music making. Rubinstein is, as always, revealed as a suberp Brahms interpreter, and the Guarneris just as exciting. The performers show a deep grasp of Brahms's emotionality, harmonic complexity, and, most of all, finely articulated structure. The tempos are just right, unlike the second piano quartet (appearing on a seperate volume), where the first movement is rather slow (go for the Beaux Arts Trio). Together with the devine piano quintet OP. 34 (also on a seperate volume), these three performances are flawless executions of chamber masterworks. A must for every fan of romantic chamber music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not my first choice","review":"I liked this CD of quartets 1 and 3 so much, I had to get #2! I could only find #2 in complete sets, so I wound up with the Phillips Duo set featuring the Beaux Arts Trio and Menahem Pressler in all 3 pieces (plus a trio to fill CD2). Lo and behold, I like that set even better.Rubinstein seems to have been on a mission to rescue Brahms' music from the misperception of being stodgy and academic. This he certainly accomplishes--to the point of being perhaps just the slightest trifle \\"over the top\\" here and there. The Beaux Arts/Pressler performances are more suave and subtle--not that they're at all anemic.If robustness is your prime criterion, you may well differ about the Beaux Arts doing better. But remember, you'll have to add some duplication to your collection or do without Quartet #2. While I do think Nos. 1 and 3 are the best, #2 is well worth getting. Phillips offers a great value and the sound is at least as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubinstein in Brahms Piano Quartets 1 and 3","review":"I read in Arthur Rubinstein's book on his young years how much he loved Brahms music when he first heard it in Berlin as a young student.

I thoroughly liked this book, and will read the rest in the series. Strong character and plot development coupled with an easy reading style made this a fairly rapid read, although the size of the book was daunting at first. The only negative I see in this book, and series I assume, is the complexity of the names of the characters. However, if one delves into the reasons for that, it simply adds an additional dimension to the understanding of the characters and their relative roles in the civilization Ms. Smith has devised. In contrast to some of the reviewers, I had no problem feeling attached to the characters, identifying with some, and disliking others. 2 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm a bit sad I couldn't give Inda a better rating. First, it took me forever to read. That is not normal for me and indicates that something is wrong. It is a characteristic of the main problem of the book. I simply don't care about whats going on. I think this stems for the book being written more like a history or a biography relating specific events to the reader rather than a cohesive story. I don't feel like I was going along on a journey with the character rather I was just kind of told some stuff that happened to them. Inda is a good character, which is why this is particularly disappointing. The book really seemed like it just needed a good edit and a focus. What story is it trying to tell? That being said I enjoyed many of the small section in the book. It was almost like reading a short story collection where there are some sections I love and some I could live without and really don't seem relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inda","review":"This story began with heavy going-the unusual names, plentiful nick-names along with sur-names which seemed to denote family alliances and historical references confused me until I recalled an old trick I used with Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky;I spent the time to write them down, put them into families and clans until they all made sense. From thereon the book was a delight. Her world-building was marvelous and coherent. I was quickly drawn into the world her young adolescents inhabited and it was an interesting world indeed. Smith can write and I agree with some of the reviews that say her writing is on a higher level than most fantasists. Inda is neither all dark nor all light but-a word of caution- don't fall in love with any of the characters. She leaves plenty of carrots around to keep one guessing. I like the sexual mores of the world and wish our own world made as much sense. Strong writer-strong series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating book!","review":"Just finished reading this book and I thought it was fabulous. Great story with memorable characters even though some of the names/titles of characters were a little hard to get through. Don't let that discourage you...this was such a great story that it was worth a little extra time to figure out the names! Pick it up...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise!","review":"This book was read with great anticipation on two counts: Thom is a former highschool classmate of mine that I respected and admired; and the reviews indicated that the story took place in Sea Ranch and Gualala in Northern California. Having spent countless weekends up at Sea Ranch over the years, his descriptions of the locale, citizens and lifestyles were vividly brought to life and I found myself laughing out loud as I read my own opinions popping off the page. Thom has always been a gifted writer, as this book clearly demonstrates. His characters come alive, and I felt as though I had met all of them at one time or another. I hope to have the pleasure of reading more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT GIFT FOR THAT FLY-FISHING GUY IN YOUR LIFE!!!","review":"i know absolutely nothing about fly fishing nor did i think i even cared to find out about it but in reading this charming little foray into the subject set in wonderous mendocino made me think differently.....i loved this story....the quirky characters were marvelous...having spent much time staying, dining and stomping the grounds of st. orres....aka st. horace....this was such a treat...didn't like the ending but i guess it's ok...still enjoyed it and will definitely pass the word on this little literary secret....how come no one else has read/reviewed this book??? it was fun...hope to read more from thom, a neighbor just down the road from me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too dry","review":"This book was terrible. the only reason I give it one star is because Joan d'Arc's story is one i like. this author portrays it very drily and i felt like i was reading out of my history book! i think the author could have made the book more interesting with more details and descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"problema con mi producto","review":"no tengo tres meses de recibir mi cp y el mismo ya presenta problemas a nivel del cd o dvd desde hace unas tres semanas, quisiera una orientacion de garantia paraa solucionar mi problema"},{"rating":"2","title":"good service","review":"This was a used,out of print book.I had used it for staff trainiing in the past,and wanted it for a friend.

The first CD is nothing more than a compilation of tracks from Hawkwind's \\"Space Ritual vol. 2\\", sounding inferior to the original from which it was copied. The second CD was taken from a live concert, and contains less than exemplary versions of songs which can be found on Hawkwind's many other recordings. Also, the sound quality of this CD is just downright pathetic....almost like a bootleg(and, not even a good one). \\"Year 2000...\\" was released by Demi-Monde, the same record label owned by ex-Hawkwind bassist Dave Anderson that also put out \\"Bring Me The Head Of Yuri Gagarin\\"(overwhelmingly voted as the worst Hawkwind album ever in terms of sound and performance quality on a recent internet poll). With the release of \\"Year 2000: Codename Hawkwind\\", it appears as though \\"Bring Me The Head....\\" finally has some competition for the \\"Hawkwind Albums Everyone Should Avoid\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Stinker","review":"Be careful when buying from Hawkwind's catalog,there are far more poor sounding releases than good ones.This one sounds like trash.Get \\"In search of Space\\" \\"Hall of the Mountain Grill\\" or \\"Quark,Strangeness+Charm\\" instead.The sound quality is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in great shape","review":"Book is flawless, not even scratches on the cover, cannot remember promptness of delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIT \\"A Place in the Sun\\"","review":"I just recieved this album as a gift. It was number one on my gift list because I enjoyed the song \\"My own worst enemy\\" However, when I poped the CD into my personal CD player, I was disgusted. These guys are basically stuck in the 50's, or rather the \\"cadillac, elvis presely\\" years. The only song I like is My own worst enemy. I am very upset with the performance of this well known group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album","review":"Not much to say here. Every song gets better and better as the album goes on. Miserable is awesome and so is My own worst enemy.. But the whole album just is great and deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now This rocks!","review":"A lot of people have said that this album is very similar to a lot of stuff done by the brilliant blink 182. In my opinion it has more imagination than the likes of Enema Of The State. Unlike Enema Of The State it takes more time to get into but trust me it is well worth it. \\"Four\\" and \\"My Own Worst Enemy\\" capture the catchy power pop sound whereas \\"Miserable\\" delves deeper into the soul of \\"Nirvana like\\" punk rock. This is an excellent album and if you own any albums by greenday, blink 182 or nirvana (particuarly nevermind)this would be to your taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy toons with punk influence","review":"When I started listening to this CD I didn't like it at all but after hearing it 10 times I started to like it.

Each and every one of the songs has a certain mood to it, like The Perfect One's guitar solo (good job Jeremy!)is very devilish sounding. Miserable, My own worst enemy, and Ziplock are all great songs that everybody knows. The first time I tried to listen to it the whole way through, I couldn't do it, because I thought the music was boring, but the next morning I took my Discman out on my paper route, listened to the whole thing, and I loved it! Definitely a great buy. GO NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun CD!","review":"Lit is a poppy rock band who sounds punk sometimes (to me, that's a great thing!) The CD is pretty fun to listen to. My favorite song is Ziploc. Listen to the verses, it's not as stupid as you think! My other favorites are Four, Down, Quicksand, and of course, My Own Worst Enemy. I'm not a big fan of Miserable, and some of the other songs aren't so great either, but the really good songs make the CD worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great improvement","review":"When I first bought this album, it quickly became one of my favorite cds out of the 400+ I own. Lit's melodies are absolutely incredible, and every single song stands out. I can't even choose a favorite. After buying this album and digging it, I decided to check out their first album \\"Tripping the Light Fantastic\\". Their sound is a lot rawer (i.e. their original version of \\"No Big Thing\\"), but shows signs of their powerful melodies to come. Although it's another great album by the band, you can see much improvement as far as creativity and musicality. This made me appreciate \\"Place In the Sun\\" even more. I hope they continue to grow, and I can't wait for their next release. If you want to check out their older stuff, I definitely recommend \\"Tripping...\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIT rocks and so does this cd!","review":"This CD flat-out rocks, and it made me a LIT fanatic! I really loved the song \\"My Own Worst Enemy\\" that i kept hearing every where, but it wasnt until I heard \\"Ziplock\\" that i was convinced this band was cool and I wanted to try their CD. So i got it for my birthday, and it quickly became my favorite cd EVER! i love Lit's sound in general, and their lyrics are catchy and creative, and consequently I can listen to this cd over and over and never get tired of it. Also, unlike many other cd's i have, on this cd i can play the whole thing and not skip any songs, because they are all fantastic. Some of my favorites are the classic \\"My Own Worst Enemy,\\" \\"Ziplock,\\"Lovely Day,\\" \\"Quicksand,\\" etc. I can go on and on, there is really no weak song or aspect of this cd. if u want to purchase a phenomenal cd, (by a band that rocks in concert--by the way...03-05-00), then BUY THIS! peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to \\"My Own Worst Enemy,\\" and then hit repeat","review":"I don't understand how bands like Lit can make one great song for an album, such as \\"My Own Worst Enemy,\\" and then lose this magic while creating all the other songs. The only other song that has any value is \\"Ziplock,\\" but this is not even a song I like to listen to that much. Just keep hitting the repeat button on your CD player for song 2 (\\"My Own Worst Enemy\\"} and then you'll be fine. Be cautious about buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT CD","review":"Well when i bought this cd, i thought that it would be just ok. But it has turned out to be a awesome cd! The greatest are Four, The Best is Yet to Come Undone, Perfect One, and of course My Own Worst Enemy. A must buy if you like rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"Lit has really done it this time- this album is awesome! I must warn you; a lot of the songs sound very similar, but they're all GREAT. I'm sure you've heard the overplayed \\"My Own Worst Enemy\\", \\"Ziplock\\", and \\"Miserable\\" (which is my favorite song- it really got me hooked on them). Anyway, those songs are great, plus \\"The Perfect One\\", \\"Quicksand\\" (Don't you love the middle of the song- \\"When it starts sinking in, like Quicksand...), \\"The Best is Yet to Come Undone\\", and \\"Lovely Day\\". What the hell, they're all great songs! Another thing is that A.Jay Popoff has a great voice, and the music is definitely not HARD, if that's what you're worried about (but it's not too soft either...hehe) I hate it when other bands yell and scream in songs- it doesn't even sound like music! Lit isn't like that at all- Go out and buy the cd NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite CD","review":"I just love this CD!!! I got it expecting to like just 'My own Worst Enemy' and maybe a few other songs. I was really really surprised when I listened to it. All the songs are soooo wonderful.

This is defintely one to buy if you just like to feel good sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is so good, it has been in my car since I got it!!!","review":"The songs on this cd could all be hits in my opinion. The whole thing is great, catchy and will grow on you after one listening. I knew after seeing them at Woodstock I wanted the cd, now I want all of their music that they have ever done. I had heard the catchy song 'My Own Worst Enemy' on the radio, but didn't realize who it was. After the fantastic live Woodstock performance, I immediately bought their newest release: A Place in the Sun. I consider Lit to be one of the best bands out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Stuff","review":"Ever Since I got into all the punk bands of today (mxpx, blink, nofx, green day) I have noticed that they never fail you!

Every track is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album","review":"\\"A Place in the Sun\\" by Lit is a very good album. Songs such as \\"Miserable\\", \\"Zip-Lock\\", \\"Four\\", and \\"My Own Worst Enemy\\", make this a resonable investment in your CD collection. They (Lit) don't thrash out; keeping their mellow-yet-cheery vibe throughout 10-11 of 12 songs. The album features plenty of good guitar effects, as you can hear during the guitar solo of \\"Miserable\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lit's the best!","review":"I think this is such a great band and also a good cd. This is a cd with all there great hits on just one record so i can listen to one cd over and over and never get sick of it.I saw them in concert and im so happy that i can take there songs home with me and just listen to them for hours and hours. It is far by the best cd i have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually impressed!","review":"I have never been a fan of the kiddie rock bands, such as Green Day and Blink 182, because they make me sick. At first I thought Lit would fit right into this genre, but it impressed me.I bought this CD for \\"Miserable\\". \\"My Own Worst Enemy\\" is just one of those songs you fall in love with. \\"Zip-lock\\" is good and all but you can't take it too seriously because of some of the lyrics, which is why Blink 182 is god-awful music.But LIT is great and I was really impressed when I bought the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total fun","review":"This is one great CD.

Told primarily from the viewpoint of a woman for whom perseverance and faith are bywords, I was inspired to read it through to the end in one sitting.A tad short on some of the writing skills we are accustomed to finding in memoirs, this story works for me. It is told with humor, the language is spare and the protagonist is a woman in charge of her own destiny. It also does not preach. It simply tells the story of a woman who loves and, in doing so, affects the lives of those around her.One of the other reviewers mentioned that this book should be turned into a movie. Darn right!

From the Elvis and Ricky Nelson covers to the McCartney originals, this album is a loving and finely crafted homage to his roots. Since \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" and subsequent works, Paul has regained the mastery over musical invention and arrangement that his critics said he had lost. His lyrics have become relevant and personal, which was something for which John Lennon was largely recognized. Lennon, however, never had the gift of tunemaking of the magnitude Paul possesses. It's nice to hear the MAC in such good form. Generation X'ers should pick up this CD if they're looking for a lesson in the Roots of Rock 'n Roll. Maybe they'll get an idea of just where it all started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Sure, Paul McCartney is a great singer-performer. But his greatest gift is that of songwriting. It's a bit of a letdown to have so few McCartney originals on this album. My advice to Paul would be this -- if you want to do some old-style rock and roll, write some old style rock and roll tunes. Don't perform other people's stuff. It's boring.McCartney's 3 new tunes rock. \\"Try Not To Cry\\" is great, much better anything on the radio today. I really wish the whole album were full of McCartney originals in this vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was quite a shock first hearing this","review":"This CD offers a bonanza of 1. rip-your-face-off and 2. rip-your-heart-out covers that stand with the best of the Beatles' coverings (except their immortal \`Twist and Shout', of course, the greatest cover of all time). The former: \`She Said Yeah', \`All Shook Up', \`I Got Stung' and \`Honey Hush'. The latter: \`No Other Baby', \`Coquette' and \`Lonesome Town'. In between is the powerful but comic \`Brown-eyed Handsome Man'. Then there are the three originals, led by Paul's wildest romp since \`I'm Down', namely \`Run Devil Run'. \`Try Not to Cry' and \`What it Is' are both hearty fare that shakes off impending threats of sentimentality. Gripping, hard-edged Mac. Unexpected to say the least. I was totally caught off guard by how dynamic and authentic these tracks sounded. But as good as they sound here, the covers and the originals go over even better, much better in fact, when alternated with the more stellar solo efforts of John, George and Ringo. As nature intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I'll admit that Paul was never my favorite Beatle. Far from it, in fact, but I always liked his music. However, this album is just badly put together. The booklet is full of typos and his vocals are not the best I've heard from him. Somehow, the whole album just comes across as something he did one afternoon while bored out of his mind.Pass this one up, unless you're truly a Paul fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Paul McCartney?","review":"I really do love Paul McCartney's music. But when I bought this I have to say I was very disapointed. All it is is a bunch of remakes. Which is alright. But they all sound the same. I only like a few on this CD. \\"Run Devil Run\\", \\"No Other Baby\\", \\"Lonesome Town,\\" \\"Try not to Cry\\", \\"Maggie May\\", \\"What it Is, \\" and \\"Coquette\\". It's really not that good of a CD. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my God!","review":"\\"Flaming Pie\\" is one of my favorite CD's of all time.

Covers of insipid 50's Rock 'N Roll Tunes! I am absoultely amazed at the positive reviews for this CD. I trust this response is in deference to the greatness of Paul McCartney, not an objective appraisal of this effort. I have listened 3 times, and I question whether I ever will again. Not a memorable tune in the lot...and this, from the categorical master of the melodic \\"Hook.\\"I realize this was probably a labor of love for Paul, and I'm sure he thoroughly enjoyed working with the great musicians he assembled. However, nothing of this translates to my ear.It hurts, but my thumbs are irreversibly down for this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't listen to it!","review":"I have every Paul McCartney cd ever recorded. McCartney 2 was shakey but I am sorry to say that Run Devil Run is the worst album I have ever purchased by anyone! It sounds like the 50's! There is not one good song on the entire cd. I am a huge McCartney fan, so it pains me to say it. I know he can do better than this. If not, he had better give it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud & Monotonous","review":"As a concept this was a fine album, a return to his rock & roll roots, but in the end it doesn't work.Other recording artists have done cover albums to great success; i.e. Billy Joel's An Innocent Man. Even John Lennon almost brought it off with his 1975 Phil Spectored Rock & Roll. But McCartney does not succeed here, in my opinion. He is just a notch too loud, the music is a tad repetitious, and by the end of the CD I was exhausted by the sheer volume of it all.If this is all that was left in the bag, it appears that Paul's creativity is spent. What a letdown for the man who as a Beatle penned Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be. It's been a long and winding road to this mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best singer on earth (the best composer in the universe)","review":"I have just heard the album for the first time and I must say I'm really proud of Paul.I give this album four stars because I think that some of the 50's songs are really bad (perfectly sung though). The best things about this album are : 1) the way Paul and the band perform the songs , it's just flawless . 2) Paul's new songs are GREAT , I hope Paul is going to record an album full of his own new songs now that he's shown how full of energy he and his music still can be (Flaming Pie is a wise (5 star) album but I'd love to hear something as full of life as his early 70's masterpieces (RAM,etc.)).Looking forward to what is yet to come ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"This album rocks, even the originals are some of Paul's best.

It's such a delight to have him back again singing rock'n'roll. He sounds just as good as he did in 1965. Probably this is a good record to close out the rock'n'roll century and close the book on rock'n'roll itself. It's never dull or smug (like almost everything I hear anymore); just inspired performances of great songs by a guy who deeply loves this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"You MUST Buy This Album!!!!","review":"This is the fabbest Paul album ever!

Paul belts out 12 rock n' roll classics along with 3 new McCartney originals like he is still at the Kaiserkeller in Hamburg. Along with a great backing band, including some standout guitar work by the always excellent David Gilmour, Paul still knows how to tear it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEATLE THAT REALLY ROCKED FINALLY COMES THROUGH!","review":"As a studio musician who has had the pleasure of working with SIR Paul, It was gratifing to finally hear him put on recording the side of him the public RARELY gets to hear!

The bass playing is just plain incredible,( He always puts the right note in the RIGHT PLACE) HE CAN FLAT ROCK & ROLL! VIVA BIG MAC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Rocks~~","review":"This is by far one of the best Paul McCartney's 50's Rock N' Roll CD ever. With David Gilmour playing awesome guitar, and Paul and the whole band just getting into some great old good songs. If you like this kind of music, then you will absolutely love this CD. With Paul, he can play any kind of music and it's great. But this is some Rock-a-billy songs that you can listen to over and over and never get tired of it.Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed. What a great come back CD after taking a break from his music. He hasn't lost his touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul at his rock and roll best!","review":"I have been anticipating this cd for several weeks and I was not disappointed! The upbeat tunes on \\"Run Devil Run\\" are so full of energy and Paul's voice has a raw edge that is very appealing. The slow songs are better each time I listen to them. I like the fact that Paul did not pick the obvious, overdone oldies that we hear all the time. This is a great cd for anyone who loves rock and roll!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul on Top of His Generation of Rock and Rollers","review":"Listen to \\"Shake a Hand\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" back to back... unbelievable. I thought the chords were permanently cashed! I was wrong...I am a lifelong fan and an owner of his entire catalog, and I'm frankly STUNNED at how his voice is as intact as the late Beatles, early Wings years, his energy is as vibrant, and his creativity is as active and intense as ever. Name ONE other Rock and Roll legend as productive, ambitious and creative as Paul McCartney. I'm a John Lennon fan, as well; however, it's hard to argue that Paul is inferior in any way. To those who find Lennon to be superior as a songwriter/performer, listen to each one's solo material between 1972-1979. I love Lennon's work, but Paul is plain and simply the best of his generation. This album smokes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Ok, wow! Go Sir Paul!","review":"Well, I'm only 16, so I totally missed the 50's by a couple of decades. That's why this was a totally new experience for me- and that's why I was a little disappointed at first, even though I knew it was mostly a bunch of covers.But then I really got into it and felt a lot better about it. It really, truly rocks! It's great to hear a different kind of rock and roll, although I thought Flaming Pie was better, so that's why I had to give it a 4.Paul McCartney, in my opinion, is the best rock and roll artist ever!! He ended up not disappointing me on this one. He still rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am the BIGGEST McCartney fan, but...","review":"I was 6 years old when the Beatles broke up. I remember wondering why so many people thought they were so good. I grew up and realized why. Paul has always been my fav. I saw him in '90 and can now die in peace. I have every McCartney album (including most bootlegs; when he was with Wings; and when he was with the Beatles). I think that Lennon complimented him, but that after '67, McCartney was the Beatles (John has admitted this). This is the first and only album that Paul has done that has disappointed me. All Shock Up is fine, but he sounds like he is too much out of breath through the whole album. Yes, I know he is pushing 60...but he is competing with 18 year-olds. PAUL...do you know why people don't buy those old songs? I would rather hear 14 new McCartney songs and be blown away as I was in the past with Band, Tug, Flowers, and Pie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Paul but....","review":"I have loved Paul all my life, have every CD and vinyl song he ever made, even dogs like \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" (with picture sleeve). But this is a lousy album. Paul's voice sounds an octave higher than it should be on several songs, particularly \\"Lonesome Town.\\" But my main criticism is the mixing of this album. He was obviously going for a \\"raw\\" sound, but he went way overboard. The bass and guitars sound fuzzy and not sharp and it sounds as if they didn't rehearse worth a damn. I much prefer the rock n roll album Paul did in Russia. The only song I can listen to on this album without getting a headache is \\"I Got Stung,\\" but Elvis did it better.I still love Paul forever, but I'm going back to \\"Flaming Pie\\" to dispel the bad taste this album left in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"It is amazing to me that the price for this CD is similar to the price for Abbey Road, Let it Be, Band on the Run, Flaming Pie etc. It is all well and good that Mr. McCartney had such a great time covering these very special songs, but i didnt have much fun listening.

IF PAUL WAS TO GET TOGETHER WITH SOME NEW TALENT AND COME OUT WITH A NEW SOUND HE MIGHT GET BACK TO WHERE HE ONCE WAS. HE NEEDS TO REINVENT HIS SOUND LIKE THE STONES.

It has a good old vocal feel and it relies less on new technology, and more on guitar and vocal style of 50's rockabilly. The new versions of classic songs such as Blue Jean Bop and Movie Magg are excellent. {Carl Perkins would be proud!} Of course they are not exactly like the original, but they have been given a whole new aura and feel through McCartney's interpretation. Of course it is held up by the solid writing of the three new songs, and McCartney stays true to the vocals. Flawless singing, of course. If you are an old McCartney fan, or just a fan of old 50's music, this will be an enjoyable CD for you. This is one of McCartney's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old time rock n roll by a great rock n roller !","review":"Paul has hit paydirt with this collection of 1950s tunes (and a few new ones, too) - most of which I had never heard of - but they are good - buy this one to relive (or make) some good old rock and roll memories !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tribute Album","review":"Paul McCartney's tribute album to 50s rock is a great album. These songs were inspirational to McCartney and inspired him when he was with The Beatles. These songs plus the three McCartney originals are true to 50s rock. The guitar by Pink Floyd's David Gilmour is phemonenal throughout the record. This album also has a dark undertow with Paul's performance of songs like No Other Baby and Lonesome Town because of the passing of his wife Linda. Favorites include Blue Jean Bop, All Shook Up, Run Devil Run, No Other Baby, Lonesome Town, Brown Eyed Handsome Man, Coquette, I Got Stung, Shake a Hand, and Party. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycling and knighthood - unsatisfactory combination","review":"I had not bought a Paul McCartney production for a long time. I was intrigued by his latest disc, and ordered a copy. Imagine my disappointment to learn that one of the all time most talented men of music was recycling songs from my pre-teen years, and that he did not do as good a job as the original \\"artists.\\" What a shock to know that Sir Paul cannot sing as well as Ricky Nelson! What is the world coming to? Would Ricky be Sir Ricky if he had lived?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh You're So FAB Paul....","review":"If only the self-absorbed, obnoxious personality of McCartney could be removed from this recording. The best thing about this is the great band assembled- which barely gets a mention. McCartney wallows in his usual \\"ain't I cute\\" obsession. The accompanying booklet actually has a drawing of McCartney looking like Elvis- with the caption \\"Elvis McCartney\\". Dude, as far as being the authentic source of rock 'n roll, you don't measure up to a bead of sweat on Elvis' brow. Overall, superb musicianship. Gilmour is great. Song choice is so-so; some songs are preadolescent-level embarrassments, others are good solid rock 'n roll. Why this guy is still trying to come off as a teenie heartthrob, I don't know. A very professional effort by a bunch of guys who really know what they're doing, but still comes off sounding contrived and fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Poor!","review":"I can think of much better Rock albums than this...I think that in the over 200 reviews here, we can see that Mccartney fans are blind and deaf! The first track is good with some great guitar work.....but the rest just because one huge blast of distorted sound....like a radio dial lacking clear reception....the album is loud in the same way Ricky Martin's music is loud....but there is little to truly appreciate...McCartney once again tries to hard to prove himself...first MCartney tries to prove that he's into art like the embarressing exhibitions he's done, then prove that he's into avante garde like the Fireman stuff, then a poet with his Standing Stone ego, then he tries to prove that he's a rocker...even in Anthology 2 he changed the track line up so his Rockier song would come after Lennon's ballads...costing many more trees to be choopped for corerected booklets....I hope someday the real McCartney comes out....but right now he neeeds to retire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it Be, Paul","review":"Now Paul is going through his bad Buddy Holly phase. Give it up, let it be Sir Paul. Your once great talent is gone and this useless album proves it. You are rich and old and you need to get off that long winding road.

I KNEW this CD would ROCK!!!","review":"After I heard Flaming Pie, I knew Paul was heading back into a different musical direction. His music has made a drastic change, and a change for the better. Now, after more than 30 years after the Beatles, Paul is back to do the music he became famous for. This is why I was not surprised of the quality of Run Devil Run. Paul, like the Beatles once did with covers, reinvents songs like Blue Jean Bop, Shake a Hand, I Got Stung, and the rocking She Said Yeah. I am just looking forward to his next album. Remember, he did say this is a good place to start.Note, my review would actually be 4 1/2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, and with some surprises","review":"I saw this one in the used CD store and decided to give this one a listen. It was a blast, plus Paul covered some obscure songs, which is what sold me. Instead of covering just overplayed oldies, he dug deeper and put a nice spin on the familiar tunes as well. It gives the listener a great perspective on the roots of rock, without being overbearing. To those out there that say the only good music came out ages ago need to remember one thing: this music was disliked back then by another generation just as much as you dislike today's music. If music always stayed the same, it would have gotten very boring and rock never would have happened. Then you wouldn't have this great CD to listen to. Think about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Run Devil Run makes me happy!","review":"RDR really makes me happy!! Paul is so great on this album. Because I am only 17, I thougt that maybe I wouldn't like 50's music, but the way Paul sings it is just marvellous. He makes me love him even more than I already did. So people, BUY THIS ALBUM NOW and let Paul carry you away and make you HAPPY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"THIS is what Paul McCartney was born to do.

Rock in it's purest form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul cuts loose at last","review":"With Linda's passing, Paul needed a project to throw himself into. Paul threw everything he had into this recording. Who knew he could still sing like this? Little Richard's forgotten 'Shake a Hand' is absolutely reckless and how long has it been since you could say that about Paul's well crafted but emotionally conservative solo output. The title track is nearly as amazing and the support from Pink Floyd's guitarist and Deep Purple's drummer provides Paul with the most forceful musicians he's worked with in 30 years. If you thought Paul was doomed to repeat his silly love songs then listen to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kills me...","review":"That record is killing me. I had lost faith in Paul after the first couple of Wings album and I sincerely would never have thought that I would, one day, feel so excited about one of his records.Musically speaking, it is solid, sober and energetic. No grease or cholesterol. \\"Party\\" is a great song that reminds me of Paul's \\"Long Tall Sally\\" world version. \\"She said yeah\\" is great. And even the three Macca songs are excellent - nothing to compare with the quality of \\"I saw her standing there\\" though...I felt that Paul was less megalomaniac than usual on this record and went back to playing good solid bass lines while singing. A feel of fresh air.Excellent record. I've been playing it in loop for the last three days and I don't think that I will stop soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMINAL!!!","review":"If you are a Beatles or McCartney fan,you must get this CD.I would rank it as the CD of the year and McCartney's best.You can believe all the great reviews on this site,it is worth every penny.

He sounds younger and more hungry than for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No McCartney album has EVER rocked this hard!","review":"This is Paul's \\"sequel\\" to the his wonderful Russian album of rock oldies/standards. \\"Run Devil Run\\" far surpasses the earlier release by giving us a much more raw sound with a lot more excitement. At least 6 of the tunes recall the sound and energy of \\"I'm Down\\" and \\"Long Tall Sally.\\" Most of the tunes are obscure but great songs by famous artists (Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Carl Perkins) and the two Elvis covers are among the highlights (\\"All Shook Up\\" and \\"I Got Stung\\"). Paul definitely sounds like he had fun recording these songs. What a gem!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I have listened to Run Devil Run completely several times now and am simply amazed at Sir Paul again. Every song on this album is strong. In many ways it reminds me of the early Beatle rockers he did. My personal favorite song is the final track on the album, titled, \\"Party.\\" It reminds me so much of when Paul sung, \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" back in 1964. His voice sounds just as pure and powerful as ever. This album has great variety, probably more on the heavy sound, which I prefer. I have always felt Paul has the best power voice in music history. (I.E.= Sgt. Pepper, Long Tall Sally, I'm Down, She's A Woman, Drive My Car, Helter Skelter, etc.) So for those of you who are fans of Paul in that genre, then this is an absolute must have for you. For everyone else, it is still a must have......come on guys, it's Paul McCartney, the Most Successful Composer of Music of All Time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul is great once again!","review":"Better than CHOBA B CCCP!

Considering the lose of his wife Linda last year, nobody would have expected him to come out with a new CD so soon even if it is mostly cover versions of obscure 50's singles and B sides, with three 50's style originals mixed in. It should also put to rest once and for all if McCartney was/is a great rock n roll singer or not. Give that one a break will ya critics! Anyhow, if you look at the ex-Beatles body of work, the other three don't even come close despite Paul's weaker moments. It will be interesting to see how this one stands up on todays charts along such light weight's as Ricky Martin and the Backstreet Boys. But sales won't be the final measurement of this album nor should they be.

It is accurately named however: \\"SONIC\\" scrubber-- it does MAKE NOISE! Woo Hoo! BUT, this is not to be confused with an \\"ULTRASONIC\\" type cleaning technique which is quite effective at cleaning things like jewelry and industrial parts.Also, don't you have to wonder about the value of anything that has to be hawked on TV by the guy that always yells? Are these things ever worth even the \\"S&H;\\" charge?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a manual brush","review":"Don't waste your money. It's a gimmick.

Unlike many such studies though, this author concentrates not on those great 18th and 19th Century awakenings, but on revivals of the 20th Century. Some of these are not well known at all, so his information is most appreciated, eg Solomon Island in the 1970's, amongst Australian Aboriginees in the 1980's, etc. He does spend an awful lot of time focusing on 'renewal' in the 1990's (eg Toronto), which many, including myself, would not include in the category of true historical revival. Apart from this, this is a most worthwhile read indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I couldn't put it down.

In those days you couldn't download songs using Kazaa, you just had to wait for the song to be played on the radio again so you could hopefully tape it in its entirety. This book isn't for everyone, but it's recommended if you have any nostalgia for the 1980s. Yes, the Smiths are timeless but '80s music was much more than New Wave and New Romanticism; it was really never just about the music. In the end, How Soon Is Never? isn't just about the Smiths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and True","review":"This is simply an amazing, pure-hearted book about being young/not so young and loving a band. Both a coming-of-age tale and homage--Somewhere Morrisey is reading this novel, singing [Respect]. Not just for all you lovers of the Smiths, but for anyone looking to read a truly beautiful and special novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent memoir; terrible novel","review":"The first half of the book, which is basically a memoir of Spitz's teenage years, does a pretty good job of re-capturing that experience -- not bad for a grownup. I especially liked the part where the characters spend weeks imagining what the Smiths might sound like, before they actually get to hear them -- we forget how difficult it was, back in the '80s, just to hear anything that wasn't on top 40 radio. Just like Spitz (or his character, which I take to be him, pretty straight up), I was sure that the Smiths would make angry, distorted, parent-annoying punk music -- and was quite surprised to find that they made sweet, jangly pop (though still with plenty to annoy the parents).However, the second half of the book, in which Spitz tries to imagine a new plot, doesn't quite work. Stick to memoir, man, and you could do good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the Smiths, and I'm not even a fan","review":"This book is an insult to the Smiths, and I'm not even a fan of the band. I like their music well enough, though, and respect them for trying to make honest, insightful songs. I like novels about pop and fandom, though, so I picked this up -- what a mistake. This is so self-indulgent it makes Morrissey look positively retiring. There are some good lines, but as a reader you pay for them by slogging through half a dozen bad ones first. I'm not as disappointed in the author, who presumably was trying his best, as in the publisher for trying to fob off this Nick Hornby cash-in. Skip Spitz (and for that matter Hornby, too) and for great writing about fandom and obsession, try Frederick Exley's A Fan's Notes. I like football even less than the Smiths, but THAT's great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring","review":"As an unpublished writer, the fact that this book was published by a major publishing house and was, somewhat, widely read gives me the motivation I need to continue writing. If this book can get published, I can write a book worth publishing.The characters in this book are completely one dimensional. They feel like caricatures of real people, and I didn't care about them at all. At times, I wondered if that was the point, and the book was supposed to be some kind of farce; but somehow, I don't think so. The worst part is when Joe's parents are sending him to rehab and he insists on going to these posh recovery centers - only to escape immediately after arriving. It didn't seam like a realistic thing for a strung out kid to do, and I wonder if Spitz was kidding.Seriously, it's been about five years since I read this book, and I still think about it every once in a while, and I check online hoping to find that it's now out of print.

The volume can reach rather loud decibels, and is pretty clear.

I would prefer a flat-screen LCD television (both for the size differential and the clearer picture), but this television does have the built-in DVD, so you don't have to clutter your room up with more cables and wires and plugs than necessary, and its significantly cheaper than its LCD counterparts.

The bucket contains an assortment of vehicles: a small train, several cars and trucks, an airplane, and a helicopter. Most of them snap together to form a train. Despite appearing cheap and fragile they are actually quite durable and can easily stand getting whipped across the room or at the nearest sibling (and they are light enough to not knock too many things off the shelf or break any glass). They are the perfect toys for travel because the individual vehicles are not small enough to easily get lost on a plane or in a hotel room and they make no noise and require no batteries (a huge plus). And it's refreshing to see my kids playing with something that requires a little imagination. All in all a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"Both of my boys love these. As another reviewer said I took a leap of faith based on the reviews that my kids would like these. I thought they were somewhat expensive (I paid $39) but they have been totally worth it. The cars/trucks are a perfect size for their hands and it is pretty impressive how smooth they roll. We have had them in water, sand and all over our house. I was glad I bought the 15 piece bucket as there is such a nice variety. They also work with the Megablocks car transporter truck, which the boys also love. I am always finding these cars, airplanes, helicopter and trucks in it. They only thing they find difficult is hooking the pieces together, which is a task I sometimes find a little tricky myself, but is a cool option (especially with the train)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring for my 2 1/2 year old....may be better for younger toddlers","review":"My 2 1/2 year old played with these once and that was IT !

There is only one story, very basic with drawings that look like they were done by a five year old. The activities included are only a few coloring pages that again looks like it was drawn by a very young child. I would NOT RECOMMEND this book to be purchased by anyone for anything over $5.00.

So I went to their concert last night here in Pittsburgh, not knowing what really to expect from them, but they were a very laid back friendly kind of band.... very comfortable and engaging with the audience.... Ambrosia has such a commanding presence, it's unreal..... she's the real thing, and she knows it.. What's cool about it is that she's very intelligent, charming and funny as well. You could tell they were having fun. I think I witnessed an early show of what is to become a very big band in the future.

How to describe this? Well, the instrumental arrangements are actually pretty cool, but the singing is mechanical and the lyrics are what I would call stupid. It adds up to an unpleasant mismatch sounding like a bad karaoke vocalist fronting a professional band.Also, the album cover is a little misleading.

I treated this camera like a baby, so it should have lasted for a long time. They would charge me $115 to fix it - and then that is only guaranteed for six months. Minolta customer service told me that it is the nature of mechanical things to break and I happened to get one that broke. Do not buy this camera unless you want to buy another one next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Unique...So Much Gutsy Style...","review":"Ruth Brown was the real name of Dinah Washington......she changed hers and THIS Ruth Brown didn't. And this Ruth Brown brought us one of the most original, unique, gutsy, soulful and earthy voices the world has ever known. Eartha Kitt doesn't have an EARTHY voice....Ruth Brown does. And this is the best recording she ever made. Sensual, sexual renderings (as you would expect) on songs like \\"Help A Good Girl Go Bad\\" and \\"Hurry On Down To My House, Baby\\".......but only this diva could turn \\"On The Good Ship Lollipop\\" into an erotic listening experience that makes you blush! 'Course she could melt her way through those ballads, too.....\\"Here's That Rainy Day,\\" \\"Whispering Grass,\\" \\"Table For Two\\"......\\"I Know Why (And So Do You.)\\" This really is the best recording she ever made, the most definitive of her range and talent and jazz expertise, and if they tell you they're out of stock right now......tell 'em to order more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singer but badly mastered CD.","review":"Ruth Brown is original, unique and super! But the mastering on this CD doesn't do her justice. The orchestra is LOUD while Ruth's voice is scarcely audible way in the background! The orchestra blares away and Ruth is barely there. You have to strain to hear her. What was somebody thinking? Get this recording but try to find a different version -- the CD I'm describing here is by \\"Garland.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Strained dialogue and transparent plot","review":"Perhaps I was expecting a little too much of this book after reading Palmer's The Fifth Vial, which I found thrilling and well-written. I felt the dialogue in The Society was strained and that certainly made it all less believable for me. This was a barely entertaining yet quick read, and I easily figured out who was behind everything about halfway through. I will (cautiously) give Palmer another shot and am hoping he impresses once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely okay","review":"This is my third Palmer book, and my least favorite of the three. The overall storyline kept me going, but it's just not that great of a book as far as believability, dialogue quality and character development. The ending seemed a far stretch (downright silly, actually) and the epilogue was annoyingly preachy and one-dimensional. Meanwhile each character was purely one-dimensional - either \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" - a bit simplistic, in my opinion. This had potential - but the author could simply have done it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, but dislike the political views.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, dispite the incredible ending and the unexplained gaps in time. My major complaint is that at the end I had to listen to a long diatribe about HMOs and support for socialized medicine. I was very surprised that a doctor would be pushing socialized medicine and so heavily in a novel.I gave the story a four and 1/2 and had to subtract 1/2 star for the anti-managed care propaganda at the end. I listened to this book and overall was done well. I do wish readers would find out the local pronounciations of places. In New England we do have many places that are spelled very differently than how they are said and I get annoyed that this is not researched. I am sure this happens in other regions of the country too. At least the reader didn't try to do a Boston accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMO's Beware","review":"I found the stories regarding the HMO's to be entertaining. The plot was fast and kept me going. Sometimes unbelievable things happen and you have to give the author a pass to keep the story rolling. (lady cop survives being shot in head but then can single handedly take down 3 tough bad people - highly unlikeley)I found Michael Palmer to be a new author i just found. Having first read Medical Cure and now this.This book is worthy of a run through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"\\"The Society\\" was a poor read.The plot was lame; the characters terribly stereotyped.Quite a superficial book, perhaps written more as propaganda rather than for literary purposes.Palmer could have written a decent book had he really chosen to explore the abuses of the HMO system.Instead Palmer chose to write something on the order of pulp fiction that would have bored a junior high student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old.","review":"A bit disappointed. I really enjoyed \\"The Patient\\" but have been under whelmed with this authors more recent books. He is very talented at creating likeable protagonists and unlikable villains. I have however, become really tired of the same basic plot: a likeable physician gets involved with a villain or group of villains, the doctor's reputation is ruined, the doctor uncovers the notorious (and often unbelievable) scheme."},{"rating":"1","title":"medical fiction....socialist preaching","review":"The premise of The society is written using a tired formula: Evil Corporations with unlimited power start killing to make $$. The plot is absurd. There are some interesting stories of managed care abuses and shortcomings. Then there are more and more and more. Palmer does a decent job of showing some of the problems with managed care then makes the misguided leap that the answer is socialism! He holds out the Canadian system as the ideal ( I know for a fact that it is not). If you think that socialism is the answer to our problems, you may enjoy this book. If you want to understand the complexities of healthcare and think for yourself, this book is not for you. Again, the plot is laughable, the message is aimed at the simple minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so silly","review":"This book starts out well. The character development of Dr. Will Grant is good. It gradually descends, though, into sort of a 'Dawn of the Dead ghouls as HMO executives'. The kidnap event in the end is very poorly done. I spent alot of time feeling embarrassed for the author as I listened to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Doctor does it again!","review":"Doctor Michael Palmer just gets better and better. Although the premise for his story is serious (deadly HMO's)he has developed a stunning use of humor and his descriptions of the doctor's craft are breathtaking. Not since Frank Slaughter and William Nolan have I been so entertained and enlightened by medical fiction, and Dr. Palmer has eclipsed the genre.A great read, and we can only hope for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy","review":"The problem with this book is that you don't know if you want to pick it up or just do anything else including sleeping. The main plot is fairly regular so you'll make an endeavor task to keep reading it. When you get to the final part you'll see that the book's finish is just ridiculous. If you read this book -that I don't recommend- you'll know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Palmer has rapidly becoming one of my all time favorites. I can't wait for the next one. Great suspense writer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much rant mixed with too little good writing","review":"Had to stop reading about 1/3 of the way through. Love a good adventure and am no fan of managed care nor of HMOs, but this book is overwhelmingly preachy and hits one over the head instead of using good writing technique to make a point within a believable story line. Might make an interesting editorial but not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Palmer books for me","review":"I've read a bunch of Palmer books, and it seems like each one gets worse. This one is a greatly exaggerated indictment of managed care and promotion of a national single payer system (a concept which I basically agree with). The story line is same old same old -- although, admittedly, an exciting page turner (which is the only reason I give it a 2, rather than a 1)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"I found this book pretty boring. The beginning is OK, but then it's just one clich�� after another. To top it off the author tries to sound as if he has any idea about serious health care issues, but in fact he is clueless. The premise: HMO - evil (they want to kill people), doctors - good (they want to save people) is overly simplistic and maybe good for a kindergartner. I wish he'd stick with the mystery plot. I recommend you try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical thriller/social commentary","review":"I'm a Michael Palmer fan, and this book didn't disappoint me. Dr. Palmer takes aim at a very real problem in our society, the bad side of managed care. When someone also begins to take aim (in a very real way) at executives in the industry, things start to get interesting. The medical aspects are accurate and realistically drawn. The sad stories sprinkled throughout the book of problems with managed care carriers are all real. The plot moves rapidly, although there are a few leaps of faith that may be a bit of a stretch. But, all in all, it's a good read...and a thought-provoking one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference for residents!","review":"The Primer is an excellent learning tool to use during a Rheumatology rotation.

Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Use","review":"I look at m any movies and purchase many movies as well. But this movie was horrible, first off they used a video camera for filming and itis very obvious. The actress seem like they are just feeling their way through the scenes.

You have been warned if you purchase the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ghost Story","review":"This is a good low budget movie that is mostly creepy and tense with an occasional moment of bloody horror. It's a fine production with a consistent strength, from writing and direction, acting, and location aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Confusing","review":"I'm not a fan of a movie that has so many characters in it that you can't keep track of who's who. There are too many scenes where the girls are showed crying, or thinking, or engaging in some sort of creative work, with a song playing and no interaction with people or anything taking place. I'm not a fan of that type of film making. It's like they just use that technique to fill up time. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY!??!","review":"Come on...REALLY? Rented this movie because of all the high ratings, we figured half way through they were left by the filmakers friends since the movie was really amateurish. I felt like I was watching the a film school final. On the other hand it did have potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"With an additional $500,000 this film would have been pretty good","review":"This is a three star story, with a three star score, played out by one star actresses against one star production values. The direction gets two and half. Schmidt is clearly competent but still has a lot to learn.Is it scary? No. There are some genuinely great moments and good scenes but bad acting, cheap effects and poorly mixed audio prevent it from being effective.It's a real shame that mindless crap gets the big hollywood money while smart, thoughtful films like this one have to make do with papermachet and shadow puppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"earnest failure","review":"this was a small shoe string budget independent movie which I didn't care for but I will say that the makers of this movie were trying to deliver as good a film as possible given they're apparent resources"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Caboolture Kid-I used to be your Drummer!","review":"Hi there!I have been trying to contact this guy for the past 12 months.Hi Keith, if you read these reviews???Remember me?

Adding a steel guitar for 2 bars does not a country song make. Moreover, he fails to even perform good songs, regardless of genre. You don't have to be Hank Williams, Sr. incarnate to be good. Uncle Tupelo mixed rock and country beautifully; Keith Urban does not. Nashville needs to really reexamine itself. Fake, lame, teeny-bopper garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album kicks! What a talent! He is truly unique!!","review":"Keith's debut album after being with the Ranch is a solid performance! The Ranch was absolutely one of the best albums I've heard. It went from rockin' country to masterful ballads to amazing guitar licks. The probelm was timing; radio wouldn't support it so this album is something radio is and should support. Please don't compare this to the Ranch. Take it for what it is. Keith is the real deal and is more country than many mainstream country artists. Hello, Shania Twain! Anyway, check it out and see for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mellow music","review":"This is early Keith - much more mellow than his newer things. Very nice, but not as much \\"punch\\" as he has now. We listened to it traveling to Mt.

I can't wait to get his new cd, Be Here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best","review":"I bought this cd three weeks ago, shortly before seeing urban in concert. I knew nothing about the music except that I liked what I'd heard on CMT. I was thrilled to learn that the rest of the songs on the album are of the same quality, and I have listened to it every day since the concert. There are no words to describe the sheer pleasure of listening to someone who loves to play the way urban does and with the highest technical skill, which is tempered with the elusive quality called \\"feeling\\" that is absent from so much of music today. The music, in my opinion, is primary, and that comes out in \\"Rollercoaster,\\" the only instumental, which showcases urban's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite New Performer","review":"When I first got this cd, it was soley because I loved the song \\"it's a love thing\\", but now that I've had it a while, and have listened to it several times, I love the whole thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban's cool","review":"Keith Urban's self-titled debut release is one of the more interesting albums I've heard recently. I purchased it because of hearing\\"It's A Love Thing\\" on the radio and really liked it. Keith's guitar work is incredible and his ability to play a variety of instruments (he is also credited in the liner notes with playing the Ganjo, and the electric sitar.) so well is truly a talent. The instrumental \\"Rollercoaster\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album, along with \\"I Want To Be Your Man (Forever), and \\"I Thought You Knew.\\" Hopefully Urban continues to progress and has a successful career in country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Urban","review":"This album is terrific. I love country music, and Keith is such an asset to what counrty music is today. I read the editors review too and I have to say, I beg to differ. This album may not be your \\"traditional country\\" but it is where country music is today. And it is amazing! An amazing first album here in the USA for Keith, and they will only get better if that's possible. I love \\"It's A Love Thing\\", \\"But For The Grace Of God\\", \\"Your Everything\\",\\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" Keith is not just sexy, but talented and a gift to the Country genre! Keep up the great work Keith! I can't wait for his soon to be released third album to come out. In the meantime check out Keith Urban Golden Road, and also Keith Urban in the Ranch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GREAT!!!","review":"This is a wonderful CD.

Not only is the music great, but the lyrics have some major depth. Knowing what Daniel went though the past couple years made me just want to go buy the Cd anyway. Ana's song is beutiful!, and well as \\"i miss you love\\", and so on. If you like either ,more metal-type rock, or softer ballad type rock, Neon Ballroom's the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silverchair has burst into the scene","review":"Neon Ballroom is the wickedest album brought out by the boys. Open Fire is so deep and thoughtful. We never really thought about the prospect of the group bringing out a song like Open Fire when they first brought out Frogstomp and Freak Show. But now, we'd sort of expect something like that. Anthem for the year 2000 shows their thoughts and what they want to believe in. It's kind of heavy and the video clip for it kick's ! This album is going to go so far . I also think that people and critics are going to finally take them seriously. Their next album is going to rock the pop-rock industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neon Ballroom-the perfect addition to your collection","review":"Neon Ballroom is an AWESOME album. The music is great, the lyrics are great, it's all great. On most of the songs, you can understand-and ever relate to- the lyrics. If you just wanna rock, listen to Frogstomp. If you're angry, listen to Freak Show. Neon Ballroom tends to lift your spirits if you are down and depressed with songs like Ana's Song and Black Tangled Heart. Then there is Anthem for the Year 2000, Spawn Again, and Satin Sheets if you want the fast, heavy rockin music. I was hoping for more heavy songs myself, but Neon Ballroom helps you realize that a song doesn't have to be heavy for it to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Silverchairs best album its so awsome!!!!

Great songs by an awesome band. Anthem for the year 2000 - amazing. Ana's song - one of the best songs ever written (how can you top a song like that?). Miss you love - awesome. Whatever you buy from amazon, make sure this is in with it. A must have for any CD collection, or music lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a NIRVANA copy","review":"John Daniel's has matured incredibly since FROGSTOMP, and the band is becoming original. Silverchair is a great band with deep lyrics but not nearly as talented as NIRVANA. Still NEON BALLROOM gives listeners great songs from beginning to end and will keep you waiting for the next album. If you are a fan of alternative music BUY this CD now! It will be worth every penny, even if it's not Nirvana-it is Silver chair's time to shine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This is one incredible album. The progress silverchair has made in 4 years is astonishing. It's hard to believe these guys are only 19. It's so obvious how much these songs mean to them, especially Daniel- you can hear the emotion in his voice and in the very personal lyrics. There is an incredible amount of diversity here, something which is getting harder to find. And all the songs are just as powerful live. If an album this good can come from silverchair at 19, imagine what's coming in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sense of maturity? Give me a break.","review":"This is a sophmoric effort (albeit their third album) by a bunch of graduating high school seniors. The first single -- \\"Anthem\\" -- lets this be known with such idiotic lyrics as \\"we are the youth; we don't want your fascism.\\" They try to be deeply political but come off as know-nothings. Want some good tunes with smart social commentary? Try Rancid, Chumbawumba, Blur or The Specials. (Unfortunately, Silverchair has a cut on the forthcoming Clash Tribute CD - yech.) Can I give this disk zero stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER!!","review":"This is a MUST! Nomatter who you are or what genre of music you normally listen to.... THIS CD WILL PLEASE EVERYBODY!!! My favorite, most listened to CD EVER!! Love this!

Well, after the first listen, I was stunned. At age 20, Daniel Johns and his band have \\"grown up\\". Songs like \\"Miss You Love\\" and \\"Paint Pastel Princess\\" carry the same bittersweet softness that propels \\"Ana's Song\\". And the chorus-driven \\"Anthem for the Year 200\\" will have you chanting its lyrics before you can say 'I love Silverchair'. Other highlights are \\"Black Tangled Heart\\" and \\"Emotion Sickness\\", both employing orchestraic parts throughout. Even the song \\"Point of View\\" will stick in your mind. I recommend this album if you like \\"Ana's Song\\", Silverchair, or love seeing a talented band mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"For lack of any better words, this is an album you MUST HAVE. Besides the fact that these guys are amazing songwriters, they present it so well and fluid-like. Everything seems perfectly in place. Great lyrics too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing..","review":"This is one of, if not The, best CDs I own. Though there isn't an accurate way to describe Silverchair's music, I would say it's close to a mix between The Smashing Pumpkins and Radiohead with a completely original twist. I've never gotten sick of this album. I love \\"Open Fire (Ana's Song),\\" \\"Paint Pastel Princess,\\" \\"Steam Will Rise\\" and everything else is great.Please don't think twice.. buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult album","review":"Life must be hard on Silverchair. The young band could have settled into the role of Nirvana Jr and rapidly stagnate. This band has other plans and if one listened to tracks like \\"Cemetary\\" on their previous album \\"Freakshow\\" - you see the inspiration for this album.Silverchair continue the progression towards more emotional rock on this album but not without difficulty. Daniel Johns sounds more unsure of himself having shed most of the Cobain croon. Songs alternate between the new softer emotional stuff to some rather dull grunge. In sum, the band is going through a transitional phase giving hints of where they really want to be but are not quite there. At the same time they try to hold on to their past roots but to no avail.Unfortunately this album is less consistent than \\"Freakshow\\" which was in itself rather uninteresting. Most tracks miss their target. Its hard to fault the young band for trying and I think that their best years are ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I admittingly just got into Silverchair. Neon Ballroom is the first album I have bought of theirs, and in my opinion, it is their best. Daniel's lyrics go beyond self-loathing and teen-angst and are derived from real problems, such as his struggle with Anorexia (as referred to in \\"Ana's Song\\"). The whole album itself is just brilliant. The use of the orchestra on the few songs adds much more texture and depth to the already mindblowing, gut-wrenching, emotional songs. The opening, \\"Emotion Sickness\\" covers almost every genre of music you can think of, a very diverse song and a perfect opening. Songs like \\"Spawn Again\\" and \\"Anthem for the Year 2000\\" are the easiest to rock out too, while \\"Miss You Love\\" and \\"Ana's Song\\" are beautiful, melodic and twisted. My favorite track of the moment would have to be \\"Do You Feel The Same.\\" If you like bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, etc. try Silverchair. Do not miss this album. I suggest to anyone that they go out and buy this. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album","review":"I just bought this album a while ago, and it was the first time I've ever heard Silverchair. I was blown away! I love it. I like nearly every song on the cd. \\"Ana's Song\\" and \\"Miss you Love\\" are gorgeous ballads, while \\"Anthem for the Year 2000\\" and \\"Black Tangled Heart\\" rock! The only song I do not like is \\"Spawn Again,\\" but other than that, the album is perfect. Daniel Johns has a thick, gorgeous voice, and you won't be disappointed by the guitars. I HIGHLY reccommend \\"Neon Ballroom.\\" It's bad-ass"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silverchair...","review":"Neon Ballroom has some of the most interesting music I've ever listened to.

I have been a Silverchair fan for some time now, but when I put on their latest CD Neon Ballroom I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Are these songs that Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion rejected? It certainly seems that way. The song \\"Miss You Love\\" made me think that frontman Daniel Johns heard the Goo Goo Dolls song \\"Iris\\" on the radio and decided to duplicate it. Lots of adult contemporary schmaltz, and when they try to rock out (i.e. Spawn Again) the result is utterly laughable. The only marginally good songs (Dearest Helpless, Satin Sheets) sound like attempts to recreate the magic of previous work, only it doesn't pan out. I would say that you shouldn't believe the hype: There are plenty of talented rock bands that aren't getting the promotion. If you must, pick up one of Silverchair's other albums, or better yet, check out the band Feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is this!!!!","review":"I waited the longest time for this cd and when i heard \\"Anthem for the year 2000\\" i said..this can't be the hardest rockin song on the cd.....I was wrong it is a wussy crapy sucky cd.It is hard to emagin this is the same band that made frogstomp and freakshow....Anthem for the year 2000 is the best song but yet it still sucks badly..this cd lacks in every catigory..It doesn't rock..depressing lyrics.....God if i wanted crap this awful i'd buy a lenny kravits album.......NOW THAT IS BAD.............HOW SAD IS THAT..........All i have to say is there next album beter be good or they will probably disapeer like that band presidents of the united states of america....they had 1 song.....what the hell was it...oh yeah peaches....i'll shut up now and go listen to nirvana(THEY NEVER MADE A BAD SONG......EVER!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Australian music at its all time low","review":"This band has to be one of the most over-played, overated, talentless excuse for musicians ever.

I made a major and great leap from the BSB( which I don't care for now) to Silverchair. I then found out about what the songs on the CD meant and I was so psyced that, unlike lots of popular music today, none of the songs were about things like a crush on someone, going on a date , whatever. It was about real things. Silverchair is awsome and I don't care what others say!!!! I've never heard of any of the songs on their other albums, but who cares? I've got Neon Ballroom. I've listened to this CD everyday (I'm not kidding) for almost two months now and I never get sick of it (that's how much I love it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silverchair is quite great!!!","review":"Although Frogstomp and Freakshow were really great albums, I think that Neon Ballroom is Silverchair\`s best one. Silverchair is my favourite band and I\`m always surprised how they connect punk and heart-felt lyrics in such a great way."},{"rating":"2","title":"is it just me or does the lead singer look like BRAD RENFRO?","review":"I LIKE IT ALOT. ITS A GREAT CD. SOMETHING U CAN LISTEN TO WHEN DOIN ANYTHIN. ALL MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE THE CD AND ALWAYS LISTEN TO IT, JUST AS LONG AS WE CAN PUT IT ON FULL BLAST.

I waited for a hell of a long time for this cd to come out and what did I get a GENUINE PEICE OF @#$@!!!!! There first cd is the best and always will be if they keep this crap up. And now they show their true side....... hahahaha thats funny. This cd makes me puke it reminds me of the GOO GOO DOLLs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I liked Silverchair until they put out this album - it has become apparent that the band has run out of quality material. The album sounds like it was hastily recorded and written under record company pressure. Even worse, they have gone in a softer, more commercial direction with this album, which makes it all the more disappointing. I would recommend this to fans of Matchbox 20, Goo Goo Dolls, and Bon Jovi (the three bands they resemble most on this release), but those looking for an awesome modern rock album should definitely look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd!!! Been a fan for years and not disappointed.","review":"Yes, it's finally out and I love it. After there first cd came out when the members where only 15 years of age, I was a big fan. And there second cd was just as good. This cd is really worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise? No. Talented? Yes.","review":"I believe this album is their best yet. They have combined several types of music and put in one cd that can loft you to sleepy world one second, then feel like the tomarrows alarm clock the next. The feeling they are just teenage know-nothings is correct but what else can they sing about? The final Four? They have opinions just like anyone else. Just because they sing about it doesnt make them a bad band does it? Can't wait for the next album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy two...","review":"Buy two copies of this album! a real Silverchair fan will melt this CD soon after getting it. I am not trying to boost amazon sales (I got mine in town) i just mean that I LOVE this CD.. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good cd!","review":"THis album is well put together.

I recomment buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is amazing!","review":"I was astounded when i heard Neon Ballroom.

I love it. Every song is great! Daniel went with feeling on this album- making it difficult to label them as anything. I hear hard/soft Rock, I hear orchestral arrangements, I even hear some screaming/metal sounds on \\"Spawn Again\\". This album blows me away. It's original, it's a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"words fail me. Wait, I've thought of some...gorgeous, evocative,varied,symbolic, deep...I love this album. I heard Anthem for the Year 2000 on a radio station by some accident, as I was not really a fan of ANY current music atthe time. I talked myself into buying the album for this ONE SONG...and have not regretted it once. i now own every CD they have put out, plus those of various similar artists(Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam,Radiohead, etc.) Wait. why am I even writing this review? Everything i want to say about this album has already been said numerous times by numerous people. This is not music, this is Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired!","review":"Man, these guys were inspired when they did this album. You have to believe, I have cried listening to songs like Emotion sickness or Steam will rise It's emotive, passionate and touching. The sleeve art is also interesant, with a different art and motive for each song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Aussie band since AC/DC!","review":"I knew two songs on this CD when I bought it (Y2K, Open Fire), so I wasn't sure if it'd be good or not, but as it turns out, it's one of the best CD's I've ever bought. It's got slow songs, fast songs, everything. The only song I don't like is \\"Spawn Again\\". It sounds like a bad Deftones impression. I've never heard anything on their previous albums, so I don't know if they've made a leap, sold out, or just stayed the same. All I know is that they kick @$$. The cool thing is that they're only a few years older than I am. Another good young band is Eve 6. I wish I had talent. Anyhow, this is a great album that you won't be disappointed with. Oh, and if you like \\"Open Fire\\", you'll like \\"Miss You Love\\" even better. Reminds me of Def Leppard back in the good old days. That's about it. Keep it real, dudes, and come back to Austin real soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i don't understand?","review":"many people have compared neon ballroom to such bands as matchbox 20 or the goo goo dolls. the difference is that silverchair's lyrics are not about falling in love or making out. speaking of the lyrics, many have said that the lyrics are poor and you have even miss- quoted the lyrics. i would sayt he best part of this album is the lyrics and the emmotion behind them that comes from real life experience. when you lock yourself in your house for a year your not likely to come out with upbeat, fast tempo songs. i definitely reccomend this album- for EVERYONE. it's time you started to think about the music you listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best I've Ever Heard!!!","review":"This CD is so cool. Silverchair is the most talented band around. This CD has hardcore stuff, like Spawn Again, and Satin Sheets, but it has the really more orchestral focused songs, like Emotion Sickness, and Ana's Song. All the songs on this CD are just so great, it is almost overwhelming, the first time I heard Ana's Song, I was Completely hooked on Silverchair!!! This is really worth buying!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock with soul","review":"I love the emotions coming from each song. Everything sounds perfect. This is the only Silverchair album I have and think is exceptional music. \\"Spawn Again\\" is rad. \\"Emotion Sickness\\" is such an original jam. My very favorites are \\"Do you feel the same\\", \\"Steam will rise\\" and \\"Black tangled heart\\". Dark and beautiful alternative rock gangsta cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CD I'VE HEARD","review":"I cannot believe what a buy this cd is. Daniel Johns is absolutely a genius!! It's sad that there are many bands around who have the same sound and their whole album sounds like one long, dragging song. This cd has SO much diversity, that it ACTUALLY brings tears to my eyes when I listen to it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Third Album from the Group!","review":"I purchased this album the day it came out, after anxiously waiting a year for silverchair to produce some new material. When I first listened to it, I fell in love with it... it automatically became my favourite silverchair album, and practically since, it's all i've listened to. I absolutely love the addition of the strings and piano to silverchair's heavy rock, especially David Helfgott's appearance on \\"Emotion Sickness\\"-- that makes the album even more awesome. I hope silverchair continues in the future to have the reputation where each album gets better and better... what'll they think of next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bomb","review":"I loved this c.d. It has such a range of music that I listen to it almost every day. I got it before it came out because of some of my connections, and I'm not tired of it yet. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad,but not as good as the other 2.","review":"It has some very good songs, such as 'anthem for the yr 2000', 'emotion sickness' and 'spawn again', but doesn't contain enough heavy guitars or rage like the first 2 albums. Still they are settling down, and will hopefully produce some more class albums. Recommended!-If soft, Radiohead style is what you are after, then look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"kicks @$$","review":"This Cd is one of 1999's best albums so far. It has good heavy metal songs like \\"Anthem for the year 2000\\",\\"Spawn Again\\" and \\"Satin Sheets\\" but it also has a lot of good ballads like \\"Miss You Love\\",\\"Do You Feel The Same\\",\\"Emotion Sickness\\" and \\"Ana's Song\\". Overall a good variety and most of the songs are very well done. Buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically, they have matured 100%","review":"it's their best album to date. but don't count out frogstomp and freaksho"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is silverchair's best cd","review":"I think this is by far silverchair's best album, there's various sounds and it's really good!! If you liked Freak Show and Frogstomp you'll love this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A positive progressive maturity!","review":"I have followed Silverchair's progress from album 1, Frogstomp. I think all intuitive appreciators of fine rock music could see that even in their genisis, Silverchair were showing signs of things to come. Freakshow allayed my fears of the second album syndrome and was even better than I'd hoped. Now, with Neon Ballroom, Silverchair, fellow aussies like myself, have proven themselve in the world of hard/grunge rock music showing a pleasing, creative maturity and a preparedness to try something new! I already knew that Australia produced great groups and Neon Ballroom certainly strengthens that belief. The stand out tracks are of course, Emotion Sickness and Ana's Song plus a host of others. Perhaps my only criticism, if I could call it that, is the level of juvenile anger still present in the mosh pit favourites, Spawn Again and Satin Sheets! I for one can't wait for the next installment from the boys from Newcastle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, bland, and uninspired","review":"I was anxiously anticipating the release of this album, but when I heard it I was very disappointed. The music is very soft, bland and unappealing - it's hard to believe this is the same band that released the epic \\"Freak Show\\". \\"Neon Ballroom\\" focuses almost totally on Daniel Johns' sensitive side, which gets old real quick - if I wanted to hear that I would put on Matchbox 20. The only somewhat good songs on the album are \\"Satin Sheets\\" and \\"Dearest Helpless\\", which pale in comparison to Silverchair classics like \\"Pure Massacre\\", \\"Slave\\", and \\"Learn To Hate\\". Other songs are plagued by bland arrangements and inane lyrics.I suggest passing over this album and picking up \\"Freak Show\\" if you haven't. It's more mature and smarter than \\"Frogstomp\\" and more eclectic and aggressive than \\"Ballroom\\". Silverchair can do much, much better than \\"Neon Ballroom\\" - it has been proven in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive pop rock","review":"the album neon ballroom is the start of a change in silverchairs music and talents they have evolved so much from the frogstomp days witch was pure hard rock now they are some pop rock bnd like creed and the like thats not nessasery bad i quite enjoy this album just not as much as frogstompStand out songs anna's song (open fire), anthem for the year 2000, spawn again, paint pastl prinsess"},{"rating":"2","title":"My friend can't write this so I'll write it for her","review":"I have a friend who loves Silverchair and after her making me listen to it, I love them too.The songs are very personal and I give Daniel Johns credit for writing them in such an emotional way.My friend and I are practically the only ones in school who even know who they are, and that's sad. Everybody else is to busy doing their little 'N Sync/Backsreet Boys thing that they forget about songs that are written from the soul and a band that actually plays their own insruments. If you really appreciate good music then get off your computer and go buy this C.D. NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silverchair's Best So Far...","review":"Silverchair has matured musically since Frogstomp, and this is seen in Neon Ballroom. The tracks vary from soft acoustic to heavy rock. A great CD in my opinion. This CD hosts a few widely known singles such as \\"Anthem For The Year 2000\\" and \\"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\\" If you like rock, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a really good album. The excellent tracks such as Miss you Love, Ana's Song, Anthem for the Year 2000 and Black Tangled Heart, really reflect Silverchair's talent and prove that they really are one of the best bands of the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"I still remember my disdain for this band back in 1995, and their second album didn't help any. Though I respected what they were doing at their age, I was really bothered by their tired post-grunge sound. I recently heard this album though, and was in complete awe. I immediately lost my \\"I wish I was Kurt Cobain\\" view of Daniel Johns and realized what talented musicians they really are. Any band who can make that kind of evolution from songs like \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"Abuse Me\\" to any given track off of this album is nothing short of amazing. I honestly believe that Silverchair may rank with Tool and Radiohead with their next release or so. In any case, this and Diorama truly deserve a listen, whatever you may have thought of them before."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd ever","review":"i would give it morestars if i could, this music puts you in another place with the powerful vocals, and unique songs, every one is different.

Request this song on TRL."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album!","review":"I don't ahve much to say except this is the greatest album I have ever heard. Not being a Silverchair fan for a very long time, I heard \\"Ana's Song (Open Fire)\\" and fell in love with it. But if you think that the best stops there, you're wrong. The whole album consists of music that is so intense and deep it goes right into your soul. So, if you haven't picked it up yet, you'd better. It's worth the investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, cheap, cheap - only 1/2 of unit heats after 4 months","review":"VERY disappointed, product was sometimed difficult to rotate, now won't even heat up properly.

Doesn't provide an even browing, but seems to cook the waffles through. It also made blueberry waffles without problem. The only drawback: six months after purchase, the unit stopped working. No heating. We're going to try and take advantage of the 1 year warranty, though we don't have the receipt any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a 1 Star because 0 was not an option!","review":"Bought today, tried to make a waffle tonight - ate pancakes on the grill instead. This piece of junk - and I really mean junk was on sale for $40.00 and I will be getting my $40 bucks back tomorrow! Please do yourelf a favor and read all the 1 star reviews as they are 100% true and had I read them first, I certainly would not have bought this item. Flimsy, ready light does not work properly, lock does not work well, and the unit wobbles and does not stay level. Oh and for the record the two waffles I attempted to make pulled apart and hence stuck to the top and bottom of the unit and made it very difficult to clean and repackage! ... and yes, I used oil to lightly grease both sides! Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle disintegrates over time and company will not replace after 1 yr!","review":"I actually really liked this waffle maker, until the handle just fell off! the plastic around the screw that held it on just disintegrated and fell off in little pieces. I had probably had the unit about 2 yrs. The company told me 1) there is no way to get another handle (not a replace-able part), 2) yes they had heard a few instances of this happening, 3) the unit is made in China, and 4) since it was beyond the 1 yr warrenty they will do nothing for me. I told them I would not be buying their brand of products again and they said \\"fine\\". So I would not recommend this product nor the company Sensio (or Bella Cucina), as they do not stand behind the quality of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great waffles right up until it broke because of poor design","review":"We bought this waffle iron at a local store less than a year ago. We probably used it 20 times. It heated well and made great waffles, but the handle came off. Nothing actually broke, but there is no effective way to retighten the handle due to a very poor design. I believe the stress of turning the handle to flip the waffle as recommended is responsible for loosening it a little bit at a time. Since the waffle maker is designed to be turned this way, I see no way it could be avoided. I would recommend looking for something sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Waffle maker, But...","review":"The Sensio 13124 Bella Cucina Belgian Waffle Maker is a great product for making perfect waffles at home, but its quality of craftsmanship has much to be desired. After having the unit and making perfect waffles for 6 months, the handle broke. Now the unit is useless. I called the manufacturer to order a replacement handle and they have been out of stock for 4 months. Every time I called, they said to call back the middle of the next month. If you want a waffle maker that you can use for more than a year...this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy Enough","review":"While this product makes EXCELLENT waffles, the handle breaks and there is no way to repair it. I've been through two. It's a shame, since the rest of the design is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Recalled!!!","review":"I cannot believe that this piece of junk has not been recalled by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. As is noted by others, the hinge was made to break. Imagine having a hot waffle iron break apart in your hands. Rest assured that I will see to it that this product is removed from the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful ...","review":"I bought this waffle iron from Macys. While the waffles were good, the iron itself was really cheap feeling. There are a lot of plastic parts that do not seem to do the job. When rotating the iron 180 degrees, the plastic latch did not lock. There is a blue light that is supposed to indicate when the waffle is done ... this did not work for me. So ... be careful. I was skeptical that this would last any great length of time, and so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and not worth the price","review":"My first Bella Cucina Belgian Waffle Iron lasted just over a year (used two or three times a month) and then it quit working--likely the thermostat. Yesterday I purchased a new one with a slightly different design, and today I'm returning it because it doesn't heat properly, and the signal light is erratic. If you desire heavy, soggy, barely browned waffles, and a signal light that goes on and off regardless of whether or not the waffle is cooked, this is the waffle iron for you. As for me, I'm going shopping for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUre china Junk","review":"I am returning the second of two of these cheap waffle makers with a pretty high price.The off and on and ready lights go wild thru a cook cycle and youcan't tell if done or not.the latest one was defective out of the box. the handle will not disengage from it's cradle."},{"rating":"1","title":"So irate!!","review":"The description say lots of padding in the footbed...well it DOESN'T HAVE ANY!

No one but a ruthless, unredeemable character like Rhys, (although at some point in the book, we're told he's really a good man) could stomach a spoiled, immature woman like Isolde. Aside from having some artistic ability, she mostly cries, bemoans her wanton lack of morals, is rude to the servants and screams at Rhys.Oh, yeah. This reviewer forgot. When a man and woman constantly yell that they hate each others guts, it's called Romantic Conflict.With these despicable characters (not to be confused with a hero and heroine) at the center of the story, the plot is immaterial, and the conclusion is a who-cares. It also doesn't matter if the medieval setting was accurate. This reviewer was forced into scan mode much of the time and groaned in agony the rest.For a story with warmth, complex characters, good sex scenes and lyrical writing, READ ANY OTHER BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun pant","review":"A fun pair of pajama pants that always makes us laugh whenever they are worn.

I liked it a lot, even on first hearing, and I'm not especially a fan of Feinstein's. Why did I buy it? The promise of a Big Band and the Maynard Ferguson name. Ferguson's two albums, sadly currently not available on CD, with Chris Connor are all time favorites. Some of the songs, and all the arrangements, grabbed me here right off, some songs seemed like filler next to some of the standards. Little by little, it insinuated itself into the everyday, and it's now never out of reach. It's pretty hard to single out a track when it's all this good: the smooth and easy \\"Girl Talk,\\" the super \\"One Day at a Time,\\" a killer \\"The One I Love Belongs to Somebody Else,\\" and, best of all, a new one on me, \\"You Can't Lose Em All.\\" Feinstein's delivery of the line \\"Who knows maybe, this could be your loving baby\\" alone is worth the price of admission to one helluva CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best to date.","review":"The selections on this cd are great.

Ms. Glass obviously has a lot of art training so her projects look nice when finished. However, she mentions cutting the paint with thinner, but gives no guidelines. And \\"tinting a glaze\\" whatever that entails. She gives no tips on picking a color scheme which is something most newbies need help with. Techniques are a little out of date. What she does with rags and sponges can now be done with special rollers. I also found the resolution of the images poor and had difficulty seeing a finished pattern well. Some guidance on where to find the products she used would have been nice. Overall, this was not a very helpful video.

The price had been over $200 but finally came down to a reasonable level.....glad I didn't purchase at the higher price, and not sure it is worth the $30 I paid.The book title should include \\"Product and Sources\\" as more than half the book (i.e. Part II: Products and Sources) is nothing more than manufacturer's source information for children's products. Great if you want children's sources all in one place, but this info can be found in many design directories, updated annually.Part I does provide standard dimensions and anthropometric information for those who design spaces for children, but half of that info is found in manufacturer's catalogs used when purchasing products. The book may be a quick, time-saver/concise reference since all the info is compiled into one book, but only a few chapters are useful.

Feldman, just how would we have done that? Saddam was very determined to keep his postion in Iraq as leader. He even provenly employed doubles of himself to thwart any attempted assassination overthrow of him by plotters. Also, Saddam killed over a million of his own Iraqis amd terrorized close to all of them while he was in power. Strong state you claim he had, huh? Sure! Terrorizing, national dictators often do manage to have strong states under their sway. Also, he sent SCUD missiles at Israel. Feldman, aren't you Jewish? He was bad for your Jewish cousins, if you are. Think about that for a while. Lastly, the USA has 350 million people. Iraq had around 23 million. We have a right to put ourselves before them in importance due to our much greater numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy Junkies are Back!!","review":"I have been a Cowboy Junkies junkie since I first heard The Trinity Session.

The better tracks on here (\\"Touch Sensitive\\", \\"Antidotes\\", \\"The Crying Marshall\\") proceed from the model suggested by \\"Levitate\\"'s better tracks - heavily processed sound.What we did end up with here is an interesting collection of noise, like an industrial-tinged grunge music with the occasional layer of strings on top.

They show very short clips (usually 20 to 30 seconds) but never entire songs. This is almost certainly because they don't own the copyright to these films, but short snippets followed by commentary counts as \\"fair use\\" and is therefore legal! If you have access to bootleg videos you can find longer versions of the actual footage. If not, I would still recommend that you skip this DVD and get \\"Total Rock Review (Dts)\\" instead, since that's a very similar product to this one but at least it has the entire 30-minute 1972 Belgian TV appearance uncut as a bonus feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the below review","review":"There's nothing I can say that wasn't said in the first posted review, but I would like to add one or two things.

I paid to see GENESIS play it, not some arrogant critic who thinks I care more about his opinion than watching supposedly unreleased Genesis footage.

It is one of those rare books that is so beautiful that itleaves me virtually speechless. The beauty is haunting and remains with the reader longafter the last sentence is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Storyteller","review":"When this book by Canin first arrived on the literary scene, clearly it was one that was seminal in bringing traditional storytelling back to American fiction.

My cat (who usually eats ANYTHING) would not touch the food for an entire day. Ok, that plan didn't work.Next, I held him down, put it in his mouth, and held it shut 'til he swallowed it. He was NOT happy with me and hid for the rest of the day. I would be mad too. Anyways, he threw up about 1/2 of the pill and never gave him the 3rd one.

Beautiful, immersive, atmospheric worlds. Monumental architecture. Eerie music. Breathtaking cut-scenes. Ugly, creepy arch-villain.2. For the most part, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to solve the puzzles.3. Great high-tech tools to use, impressive vehicles to drive and fly, creative use of everyday objects. When you pick items up, they zoom off the screen into your inventory with a whooshing sound. The inventory feature is exceptionally easy to use.Cons:1. Some locations are too dark and murky. I suggest that for the very dark places, you might want to adjust the brightness/contrast on your monitor to make it easier to locate the hidden goodies.2. Some mechanical levers/controls respond correctly only if you move the mouse VERY slowly.3.

By the time you get to the end, though, your first thought is \\"That's IT?!?!!? Boy, that wasn't worth it!\\". A very disappointing ending.I played this game on a fairly up-to-date PC, and it never made the computer crash, but I did have to go to Dreamcatcher's website twice to download two programs that are important in the playing. Kinda stupid...as other reviewers noted, they shouldn't have released a game with so many bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money, a waste of time, a waste of 120mega bites","review":"I'm sorry, I just could not get into this game.I'm not even going to talk about all the bugs in this game, that would take forever and I can only use 1,000 words anyway, so i'll just say this: There's no replay value - sure, you can play through the game once, but what do you do with it after you've beaten it? - and there's nothing to keep you interested in the game if you're stuck on a puzzle. I have to say, I think the only reason dreamcatcher makes games like this is so they can sell strategy guides.Basically, what i'm trying to say here is if you only get the chance to play 10,000 video games in your lifetime, MAKE SURE THE CRYSTAL KEY ISN'T ONE OF THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 years in the making for this?","review":"I was really excited about this game. I loved both Myst and Riven and was hoping that this would be as good or at least playable! I read all of the reviews and thought that the bugs and the lighting and the thing crashing every 2 seconds were not going to be that bad. Don't waste your money. This could be an enjoyable game, its not the most challenging but still enjoyable the only thing is you have to worry the whole time that something is going to go wrong, or tools that you know you need to do something just don't work no matter how many times you click on them.You need a cheat book just to tell you where certain things are because you can't see them! I am going to try to finish this game but I am very frustrated. Why would someone put out a game with this may problems?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Product?","review":"I think I'm being generous with the 2 stars I gave this product. This game seems unfinished, as if they ran out of time and just slapped it together. The graphics are okay in some places, not great though, and NOTHING like the pictures on the box. Do not be fooled. In fact, the playing window is quite small, which makes it seem as though you're looking through binoculars - very distracting and annoying. Most of the graphics are very bad. Some of the scenes look like unfocused pictures. The shadows are just black areas with no depth. I don't know what else to say - it's bad. The voice actors add nothing to this game. They aren't really characters, they just appear briefly to provide information. To top it off, there is no ending cinematic. The game just ends with a screen that says, \\"Congratulations!\\" The puzzles are sometimes entertaining, but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Do not waste your money","review":"This game is so full of bugs that it's almost embarrassing. What were the people at Dreamcatcher thinking? Riven and Myst set a very high standard for games.

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash City","review":"Despite reconfiguring my computer more times than I can count I could never get this game to play for more than a minute without crashing and giving my entire PC some sort of seizure. Contact with Dreamcatcher elicited a polite but never-ending stream of things that must be wrong, settings that had to be changed, shutting down EVERY running program (including Intellimouse). Good GOD, Why would you put out a game that requires a user to COMPLETELY RESET their computer just to be able to play it! Yes, it's cheap--but that doesn't mean you should buy it. Twenty bucks for a game that doesn't work is still twenty bucks gone.

I spotted this while browsing in the store and thought it looked similar to MYST/RIVEN and would keep me occupied until the Miller brothers came up with more Myst sequels. That will be the last time I ever buy a game without checking online reviews of the game. While the graphics and puzzles are pretty good, I found the plot and characters two-dimensional. I also had a technical problem with one of the puzzles and had to download a patch that solved it for me. Gee, how fun it that? Dreamcatcher should've known better than to release a game with so many bugs in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"does indeed fall short","review":"Crystal key has terrific graphics, yes. The storyline has a promising beginning. There are occasional snippets of good music. However, the game is horribly slow on my computer. It often took 30 seconds or more to move to the next scene, which made it cumbersome to use. The storyline falls apart after the opening and, while you go about seeking things and solving puzzles and such, the storyline virtually disappears. The creators have created a nice universe, but leave you with no information about it. The ending, as well, is horribly anticlimatic. You finish the game wondering what happened and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Attempt","review":"It's been a while since I have picked up a Myst clone that has kept me interested. (Riven was the last, and it was also by Cyan.) While the game is sometimes slow and unintuitive, Dreamcatcher Interactive shows promise in this genre of games. Many of the bugs mentioned by afore reviewers have been ironed out, and some limited keyboard commands have been added for saving and quitting. The puzzels range from simple to confounding, and the worlds are well rendered. The only element that is missing is a sense of culture and identity to these worlds, but someone may not necessarily miss that in a game. It's only twenty bucks SRP, and worth the ride if you are a persistant and patient gamer. Diehard fans of 3D shooters may loose their patience, but people who love to delve into unexplored worlds should find The Crystal Key a satisfying experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Not a Player, Just a Watcher","review":"The player has no choices in where to go or what to pick up. You mainly just wander around looking for the cursor to change so you'll know where to go next. Then you get to ride there on a video. There is no logic to the puzzles, and no way to identify what you are looking at. There are no clues to point you in the right direction, just changing cursors. I got tired of wandering around and resorted to a walkthrough just to get it over with. Even then, the game makes no sense. There were repeated crashes, error messages, and reboots.A complete waste of money - and a good thing it was not very much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Boring","review":"Story and puzzels seemed illogical.

I did not enjoy this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at All","review":"Confusing and impassable. Think I'm talking about NYC traffic? No, this was the Crystal Key. In my opinion, this was the worst game I have ever played! I couldn't even get past the first \\"land\\", even after following two walkthroughs! The plot didn't make sense, and wasn't exactly great. I would advise to play the real Myst instead, instead of some spinoff trying to live up to Myst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, too easy, no great thrill&#65533;","review":"I experienced no technical problems, (though I'm running 896 megs of RAM, less RAM may mean more glitches and freezes), however this game is so simplistic, it's not worth the time.As a RPG fanatic, I have to say the main character had no development or real background, no choices other than to select where to go and how to solve puzzles. There is no interaction with other characters and, other than the graphics, I can't think of much that redeems this game.Save your money or spend it on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"That crackling noise is your money burning","review":"This is dragon lady's daughter now excuse me, I am going to breath fire.Long story short, if you are intellegent, have a head on your shoulders, are not a martyr,enjoy a good computer game, and are not on heavy medication, DON'T BUY THIS FRIGGN' GAME!!!!!!!!!!! You spend an untold amount of time banging your head on the key board and yelling profanitys at the computer as you play this pile of filth. The gliches are constantly annoying, half the time the screen is too dark, the story line is so uncomplicated a preschooler would blush, and to actually get anywere through this quagmire you have to go online and get the cheats (speaking of which, the cheats I found online were obviously written by the company, because I wouldn't have been half as darn freaking cheery if I had written them.) Bottom line, whoever you are where ever you are love yourself dont buy this thing.

No help from the DreamCatcher web site and you can forget customer support. Even when the game does run, it's not very interesting and some of the places are so dark, you won't even see the puzzles.

I can accept that. In fact, I was expecting that. However, even without those two comparisons, The Crystal Key falls flat. The graphics, while beautiful, are confusing and overdone. It seems like if they spend countless hours designing these environments, you should have more freedom to explore them. No such luck. If it's nonessential you can't go anywhere near it, and if it's essential, it's too dark to see even with my monitor's brightness turned all the way up. The puzzles have a faint logic to them, sure, but it's convoluted logic at best. I had to resort to a walkthrough site at the beginning of the second world, and for almost every puzzle after that. The recorded messages make sense only in the context of someone there to tell you what's going on. All in all, it's either too set up or not set up enough, and not worth playing even at the low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this when I was in my \\"Adventure\\" mode. Several other games earned my dollar, such as Lightbringer, Gabriel Knight 3, Kings Quest 8, etc. This one, however, was not really with the $19.95 I spent.The visuals are beautiful. The gameplay is too linear however. You have to \\"do this\\" before you can \\"do that.\\" There is no way to accomplish your goals in multiple ways. Whereas this concept was astonishing 3 years ago, it no longer appeals to the gamer.Another gripe: WAY TOO SHORT. If Al Gore had played and beaten this game, he would have demanded a recount and a re-recount.

Raw in Ten Minutes seemed to be one of those endeavors that did not have complete dedication. Like other reviewers, I too agree there is too much fat from nuts. You can call nuts good fat, but fat is fat and it can build up in your arteries. As an example, one of the author's recipes calls for two cups of Brazil nuts. Using www.nutritionfacts.com, one cup of Brazil nuts contains approximately 88.4 grams of total fat and 20.1 grams of saturated fat. Two cups would equal 176.8 grams of total fat and 40.2 grams of saturated fat. Yikes! If the recipe was for two to three servings.....well, you decide if it is too much fat for you. I recommend that anyone transitioning to raw analyze your recipes for nutrition content. Also, read \\"The China Study\\" and \\"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\\".I gave this book two stars just for the author's enthusiasm for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Raw Books Out There","review":"2 stars for having a few decent recipes. Of all the raw 'un-cook-books' I own, this is only one that I've been disappointed in.Many of Au's recipes are very unbalanced, as if some of the ingredients amounts are incorrect - extensive changes improved them, but if the changes are extensive, I feel like it's not really his recipe I'm using anymore. Other recipes were fairly tasteless & disappointing. I couldn't get a few recipes to 'work' (gel together, or mix as claimed), no matter what combination I tried.The raw books by Alyssa Cohen, Juliano, & Sarma Melngailis are much more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a beginner","review":"I would not advise a beginner to raw foods to get this book -- some ingredients are just too hard to come by: Hawaiian Mellow White Miso? Azuki bean miso? kelp granules? dulce granules? Definitely for the more experienced raw foodist, who probably stacks all these ingredients in his pantry. Plus, it doesn't help that all the pictures are in black & white. If I wanted to attract someone to healthier eating with raw food then the more visual stimulation you can give them, the better. And I'm sorry, but these, at least in my opinion, are not 10 min recipes....maybe if you've been in the raw food world for a while but definitely not if you're just starting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has motivated me to go on living a full life.","review":"I just finished reading \\"More Alive Than Ever ...Always, Karen\\" for the first time and I feel it was just what I needed! I lost my boyfriend to Leukemia two weeks ago after a two year battle and have been searching for some form of consolation. This book explains in detail what Karen felt right before dying, during death, and during the crossover to a different plane of existence. She communicates through her Mom that she still exists and that we all eventually return to our spiritual existence when our human life has ended. This book is similar to \\"Embraced by the Light;\\" however, Karen's was not a near-death-experience but a life after death experience here on earth. I believe now with all my heart that those we have lost are still near us watching over and guiding us. This book has given me the motivation to not only continue my previous goals but to do more on this earth so that I may grow spiritually before my time here is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can a personal account be plagarism.","review":"From the book and the interview one can see that this was truly a mother not seeking sensationalism but a woman inspired to tell the story her daughter had communicated to her.

It's identical to old-time radio hours; watching T.V. with no picture kinda thing ya know? Those of you who like gitaroo man, do not purchase this CD. The music is blocked out by japanese people that just continuously talk.Once again, I must stress this: THIS IS THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!

If you're unfamiliar with this term, the best way to describe it is a bit like a radio drama. Seems to a retelling of the Gitaroo Man story, (all in Japanese of course) with U-1 and Puma battling the various enemies in the game. Although it focus's a lot on Gregorio III from what I could make out. By the way, Gregorio's Japanese voice is just as good as his English counterpart in this ^_^The inside booklet seems to contain mini profiles of all the characters and what seems to be a relationship graph (that's what I wager it to be anyway, wish I could read it :P ) Obviously this is all in Japanese.Despite the language barrier it's still ammusing to listen to, may not be to everyones taste though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine introduction.","review":"This delightful little volume is a compilation of articles written for American troops bound for France in World War One. While their effect on the average doughboy may be questionable, they give a powerful and invaluable insight into one of the most perceptive minds of the age.Wharton, in her most engaging and always readable style, discusses First Impressions, and examines issues of Reverence, Taste, Intellectual Honesty, and Continuity, and, in her essay on the New Frenchwoman, reveals perhaps more about herself than her subjects.Highly recommended as a fine introduction to the author.(The numerical rating above is an ineradicable default setting within the format of the site.

So for me to say that this new recording is even better says a lot. This is a recording of the full score, with incidental music included and there are even songs that were deleted from the show. Karen Ziemba and the rest of the cast are terrific; her voice is less operatic than that of Inga Swenson in the original show and is easier to take of repeated hearings.

I just purchased two of the Fiskars 7\\" saws from Amazon, mistakenly thinking that they would be of the same blade quality. I was wrong. The Fiskars saw will not cut with anything like the authority or ease of the Stihl (it cuts at half the speed and with three times the effort), and is likely to be of use only as a paperweight. This \\"new\\" Chinese-manufactured Fiskars product, in my opinion, will do a lot to ruin Fiskars otherwise good reputation. Amazon, would you like these saws back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blade, get the fiskars 6\\" slider instead!","review":"We use a lot of pruning saws for trail building. I have probably bought a dozen in the past few years. We normally cut through hardwoods like manzanita, oak and Madrone. We have been using the 6 inch sliding Fiskars saws and they work well. I do prefer the folding blade like the 7 inch features because it doesn't loosen up and slide when you are sawing like the 6 inch model. Also it would have been nice to have the extra inch of saw blade for larger limbs.Well after failing to get through a small pine with this saw we threw it out. The cutting ability was absolutely terrible - nowhere near the 6 inch. Unfortunately the 7 inch model is not even worth carrying in the pack. We ordered 2 more of the 6 inch saws. Fiskars should check their manufacturing sources as this product is nowhere near worthy of the brand which we have mostly found to be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This folding saw does not cut very well.

The blade would barely cut. The teeth had been spread too far apart so I pushed them closer together with pliers to create a thinner kurf. This helped some but was still slow.

Congratulations to Kathy Dobie for presenting such a well documented account of being a teenage girl in a small town. I found it easy to be drawn into this girls life and the feelings and experiences she went through. Although I initially thought the book was going to be a much more harrowing, dramatic tale, I still enjoyed it immensly and has lead me to think about how I, too felt at that age. A great achievement from an unknown. Let's hear more from her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I just finished this book today. I am typically a fast reader, but not in this instance. It did not hold my attention enough to where I wanted to sit for periods of time to read it.The beginning of the book, really talked about nothing. The part having to do w/ the title was interesting, but after the act, it went back to being a bore. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It should read quickly for being so short- instead it drags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoir at its Poignant and Lucid Best","review":"Kathy Dobie takes a tale of a messy and traumatic sexual coming of age and through the alchemy of lyric imagination achieves art with a capital \\"A.\\" Much American memoir of recent years has tended towards the self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing... ego overwhelming form. Not only does Dobie avoid this trap, she rises to dizzying literary heights. This is a political book without rhetoric, a psychological journey without therapeutic cliche, a journal of sexuality that isn't tawdry, an American memoir that embraces the reader as tenderly as Dobie has her own shattering past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and sincere..","review":"Painfully sincere, and brutally honest. This poor girl was punished over and over for a decision (mistake) that she made at the age of 14. It takes an incredibly strong person to survive not only the event, but the horrible, cruel years that followed. As a young teenager, this girl tried several times to confront her demons and face the problem head-on. A sad story with what I deem a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. I really enjoyed it.","review":"Despite the graphic nature of some scenes in this book (let's face it - they see worse in movies),The Only Girl in the Caris essential reading for any teenage girl. In a world where sex is everywhere, and girls are losing their virginity earlier and earlier, this book illustrates the trouble being too free with your body can lead to. Sex can be a beautiful thing, especially when you are just discovering your sexuality, but it can also be very, very ugly. Many parents are reluctant to discuss sexual matters beyond the 'what's happening to me' talk. Yet, without our guidance, how can our girls learn the difference between the beauty and ugliness of sexual encounters? It is our responsibility as parents to move past our embarrassment or conservatism and teach girls how to behave in the world they live in (vastly different from when we grew up). This book is a perfect example of the ugliness that can result if girls do not learn to control their sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"ALL I CAN SAY IS ITS NOT AN EASY BOOK TO READ BECAUSE I KEEP FALLING ASLEEP ON THE BOOK...IT WAS HORRIBLY WRITTEN...I DID NOT WANT TO GET TO THE NEXT CHAPTER AT ALL I JUST WANTED TO SEND IT BACK..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Shallow","review":"My daughter read this and found it wonderful, so I gave it a shot. It's a short book, one you can finish in 3-4 hours. That, I feel, represents part of the problem. This book lacks depth. The periods of her life are isolated from each other and she fails to make the connections between her family life, her wantoness, the group sex, and her afterlife.I'm not sure Dobie understnad the impact of her choosing to engage in sex with those boys in the care had on her adult life. Instead, the ending leaves one with a voyeuristic hangover similiar to watching The Jerry Springer Show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A girlhood, an assault, the coming-of-age","review":"Dobie's book can be split into two distinct parts, the first about her early girlhood in a crowded Catholic family of six, trying to form an identity for herself within her family. As an adolescent, Dobie relates more to boys than girls, and she makes some decisions that push her away from the girl cliques, yet she is never fully accepted by the boys. Dobie learns the hard way, the very hard way, that there are different standards for boys and girls, and this culminates in the life lesson of being \\"the only girl in the car\\" for a sexual assault.The recovery portion of this memoir leaves the reader wondering about Dobie. She became chaste and stuck it out in high school until she could escape to the world of New York city and leave her past behind. I finished the book still wondering about her, as I think Dobie wondered about herself in the years to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I first saw this book I thought it sounded very interesting, but then I was proved wrong. The book didn't have much to do with the title itself. The first half was describing every aspect of her home, friends hair color, etc. I found it boring. The middle got slightly more interesting. Then it was like she wrapped the entire book up in the last chapter. She went from child throughout the book to BOOM the rest of her life history in the last chapter. I also felt that she didn't explain very well what she learned through the experience. The book was jerky reading and as other readers said what was the real reason she was like this? She would one minute say what a happy family she had and then say how she hated them. Just made no sense to me. I have read alot better memoirs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we there yet?","review":"Although Dobie has a story to tell it should have been condensed into a much smaller form. Through out the slow first half of the book Kathy Dobie is no different, or even mildly entertaining, than any other girl growing up in the suburbs. Her life story finally does take a disturbing turn down the wrong path of adolecent discovery, but her writing of it leaves you feeling indifferent towards her. This is not a story of survival and triump, it is simple muddling through a depressing life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manages to make bad girls boring","review":"I could not make it past page 50. The part I did read was Dobie telling childhood tales of neglect and being misunderstood, ostensibly to explain what happened later in her life. This should have been more exciting than it ended up being.The main problem I had was that the narrative just wasn't compelling. At no point in this book did I care about what happened next. Perhaps Dobie was pulling her punches and keeping things clean for the youth. Young girls thinking of becoming the neighborhood bicycle could benefit from this memoir, but in my experience, those girls don't usually read.So, the book is a waste on all fronts.

It reminded me of the kind of talk I'd share with friends in high school except our conversation was more interesting and articulate then the people interviewed in this video. You'll see short snipets of the band, repeated, and opinions shared, and repeated, but the only band member actually on the video is a johnny come lately guy who made a rainbow album that most people never knew was even made when Blackmore threw together a band on a whim.

Then only real price guide in my opinion is eBay and I wish people would stop putting price guides in publication. I also agree with a prior comment that most vehicle pictures were just top down shots and I think isometric shots of all vehicles would have been more valuable. Also a picture of the carded figures/boxed vehicles would have added nicely.

Although the audio can be a bit murky, as is the case with most live-concert recordings, the music is wonderful, engaging, and absolutely delightful. For those of us in parts of the country that Leon hasn't visited in a while (Texas!), it's the next best thing to being there. He performs both familiar and unusual material, including some songs I'd not heard before. The cut with his favorite Hungarian coloratura soprano brought back a fond memory of Leon's last Dallas shows over ten years ago.

The box was mashed up, but everything inside was in good shape. The quality of the construction is impressive, but it should be for the price. I immediately spread 150 lbs. of fertilizer with good success. I like the way that the flow stops when you do. My rotary spreader would just sit there with fertilizer pouring out on the ground. Works well on turns and is okay on hills. If you have a full load of fertilizer, it may be hard to keep traction on steep hills, but this is not a fault of the spreader. After the fertilizer began to work, I did note some striping, but I recognize this to be a fact of life with a drop spreader. On the other hand, you have much better control than with a rotary spreader.I would recommend this unit to anyone who has a large area to fertilize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Fresh and Vibrant Electronic Art!","review":"Happened to hear these guys on an internet stream and HAD to look them up.

I am also a big fan of classic Jazz. This album is simply oil and vinegar. Ferry's voice is getting more and more \\"warbly\\" as he ages, and while the music is quite good, it is unoriginal.The two simply don't mix well. This reminds me of a bad Vegas-style concert performed by a washed-up musician trying to wring a few more bucks out of his loyal fans. I am so disappointed. Bryan, if you are listening, \\"Please give us something with substance. We know you can do it as you have so many times before!\\" As for everyone out there reading this, don't make the mistake of buying this - you will regret it from the first note to the excruciating last."},{"rating":"2","title":"You knew this was Coming.","review":"It was only a matter of time before the Great One produced an album of all old standards and torch songs. Bryan was born to sing these songs, and it ain't no stillbirth. Nice light touch, beautiful interpretations, excellent selections. They used to say it was Sinatra's world and we only lived in it, but Ferry's world is where we go to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"The musical alchemist strikes again","review":"With this magical production, Ferry has obviously alienated those near hopeless naysayers reared on a monomaniac diet of \\"modern\\" music with all its catchy synth trappings and infinite levels of overproduction.When the musical alchemist strips down those unnecessary layers, mines for the gold, and reveals the beauty and simplicity inherent in timeless structures, is it any wonder that some must flee? Beautiful, haunting, lush, moving, elegant, poignant, pleasantly addictive, are expressions and words that this creation objectively warrants.One who can transform songs from the distant past into aural pearls that so easily eclipse contemporary options, is worthy of much praise. Bryan Ferry is a gift to the world of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"I first heard this CD on my friends car stereo while we were driving two weeks ago.

I'm not a big fan of 40's tunes and therefore didn't hold much hope for liking Bryan's latest, despite being a huge fan of Roxy Music. But I didn't think I'd find it soooooo mind numbingly dull - worse, even, than Taxi which had one great song and nine fillers.Couldn't any Vegas has-been polish this off? It's no better then Robert Palmer's similar effort a few years ago. Bryan's got a great voice but even covers should be a little more original than this. He's clearly lost the ability to write songs, and that's sad, but he should be out to pasture rather than lolling round the track at half pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let bygones be bygones Bryan","review":"I was truely disapointed with your music this evening.

Just wonderful listening. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired and superfluous","review":"Ferry used to put his heart into covers of old songs. His cover of \\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\\" had an energy and excitement to it. On this CD, however, he sings everything in the same dreary, breathy croon, as if he wants this to be background music. You keep wanting him to clear his throat and sing. Even the selection of songs is uninspired; no one needs yet another version of As Time Goes By, when there are so many old songs that are unjustly forgotten. Much better stuff in this vein is Vic Godard's Songs For Sale, and Bjork's Glim-glo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprisingly weak album from a great vocalist","review":"Make no mistake; I love Bryan Ferry. I got this album after hearing \\"Falling in Love Again\\" (which granted is one of the rare winners on this crooner's CD) at a restaurant. The rest of the CD is so-so, and Ferry's voice wavers surprisingly over some of the note arrangements. Instead of the robust voice that melts thorugh songs like \\"Limbo\\" and \\"More than This,\\" his performance is oddly tinny. Stick to his Roxy Music catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"The art has faded","review":"Gone is the magic that set Bryan Ferry apart from so many of his contemporaries. Way too twee at times. Lost is the artful stylings. The magic and influence that set Bryan Ferry's music years ahead of so many bands over the years! When I think of a Bryan Ferry cover I'm reminded of the brilliant rendition of the Harbach/Kern tune \\"Smoke gets in your eyes.\\" That's the landmark by which I judge a Ferry cover. This twee selection of tunes found on his latest has been relegated to samey same...I mean, I might as well have bought a Celine Dione album or some such. Phenomenal disappointment...save your money or wait for it to show up in the used bins and cutout section of your fav cd shop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned!","review":"If you were expecting a \\"Taxi\\"-style reworking of these old classics, then stay away from this pointless album. Is this all that somebody with Bryan Ferry's talent could come up with in three years?? The music is a straight (meaning it sounds just like your parents' old jazz albums minus the pops and scratches) reworking of old songs that were done many times before by people better than Mr. Ferry. Really, I'd rather hear Mel Torme or Tony Bennett than the sadly misplaced Ferry on these songs. Where the hell is the follow-up to the brilliant \\"Bete Noire\\" or even \\"Mamouna\\"? Hopefully this was just a momentary lapse and he'll return to write an album on a par with Roxy's \\"Avalon\\" very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this some kind of joke?","review":"Brian Ferry must be going through some sort of mid-life crisis, crooning these tunes from the 30's and 40's. He may take this project seriously, but it often sounds like a parody. It's almost unlistenable. And this opinion is coming from someone who owns every Roxy Music and Brian Ferry recording available. Boy, am I disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?!!!!","review":"After 5 years of waiting after Mamouna this was all that Bryan Could come up with? Don't get me wrong Bryan Ferry is a great singer with a lot of talent but unfortunately this album doesn't show much of it. What we get here is something that reminds me of leftover musical table scraps. Bryan's voice sounds terrible and the music itself is boring, dry and devoid of any life. It seems like no effort put at all into the songs and the result was not very good. I,m sure that some fans may criticize my review but I stand my case. This is like the equivelent of eating paper when listening to this. I became a big fan of him especially after first hearing Bete Noire but I am sorely dissapoited with this one. On the positive side the CD itself is pretty well colored and makes a good coaster. It's also good to listen to while reading. It's not a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"As talent goes by","review":"Yikes, this is one of the WORST albums I've ever heard of the standards. Bryan Ferry has recorded some of the most beautiful songs of our time, but he hasn't the voice, interpretive skills or finesse to do them justice. His instrument is shot; that's not singing, that's croaking, that's rasping. What a waste of vintage arrangements when you've got no tonal beauty for this material. That's a shame because these tunes are timeless. You don't have to be Tony Bennett or Frank Sinatra to sing them; I can think of glorious-sounding young pop voices like Tom Andersen, Jack Donahue or Brian Lane Green who can perform the classic songs with such feeling and fun. Believe or not, I've actually enjoyed some Roxy Music in the past, but I'm sorry: Ferry doesn't meet the high standards he's set forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"Bryan was best when For Your Pleasure was new.

The writing is clear, and topics are covered in enough detail as to promote a decent all around understanding of the material.If I could fault the book in any way, it would be because there are perhaps too many topics covered here.

But I guess he represents a large percentage of people.Sky was conflicted and torn, but it was of her own doing...her own greed is what placed her in the position she found herself in.Overall, it was a great movie (but are people really as guilable as Tre and Craig?).

(And why it is so seldom done by real novelists) Donachie's effort fares no better than most; here are no new insights on the era's most hyped liaison which might help to justify yet another fictional treatment. Instead we find the same tired melodrama and cloying passages as every other attempt.Whatever other reviews may say, the dialog is stilted and unnatural, and consequentially the characters never ring true.

Bak while undoubtedly an interesting character does not have a very interesting story or plot in which to reveal himself. The story is lacking in description and constantly refers to the smells of Egypt - such as manure. Too much detail is put on the shipping trade and not enough into the characters and depth of the characters in it. It lacks color, emotion,depth and does not transport one to Egypt as do most of the novels I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grave disappointment","review":"Reading this book I expected to feel the flavor of ancient Egypt and was very disappointed. As much as Haney loves Egypt she fails to convey this in her book. The Elizabeth Peters books, written in a completely different time period at least portray some ideas of ancient Egypt. Haney's characters seem shallow and the dialogue sounds more like modern American than Egyptian.

It would be nice to know where the author got some of his claims and \\"facts\\" if not only for the purpose of chasing down further reading. With no sources the entire book is weakened and really is just the opinions of 14 words press. Therefore, it comes off as a little too much like a sermon, rather than serious philosophical thought.

Mc Van lays out a twisted and paraniod version of dead gods, with Wotan as a symbol of an awakened racial consciousness. Woden is one of the high gods in the heathen religion. Our Troth, Teutonic Religion, and the Poetic Edda are much more constructive and educational books to read about heathenism and Asatru.

It's tedious, the voice acting is pathetic, the graphics are strange, and the plot is nearly non-existant. This game ignores the details of the storyline, and puts forth all their efforts into opening doors and collecting dead rats. I was expecting an in-depth and interesting game, but was greatly disappointed in the end. There were so many areas where the creators could have pushed the story along to make it more intriuging, but of course they did not.Also, the puzzles are NOT logical. They're like standardized tests, only once correct answer when there are more possible ones. Lots of pixle searching, which drove me to read a walkthrough.

Also, although the 2D backgrounds were interesting at times, calling this a 3d game is quite a stretch by any definition.

They have more of an American Indian sound and didn't fit the theme I wanted to hear. The rest are a refreshing change from anything I've ever heard.

Her voice isvery white and tends to shrillness. However, her technique is excellent.This is probably the closest we can come to what Toscanini's Lucia soundedlike since Molajoli worked with him. The tenor, on the other hand,is wonderful. He was married to Toti dal Monte, Toscanini's Lucia.Why she didn't record the role instead of Capsir, I can't figure out.Toscanini recommended Dal Monte to Melba's agent for a tour of Australiain 1924. She went back in 1928 and met de Muro Lomanto and they weremarried in the Sydney cathedral. He has a beautiful voice. The baritoneis also good. The bass is Salvatore baccaloni, who later was abuffo at the met. He also has a good voice.

The only person who actually acts in the film is Michael Chiklis as The Thing. Everyone else give awful performances, especially Jessica Alba. They're not helped by the atrocious dialog they have to say. The script must have taken about 20 minutes to write. I gave it 2 stars because I've seen worse movies and there are a few good effects sequences, especially at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Bore","review":"I was looking forward to this movie until I heard the reviews. I made the choice to rent it and i was not impressed. The movie was deeply flawed. For one thing, the heroes of the movie recieved amazing powers and acting like there was no big deal. The human torch for example, was setting his sun on fire just to impress women. Also, the Thing has nothing to say but \\"I'm the Thing now. Hmmm what a bummer\\". Another flaw is that the fantastic four seem to be causing most of the trouble, and people are applauding them.One more flaw, why is Jessica Alba the invisible girl? That is a horrible move to make. I want to see her at all times.The movie may be called the Fantastic Four, but this movie isn't even close to fantastic. In fact, this is one of the worst movies of 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for adults Lame for kids too","review":"This movie had great sound and special effects, but that was not enough to keep me from falling asleep. The story line was just lame. I have a 3 year old little girl and she loves super hero movies and she told me herself; \\"Daddy I don't like this one.\\" So don't make your kids upset pass on this. Watch in about 5 years when it make it channel 10 broad cast primeier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly BAD! But watch it anyway","review":"This is a terrible movie, seriously this is one time when you should beleive the press, it is awful! In a shock move, however, I am going to recommend it. If you are reading these reviews then you likely enjoy the genere and if that is the case then you will glean enough entertainment out of the 3 of four quality movie moments in the movie to make it a worthwhile investment of 90 minutes.That said, whatever you do - DO NOT buy this movie. Rent it, wait for it to show in HBO in HD or even make it to regular cable but dropping hard earned green on this flick would be a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak super-hero film","review":"The fantastic four was a very popular comicwhen it came out, but this film just did notlive up to the comics. It was terrible, infactI was expecting it to be one of the best super-herofilm ever. turned out, I was wrong.weak script, to fast paced,but the special effects were good.Rated PG-13 for language violence and some suggustive content"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I have to say that this movie was not good in any way. The characters were poorly designed and fleshed out. It certainly did not make you like them. The so called comedy appeal was not funny. It made me feel embarassed for the makers of the film. I don't even want to get into the way the Thing looked. Overall this movie was sad, a waste of time. I didn't even finish it. I was disappointed becuase the other super hero movies have been pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly 4","review":"This movie is just plain silly and dumb. Another reviewer has already mentioned Ben's wife coming out in her nighty. Why does Sue Storm have to turn invisible to get by the crowd when Ben and Richards just walk through it? Why do the 4 pay attention to their \\"symptoms\\" and totally ignore Von Dooms? These conversations in front of crowds were equally stupid. There is no reason why Ben would want to stay in his state after the fight was over.What kind of a \\"scientist\\" thinks that Johnny getting to 5K Kelvin would \\"ignite\\" the atmosphere and destroy the planet?I still find it hard to believe that people throw millions of dollars at a project and yet not spend any of that money on a good story. Surely millions at something would mean attention to detail right? I guess the dollar just doesn't go as far as it used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and just rent this one....","review":"I judge films on the genre and when you have wonderful comic book films that come to life like Spiderman ,the X Men and Batman, then you know that it is not impossible to write a decent film with protagonists that happen to have super abilities. That being said, I felt that the Fantastic Four went the way of Ang Lee's Hulk. The actors are likable, but the script is ridiculous. The only character remotely four dimensional is The Human Torch. Reed and Susan have no chemistry at all. Michael Chiklis comes close to bringing the Thing to life, but he is so bitter that it is not worth watching. Of course, I thought the scenes with the Invisible girl being left in her underwear were gratuitous, but if you got it flaunt it. Von Doom sucked out what life the picture may have had.Overall, I was glad someone treated me to this turkey. I would have hated to pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good scenes but I can't recommend it","review":"Long story short, I liked Fantastic Four. It had it's faults, mainly it's portrayal of Dr. Doom, but it was fun. I was disappointed in the extended cut though. Most of the added scenes were OK. More character development, more story, a reference to the Puppet Master and that Herbie robot, but in the end, it felt as though they just Frankensteined this thing together from leftover parts. The scenes with Reed and Sue in the planetarium then again on the bridge being the exact same scene was the worst offender. And the part where Alicia gives Thing a spongebath just felt wrong on so many levels. There were a couple of interesting documentaries and the original version is thoughtfully included on this disc so for those who haven't bought it yet. All in all, worth watching just to see what could've been but it's no improvement over the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I got it used through [...]. Some comic turned movies, or cartoon turned movies are not that great. This is well worth the money. Plus, it has Jessica Alba in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst comic book movie ever","review":"Heres an idea lets give them super powers the first 10 minutes, without developing the characters. then lets make some cheesy special effects and throw it together with a 5th grade story and 1st grade dialogue. Wanna see how a real comic book movie should be made see Superman, Spiderman, Hulk, Blade and Daredevil."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one is better than \\"incredibles\\".","review":"the incredibles was almost a complete and total disappointment if it wasn't disney i wouldn't have liked it at all! anyway this one is great because it's a mixture i think they didn't want to look like a copy so they took action off their to-do list that's all. and it's funny interesting and great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing...","review":"I can't say I wasn't warned. I had been dying to see Fantastic Four for quite some time. Despite warnings from my boyfriend and my brother that this movie was a huge letdown, I had to watch it and decide for myself. On the one hand, if I'd listened to them, I'd have watched one less bad movie. But on the other hand, if not, my best friend and I wouldn't have laughed at it's complete stupidity (hence why I give it 2 stars for at least it gave us something to make fun of). It truly was one of the biggest disappointments for me in a while. Sad, because it really looked so good in the previews. If you want to see it, I'd advise renting first and then if you like it (for what reason I can't imagine) go buy it. A big BOO from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"Please don't compare this movie to Spider-Man 2 or X-Men 2. Those were sequels. They already had a previous movie to get all the introductions and explanations out of the way. This was a team movie and there was a lot of background information to cover before any actual story could begin. This movie was every bit as good as X-Men 1 and Spider-Man 1. If there is a sequel made of Fantastic Four, I'm sure it will be just as good as those movies. So be kind to Fantastic Four. Sure, Mr. Fantastic is lame but I mean Human Torch is cool! And Jessica Alba is hot! What more do you really need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"I wonder how can a movie with The Shield star Michael Chiklis and Nip/Tuck star Julian McMahon be so dull. The Fantastic Four was my favorite superhero comic book when I was a kid. In fact, it was the only one I would buy. Like most girls, I preferred the Archie books. There was one fun scene where The Thing tries to help someone who was going to commit suicide. All the superheros joined in to help and the world got to see their superpowers. But in general, it was unexciting. It should have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Four...","review":"Gang, I read the Fantastic Four comic books as a pre-teen. It's a joke to me that FF got this treatment. Reed Richards, down on his luck? Reed Richards/Sue Richards, not together? Victor von Doom, financing their work? Even worse, Kirby is buying in to this scheme? Give me a break. I won't waste my money! Two stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"are you ready for the fantastic?","review":"this movie has intense action and a sense of humor.I loved the part on the bridge too. my favorite is mr. fantastic. I loved the fight with doctor doom.overall:9/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:With terrible acting (exception: Michael Chiklis), terrible special effects, annoying character interaction and a paint-by-numbers plot, Fantastic Four has precious little to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"This DVD smells and looks like they going after while down the road comes out with double disk or UNRATEDCUT OR EXTENDED CUT for SURE!! Like they did that with most others DVDS and suck up more money from us twice,In same titles, for example...\\"THE GRUDGE\\", \\"SAW\\",\\"SINCITY\\",\\"HELLBOY\\" And most others & Specialy if is \\"PG-13 rated movies\\", I'm going to wait and buy the real DVD Later on for my collection!!Guess i skip this DVD version !!! If u really wants to see it, just rent it for now! do not buy!!I Guess better be safe then sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"this is not a good movie. i would not reccomend it at all, being that it is dull and tries too hard to make itself into a good action superhero movie. basically, the best parts of this movie are shown in the previews. again, i would not reccomend this movie. you would be much better off renting one of the Spiderman or Batman movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short in every way!","review":"This movie sucked! I mean C'mon! How can you make a movie like this? It had nothing to do with the comic. The make-up was terrible! The special effects were lame! I wasn't even scared! The werewolf transformations looked so fake. You could tell it was a guy in a rubber suit the whole time! If you wanna see a good movie this summer,go see Batman Begins! Just skip this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Wow, what a terrible interpretation of the Fantastic Four. 20th Century Fox, please give the rights back to Marvel so they can fix this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you watched the previews you watched the movie!!!!!!","review":"I was very unhappy with the fact that the previews gave you what the whole movie was! I hate when that happens. It was good though, but I wish there was more to the movie that wasn't seen in the trailers. The special affects where great and the acting was good. It was more of a goofy marvel movie. Kids laughed in the theater and I even giggled a bit. I will say it is a family movie. I will buy when it comes out on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fantastic.....................DORKS!","review":"Let me keep this short, horrible acting with the exeption of Ben Grimm (Mike Chiklis), Jessica Alba as a MISCAST hottie who gives the only reason to see this trash since you get to see her in almost nothing at one point in the movie, no chemistry whatsoever between any of the four, I like Julian McMahon as an actor but his part as Doom could of been better, special effects that look like leftovers from rejected films, no character developement at all for anyone, and on top of that, NO PLOT! For anyone who liked both Spider Man and X-Men films and Marvels crowning achievement, BATMAN BEGINS, do yourself a favor and avoid this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic 4","review":"Fantastic Four [Blu-ray]Product arrived on time. Was very good.entertainment for the whole family.Really good on blue ray. Price is very very good compared to retail stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative and misguided.","review":"The overall plot of \\"Fantastic Four\\" is classic and decent and I don't mind the screenwriters attempting to add humor and romance to the action and sci-fi. A more lighthearted tone to appeal to all types of audiences was a good idea. But the film fails because most of the actors in the film are totally miscast (with the exception of Chris Evans). They deliver their lines with so much cheese that the humor and romance seem silly and the drama, action and science-fiction elements seen hokey. It's a shame because this could have been exciting and imaginative. I think that the worst part of the film is that director Tim Story has no sense of how to properly edit an action scene. Add that to the horrendous visual effects and you have for a pretty disappointing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie.","review":"Purchased this DVD because my grandchildren wanted to see it. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica Alba","review":"That is the only thing this movie has to offer. If you are a fan of the four then read on. If you want to see this movie then stop now. Please explain to me how that Doom is now a multi Billonare industrialist and not a revenge seeking psycho,who's mother was a gypsy with occult powers, with a personal ax to grind on reed richards for causing a face scaring accident.How is it that Ben Grimm is Married? Ben was never married, that I know of and I read FF for over 20 years. Why is Alicia, African American? Alica was white!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the better superhero films...","review":"it's hard to understand why some awful superhero flicks are considered good by reviewers and critics (ex. spider-man 2, batman begins), and why some good ones are ragged on.the fantastic four is the second best superhero movie of recent times, behind spider-man. it's not perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as critics made it out to be. it's leagues better than the first or second x-men for example. but the movie was a large financial success. let's hope ff2 is both a critical and financial success as the ff + silver surfer vs galactus plot of ff2 is the greatest comics storyline ever.ok i rewatched ff the other day and it's pretty bad. i would give it 1-2 stars now. i'm just a big ff fan and the new movie looks promising, but this one is pretty poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"groan!","review":"This one is barely worth even commenting on. I agree with Digibong in that the characters are, well I was going to say awful but he's right \\"ANNOYING\\" is so much more appropriate. Especially this Alba woman that plays The Invisible Girl. Yes, she's OK to look at but I've seen this sort of cookie cutter tart in dozens of xxx rated flicks and they can't act either but no one really expects them to. This woman's acting is so one dimensional, contrived and unconvincing that it's just too insulting to be in the audience.The special effects... blah who cares! Been there done that. Walked out on this one half way through. Boring is bad but this movie is too irritating to even sit through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buena y Entretenida","review":"esta pelicula es muy entretenida ya que ese es su objetivo deberas que no se van a arrepentir en comprarla y pasarse un buen rato ademas de que los personajes estan muy bien plasmados en la pelicula y ya se va a filmal la secuela"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic 4","review":"The acting and the characters portrayed keep well to the spirit of the comic books. Fairly typical story for the escape genre. I enjoyed seeing this come to DVD and I was a fan of the comic. Interwoven within the story line are funny jabs and barbs of banter as well as the struggles and tragedies that each of these flawed characters must cope with.I hope see more movies in this series to develope the spirit of the F-4.I rated the DVD a 5 because I enjoyed it and the quality of the production values does not get in the way of the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't that good","review":"I was kind of disapointed with this movie. I'm 15 years old so i know my movies. It was not good only because they spent too much time fighting with themselves that their enemies. It wasn't that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"i expected this film to suck. Totally. I was surprised to see that it actually watchable. And pretty good! The story was solid, the charcters were treated pretty evenly, not too much focus on any one. The acting was believable. I wanted to hate it but I ended up liking this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was that?","review":"First of all, if a movie takes over an hour to build up the chracter of a villain , it should take more than ten seconds before that villain's wrath is over and done with. I like that a million comic book movies come out each year, but they should force the screenwriters of each one to read the comics and at least be true to the content for the sake of hard-core comic book fans like myself. Doctor Doom could take on these four punks and an army of other heros and not break a sweat, and anyone that is going to see this movie should realize that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is total garbage and a complete insult to the beloved Marvel comic!The plot and direction are more cumbersome than a Mack truck with all of its tyres flat trying to drive up a hill!The acting is beyond terrible,Jessica Alba really should seek another form of employment and Julian McMahon, well him leaving Australia and going to the USA to act is definitely the USAs loss and Australias gain!He as Dr.Doom is the worst acting I have seen on screen in many a long year,he is absolutely appalling!A total waste of time from start to finish and to think they did a sequel which if possible was even worse!AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This movie highly disappointed me. The second one was a lot better. This movie had dumb jokes thrown in and a lot of stupid lines. The visual affects were pretty good which made me give this 2 stars. Worth a rent, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a purist","review":"Okay, first, I'm angry because the original FF concept has been jettisoned for something different -- a la Spiderman, in fact.But then it occurred to me: the original FF was almost 50 years ago, from a time so quaInt, 6-year-olds wouldn't buy it.With that in mind, it's not bad.Jessica Alba is NOT Sue Storm. Sorry. ain't gonna happen, she's cute and all but NOT Sue Storm.Failing that, the cast isn't too bad.The special effects are necessarily 21st-centuy in nature, since this could not have been done 10 years ago.So four of five.

It is very enjoyable for a superhero movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"comic book","review":"This movie is the origin of the Fantastic Four. There is not much plot, character development or even coherence. However, by turning off my mind and just watching, it was quite enjoyable. All the basic elements of a comic book movie are in place. The discovery of the powers is entertaining. The actual \\"battle with the bad guy\\" seems tacked in at the end. (But, who would doubt that the character named \\"doom\\" would end up being the bad guy?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flab-tastic","review":"I heard this stank. Having finally watched it, I'd say it's even worse than most critics agreed back when it was released. It's more like a lame comedy than a fantasy film. See it, only if you are a hard-core fan of these comic books brought to life films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Crap","review":"I saw this movie a couple of days ago and was anything but enthralled by this subpar superhero flick. To start the special effects are pretty bad and don't compare to any other movies of it's type. The cast at first glance seems to be acceptable, Chikilis and the guy from Nip/Tuck Jessica Alba is the only flaw i don't care she may be hot but her acting skill is comparable to Paul Walker. But the script is pretty terrible even the good actors struggle to make anything out of thier lines. The story is stupid and about 75% of the movie is a snorefest and the final act is just cliche and stupid in every way. As you all may know FOX would make a sequel out of The Passion so the next installment of Fantastic 4 will be hitting a theater near you."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Liked It Alot","review":"We really enjoyed this movie. It has humor, action, and a great love story (PLUS some eye candy in the form of The Human Torch;)). \\"Another World\\",\\"Charmed\\", and \\"Nip/Tuck\\" fans will recognize and enjoy the villain (Dr. Doom).I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"See what happens when you DON'T take the material seriously..","review":"Wow. What happened to this film? It was supposed to be this Summer's big hit. While watching this movie at the local $2 theatre, the answer came to me: Design by committee. A bunch of Hollywood execs got together to create this movie. Why else would they cast Jessica Alba as Sue Richards?This also explains why Doctor Doom looks like a big green, corny dialog spewing Van Der Graf generator.Fantastic Four was supposed to be this big blockbuster but hype can only carry a movie so far.

On top of the poor acting the script was utter nonesense and the editing was not much better. This movie is a complete waste of money and I dare say watching it for free would be a complete waste of precious time. It is no wonder why Hollywood is losing money.

So if you put aside the negative reviews and watch it in a light and \\"popcorn\\" mood you will actually enjoy it.The film is about a team that goes into space to study a unique phenomenon which, in turn, alters their dna and they get special powers. And the Fantastic Four are born. Jessica Alba is gorgeous but Flame and Thing/Rock really spice the film up.The film is not really true to the comic book but it does not really matter as it is entertaining provided that you watch it in a relaxed mood. There are some flows and the romance outcome is predictable but you will enjoy it.Moreover it sets it self up for more sequels and hopefully they will be as good.The blu-ray version is excellent and the special effects come out in a stunning form. The picture is as sharp as it can be and makes the film even more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singed Pagoda: The Freedom's Mine!","review":"I must have overindulged in the coffee today...There are actually positive reviews for this turd of a movie??? The director had such a bold vision for this production that he went completely blind. Comic book movies are on the decline again, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to flicks like this one, which take an extraordinary concept and mutilate it for the masses, cross-energized with an electric stupidity and a blatant disdain for anyone who owns a Dr. Doom t-shirt.So....I have \\"Ghost Rider\\" with Nicholas Cage to look forward to.Yeah, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this movie, it'll kill 2 hours of your life!","review":"If you've seen the commercials, you've all but seen the best parts of the movie. Superman IV the Quest for Peace, Batman and Robin (both the Adam West version and the George Clooney version) were better than this dreck, hell, the Hulk tv movies were better than this dreck. What an abysmal movie. FF is probably responsible for my hair loss as shortly after I saw it my hair started falling out.This director should go back and direct Barbershop 3 and stay away from Fantastic Four; about the only thing he got right was the relationship between Ben and Johnny, and those sequences were few and far between.You'd think for an $145 million dollar movie they'd get the grey hair on Reed's temples right, but nooooo they couldn't even get that right, one minute it's grey, the next brown.Boring, awful movie.

Waiting for nothing. This movie is about four people who hate each other who go up into space, gain special powers, spend 99.9% of the movie arguing about how to return to there normal state. I thought I was watchin a soap Opera. Some parts are funny, but in a corny kiddie way. At the end they come togeather for the last 2 min. of the movie and spray the villan with a fire hydrant. THE END. Thats it. Thats all there is to it.No action, just disfunctional relationships. If there is one thing that really made me angry its \\"the thing\\". He spends the whole movie crying because he has super powers and when he gets the chance to go back to being a human he decides he'd much rather stay this way. Whatever.

It's not Spider-man 2 great, but it is on par with the first X-men (i.e. movie could have been longer and the ending \\"bigger\\", but the potential for a superior sequel is there)FF is definitely more lighter & comedic than other super-hero movies...and it should be. The FF has never been dark & brooding...it's always been about a slightly disfunctional family with super-powers.The one issue I had with this film was the editing...the transistion from some scenes seems very choppy...i get the sense that a lot was left on the cutting room floor to quicken the pace of the movie. Hopefully, a extended cut DVD version will be offered with those scenes placed back and the movie should flow better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Economic Review","review":"Normally, I like to spot off ad naseum. For this one, I'll keep it short. To toss this out there, I'm a fan of comics. The Thing is one of my favorite Marvel characters. Now the review-lite:Michael Chiklas (please forgive my poor spelling) is great as the Thing. He emotes well through the suit, and fits the Ben Grimm role quite well. Ioan Gruffudd is OK as Mr. Fantastic, but could have done more with it. Jessica Alba is a waste of space as Sue (albeit a nice looking one), and Chris Evans got annoying as Torch. Victor von Doom wasn't portrayed with any real gravity, either. Jokes were lame, but a decent attempt to portray the four as a family with their share of rows.Not a terrible movie, mind you, but not worth watching more than once. A rental at best. Here's hoping the inevitable sequel is better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want more special features and the extended edition you have to buy it on DVD","review":"Part of the reason I buy movies on disc is for the special features like \\"making of\\" documentaries, outtakes, etc. Unfortunately I haven't found a Blu-ray copy of the first Fantastic 4 movie that includes all the special features you get with theFantastic Four (Two-Disc Special Edition)on DVD. There are commentary tracks on this Blu-ray, but that's about it.I think it's a shame that you have to buy Fantastic 4 twice if you want the movie in high def AND all the special features. Worse, it's not as simple as putting disc 2 from the DVD in your Blu-ray case, because disc 1 from the DVD (above) also has seamlessly integrated extended scenes--you just can't get those on Blu-ray at all.I like the movie, but I give this Blu-ray two stars because it lacks most of the features found on the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get to watch it.","review":"Would've been nice to know that iPad to TV HDMI Output is not supported BEFORE I bought the movie.

If your looking for a movie as as good as Spider-Man or even Batman Begins then you will probably not like this movie. Now if your looking for a movie with action and a sense of humor (think Blade Trinity/Ryan Reynolds) then you will probably enjoy the Fantastic Four. Chris Evans who plays Johnny Storm brings some great laughs to this movie. The movie was entertaining and did far better than what anyone expected it to do by being the #1 movie in America opening with 56 million dollars and finally ending a 19 week slump in Hollywood. Fantastic Four is not a great movie but for any marvel comic book fan this is one worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted opportunity","review":"This film is a missed chance really. It could have been a cool production like the new Spiderman movies, but it ended up being a movie that cannot decide between comic and real drama. In addition to that there are some very strange facts. A beautiful blonde being a brilliant doctor..a reckless kid being an official space pilot...Sue being Doom's girlfriend with no passion of whatsoever on the surface..Dr.Doom is not nearly as impressive as the one from the Marvel cartoons.

Constatine was pretty good, Sin City was better than I expected and Batman Begins was great. So when Fantasic Four came out I couldn't wait to see it.But at the end of the film I couldn't believe what I saw. This was not the movie I saw in the previwes. All it is about is them trying to go back being normal The Thing finally goes back to being human but just changes back and all he was doing was bitch and moan.

I am not personally well-versed in any of these areas, and so learned quite a bit. However, the information is rather dated especially in electronics and other technology.

The Kaplan book was filled with silly ideas that just didn't work.. . and it wasn't for a lack of trying. I worked with the book almost religiously for about a month, and my scores went DOWN! The techniques were silly and confusing. In fact, their ideas about how to do the math section were totally messed up.

The graphics are nice, but they get repetitive, and are also a bit too dark to make out detail. This inability to see detail will lead to problems in some of the puzzles.

But they should make the Extended Versions available at the same time as the Theatrical Version and not force (or to be precise, induce) fans of the movies to doubledip on first the theatrical versions and then the extended. If both versions are available at the same time, people can decide for themselves which version they want.Like other people, let me insert the link for the extended version here so that people can sign up for that and hopefully, by sheer strength of numbers, maybe we can get the message across:The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 1 star vote to make sure no one buys this.","review":"Money-hungry is a nice way of describing this tactic.

As a fan of the books, I pretty much hated the theatrical version of all the films compared to the extended version (which had its problems as well).On the topic, answer me this - The Hobbit, a prequel, gets two movies, but each of the books in the trilogy only gets one.

I will NOT be buying this set and will instead be finding some other means of obtaining and watching these films in HD.

Fellowship of the Ring apparently suffers from this the most. Furthermore, the extras are ported straight from the original theatrical DVDs, which means they don't amount to much.Take this information as you will.

But this time they have the extended cuts ready to go, with Bluray fitting 50GB of data they will be able to fit everything on one disk.

Put out the extended edition, then let Peter Jackson search through his archives for what ever else he could possibly not have used, and then put out a new, \\"Ultra\\" edition later?

People that don't know better will buy this theatrical edition while us true fans will have to wait, but they know we will still spend our money in a few years when they release the extended edition.So here's what I'm going to do: I'm not going to buy my own copy of the extended edition.

No. I won't even buy it if there was a threat that the extended editions were never to be released on Blu-Ray. Give us the Extended versions on Blu-Ray or nothing at all.

If you are interested in buying this set you should instead go out NOW and rent or buy the Extended DVDs for around $15-20 each today... its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste and a shame","review":"This is just a ploy to take advantage of the customer. We know Blu-ray has extended space (7x!) vs DVD and they could seemlessly branch from theatrical to extended version of the movie. I have seen the extended version in the theaters (one-time back to back) so I know it is not a case of the effects being rendered at DVD resolution. Hold out for the extended edition. I do not even own a blu-ray and will not buy one until LOTR: extended editions come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, but we can wait for the extended edition","review":"We're not getting taken again.

What a joke this is in this economy to gyp fans out of the best versions of these masterpieces and release both versions on separate Blu-rays.

The special effects, acting, cinematography, and music (score) are all very well-done. The only flaw in 'The Lord of the Rings' movie-trilogy is that each movie is quite long. But thats O.K. To be honest I don't really find that much as being of a flaw.

Those of us that are true fans of not only LOTR but Blu-Ray as the preferred choice of media will not go along quietly with this release.

As EAGER as I am to jump on this, I realize this Blu Ray release is only the theatrical release and only to gouge our eyes later on the extended release.

It is time to make a sacrifice and take a stand. As many have commented, release both editions, let the consumer (your supporters)decide whether they simply want the theatrical or if they are willing to pay a LITTLE more and buy the extended edition. I know it is difficult to make such a sacrifice in this day and age where we have been programmed to enjoy nothing but such fantasies on screen but at least in a case such as this, we should teach them a lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Versions of the Lord of the Rings Movies.","review":"This set is a collection of all of the Extended Edition Dvd's. Peter Jackson himself added the extra footage in. That means you get over 600+ minutes of just movies. This alone would justify the price of this set, but they even went further and included tons of special features. The actual movies themselves are monumental achievements in cinema history. The battles are breathtaking. The Battle of Minas Tirith was, in my opinion, the greatest scene in the history of movies. The quality of the story has not been lost from book to screeplay. The actors do an outstanding job bringing Tolkien's characters to life. Overall, very good movies, made better by the special features and extra footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurry the **** up with the extended editions !!!","review":"This is ridiculous just release it in extended...From the overwhelming majority of reviews it's what we clearly want.

This would encourage fans to spend their money yet again on a more comprehwensive package. LotR did this as well on their initial DVD releases.Now that this fantastic film is ready to hit Blu-Ray, New Line Cinema is releasing the Theatrical Version only to start things off. Well, most LotR fans know that the extended version is the far superior version and will undoubtedly be released on Blu-Ray.

Lucas is famous for this with the Star Wars francise too. I bet we'll see someting similar. These sub-standard and unessesary products need to stop.

These are no mere 'director's cuts' with 35 seconds worth of added 'footage.' These do an amazing job of fleshing out Peter Jackson's vision, which had to be trimmed significantly for the theatrical releases.Which is why it's equally amazing that someone at New Line thought that they could re-release the 'theatrical versions' again, to the very same audience they exploited the first time. Really. The customers who really want LOTR on Blu-ray are educated enough --as you can see from the 2,000+ reviews posted here already-- to know better than to fall for this criminal double-dip a second time.

So why, if you're going to release the epic trilogy on Blu-Ray, would you even bother to release the theatrical edition. Heck with the robustness on Blu-Ray you could offer a set that allows the user to choose either and just release the full thing.Again.

(Personaly, I only watch the EE's, so this makes sense to me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Portuguese subtitles!","review":"Only a fool would not wait for the extended edition.Additionally, the industry seems to forget that the new region 1 for blu-ray now includes South America, so please don't forget portuguese subtitles.

Fool us twice...","review":"So the first time around, I tolerated the dual releases and bought both the theatrical and extended versions on DVD. Now Warner Brother's expects me to double pay again? Not this time. Warner Brother is gonna be left with a lot of unsold copies while people wait for the true versions. Here's hoping they don't wait until the release of the Hobbit before they release the Blu-ray extended editions. I get the ugly feeling that is exactly what will happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended and Theatrical Together or not at all!","review":"I am sick of dealing with these huge corporate movie companies ruining the Trilogy by trying to make a little extra money! God nows that this Blu ray set is going to make bank! The only reason they won't give the fans what they want and put the Extended Version and the Theatrical Version together in one set in the first place is because NEw Line and now Warner Brothers are greedy! They treat Peter Jackson like DIRT and then go crawling back to him. Now Warner Bros. and New Line are starting to treat the fans like dirt. The Trilogy will not be ruined through this infamy! This ends now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo, New Line","review":"Agree with all who've written --- the beauty of Blu-ray is suppose to be how much content can be put on a single disc. First off, Give us BOTH versions (theatrical and extendend) + all of the bonus content from before + additional stuff we haven't seen, including stuff to get us excited about The Hobbit... put it on 3 Blu-ray discs at most. We don't need 7 discs and you know it, studios. One 50GB disc per movie is fine! It's all about the illusion of value with you guys. Just more discs to get scratched if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't have Spanish subtitles like it says it has","review":"I was very disappointed to find out that the package I bought didn't have Spanish subtitles like it says it has. I bought them for my parents so they could watch them too. It should actually say that instead of Spanish subtitles it has French subtitles like it's described at the back of the box. They should change the description of this product; they are deceiving the buyer thinking what they show is what they sell. It was a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a definitive edition","review":"I personally prefer the theatrical editions because of the extended editions lengths.

I join with all other fans of this franchise in voicing my extreme disgust that New Line would try to rip us off with the release of ONLY the theatrical versions of these films. I will NOT be purchasing this trilogy on Blu-ray until the preferred extended editions are available. Until then, I will be quite content with my complete set of Extended DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have an open mind.","review":"I won't waste my or your time by telling you the plot, because pretty much everybody knows it, and even if you didn't you probably wouldn't be looking here for an explanation. So let me just make it quick and let you know that if you have an open mind and enjoy watching movies, this will quickly become three of your favorite movies. If doesn't matter how old you are (just be old enough to watch PG-13 movies), if you're a boy or girl, if you liked the books or not, what you are like or what job you have, because ANYONE can LOVE these. You don't even have to like fantasy to be found in front of the TV panting over these DVDs with a big bowl of popcorn in your hands. I'm thirteen and I watch at least one of these movies every weekend. The extendeds are better, simply because it's more. These movies are fabulous. Just have an open mind and give it a chance and soon you will gain a deep appreciation for Tolkien/Jackson's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movies - hate buying them twice!","review":"The LotR trilogy was a big risk. So many people know and love these books - vast in scope and how could it possibly live up to our collective expectations? Somehow they met and exceeded them. True, the theatrical version were quite long - for watching in the theatre so I understand cutting some of the extended scenes even though the extended versions add so much. Watching the movie at home IS different. You can take a break if you need to. I loved the movies and so like many I bought the theatrical and extended versions of the DVDs but I will only buy the extended Blu-Ray and encourage everyone who loves these movies to do the same. Send a message to the studios that you want them to ADD value to earn your business with the highest quality of BOTH the theatrical AND extended versions as well as a digital version you can take with you. Let them know we the consumer have choices now (some, unfortunately net them no profit at all). Vote with your dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of what I already own twice on DVD.","review":"I'm so sick of getting screwed on these re-releases.

I was always a bit upset of the low picture quality on the two disk sets, and thought it was a bad transfer. BUT the real problem was 3 hours on one DVD. Now with two disks per movie on the extended set, the picture quality is MUCH better!! Of course I have a high def big screen, and upconverting Sony player with HDMI digital input.

The first movie, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was so painful to watch because it was so long. The story seemed to take forever to get going. I can't imagine it having an extra 30 minutes added. The second installment, \\"The Two Towers\\" is better. There is a more moving plot and some comedy is added. The third, \\"Return of the King\\" is definetly the best story. Was it worth best picture? I would say no. Some of the awards it did win were justified however.Off hand, the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Godfather, Back to the Future and Beverly Hills Cop trilogy, just to name a few, are much better than the Lord of the Rings. Even the Harry Potter series, which has 3 movies out at the present time, is far more entertaining. If the movies would have been trimmed, it may be a better set. I would recommend this movie to someone who really, really loves mid-evil things, and has A LOT of time on their hands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen only??","review":"I think for this price, amazon could at least offer this in full screen.

Couldn't find one character I could like.I also don't get Kurosawa Akira's movies.

That's six different purchases for three films. I saw each movie three times in theaters. New Line has gotten a LOT of my money.I refuse to spend any of my money on this sad attempt on cashing in on loyal fans.

Only DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD offer lossless audio for movie soundtracks (of course you have to have the equipment to make use of these high-res audio formats - and that probably means at a minimum a receiver with HDMI audio/video inputs).

These studio attempts to bilk the public have turned me off to buying DVDs and Blu Rays. I only rent now, and have no problem with people who turn the tables and download pirated movies. You reap what you sow.The shame is that it has been over 6 years since The Return of the King was released.

Vote with your wallet or pocketbook and don't support this kind of nonsense.Update on 12/14/09: Newline just announced a date in April 2010 for the release of the THEATRICAL editions on Blu-Ray. They have not heard the requests of fans and seem unlikely to generate much interest - or money - from these releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended Editions + Theatrical Editions >>> Theatrical Edition","review":"Wow...the movies have been out for what, over 6 years now? Come on, it's just plain greedy to release the theatrical editions on blu-ray when everyone knows there are extended editions. Please give us theatrical editions + extended editions + more extras when you finally release LOTR on blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I am a huge fan of the movies, but totally agree with the idea that we are being ripped off.

A lot of true LOTR fans were duped the first time when it came out on DVD this way...we deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you take us all for fools??","review":"It's at least insulting to release the theatrcal version and anounce the release of the extended for sometime in the following years...Any decent studio would have the courtesy not to rip of its public like that.You can very easily release them both together, or make an edition in which the viewer can select which version he/she wants each time he views it!After this kind of treatment do you think its a wonder that many people resort to illegaly obtaining a large part of their music or movies collection???Respect your clients and they will respect you back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"Excellent Movie. However, this is another shameful marketing attempt to fool fans of this great series into filling the studio's already enormous sack of money for a third time. We all want The Lord Of The Rings on Blu-Ray but it's an outrage that they're only going to release the theatrical versions of the movie and probably wait for it to sell an incredible amount of copies before releasing the extended versions. Do not fall for this marketing scheme and wait for them to come to their senses and decide to actually please the consumer this time by releasing the extended and theatrical versions on Blu-ray at the same time or in the same package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripe Off","review":"There is no reason not to include the extended versions.

There are no technical difficulties here; the cuts of the source material have already been made and just like the DVD versions, the extended versions could have been included as a viewing option using the same disc.This theatrical release is only meant to entice customers into another purchase before New Line Cinema chooses to release the Blu-Ray Extended Edition Trilogy. This type of salesmanship is a REALLY low move by New Line Cinema.I intend to vote with my lack of purchase until they release the Blu-Ray Extended Edition Trilogy. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST SAY \\"NO\\" !!!","review":"DON'T BUY THIS INITIAL \\"THEATRICAL\\" BLU-RAY EDITION! There is simply NO excuse, given the current technology, for a \\"theatrical only\\" release for such a monumental motion picture trilogy.

I agree with most of the reviewers here on Amazon that it is disgraceful for this studio to try to make more millions off the same scheme instead of giving us both the theatrical version and the extended cuts and letting the buyers decide which to buy. I was even more upset when I saw that THE STUDIO DOES NOT PLAN TO RELEASE THE EXTENDED CUTS ON BLU-RAY UNTIL LATE 2011 OR EVEN 2012!!!! Its time studios stopped being greedy and did something good for the consumers!NOTE: As others have said, I am NOT giving a bad review of the LOTR trilogy. It is one of the finest produced set of films I have ever seen. I even decided to rent the theatrical versions on Blu-ray and they do look FANTASTIC (something I suggest you do if you cannot wait to see them in Blu).

According to an interview by Peter Jackson I saw a few month ago about the Hobbit, he said that the extended edition was a definate for blu-ray and it would probably be released before Christmas of 2010. So i'm pretty frustrated as to why they don't just release them both at the same time and charge more for the extended edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me once... cant get fooled again","review":"This type of greed is disgusting.

I will wait.No stars to whom ever made this decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say no to greed","review":"I don't have anything to add to the hundreds that have preced me, but hopefully New Line might see the financial light (though I doubt it). I won't buy these because I prefer the extended editions, which will inevitably be released on Blu-ray, and see no reason to buy these twice once again (as I did on DVD).

Yes I paid twice.

I am one of these people and do not want this to happen again.

Although with this movie the loss of that extra hour makes us miss some truly heart felt scenes.Such as the scene in The two towers when Aragorn reveals how old he is while pretending to like that broth.Its like buying a box of choccies and finding you've only got 6 of 12 types in the box. How can you bring yourself to watch a movie that offers you half of what you got before ?Ok in the cinema it was ok because after 4 hours of sitting in a small seat you would be dying for the toilet ! That is unless the UK bring back the interval and stop making cattlesheds to watch movies in.Never been to the cinema for years because half the time the screen looks aweful (yes one time it even had a hole in the screen !!)Anyway to sum up WAIT for the extended versions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bend over, here we go again!","review":"I am just as big of a fan as anyone of this series. I too fell victim to the new releases on DVD. I felt like it had been planned and that we had been betrayed. I was sad to learn that this looks like a repeat of what happened before. I am writing this review, (my first review of any kind) in hopes that the studio's will learn that we won't take this lying down. It is hard enough to replace 3 DVD's with 3 Blu-ray discs as it is, let alone, replacing them twice or even three times. America is hurting right now. Give us a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's a ripoff","review":"I totally agree with the first anti-review. Another example of studio ripoffs.

And now that they're finally getting around to put it out on blu-ray, they're pulling the same thing over again.

Pay your money and sit down secure in the knowledge you have pressed the feeder button firmly. Enjoy your pellet.

The release of this trilogy in only theatrical edition is tantamount to studios making a movie with no intention of releasing it to theaters. This is because they realize that there is money to be made just by simply releasing this product to video stores, redbox, retails chains (even if they sit on the shelf). So, what will happen here is, distribution channels will be flooded with this product. It will be the next bargain bin blowout. This series deserves so much more than that. Have a little respect Hollywood, and don't pimp out your warez. Don't prey on the masses that don't look closely at what they are buying, assuming they are getting one thing, and in actuality getting much, much less. Studio conglomerates - earn an honest living like all of the rest of us do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto with everyone","review":"Even though this has not been released, it is easy to write a review for this. Don't put some crap like this out when you could just as easily put out the Extended edition. I for one am not going to buy this. Studios need to stop thinking that we are all idiots. We know a better edition will be released. And we do have the patience to wait. DO NOT buy this release. Let the studio know that if they are going to do multiple releases they should be simultaneous, so that the LARGE number of us who want the more fully featured versions don't have wait. BUT we will wait, and that means more time before the studio gets my money.And if this really happens to be an issue of time to prepare the Extended Edition for HD, then you should just have waited on the announcement in the first place. We waited this long for the Blu-ray, an extra 6 months to a year, isn't going to make a big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANKS LET ME KEEP PAYING FOR THIS OVER AND OVER","review":"Lord of the Rings is a great series of movies, that being said New Line Cinema is one of the worst companies that ever existed in the history of humanity.

Maybe some day they will start listening to the people who support their products. Double dipping worked with DVD because it was a brand-new, evolving format so at that time, you could get away with selling us \\"special edition\\" \\"super-special edition\\" \\"directors cut\\" \\"the definitive special edition\\" and so on.

It is generally accepted among LOTR fans that the Extended versions are Peter Jackson's COMPLETE vision for this beloved trilogy and are superior to the theatrical versions. By not offering the longer versions on Blu-ray format (that can finally handle the capacity with ease) is just wrong. I would be willing pay more for the extended if it were being offered, but I refuse to purchase the same thing twice. BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE - Let's all wait for Warner Bros/New Line to DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE CONSUMER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Greed","review":"Why would they even do this to us? Pure greed. In today's dvd/blu-ray loving society, with ALL of the extras that now come on dvds, there is simply no excuse for not releasing the extended versions at the same time. More to the point, the studios could have EASILY put both versions on the same set if they were worried that such a large sect of the fanbase, for some unknown reason, would NOT WANT the extended versions. I have many movies on dvd that offer a \\"theatrical version\\" and an \\"uncut\\" version, and with the legions of fans that support this franchise, it's truly a slap in the face to make us wait. I have not bought this product and will not buy any Lord of the Rings on blu ray until they release the extended versions. Which sucks, because I love these movies and really would like to own a hi-def copy, but I guess in the meantime I'll just watch them on TNT when they do LOTR weekends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not extended version","review":"We won't be fooled again.

You knew right from the bat that they were putting out extended ones but that they weren't ready yet.There is literally no reason for them to hold off the EE on Blu-ray like this.

I suggest all other LOTR fans follow suit and boycott this cheesy attempt to exploit the fan. I can wait until it is released the proper way before I buy it on Blu Ray.

Rental may also be an option, but probably not for me personally.That being said, the Ring is a magnificent set of movies, a wonderful tribute to Tolkien's masterpiece and to Peter Jackson's artistry.

I rarely even watch the theatrical; I own the DVDs but for me it was more entertaining analyzing all the differences. But that was years ago. When I'm in the mood to watch them, do I watch the 'abbreviated' version? No! I watch the full-length extended version, as it (truly) was intended.

Normally, the Blu-Ray's offer Dolby Digital 5.1 as a fallback to folks who don't have 6.1 or 7.1, but this release only offers Dolby Pro-Logic in English. The last two movies do offer 5.1 in Spanish with English subtitles but I pass on that.

When I purchase LoTR on blu-ray, I want to do it ONCE and I want it ALL... so I will wait and I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED VERSION","review":"I agree with everyone else.Why buy this one when you know the extended version will be out within 6-12months.Just rent this blu ray if you are dying to see it in HI DEF as I am.Rent..don't buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Will Only Buy the Extended Trilogy!","review":"They want us to buy the Theatrical Editions now, and then buy the Extended Editions later?

This is what bluray discs were made for. Will not buy theses. Release the Extended Cuts together. That is what all of the fans want. In fact Demand. I hope George Lucas is paying attention as well. Release both original and SE versions of Star Wars Saga on the same Blu ray discs as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Extended Edtion??","review":"I hate to give anything related to LOTR 1 star! But, this is ridiculous! By now, most fans who would shell-out money for the Blue-Ray version of these films has seen the extended edition and would agree that they're much better than the theatrical versions, so it's obvious that this is nothing more than a way to milk more money out of the LOTR market and fanbase.I will wait for the extended versions, because I have both versions already, and won't be utterly dying to pay $70 for something I already have, unless it's BOTH versions (or the Extended only) and it better meet the expectations of brilliance that has been Peter Jackson's LOTR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those ninnyhammers!","review":"I agree with the others. There is no reason to use the technology of blu ray (i.e. lots of space!) Every movie that comes out now advertises \\"two movies in one!\\" when they mean rated and unrated, theatrical cut directors cut etc etc. If you have seen the extended editions which many of us have; the theatrical versions of the movie just seem like a cable TV cut of the movie. Still amazing, but not AMAZING. I hope that the more negative reviews this product gets because of the non-extended nonsense the more new line will re think their release plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the....","review":"90% of the people looking to buy this wouldn't waste their time or money on non-extended editions of LoTR, and the truth of that statement can be see by this product's rating. What's worse is that the movie studio will probably wait another year after this is out to try to dupe the consumer into buying both sets, just like they did with the DVD releases, spacing the extended edition release dates out 6 months after theatrical."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too will wait.....","review":"I will wait for the extended edition.

They could not be more wrong. The movie are excellent in their theatrical form-the only people who give it one star just want the extended cuts RIGHT NOW. Frankly, their reaction makes me happy that the extended cut is delayed. Also, please bear in mind that none of these people who have been panning the movie have seen the actual high definition transfer. Their reviews are not a judgement on quality, just their own dissatisfaction and impatience. If you like the theatrical cuts, please don't let the product score dissuade you from this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disapprove","review":"Dear New Line,You treat fans of LOTR like dirt.

Anyone fan enough to buy these movies, moreso to upgrade from DVD to Blu, is not going to be one of those who complains about their length, much less one who is happy to see less of the story.Studios continue to see profit in the multi-dip strategy because there are too many people with no restraint and money to burn.DON'T BE ONE OF THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah Ah ah, u _almost_ fooled me twice","review":"Please, I fell for the same nonsense with the DVD releases. Dont buy this version of the trilogy. They say that the extended versions wont be out until 2011 or 2012 on bluray, but seriously, 700+ people giving this edition a 1 star review before it has even been released?

By the way the only reason this got one star was because I could not give less and it has nothing to do with the movies they are great!

This kind of obvious marketing ploy ticks me off - I refuse to pad their profits by being an early grabber of a \\"theatrical edition\\" that no one really wants. The worst part is that they'll probably do something even more stupid by making tons of this version, thereby wasting their capital on them which will only sit on the shelves - and in their brilliance they will mistake the lack of sales for dis-interest in the series and so they won't make the \\"extended versions\\" in BD... I trust that my cynicism is over-the-top and still hold out hope for the BD we're all hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not extended? What is the point?","review":"If they released Theatrical and Extended at the same time, fine I could get that. But this is just a trick. They want people to buy Theatrical first, then buy again on Extended. Some people might want both. Most will want only one or the other. They know this, so they hope to get more $$ from people who really only want the Extended versions but want blue ray as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW LINE, stop being greedy douche-bags..","review":"I'm with 'the dude' on this one.

There's absolutely NO REASON not to release both versions at once other than to screw over people who don't know any better (or don't feel like waiting)making people buy both.

I just couldn't believe it! I'm a huge fan of the novels and movies so I like to have extras, especially when the scenes were relevant, amazing, and only cut for times sake. Most fans seem to agree with me on this and very few actually prefer the shorter edition.

And yes Newline is being greedy. But part of the reason this is happening is Peter Jackson. And for actually good reasons. PJ gives a lot of extras with his releases and goes all out for quality. So the extended editions are going to take some time. In the meantime, if someone wanted, they could buy or rent these. At least KNOWING there will be extended editions one can make an informed decision.I suspect they will end up saying something like get a $20 credit towards the extended edition when buying this.

The theatrical version of Fellowship, for example, is 178 minutes, while the extended version runs 208 minutes. Clearly, a dual layer Blu-ray disc has more than enough capacity to hold both versions of the film.Although I normally take the attitude that if you don't want something you don't have to buy it, this release is a blatant attempt to exploit the trilogy's fanbase with the assumption that we're such fanatics that we'll buy ANYTHING related to LOTR.

Many of them have 4 different cuts of the movie, all seamlessly accessible from the menu and all on a single disc, with no duplication of content! New Line, you can ship one set, the EXTENDED set we all want, and give us the option to view the movie with or without the extended sequences... all from the same discs.This packaging attempt is blatant double-dipping and we will not have it!-jer"},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously?","review":"they haven't made ENOUGH money already off of these (admittedly) masterpiece movies? not that I support piracy, but i know plenty of people that see this kind of greed and use it to justify downloading the movies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinded by their greed...","review":"...the studio execs decided to try to make fools of us once again.

I confess I'm not a die hard LOTR buff because I don't think the extra deleted footage added really that much to them which is why I went for this theatrical edition. Besides, the last one is long enough clocking at well over 3 hrs so why do I have to sit longer and endure almost 4 hrs worth of extra footage. My only complaint is that we don't need a digital copy or the Standard DVD versions of these films--the Blu-ray would've sufficed enough but I can't complaint because I only paid $36 after a trade of some CDs plus though the first one is rather soft (due to DNR), the other two look fantastic.

Maybe if enough people sign up to be notified for it, the studios will be more likely to release it sooner, rather than waiting 3 more years. Hopefully they'll see the reviews here and see that people overwhelmingly prefer the Extended Editions and are willing to wait to buy them, instead of buying this version. It would be easy enough for them to have an option on the EE disks to just play the theatrical versions for people who prefer that (both of them) and let the rest of us watch the EE version with just one set of disks.[reposted from another review]http://www.amazon.com/Rings-Trilogy-Extended-Editions-Blu-ray/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it!","review":"Please rate this as one star since they are trying to steal your $$$.

I can understand a separate release in the initial progression of marketing the movie, with the 'director's cut' or 'extended version' being developed at a later time.

But don't make those of us who want the full experience wait 10 more years just to bleed us for more dough...from what I've read, you've made quite enough money off of this franchise already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Crucial Information","review":"Want to know \\"All about Hobbits?\\". Want to see detailed scenes during battles, dialogue amongst the allies, and other information important to this story? Then do NOT buy this theatrical release - get the extended version. The extended cut is not just for LOTR junkies, but for everyone as the story is enhanced greatly by the additional scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit ripping us off","review":"You know, this just smacks of pure greed. The Blu Ray format, while great, isn't enough for me to keep buying the same content over and over. There needs to be some value add. I will wait for the extended cut, and then, I may just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo, New Line Cinema.","review":"So ridiculous. If the extended edition doesn't have some fantastic NEW features, or the aforementioned option of watching the theatrical or extended release, I may not bother to even buy the extended editions on Bluray, either. My bluray player upconverts rather nicely, and I'm not sure the difference is worth lining the pockets of these greedy b@stards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree","review":"I own the extended version on dvd. It's a big box set and that is plenty for me. I'm sure not buying it again. I just bought a Blu-Ray player but only for the Netflix capability. Blu-ray is nice, but not worth an extra $10-15 to see the pores on someones face. I am going to keep buying DVDs. Besides I watched LOTR after seeing Avatar recently and LOTR is laughably lame in comparison (effectswise). Avatar has raised the bar now and even Helms Deep (which blew me away years ago when I saw it) now looks like a lame video game. I agree that the LOTR guys are being greedy. Maybe they have the ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"I love LOTR as much as anyone... and bought the extended DVD edition. I'd buy the extended blu ray edition in a heartbeat. But why not release them both at the same time. As other reviewers said, it's a blatant ripoff and double dip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old pattern to steal my$$$","review":"I would hazard a guess that the extended version will come out as sales of this have peaked and then slumped like on DVD to maximize profit - hahaha - just like last time I did not purchase - I waited them out with my hard earned money. The studio needs to learn that jerking around their profits is playing with fire!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!","review":"Someone gave me these as a gift ages ago and I foolishly gave away my extended DVD's thinking that SURELY the blu ray edition could be nothing less than the full extended version with all those remarkable extended features (which I love every bit as much as the films themselves). I was shocked to discover when hosting a LOTR marathon last night that these are merely the theatrical versions of the films. What? Why?I just re-purchased the Platinum Edition DVD's...because anything less seems wicked and tricksy, my precious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one thing that isn't Precious","review":"I'm getting tired of getting ripped off.

It saddens me =("},{"rating":"1","title":"S.O.S.","review":"S.O.S. over again. Rip off the public, bilk them out of their last, red cent.

If the Theatrical Edition is boycotted, perhaps he'll pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incomplete product","review":"I own Close Encounters of the Third Kind on Blu-ray, and that product contains all three versions of that film. So, it is with great disappointment that I find that seven years after the theatrical release of the Return of the King, that the Blu-ray version of these films is being limited to the theatrical version only.The Lord of the Rings was created with DVDs in mind. I own two versions of each film, and there are a lot of extras between both versions. In those extras, Peter Jackson tells his crew that he'll put cut scenes back in the DVD when he felt that he had to cut them from the theatrical version. The extended editions are a part of the artistic intent of Jackson's creative effort, and it's a shame that both versions are not being released together.I will wait until both are available together before I'll buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy the TE, more corp screwing...","review":"We know what the studios are doing. They are releasing the TE knowing good and well that they have pushed the release date for the EE out far enough to make fans feel like if they want to see the movie on blu that they will have to get the TE and then will want the EE when they come out two years later. Not getting my money like that.All this is going to do is prompt people to rent and burn the TE or download them from the torrent sites. But that seems fair right? You steal from us, seems only right to return the favor.Do the right thing here, either offer both versions on a single set of disks or release both versions at the same time and let the consumer decide which one to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for theatrical","review":"I paid the big bucks for the extended versions of the regular dvd, and I would only buy the Blu-Ray if it included extended versions of the movie.

Show these big corporations that they can't suck money out of fans this way!

The only thing they'll have to do is to encode it a new - okay they probably want to do some adjustments to polish some material so that it looks good in high def but that's not so big a deal - it's all about fooling us - selling the same thing more or less twice - I'll wait for the extended version, \`nuff said !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray containing Theatical Version Only","review":"I can not say that I am suprised at the double dipping into people's bank accounts with a Theatrical versions on Blu-Ray before the Extended versions. I will not buy the Theatical versions even if the Extended versions are never released on Blu-Ray. There is no reason that both versions should not be contained on one Blu-Ray disc per movie.

These movies themselves, 5 stars, but this is not a movie review. I am an avid blu-ray collector as well as a Lord of the Rings fan. This is a studio attempt to cash in twice on one product, AGAIN. If this item sells, the studio will milk it until it's dry and the release of the extended editions will be even further off and more expensive. If we all decide to band together a fellowship and not buy this product, the studio will be forced to release the extended. They need to hear us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Resist any urges, and spread the word...","review":"We do not want to go through this again. Do not buy this version just to see it banished to the back of the case when the extended cut is released. Tell everyone. Stand by the dispaly at your local stores and steer shoppers away from this orcish crap. Let's make New Line squirm a bit as this version sits on shelves and gets ugly price cuts.This is the key element:By purchasing this version YOU feed the cycle.

It's not good enough that we've replaced our standard dvd's with blu-ray. Now we're going to have to replace our blu-ray dvd's with extended, \\"special edition\\" blu-rays. WTF!Don't do it!

Companies have been doing this for YEARS...and, you know why?? Because as fans of movies, we'll buy it just for the movie first time, but the SECOND time, they will add, more scenes, a commentary, a great big making of doco. etc. And THEY PLANNED THAT ALL ALONG! Why? becuase that way, they get you to buy a movie TWICE! And of course that doubles profits...and that's what it's all about, PROFITS. So, if they DON\\"T make a profit off of the bare-bones release....they'll stop doing them. And the only way they won't make a profit...is if we don't buy it.

BTW, i love lord of the rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Blu-Ray win the format wars cause it could hold more?","review":"I thought the whole big thing about Blu-Ray was that it could hold more data? Sure the extended edition is larger, but a double layer Blu-ray can hold 7x what a dual layer dvd can. There is no reason they couldn't have done this, they could easily have put both theatrical and extended on the same disk IN 1080 if they really wanted to. I would have rather paid double from the get go for the extendeds, but I refuse to get double duped (again). I am content on watching an upconverted extended dvd while I wait.Also, I hope the people behind the inevitable Star Wars Blu-Rays reads these reviews and does not piss on their fan base as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why there is Piracy...","review":"But which came first...Piracy or studios trying to squeeze every drop possible out of the consumer...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Theatrical Versions only?!","review":"Do they really expect us to buy these theatrical versions, when the extended versions will be out in the near future?!

I guess that is partly the reason why they are trying to manipulate it so much. Releasing the movies in their theatrical versions is one of the cheapest tricks they could have pulled.
