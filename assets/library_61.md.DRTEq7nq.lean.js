I was able to print and scan using Windows' utilities, but Lexmark's own sofware wouldn't detect the machine. When scanning, it made an unusual rattling noise and the scans came out with horizontal lines. When using Pictbridge to print photos directly from the camera, it doesn't automatically print at the highest quality setting. You have to go into the printer's default settings in Windows, set the quality to the highest setting first. After you're done, you have to go back into the settings and change it back to your preference.

He seems to forget that dance origins of each of these Chopin pieces and plays long elegant legato lines with insistent, plodding key strokes. He denatures phrases that should gracefully flow. In areas where he should apply a tasteful rubato, Alexeev hews to a methodical clockwork pace that's maddening for such Romantic material.

HP has a guarantee to replace any cartridge due to manufacturing defects, which this case obviously was because the other brand new cartridge in the pack worked perfectly. Upon calling HP customer support, they make you jump through any bell and whistle they feel like to make sure this process is as difficult and painful for you as possible.

Granted, there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments, but it's often dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"A first effort","review":"Sebastiane was a useful film to view only in as much as it traces where Derek Jarman started as a film maker, marking his film making adolescence. Like many a first film or book it is painfully self-conscious in design (Latin dialogue for no apparent reason, grainy colour distorted visuals, hand-held camera work, little attention to continuity), it is contrived and obsessive; the title itself gives this away. Jarman's later works Carravaggio, Wittgenstein, Edward II are polished diamonds, Sebastiane the raw product. It struck me as the film he had to make in order to get it out of his system and move onto more thoughtful things, rather like most adolescent poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expression is only the vehicle for content ...","review":"I felt deeply disappointed by the film, which is empty, irrelevant and self-indulgent.A lot of scenes in the movie were well arranged, sometimes sensual, defiant or narcissistic. However those images are static, hardly fluid and unsuitable for the media of motion picture. The sentiment, so, maybe too, beautifully portrayed in one split second, died quickly into the next, because of director's incapability to let those images or characters evolve and grow. Above all there is no coherent message or even an idea in the movie, except the director's own erratic obsession of beauty, moments or desire. His self-centeredness is hardly engaging to me.I can accept paintings to stress forms while defying meaning. But motion picture has one more dimension than paintings. Such waste of its expressiveness is a crime. After all, ideas are the most powerful and exciting, but not an idea of emptiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed, don't judge a book by its cover","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. The cover is misleading. it really is just conversations with *VERY* limited stars, and their accounts of things. I thought the book would talk more in depth about an erray of adult film stars and the stuggles they have delt with. Instead, it was more about bashing people like Savannah, and Jill Kelly's dead husband. I found a few things interesting about Traci Lords, and my own belief that she probably did all the feds on herself. Really not worth your money. I actually returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a book.","review":"Its a book. Some of the stories are interesting but its not really a story. It may be chronologically arranged but its not complete interviews, its not an actual interview. The author takes snipets of this and that and arranges them to make a book without actually conducting the interview. Does that make sense?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird perspective","review":"This is an oral history of the Porn industry taken from a huge number of sources. In a lot of ways it exposes our hypocrisy about pornography, the \\"yeah I did but I didn't inhale\\" sort of thing. Interesting stuff, it traces how the early \\"Hippie\\" free love culture evolved into a drug crazed, biker gang and organized crime thing. It touches on some of the high profile disasters, Shauna Grant, Savannah, Traci Lords and John Holmes but virtually ignores how the porno industry evolved into big business with large corporations dominating the industry. There's very little discussion of the shift from New York to California production. There's virtually no mention of the impact of the Internet. Well written and well worth reading though. A sequel picking up in 1985 would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"i ::heart:: 19050s theatre!","review":"this is a beautiful little sliver of 1950s psycho-drama. to the modern reader, it may come across a bit campy, but the delightful details regarding the amaerican dream, freudian psychology, and the time period are priceless. not to mention, the writing is good. a wonderful play- even better than the film version, which i believe to be a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"sugar, spice and everything nice??","review":"'The Bad Seed' is certainly a great horror story, made even more remarkable since it was written in the early 1950s when the world was thought to be a kinder, gentler place. In it we have a young mother at the end of her tether in dealing with her adolescent daughter. Her daughter is not all peaches and cream. She is a cold, emotionless psychopath. She doesn't recognize good from bad. All she knows is that when she wants something ... SHE GETS IT. Poor mother eventually comes to grips as to why her daughter is the way she is, and arrives at a decision on what to do about it.Bottom line: although it created a sensation when first published, 'The Bad Seed' has stood the test of time and is worthy of new readership. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in the World!","review":"I'm 13 years old, and The Bad Seed is my favorite movie.

IF you haven't read Angela Carter or seen this film I would. Mr Fenton is a beautiful composer and it is no surprise that this and his other work (Ever After) are two of my favorites.

Well turns out, they weren't even worth that much.I ordered two pairs and out of the four markers, one was completely dead, one would just very faintly stay on and not blink, and the other two (which I assume were working correctly) would blink so slowly than if you were to rely on them to see where your driveway ends, you would have to stop and wait for them to light back on. And should I even mention that you have to take them off the PVC pipe that acts as a pole to turn them on, the switch being in the hollow base ?I don't know if Amazon sold them at such a low price at that time because they were getting rid of a batch of sub-par units, but I wouldn't even begin to think of chancing it for the price they are selling for now.

The power of story a way of life is revealed throughout the book and Lane is a careful and insightful reader of the biblical stories. As one raised in the Catholic Church I find the book quite challenging because of its insistence on actually reading the stories instead of having an authority figure tell me what they mean!The book could be improved by a more careful editing job as there seem to be printing errors in some places."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great box set of music","review":"I just bought tracks last week, and it was worth the money. I particularly liked brothers under the bridges, man at the top, rockaway the days, wages of sign, and living on the edge of the world. I didn't like the 4th cd that much. I am excited about this tour, and for tracks highlights, which comes out on april 13th, however \\"the promise\\" will be an acoustic version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to Compare","review":"I have the Dylan bootleg series one, Lennons new 4cd box, Robert Johnsons box, and a few others. NOTHING comes even close to preparing you for the majesty of Springsteen's TRACKS. It has everything a true fan could want (save for a few individual favourites which for one or another reason didn't make the box) including a dramatic statement on Bruce's ever increasing songwriting abilities. ANYONE who can't find true happiness in some of the songs on Disc 4 (Happy, Loose Change, Over ther Rise, Gave it a Name, Brothers Under the Bridge, Back in Your arms to name just a few) simply doesn't appreciate fine music.Bruce's songs HAVE become shorter and simpler in many ways, more spare, but they still pack an emotional punch like no other artist/s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Collection is almost perfect. Hardcore fans will wonder why \\"The Promise\\" -- a song replaced by the title track of Darkness on the Edge of town is not on it. And why so many songs based on a version of \\"57 Channels\\"? Where are the live versions of Prove it All Night and Incident on 57th Street, showing the Boss at his best?Otherwise an excellent album, and baptism of Bruce into the Rock n' Roll hall of fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best conceived box set ever","review":"It is scary to think that one artist's rejected or unused material can be this superior to almost anything else in pop/rock music today. Don't give up on disc 4 - the subtle power of these songs sink in after a few listenings. Thanks Bruce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the Boss is the Boss","review":"Excellent - what Springsteen fans have been waiting for for years, and what every non-Springsteen fan should hear. Only Bruce could release a box set of non-releases and B-sides that still easily top 90% of the \\"official\\" releases by most other artists. The only flaw - some of the later songs (90's) pale in comparison to the 70's and early 80's songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rendezvous on the Edge of the World","review":"I'm listening to Be True now and this is like manna from heaven, waiting so long since Joad! I have to wonder why he just didn't release albums more frequently in the 70s and '80s. And now he says there are four more albums of new material in the can, but when will they be out?!?!?! Anyway this one is great and definitely a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduring/Memorable","review":"I revisited these recordings after Springsteen opened with \\"Back In Your Arms\\" (from disc 4) on Saturday in St. Louis. There's so much to choose from here--many of the more subtle pieces didn't have a chance to grow on me--until now. Some of the 90's era work already sounds dated, but otherwise, it's a strong overview from start to finish. The music is satisfying, with portions of songs in different incarnations allowing us to glimpse Springsteen's approach to his craft. Seeing him redefine himself as a solo artist live over the weekend, and listening to this broad cross section of his catalogue highlights how he weds work and creativity like no other--he simply has no peer. With thirty plus years of the road and recording behind him, I expect we may see a second round of Tracks 30 years from now. I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing... lots of songs too weak to make the cut.","review":"Repetitive and ultimately uninteresting... and I'm a big Springsteen fan. Most of the best stuff has been released before. Maybe there was a time when this would have thrilled me, but now I'm just over-saturated with this stuff. I had to get it to complete my collection, but I actually regret it. Save your cash... let's not reward Bruce for this kind of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB - A \\"YOUNGSTER'S\\" VIEW","review":"As somebody who is as old as Bruce's recording career, I am just disappointed that I could not see Bruce perform when he was my age. The effort in each of his songs on the first two discs is something which is quite outstanding, and something which you just don't find with modern day singer/songwriters. And for all those who don't think the last cd is any good, you think of a song that is written and sung with as much emotion as back in your arms and brothers under the bridge. Thanks Bruce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of Bruce!","review":"I am a Springsteen fan from way back in the seventies. Although I am not a big fan of his more recent works, way too moody for me! Love this collection, and have listened to it every day since I got it for Christmas. A must have for all us Springsteen fans that grew up on the East Coast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce hits like a thundercrack","review":"I have been a long-time fan of Bruce Springsteen. Bootleggers may know me as the guy that shouted \\"Bradley Beach!!\\" from the Bottom Line. Anyway, even though there is a tremendous amount of great Bruce music omitted, what is included in this collection is going to blow you away. Remember that Bruce was writing these songs shortly after the Beatles sued each other, right through the disco age, and well into the hairspray sounds of Duran Duran and Kajagoogoo (or something like that). The Punks had come and gone. Heavy metal and rap found niches.But nothing shook Bruce from the pure foundation of full steam ahead american rock & roll painted with the sweat of desire. His ability to tell a story about characters we would never otherwise want to know, but now totally relate to is genius.I cannot stop listening to this unbelievable collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Real Power of Rock and Roll\\"","review":"Kid Leo, former disc jockey with WMMS in Cleveland once said of of Bruce and the E Street Band,\\"round for round, pound for pound there ain't no finer band around...\\". Even though \\"Tracks\\" is Bruce's music it's good to hear some of Bruce's best material played with the E Street band. That having been said, I can't even imagine what goes on inside Bruce's head. The material layed out on \\"Tracks\\" is powerful, beautiful and straight from the soul of one of the best singer/songwriter's of the last 50 years. I hope that the rumors down in Fair Haven, NJ prove to be true and we will see the tour all of us have been waiting for since 1988. I'm 39 and need to get in shape if I'm going to sing and dance for 4 hours at the Gund Arena.... Bruce's fans know what the critics don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Bruce is worth the money","review":"Tracks proves one thing: Bruce Springsteen can write a bad song or two. But for fans of the Boss finding a rare Bruce blunder can be just as interesting and revealing as finding a rare Bruce gem. And Tracks is loaded with gems. Most of the 65 songs are as strong or stronger than the songs on the albums they were cut from. Tracks is a must for true Bruce fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but...","review":"At last Bruce Springsteen comes around to release a bunch of his famous outtakes. At first rumoured to be a 6-disc set, but finally cut down to 4. A lot of his arguably best songs are on this set, and there are also many songs not previously circulated on bootlegs. But some of his most famous outtakes aren't here, like The Promise and The Fever to name a couple (these were finally released on 18 Tracks). The feeling that comes to mind is \\"we want more\\". He has so many songs in the vault, and another disc or two wouldn't done any harm. The songs that made it, though, makes sure that this is a thrilling experience for any fan - and a must-have if you like Springsteen at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Cadillac","review":"I really just wanted a cd with Pink Cadillac on it but could only find it on this set. As it turns out this set has many good songs on it....well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major Genius; Minor Quibble","review":"Imagine waking to discover that despite 25 years of dedicated Bruce fan-dom, you had somehow missed an actual full-scale studio-release album. Now imagine it's more or like 6 or 7 albums. That's what you get with \\"Tracks.\\" One minor quibble: despite a beautifully packaged set, complete with lyrics (thanks, Boss) I would have liked track-by-track comments from Bruce about why a particular song didn't make it, or why it still remains one of his favorites. For instance, how did a couplet from \\"Santa Ana\\" end up in \\"She's the One\\"? And how did the sublime \\"Hearts of Stone\\" end up in the not-so-sublime hands of Southside Johnny? So one star off for that, but otherwise, a dream come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orgasmic","review":"As an avid, longtime (since '74) Springsteen fan, I know I'm biased, but I can't remember when I've enjoyed a collection of new music by anyone as much as I'm enjoying this one. It's reassuring to know that Springsteen's vaults are full of material that is as good as some of the best material he has produced over the years. As others have said, this collection very quickly reminds you why we fell in love with Bruce in the first place. The scope of the work and being able to hear Springsteen's evolution over the years is as impressive as the material itself. There's probably more great material here than in all of his post E Street Band output combined. And it arrives just after we had given up all hope of ever hearing another one of those great rambling Springsteen epics like some of his early material. Bruce's Back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole box set is fantastic but...","review":"You could just buy it for Loose Ends: it brought tears to my eyes the first twenty times I listened to it. Thundercrack, Restless Nights, an unsettling version of Born in the USA, Cynthia, and Janey Don't Lose Your Heart are only a few other highlights. You have never heard Bruce sound so innocent as in the better version of Mary Queen of Arkansas than in \\"Greetings From Asbury Park\\" included on this album. Even for a regular Bruce fan this box set is a must have. There is so much more to \\"Tracks\\" than the highlights included in \\"18 Tracks\\". Advice to those who are considering buying \\"18 Tracks\\" in addition to this box set for the two extra songs: don't bother. Just get Napster and download both songs. Don't fall for the money making trap."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Springteen album you'll ever need","review":"I wish I could imagine what it would be like never to have heard any Springteen. But if you were in that tragic state I'm certain 'Tracks' would be the perfect introduction. It's just the most stunning collection of an artist's work and, unlike The Beatles' 'Anthology', Dylan 'Bootlegs' or any other 'from the vaults' collection, it repays endless repeat plays. Ignore all the bruceophiles showing off about having heard it all before on bootleg - this is prime quality stuff and even if your Springsteen experience is limited to Dancing In The Dark or Born To Run, buy this and play it again and again. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Springsteen Cash's In","review":"Too Late in the career of Bruce Springsteen. A sad comentary to a media hyped circus arena, Tracks should have stayed in the vaults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a major disappointment","review":"Many of these songs were unreleased or didn't make it onto a Springsteen album for good reason: they're simply not up to scratch. A few are experiments gone awry, some are glossy pop tunes with bubble gummy melodies, others sound like a mediocre Springsteen tribute band trying their hand at songwriting. There are gems buried in this rubble -- \\"Rockaway the Days\\" for instance -- but they are rare. Worse, the liner notes only transcribe the lyrics so there's no narrative to guide listeners. It would have been fascinating to know the story behind this music, as uninspiring as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly second rate material","review":"I love Springsteen's work but this is the dregs of the aforementioned. I compiled the entire 4 CD's onto a single CD that has all that I considered worth listening to on it! And the CD had lots of free space!Alas a once great Rock and Roll star has turned himself into a left wing mouthpiece alienating his work from his hardworking American fanbase. Oh Bruce I marvel at the hypocrisy of advocating open US borders when you live in gated community. I wonder how much of the Diversity you advocate for others is bestowed upon your children? In summary here is yet another hypocritial Democrat who talks a good game but actually lives life more like a Republican. Still cannot see just where he lost the plot and abandoned his culture and identity for the endorsement of the beautiful people."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it was unreleased !!!!","review":"No wonder most of this material was unreleased!! The songs sound all the same !! Absolutely nothing new, only Springsteen's old formula, but without the charm that is present in the material that went on to their final cuts in his discography !!! Keep away !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There should be more than 5 Stars","review":"This is not an album for the Born in the USA fan! This is for the true fan that can let Springsteen under their skin and sit for a little while. This is for the fan that feels emotions, and is not just out for a pop album. If you like the Boss and dig all sides of the coin, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Bruce Collection","review":"Bruce Springsteen's box set TRACKS is definitely a worthy buy for any Bruce fan. Culled from Bruce's earliest demos to the early mid 90s material TRACKS is a great way to explore the world of Bruce without hearing his greatest hits, but rather genuis songs that never got released or were B-sides. Disc one starts with what i think is his first demo at Columbia, \\"Mary Queen Of Arkansas\\" and is followed by demos of other songs and a great live track, \\"Rendezvous\\". Later on in the set there are great versions of \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\" and \\"This Hard Land\\". Disc four has many nice songs, \\"Sad Eyes\\" and \\"Gave It A Name\\". The booklet that is included has many great pictures, which makes that much more of an must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each of the 4 c.d.'s could have been a standout single release","review":"I purchased this set when it was released in '98 and listened to it a couple of times, liked it, and then didn't listen to it again until April of 2009.Maybe I have too many c.d.'s, or possibly my 4 kids diverted my attention, but I can't believe I'd forgotten how good this collection is.It's difficult to summarize a 66 track set, but from '72 through '95 Springsteen's artistic powers were such that even the unreleased material exemplified here is uniformly excellent and only comparable to the first volumes of the Dylan Bootleg series. This boxed set is truly a stunning achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Awesome CD BOX! Every cd is a new journey through Springsteen artictic work.

Unless you are listening to it on a boom box/kmart rack system, the sound of these disks is thin, flat, one dimensional and very fatiguing (aka digititis). Its hard to beleive these were actually remastered. No wonder vinyl is making a comeback. Analog sounds like the real thing.I want to restate that I think this is a great work of art. It just could be worlds better if the recording industry gave a damn and would put some emphasis on recording sound quality.

What Bruce found not good enough for his 'regular' albums, would be the highlight for most other artists.

Looking forward to see him on the road!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This boxed-set is a true relief to the 30-something group","review":"It's about time, Bruce. Your die-hard fans of the first five albums can now come out of hiding.

Although I do question a few of the selections on the set (i.e. why is \\"such-and-such\\" song on here, but not \\"such-and-such?\\") and I do wish there were more selections from the \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town\\" era, this is a must-have for any Springsteen fan and student of rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE BEST","review":"I have been waiting for a collection of songs like this forever. Its nice to see how some songs started out and where some songs changed ..One of the biggest pluses is the B sides..I could lisiten to these CD's forever.\\"Living on the Edge of the World\\" a real treat..Its like being at every juncture in Springsteen's life.Now all I want for Christmas is a TOUR..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"new music\\" from Bruce in years!","review":"As a long time Springsteen fan (some might say fanatic) who owns a number of bootlegs, I had extremely high expectations for this collection but didn't expect many surprises, just cleaned up versions of things I had already heard. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. Tracks exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is phenomenal (Bruce: it's time to remaster Born To Run, Darkness, & E Street Shuffle). More than half the material was new to me and a number of the tunes are as good as anything he's ever put out. It also does a great job of capturing the evolution of his career (sounds, themes, etc.). As I read somewhere, \\"it reminds you of why you fell in love with Bruce's music originally.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever you do, don't miss this train.","review":"You can't imagine how wonderful it is to hear NEW Springsteen. It has been a delight over the last week to be able to pop in any of his four new CDs and listen to \\"Thundercrack,\\" or \\"Stolen Car,\\" or the wonderfully evocative \\"Lucky Man.\\" He's amazing, I tell you, and if you don't have this set, buy it now. Every day you delay is one less opportunity to enjoy great music and great artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"top ten\\" Christmas album","review":"If this album contained nothing but it's splendid rendition of Madan's Lo! He Comes, with Clouds Descending, the album would be worth owning. Fortunately, the entire album is a brillant mix of voices, instrumentals and performance styles; the resulting album can be played several times in successiion without becoming repetative - no small feat for a Christmas album.The album ranges from the 13th century Nuns of Chester to contemporary composers - Judith Weir - or nearly comtemporary - Britten, Holst ... with excellent sequencing so that no piece seems out of place.The instrumentation varies from the traditional organ with SATB choir to fiddle, flute, concertina and cello. This provides the variety that makes the album so listenable.For traditional Christmas music this album is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and special","review":"Loved this album the entire thing. An English flavour.Especially loved the Lo He Comes With Clouds Descending..heart stirring. A great way to get into the Christmasspirit and lift your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this 3 weeks ago with the hope that I could fix my mouse problem here, no insects just mice.So I put it down in the basement directly facing where the mice were coming in, and it seemed to be working (I didn't see anything) the other night though I went downstairs and sure enough I saw a mouse.I decided to move the Rodar into the room with the problem, and last night I saw one walk right past it and not effect.I have a cat and he has caught some of them but I didn't want to have to resort to poison / traps because it gets messy.Now I guess I should have spent the 20-30$$ and not bothered with this, and I did talk to an pest control guy and he said that for the most part they don't work otherwise he would be using them.if I could rate this lower than one star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment...","review":"This is one of the most expensive units in the category. I have purchased it based on multiple positive reviews.It was very big disappointment to see that rodents are completely ignoring it (from few feets away).However, a little generic device \\"DX610 Pest-A-Repel\\" (I've purchased it for another area) works just fine.I hope it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"No squirrels in the walls","review":"It's impossible to tell if the device is on or working except by the results.

While I'm not an opera fan per say, I do very much enjoy the orchestral excerpts from most operas. This set in particular shines for three reasons in my opinion. First and foremost, boasting excellent performances at a budget-price, this is a great disc for the casual fan. Second, for the more astute listener it features brilliant recordings by Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, Antonio de Almeida and Alain Lombard, three highly underrated conductors. Lastly, while half of the operatic works featured here are quite popular (\\"Carmen,\\" \\"Samson et Dalila,\\" and \\"Faust\\"), others are lesser known (those by Massenet, Gounod, Delibes and Thomas) yet equally enjoyable. In all, this is another Seraphim title that will appeal to the novice and serious collector alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neighbour to the moon, ambassador to the stars...","review":"\\" After Years of thirst, a voice like fresh water has arrived. A cloud, a love letter from another planet: Fairuz has overwhelmed us with ecstasy. Names and figures of speech remain too small to define her. She alone is our agency of goodwill to which those of us looking for love and poetry belong. When Fairouz sings, mountains and rivers follow her voice, the mosque and the church, the oil jars and loaves of bread. Through her, every one of us is made to blossom, and once we were no more than sand; men drop their weapons and apologize. Upon hearing her voice, our childhood is molded anew.\\"Nizar Qabani"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible quality, don't waste your time","review":"Being that Warner has taken a break from their release schedule with the official DVDs, I decided to check out this release as it contains the later color shorts. I figured it would tide me over until the Warner sets come out. I was first surprised to see that these are DVD-R discs, not factory pressed. Anyway, I sat down to watch this and neither of the two discs would play in one of my DVD players in my home theater (it said \\"format not supported\\"). My other DVD player, which is region free, would play disc 1 and I was appalled at the horrible video and audio quality. They all appear to be low bitrate with tons of macro blocking artifacts and audio dropouts. The printing on the cover says NTSC/PAL and I figured I was given a PAL disc by accident. So surely it should play in my computer too, right? Wrong. This was sent back for a prompt refund. The seller didn't offer to replace them either, which I found interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk like spoiled spinach","review":"Quality of this video is horrible.

The lyrics are bad, the music is unpleasant and the whole result is just annoying. I usually like No Doubt alot, and imagine that the lyrics were meant to be clever, but the repetitive chorus is like a toothache. I hope they get back to more songs that are fun and meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE LETDOWN","review":"This song is soooooooooo horrible. This is No Doubt selling out big time. They know much better than this. I cant belive they did this. They made this song to be popular and sell albums. Last time i checked, that's called selling out. You say the whole point to being a musician is to be popular and make money? That may be so, but when u are a REAL band and make your own music, you don't sell out. Shame on No Doubt.

While there are some weakness, particularly the final chase scene which was obviously a train set, overall the movie is quite good.The story focuses around a stolen necklace, and a series of colourful characters, including a cockney who was a scene stealer, a deaf mute woman, a rather nosy lead actor and a number of \\"bad guys\\". Well worth watching, particularly if you keep in mind that this film is over 70 years old, and still holds its own"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tight fit, mediocre sound","review":"I bought the neckband headphones because my clip-over-ear headphones always get tangled in my bag. They look and feel really nice. But sound quality was disappointing and barely comparable to the stock ipod headphones. Frankly the fit is tight, even for my small head. The system to hook to your ears requires a sort of a clumsy fumbling to make them work. If you plan on using them on a treadmill or while jogging, be aware that the bouncing motion pulls them down on your ears, which can be uncomfortable during vigorous exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly useless as it falls apart","review":"I've had my PMX 100s for a month now, and already they're in pieces. The mechanism used to hold the driver to the neckband isn't very good and is not meant to be repairable. The drivers also wobble around. Once they come out of the neckband, it's game over. The foam pads easily fall off as well. And the comfort? ...What comfort? These are less comfortable than almost any other neckband style headphone I have worn.The sound quality is OK (perhaps spoiled as I am used to higher end cans like the HD600), but the durability and lack of comfort make these cans unwearable and unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurt my ears","review":"The sound was okay, but the attachment on my ears was very uncomfortable. Too bad because I liked the neck band aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones for the Price!","review":"I bought both the PMX60s and the PMX100 headphones. I am not a sound expert. To me the PMX100 sound alot better than the PMX60s and are only $6 more on Amazon. The PMX100s have much better lows and clearer highs.Both headsets sound better than the sony headsets I have had in the past.They fit well and don't fall of during my runs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, not durable","review":"I bought these in April after an extensive search for great sounding headphones. I used Sennheiser at my workplace, so I was eager to get these phones. The sound has been great, and they made my commute much nicer as l listened to my music on the bus. However, I noticed that the plastic coating the wire was no longer attached at the jack. I tried to remedy this with electric tape, and this worked fine... until today. When I pressed play on my ipod, I was devastated to only hear sound from the right phone.I love the Sennheiser's sound quality, however, these are not the most durable headphones. I used them everyday and I am not sure what would cause the coating to detach from the jack. Needless to say, I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Durability","review":"I've owned 3 different PMX 100 headphones over the past three years. The use was intermittent with PMX 60 headphones which are also very good but the sound is not as great as the PMX 100. Problem is, after a few months of use the connection started to tear apart. It's very sad to see this happen three times. I've decided not to purchase a PMX 100 anymore. The durability is a disaster and it's not worth it for the great sound it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"another glowing review!","review":"nice headphones. good fit -they stay put, great sound, and excellent build quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound. Shoddy design.","review":"I started using these headphones immediately. They conformed pretty well, sounded fantastic. I thought \\"$40? small price to pay for great sound, comfort, and even cool looking headphones.\\" But I spoke too soon. The cord that comes out of the mini-jack is already coming apart. Medium wear and 2 weeks of use = $40? I don't think so. Sennheiser may not get my business ever again with build quality so poor. They sound good, feel comfortable, and aren't super expensive...but if you want to use them for more than a week, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Running","review":"This was my second pair. I bought a pair a little over a year ago for excercising - primarily running. The design keeps them in place through all the jostling of jogging. I had to get the second pair because my wife kept stealing mine and I could never find them for my runs. The sound quality is quite good for an open air headphone. The design allows me to hear other things going on around me. This is very important when running around town. It doesn't take a lot of effort from my shuffle to power these things. Therefore I can get a lot of runs in without worrying about having to charge my ipod again. Both me and my wife love these headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones with one small gripe","review":"These headphones sound great, and they are really comfortable. The only gripe is that the neck band is not adjustable but that is only a small gripe. I would definitely buy another pair of these if I needed them. They are a lot better than the ones supplied with my MP3 player"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful musicians","review":"I was in New Orleans for work for a few weeks in 1997, and I had to go see Preservation Hall. After watching the shows there, I left and ran into O'Flaherty's there, where the Poor Clares were playing. I was hooked. I went every night, and there was some mix of this group of musicians (Patrick, Betsy, Beth and Justin). I bought all of their albums available. I was heart broken when O'Flaherty's closed, but am glad these guys are all still playing.They were great live, and the album does a good job at creating that live feel. The only thing missing is the banter between songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic is Still There...Hang Ten!","review":"I never get tired of Gidget stories!

He told me no it doesn't. I Read some of the reviews and was concerned by one reviewer's extremely negative comments.I continued searching for a lamp by any other manufacturer that would meet my requirements but kept coming back to this lamp.I decided give this lamp a try because I knew if was not satisfied with it I could return it to Amazon without any problems.I received it in 3 days and I'm very pleased with this lamp.

I still have it--it looks great and works like a champ. My wife was looking for one and came across this listing on Amazon for the same lamp. Problem is, I paid about $25 for this lamp and it's now selling for $100, which is completely outrageous. I don't know why the dimmable desk lamp market has all but dried up (at least sub $100) but it's too bad that this lamp is so expensive now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unaceptable","review":"The song \\"Intruder\\" was one of the singles of this album, and it was played on Headbangers ball back in the day. I really liked Intruder, it was in your face hardcore, and Billy Milano's voice sounds strong and agressive, so i went out and bought the album....I felt really let down by all the other tracks except Intruder, and certainly didint sound like the first M.O.D. albums that are much better than this one. If you wanna get anything with Billy in it, get S.O.D or the first 2 M.O.D albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhythm of Fear","review":"Rhythm of Fear fails to deliver. It's mostly unentertaining and boring. My favorite songs were: Dead End, Rally(NYC), Get Up And Dance, and Step By Step is alright.

His signature style of mixing jazz, poetry, and hip hop is apparent in this release. There are a lot of outstanding tracks on this album with \\"Listening\\" being my favorite. Definitely a must have for those who love hip hop, or those who just want to chill. If you want to see J-Live, get Da Bassment T.V. on DVD. What he does with the turntables and the mic at the same time is crazee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun For Youngies and Oldies Alike","review":"A superior entry by Tom Holt which moves at a fast pace from beginning to end. This book is a sequel to \\"The Portable Door\\", but it can be easily read as a standalone. Son of the world's worst parents may have something to do with Paul's lack of confidence. His coworkers at J W Wells are an odd assortment of wizards, goblins, dwarves, and even the Queen of the Fey. Paul is still a trainee and has recently been assigned to pest control, but these pests include fire breathing dragons, wyverns,etc. His duties also include assisting in the companies banking at the Bank of the Dead, which is a bit tricky and also a \\"bit of a tax fiddle\\". \\"In Your Dreams\\" answers the following important questions:1. Can you take it with you? Yes, merely setup an account at the Bank of the Dead and deposit, making sure you burn cash and deposit slips thoroughly.2. Is your company car really the bosses sister? Yes.3. Does life ever produce happy endings? Nah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Some definite good short stories in here some not so good but none too terrible.

As such, it heaps banality upon banality in the stuffiest and most pretentious pseudo-English intellectual style. I believe that this is the product of a truly mediocre mind, isolated from the academic mainstream to such an extent that he is unaware that he has NOTHING new to say. His main point is that institutions and politics influence the business environment. DUH. It would be funny if it weren't pathetic. In addition, his writing style is neither elegant nor fluid, but flat and dull. I would not have read this it if I didn't have to for a class.If you want books on political economy and globalism, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Illustrated","review":"I thought this book covered the loss of a pet to old age very well.

I honestly just picked it off the shelf because \\"Lulu\\" looks a lot like our dog, and thought it would be a cute story about maybe losing a pet and finding it again. From the moment I began to read it, I realized what the story was really going to be about... And yes my 5 yr. old and I cried, and my 8 yr. old put on a brave face, but was very moved by the story. This brought up many questions concerning our own dogs life and when his possible death would be. It also has made my 5 yr. old more loving and gentle with our dog. It's a beautiful but very honest story. One that I imagine plays out in many households everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saying Goodbye to Lulu","review":"Dealing with a difficult subject, this book tenderly shows how a young girl copes with the death of her beloved dog.

Thankfully, we found this nightstand on Amazon and ordered two of them.When they arrived we opened them up and had them assembled in about 15-20 minutes a piece. The instructions were clear and assembly was not difficult. Unlike some other reviewers, our tables didn't have any surface blemishes on them. They were both scratch free and looked great once we had put them together!These probably aren't as good of quality as other name brand nightstands, but for the price they are wonderful. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and serves it's purpose!","review":"Fast Delivery, no damage. A heavy and sturdy night stand, took me 40 min to put together without any hardship. I needed to fill in a corner between the bed and the window and to have something to put my laptop on and my phone and charger and this is perfect for what I needed. It might have some imperfections in terms of aligning perfectly together, and the biggest negative is the drawer - if you slide it out more than a third it drops down, but if you just need it to store some chargers or something and only open it once in a while it really doesn't matter. The surface is large enough for my laptop and other small items, and the bottom is great for some magazined and my drawing pad. Overall a great buy for a very affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Cheap Cheap","review":"Upon arrival this thing was already scratched on the top surface and had a crack in the wood.

I wouldn't buy from this seller or company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little table!","review":"Bought this nightstand for my bedroom and it looks great! Exactly like the picture. Easy to put together by myself and it seems very sturdy. I think the only criticism I have is that the small circular pieces to cover the screw holes don't really stick unless you use glue. Nevertheless it's an easy fix. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a decently priced nightstand/side table"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect condition","review":"I purchased two (black). Both arrived quickly, without a single scratch, nick, touch-up job, crack, etc. All holes were alligned correctly and to the appropriate depth, although it seemed like I had to tighten the longer screws forever (once as I built it, once afterwards as the table was upright). make sure you use the correct end of the wrench in order to get the best leverage! As a female with pretty much no furniture putting-together experience, I finished the first in 40 minutes and the second in 30, without the aid of another person. $36. No wood veneers.

I cannot manage to put it together without it being rickety and wobbly (and for the record, I'm usually pretty handy with this stuff). I'll be sending it back, if they'll accept it as a return. I'm not sure what the issue is but since it comes flatpacked and needs to be bolted together, I assume some of the holes don't line up quite right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy nice looking table","review":"The finish looks great and its very sturdy. I use it for my birds cage. The drawer does dip the further you pull it out. It's really not a problem I just hold it. Took all of 20 minutes to put together, very easy.

It is a great little table, came with only one small knick that I was able to easily touch up with a black sharpie marker. I put it together myself (I'm mom) in about 20 minutes. You need a philips head screwdriver, I actually used our cordless drill to sink the screws all the way in. The majority of the screws use a tool that comes with the table (hex style). The table is sturdy, I did notice the same thing others have complained about, I can not get the drawer nob tight. I may put some epoxy or glue behind it so it doesn't slip around in circles.

It is shot on VIDEO. Not Hi-Def George Lucas like video but soap opera / sitcom style video. However, despite the low budget quality of the production, this is a fun ride. The story and characters differ quite a bit from the theatrical version of the story but I enjoyed this alternate take. It clocks in at over 200 minutes so the story delves deeper into nuances & character arcs. Now on to the martial arts. The fighting in this new production is intense & non-stop. Top notch Kung Fu all the way. Overall, this will not make you forget about the Ang Lee directed theatrical film but it's an interesting alternate version of the epic story. Approach it with an open mind & I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad Video (DVD)","review":"This is a great movie. I don't buy many movies but I enjoyed this movie so much, I had to own it. I bought the DVD. I was anxious to see the English dubbed version to see if it would add or subtract to the enjoyment of the movie. What a disappointment.The sound track was just bad. The relative levels of the music, sound effects and the voices were all wrong. To top if off, the levels varied from scene to scene and would drop off in places. I spent so much time adjusting the volume I could not enjoy the movie. I checked the Mandarin version and it was better.I read some of the other reviews (after I bought it) and some of the suggestions that would have made this DVD perfect. I would have been happy with the current content if they had just gotten it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I would probably enjoy this movie more if it didn't have all that unrealistic, silly-looking, flying about. C'mon, there is something to be said about general common sense. That fact that this movie got all those awards, only has me question the integrity of how movie awards are selected and praised. I almost bought this stupid movie before I seen it. I'm sure glad I refrained. I wouldn't keep this movie if it were given to me. Too bad, too, because I usually love asian films. I even like Michelle Yeoh. But, this movie, just looked silly. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vertigo inducing, overrated trash","review":"This movie was terribly overrated. If you want to see people jumping from rooftop to rooftop, rent The Matrix. Explosive indeed, the effects were impressive, and if you're a fantasy devotee, you might be happy, but Crouching Tiger managed to take me to a place where I did not want to visit and where I did not want to stay.

It seemed like some of the special effects were just put in gratuitously, they were way off base from the advancing of the plot, what little plot there was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too overhyped","review":"This movie was a major dissapointment, all the so-called special effects had been done in previous kung-fu movies and in some cases done twice as well. The battles are impressive in some cases but if you want to buy a movie for excellent kung-fu fights such as you'd find in this then you should buy Legend 2, it has nearly the same special effect's only done in a much more entertaining fasion then this movie.

Only martial art lovers may like this film. Lacked emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filming, but pure romanticism","review":"It was funny seeing this film that was made specially with an American audience in mind. Loved the filming, thought Michelle Yeow and Chow Yun Fat were horrible. They can't speak mandarin for nuts. Plot was really dumb and the kung fu just added to the stereotype that martial arts is highly valued in Chinese culture, which it is not at all. Somehow, one thinks if this film is but not oriental romanticism. I know many of my friends who didn't like the film because of that reason, in fact, some were offended. Personally, I thought the Xinjiang chapter was the most beautiful and enchanting part of the film. the chemistry was really there. Anyway, yes, this film deserves a few oscars here and there. and who knows, it may just out seat Gladiator. haha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Although I enjoyed Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi (as always), I didn't enjoy this movie hardly at all. I couldn't believe this was the movie that got such rave reviews and was Oscar nominated etc. I don't say that foolishly, stating that I dislike the movie when really I dislike the genre. That's not it. I just much prefer films like \\"House of the Flying Daggers\\" and \\"Hero\\" to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I sat and watched this film in utter disgust. After all the hype, after all the critics raving on and on about it, after a few of my friends said \\"you gotta see it\\", I can't help but feel like I'm missing something. The plot was boring, the characters seemed shallow, and what's with all the flying? The only bright spots were the terrific sword fights, but then they'd inevitably start flying again which made me sigh in agony. The end of the movie (which I won't get into detail on) left me thinking that it was just an easy out. I sat there wondering why I put myself through such an awful movie and where else could I have spent the money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Garbage","review":"I can NOT believe how overrated this film is! \\"Best film ever made\\"? Hardly. Some [people] even compared it with \\"Gladiator\\" as the best film of 2000. That is totally ridiculous. \\"Gladiator\\" was a summer blockbuster but it also was a movie with compelling sympathetic charcaters and incredible action. Crowe's Maximus is a lovable characte who captures people's hearts. The same thing can not be said about anyone in \\"Crouching Tiger\\". This film is filled with irritating awful characters who I didn't care at all about. The young girl in the film is downright annoying. Also, the special effects of this movie are so overrated it isn't even funny. We have all seen the same type of effects in Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies. Why is this one so special??? In short Crouching Tiger is just a long terrible movie with Chinese people flying around ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped","review":"I had heard so much about how excellent this movie is, but after seeing it I wonder how many people out there like bad movies.

I am a Chinese and I love martial arts movies, but \\"crouching tiger\\" is one of the worst movie of this genre I ever seen.I don't understand why so many Americans give this movie a 5 star. Why? Is it because the Americans never watched Martial Art movies before? When this movie was shown in China, Taiwan or Hong kong, it receives more critics than praises.To tell the truth, the fighting scene in this movie has lots of flaws. In all other martial arts or kkung-fu movies, people don't fly like the way it is in this movie. The director Li An dosn't know anything about Chinese kung-fu. The story of this movie isn't good at all. I am a Chinese and I watched the Chinese version, but I don't even know what is the point of this movie after wasting 2 hours of my time!!My point is that, if this movie could get an OSCAR award, then all other chinese martial arts movies can get an OSCAR award too.."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Who Like Pretentious Commentary Will Like This Movie","review":"What a waste of 2 hours of my life.

Yun Fat Chow and ZHang Ziyi's fight scene in the forest near the end was one of the scenes that I thought was very memorable..)It is not a typical Hollywood comedy-martial arts film like Rush Hour or anything, but I think the director did a fantastic job with this film.I highly recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dragon's Triumph","review":"One of the greatest films I have ever seen. Ang Li paints an astonishing picture of Ancient China, the unbelievable true beauty in the maritial arts, the scenery, directing and incredible cinemetography are just the tip of the iceburg. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a love story, it is a soceital story, it is a story of inner peace, and sacred truths.

The shock of my life. Never have I underestimated a movie as much as this one. The ballet, the music, the love stories, the emotional challenges, the broken hearts. Death.

The only thing about the movie I didn't like was the ending, but I can't tell you that because that would ruin it wouldn't it? JUST BUY THIS MOVIE!

However, this film was so intreguing that I felt immediately absorbed.This film has an excellent plot line for an action movie. There is plenty of fight, but not too much. There is a coming of age element, but it doesn't drown out the rest of the story. Lastly the matter of love is disscussed and attended two in two diffrent veins, but does not overpowere any other part or element of the story. The ending was slightly disapointing, but the middle made up for it.Some people are bothered by the flying in the fight sceens. Yes, if you are a purist, then it is most likely going to bother you. However, the choreography of the fighting, again, is very powerful and allows the viewer to ignore the slight, fantastic moments of flying.Overal, great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy, remember that...","review":"Ang Lee does what few before dared. A near perfect melding of martial arts fantasy action and classic romance. Or at least classic in a Chinese sense. All with a well crafted story and a slight sense of humour. Perhaps some will only want to have the martial arts, for them, the love stories will bore... To those who find wire-work martial arts action to be silly, this might be too much. The most important thing to remember is that this is a fantasy! All films are best compared to movies in their own genre and there can be no doubt this a five-star movie in that respect. So watch and have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the standard version","review":"This review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only. Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version. You'll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place. I've watched this movie on my 40\\" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version. So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"i think it is the best movie out","review":"i Like the way the did the movie and how they put differnet kinds of fighting in the movie and i gave it 5 stars but.

It seems to be an overblown story about Oriental love and war and honor with actors on strings-like acrobatics.

I watched it with my fiance when it came out on DVD...thank goodness we only rented it. But, I heard that it was excellent, so I decided to try it out. First of all, even though it is part fantasy, the whole thing with the characters flying on the rooftops and treetops just seemed laughable to me. In the context of the movie, it just didn't seem to work for my taste. Now, I certainly don't begrudge anybody for liking it, because it does have a lot of fans.

Fortunately, I rented it first. While some of it was entertaining, it is not a movie I would ever care to watch again. Admittedly, I do not know the folklore involved, but a movie should be able to stand on its own. Because this movie does not do that, it's disjoined somewhat and the ending makes no sense. If you enjoy la-la land then you may like this movie . . . I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hybrid product.","review":"Weak story, good cinematography and fighting.

I rented the movie thinking that \\"This is going to be a great action movie\\". I watched about 30 minutes of it then turned it off after seeing someone fly backwards through the air across a courtyard. They fly throughout the movie and it's so obvious how fake it is. Too many moves that aren't in martial arts.

If you's a fan of martial arts, this is a must buy. The story line has everything from tragedy, to love. The fightsequences are amazingly composed, there are none like them in any movie I have ever seen. The plot and the characters are well done. Zhang Ziyi is amazing in this movie her talent with a sword really shows through, as does her talent. This is a classic story line, of epic proportions. It's as wonderful for the eyes as it is the mind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Chimpanzee, Flying Gumby","review":"After hearing and believing the hype for this movie, I really wanted to see it bad. Having missed it at the cinema, I decided to wait until it was released on DVD. I went to great lengths to reserve a copy at my local video store so I could bring it home and watch it at home on my home cinema.What fool in his right mind would really be amazed by flying monkeys and a down right boring and uninteresting plot.While some of the fight scenes seemed to have been inspired by the currently in vogue film Matrix, it does lend itself to becoming a self-parody of immense proportions.The scenes with characters flying in tree-tops and onto rooftops made me feel extremely uncomfortable when I saw it. It's just so ridiculously unbelievable.If it were made as a fantasy film in the tradition of the X-Men or Star Wars I could have accepted it.This movie failed to impress me at all. I'd rather watch that Japanese TV show from the 80's called Monkey-that made more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-delusion required","review":"I didn't see this one in a movie theatre, but I don't figure it would have made any difference. After all the hype surrounding this movie I was really surprised to see how BAD it is. This movie is BAD! Bad script guarantees a bad movie and this is what happened here. The story is to say the least uninvolving and reminds me of 20 year old ultra low budged kung fu movies. The effects, although well executed, border on looking silly and the characters (with the exception of Chow Yun Fat) are annoying. I imagine the only way to like this movie is through total self delusion: \\"I's an unusual, exotic, foreign movie. It must be good\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"The story was very simple, the scenery was nice and the costumes were ugly.

However, for those of us who prefer our action heroes in tights and technology, you probably should pass on this film. As for the DVD itself, it was not up to the standard of Academy Award winning films. Hey and how about the sound track? Wow, blew me away, not! If we have to suffer though the lip sync thing, why not put in a real Chinese track so we can brush up on our Mancow (that's a Chicago thing)? Basically, this is a hyped film that disappoints and the DVD is about the same level of quality . . . poor! Perhaps in the sequel, the actors could blow up some crouching tigers or Kung Fu a couple of hidden dragons. Now that would be something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey!, Give Me Back My Comb!","review":"Man This Movie [stinks]! If I Got The DVD I Would Be Skipping To The Fight Sense.

The acting is so slow and boring I almost fell asleep. Even the few awful fight sequences failed to wake me up. The \\"flying\\" sequences are so artificial too. Where on earth did they learn to fly like that? Come on, get real, man.Now, if you want to watch a truly great martial arts movie, I strongly recommend either \\"Once Upon A Time In China\\" starring Jet Li (before he started acting in those bad Hollywood movies) or \\"Iron Monkey\\" starring the fantastic Donnie Yen. Those are truly GREAT martial arts movies. Do yourself a favour, avoid \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"... a great disappointment! It doesn't even deserve the one Star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes","review":"Like the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, it seems no one wants to say nay! This no-appeal, plot-less, subtitled piece of oriental dreck foisted off on the American public has been bally-hooed by the critics, as usual.

Get real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crouching Action,Hidden DVD","review":"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a love story told through edge of your seat fight scenes and quiet humor. It is a great film and is even better on dvd. It's extras are: Photo Montage,Unleashing Dragons Featurette,Michelle Yeoh Comparison Featurette, Commentary, English and Mandarin with Subtitles. As for the best scene it is probably the climax- They must have used a dozen weapons in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful romance, high packed action, GREAT movie!","review":"From heart-touching romance scenes to great action, this movie has to be one of the most unique fighting-style movies I have ever seen. It's one of those movies where you either love it or totally despise it. People have to give it a chance. Sure, it's not like Jet-Li's movies, but that's because it is different. Unique is the word to describe it. I'm a die-hard fan of fighting-action movies, I watch all types, and this movie is AWESOME! If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon","review":"The movie is very good if you like action. The way of the fighting in the movie is different from the american style.

Its definatly one of a kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It.","review":"What's all the hype about here? this movie is really nothing special. i found it dumb and pointless, much to the suprise of my friends, who loved it. i just dont get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Boring!!!","review":"I agree with John Harris. This movie production film is the worst I have ever seen! Jackie Chan has done much better and from my perspective he could kick their butts anyday of the year!!! All they do is talk and the flying doesn't look real at all. You can also see the cables they use to do their stunts. This movie was unrealistic and you can't picture anything in real life with that! I thought it would be so much better if they did more realistic stunts and did not talk as much. I hope that Ang Lee can do a lot better if she works on a new movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What??","review":"I dont know, maybe its just me...But I have a hard problem watching a movie when I dont understand one word they say. The action sequences are good, but other then that...either I should invest on learning some more Oriental Languages or they should get a quality English dubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember when the American public was scammed into watching this film","review":"The media and the critics raved about it. Then the public went to see it, and realized they were conned. It was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. This was made back when the Chinese film industry was still kind of amateur. They have improved vastly since then, which is admirable. Still, this movie is complete junk.

I am an avid reader and do not normally mind subtitled movies (ie.. Pan's Labyrinth and Kung-Fu Hustle.. BTW, Kung-Fu Hustle is LOTS OF FUN!) but there were PARAGRAPH AFTER PARAGRAPH, NOT SENTENCES, OF DIALOG.. FAR TOO MANY SUBTITLES GOING ON AND ON FOREVER, AND GOING BY QUICKLY, that I could not figure out who was who or what was what in this movie. I lost the plot in the first half hour. I was so busy trying to read that my contacts kept drying out and I could not enjoy anything else going on in the film. If you're a martial arts purist, maybe you would enjoy it more than myself.

The special effects were pretty cool the first time you saw them but for the rest of the movie the \\"flying around\\" got quite old.My idea of what makes a good movie are examples such as \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\"; this movie however was a sleeper.

When they got hit, they whould go back floating 2 feet of the ground! The movie is also very slow going, and it is almost impossible to follow. PLEASE DON'T WAST YOUR$! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!P.S. If they would have had a 0.00000001 star selection, I would have picked that! Again, as that other guy said, PEOPLE CAN NOT FLY LIKE THAT!

It's a dreamy, artsy movie, part fantasy part reality. The choreography is great, as is the music and costumes. BUT I started checking my watch after the first 30 minutes, waiting for it to end. It's frustrating trying to take in all the images on screen WHILE reading subtitles WHILE trying to figure out what is going on WHILE avoiding the young princess's yellow teeth!I am reminded of an episode of I Love Lucy where Lucy says, \\"This looks like a bad dream you'd have after eating too much chinese food\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S BORING!!","review":"WHAT THE!?...This is not a kung fu movie, It's just a love movie with 3 or 4 fights and too much flying...BORING!!!If you want to see some old school kung fu movies that has a lot of crazy punches and kicks and sword play with out the hollywood hype, check out:Dragon InnDuel to the DeathFists and GutsThe Shaolin Drunken MonkMystery of Chess BoxingFive Deadly VenomsReturn of the 5 Deadly Venoms"},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid and boring","review":"I saw this in the theatre and tried to fall asleep becuase it was so dull.

I was a \\"bit\\" disappointed, hehe....uh, the DTS is cool, its better than dolby digital 5.1, which is the best the other dvd provided. Also, the Superbit didn't have that annoying dubbed track, that I doubt many people want to listen to anyways. Although I only watch my dvds through s-video rather than the best picture quality component video, I can still say that I've seen better picture in dvds that werent superbit.

I was disappointed with the release. It is dubbed in English, which makes it easier to watch, because you aren't always reading subtitles. However, they deleted at least 15 minutes from the film, and didn't include them on the disk as extra or deleted scenes. One of the deleted scenes was one of the best fight scenes of the whole movie, I don't understand why they did it. The theatrical version was about 2 hours and 20 minutes, with story twists, and fights, that really enriched the movie. I loved it in the theater, and couldn't wait to own it on DVD.

Forget it. I couldn't even watch the whole thing through without nearly falling asleep. The sequences are ok but the flying is just ridiculous. The story is so thin - the search for an ancient sword. The subtitles distract from watching the footage.

It is not popular in China although it is a Chinese film. I don't like it, so does many Chinese. Maybe this film is too common in China. In contract, I like 'The Matrix', 'Five elements'.

Now I don't like them any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Story, Hidden Plot","review":"This movie is, in my opnion, the most over-rated film it has been my displeasure to be unable to avoid. When it first came out on DVD, I breathlessly stormed my local video store, renting one of the first copies to hit the shelf, anticipating luxurious visuals, whimsical storytelling, and hyper-kinetic action. Movie reviews I had read led me to believe that this movie was akin to the re-invention of Great Cinema (capital letters intentional).My wife and I were sadly disappointed. The plot was meaningless and rehashed, the action (ACTION??? I meant non-stop \\"swordfights\\") is the silliest I have ever seen, and I couldn't wait for the next scene. Any scene. Anything that made sense, or progressed a plot... Forget Crouching Tigger, Hidden Piglet and go see a Bruce Lee movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown hype","review":"I've watched the movie and while the fight scenes, the scenery, and the characterizations are truly wonderful, the main part of the film (the plot) leaves one in the dust with disappointment.When the movie is done, you are left with the impression that one young brat is responsible for the pain, suffering, and death of countless good people. Even the ending - when she supposedly finds her happiness - leaves her lover in the lurch ... after he sacrificed everything he had for her.It was a very disappointing film given the incredible amount of hype around it at the time of the theatrical release and the release of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd AWFUL!!!","review":"I implored my friends and coworkers to AVOID this [bad] movie at ALL costs. The plot was insipid, the acting overwraught, the special effects were ridiculous &#65533; those in the last Star Wars movie, as dumb as that flick was, were 10 times better than those in this movie.

I applaud the bravery of these film makers, given a Western market, to make the movie in Mandarin and have the plot Chinese style: no sex, the female lead commits suicide because she understands all her wrong doings, the death of Chow Yu Fat preventing possible marriage with Michelle, and Michelle's loyalty to her belated financee. This is who we are! A mature and deep understanding required to fully understand this movie, especially its' ending. Best picture oscar should have gone to ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' because the scenery is real, unlike all the digitalized graphics of ''The Gladiator,'' but of course, the best oscar has to go to the Whites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, except for...","review":"First of all, I enjoyed Crouching Tiger a lot. I saw it three times in theatres, and this DVD does it justice with a crisp transfer, and a lot of audio options. While I prefer the Subbed version, the english dub is actually pretty good. However, be very careful if you are changing the subtitle options around people that haven't seen the movie. The end of the movie is shown as one of the animated menu transitions! I can't even begin to describe how unhappy I am with Sony because of this, thus the 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Don't believe the hype. The matrixesque martial arts fall flat especially when the characters fly across the screen. This reminds me of a play I saw in grade school, \\"Peter Pan\\". The story itself is nothing new. The acting is average. I do think cHOW yUN fAT is superb actor but he alone is not enough to carry this film. If this is the best of the kung fu genre than I don't think I need to watch a kung fu film ever again. As for the rave reviews, the oscar nominees, the best foreign film award, critics top ten, etc. Ang Lee is lucky.

Why all the awards?","review":"I like an art movie as much as the next person, but this was really tedious! It is beautifully shot and the art direction is wonderful- this does not make up for a boring story and endless tedious martial arts. A great disappointment considering all the fuss that was made about this movie. I appreciate the choreography of the action scenes but enough is enough-the flying sequences were not properly realised-you could not see the wires but you knew they were there! Viewing this film was a triumph of hope over experience. I should have known that this was just another kung fu film-however you dress it up! Sorry Ang close but no cigar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not the spectacular event people claim it is","review":"Yes, it is a high-quality version of Hong Kong wuxia films. Some of the action scenes are great, some are too unrealistic.The \\"flying people\\" is at times, a bit bizarre. The best way to view it is on DVD, since it has English Dolby 5.1. The lead actors are good, but no need to rush out to get this non-epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chop-sockey film, rent before you buy","review":"I was surprised at this film which I saw on a rented video. The hand-to-hand fight scenes are phony looking; the aerial gymnastics are obviously done with wires (not anywhere near The Matrix in quality). Although, I really did like the sword fights, the choreography on them seemed excellent. Perhaps it's just a culture clash that made the characters motivations and actions seem childish if not plain stupid to me. If you saw it in the theater and liked it, fine then get it, but I would recommend renting it first and then if you like it, buy it from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good choreography, and that's about it....","review":"Good action sequences, horrible movie.

It was such nonsense, I lost interest halfway through. I still watched it, but it made no sense! Where did these people learn to fly??? Say what you will, but I hated this movie.

Everyone I know who has seen this sparkling film and the film \\"Gladiator,\\" which took home the Best Picture award, give a unanimous gasp at how that could have possibly happened. The cinematography in this film is lush and just plain gorgeous! The costumes are intricate and beautiful! While the story is great fantasy laced with fantastic fight-choreography with many different weapons, not to mention hand-to-hand combat, and has an emotional depth not seen in most foreign films. This is simply a great film! Many are turned off by the \\"Peter Pan\\" fantasy elements of this extraodinary folk-tale, but I loved every moment, feeling like \\"if that's going to be possible in this movie, then anything could be.\\" What a delightful idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Wish I Spoke Whatever Language That Is","review":"Stupid Sony DVD won't play in my fancy PC DVD player.

Are you people very hairy? Do you drag your hands around when you walk?) I'm only going to say that the action, story, acting, direction, cinematogrophy, sets, costumes, comedy and drama is brilliant enough to produce a feeling of sheer joy. This is the movie that started my kung fu craze. I wish this movie came out years ago, for I would have liked to have been introduced to one of the best genres of cinema history a long time ago.

Some of the best on-screen combat I've ever seen with hot, fiesty, sword fightin' chicks and Chow Yun-Fat at his absolute best. The only way you can be underwhelmed by this movie is if you do nothing but watch the greatest fighting movies available or actually live in Hong Kong and get to see them released. I thought Ang Lee's film \\"the Ice Storm\\" had great potential and beautiful cinematography, so when I heard...that this visual genius got hold of Chow Yun-Fat back in 99, the drooling commenced. When I saw it opening night with my friend Jessica, I refexively blurted out \\"Why do American movies suck so bad??\\" as I watched that crazy Hong Kong Brit Lee destroy my vision with some of the greatest story telling Chicago's McClurg Court theater had ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of two hours of my life","review":"This movie was horrible.

NO. this movie is so bad. it makes me wonder are the oscars just a fix....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Tiger, Stupid Dragon","review":"One of the stupidest movies of the year.

I honestly can't believe anyone liked it, and the amazing thing is that so many people do seem to have liked it. The plot was absurd. The characterizations were thin and implausable. The film gets points, I guess, for being unusual. But I thought it had a scarcely-veiled pandering attitude to women, especially the long, boring \\"abduction\\" sequence where the star finds true love with her captor. I like art house films, so it pains me to see mildly imaginative PC garbage passing for serious art. Ang Lee, try again. You're talented.

This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. There is no real character development, the plot is entirely predictable and cliche', the action sequences are either funny or just plain boring. The special effects weren't cool, just dorky - it would have been no worse by having the actors flying through the air by the \\"invisible ropes\\" of years ago. Kids might like this, though I've seen almost every Disney film made and this was far less entertaining than anything Disney has released in the last ten years. I can only imagine that folks that like martial arts and kooky special effects will find this movie entertaining.

The flying parts are a bit far-fetched but that is why this is a movie. The drama parts can be shortened but I guess Ang Lee wanted to make this more than just a martial art flick. Not too many of my friends understood the ending, I only accepted it as the way of ... Chinese Bushido.All in all, it's a good movie, despite of the hype.

At first I thought maybe it's a spoof, but then I got the queasy feeling that it's meant to be taken seriously. I then got an overwhelming desire to scream \\"What the ****?\\" I could go on with a detailed critique, beginning with the unexplained suspension of the laws of physics, but I have a feeling it would serve no purpose. This is a movie that, judging from the reviews here, you'll either love or hate. If you haven't already seen it, and are considering buying a copy, I strongly recommend renting it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Tiger.......","review":"----------------------------------------------------------------Despite the (over)hype, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is very simply, very easily overrated. Although it has moments that are truly great, these are few and far between. This is hardly the best Martial Arts movie of all time, that's for sure. And I don't know why people are praising the FX. Digitally erasing wires is NOT a great achievement. Director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm) has come up with the least interesting film of his career, though Crouching Tiger IS more entertaining than Ride With The Devil. Based on the (over)reaction to Crouching Tiger, I expected magic. Instead, I got a tedious and pretentious film that is interrupted sporadically by interludes of brilliance. According to my watch, with which I become well acquainted during the screening, I believe that there are about 20 minutes of a great movie interspersed into an exceedingly dull one.----------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO!","review":"This is in every way boring.

The only reason I can think of is that they never seen a better sword fighting kung fu movie. The fighting moves are nice undoubtly, but it is a bit ridiculous. Sword fighting is not all about \\"floating around in the sky\\". it actually also follows the physics law. clearly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fails to see this point. however, the casts gave quite a good performance. if u want to see a good swording stunts and moves, this movie is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made next to plan 9 from outer space!","review":"What were the makers of this film smoking when they made this, this is just another kung-fu style fighting movie , nothing is different from this film and the ones I watched 10 years ago,except this has a dumb story. The only thing is the people can fly higher. Who can't make a movie like this. Make people fly and fight each other and lets say they have to find some jewls, there you got yourself another award winner. How can anyone like this. If I wanted to watch people fly i'd watch Peter Pan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soooo boring and stupid script","review":"I tried to like this movie. I really did, but whole time spent in the theatre was total agony. It bored me to death. Even the fighting scenes were much too long to be enjoyable. The story was so thin, that film director probably had to fill the time somehow. Besides that the whole plot is absurd. You can never figure out why characters are doing what they are doing. Who hates who and why. They are just confused. Bad, bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie...!","review":"Great action sequences. The one where Michelle Yoeh is chasing Zhang Ziyi was great film editing (this is if you're patient enough to wait for it. This movie starts off kinda slow). Those less-forgiving movie watchers might have to get used to everybody flying around like Peter Pan and also the rather pointless 20-minute flashback. Great movie otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good example of the genre, but not the best","review":"Credit where credit is due. This film reintroduced Hong Kong style Martial Arts to the western world in a big way. It is not perfect and maybe slightly overlong. The DVD is very good with ample extras and sumptious picture and sound quality. There are better examples of the genre though."},{"rating":"2","title":"what more can you say about this","review":"Everyone must have seen it at least once by now, so what else is there to say. Maybe that the only downside to the DVD is that for some reason it starts playing using the dubbed version, whereas I think the only way to fully enjoy it is in the original language and with subtitles. Apart from that I was very happy to have bought the DVD. When it was playing in the theatres I didn't go to see because I assumed I wouldn't like it becasue I don't like these martial arts films. Although I still have some reservations about these flying skills of the characters, it is a beautiful film. The only thing I can add is that you should definitely see Ju Dou and Raise The Red Lantern. They are much slower and without action scenes, but the cinematography is at least as beautiful as in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad subtitles make Blu ray version unwatchable","review":"This cinematic masterpiece is ruined by the newly translated subtitles contained in the Blu ray version released July 27, 2010. The theatrical subtitles flowed smoothly and had a certain rhythm that helped the film win an Oscar. The new translations contain distracting juvenile language that ruins the original script and makes this an entirely different film. I doubt the director or writers approved of these new translations. The Blu ray version is not what the film makers had intended for audiences, and it should be pulled from the shelves until the original subtitles are restored. Buy the DVD version or wait til Sony cleans up their act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Letdown!","review":"This version of Crouching Tiger is certain to disappoint most fans of the Ang Lee movie version. The special effects budget is nonexistent. There are scenes where the wires are vividly visible, destroying any believability. Unfortunately, the acting only deepens the disappointment. It is abysmal and amateurish. The story progresses at a jerky pace and the editing is choppy, (probably reflecting the fact that this is condensed from a 15 hour TV version), making it difficult to follow what is going on. Take my advice, save your money! Buy the Ang Lee movie version if you have not already seen it. Watching this horrific and degenerate version is painful and not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"magic ?","review":"The only magic here was how Lee got you to part with your money to view this epically terrible, boring B- movie... saying this was important film making would embarrass even Jackie Chan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Snoozefest, Hidden Boredom","review":"OK, there was a hint of a good story in here, but this turkey was way more style than substance.Totally odd looking effects....you could almost see the wires lifting the actors and actresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie.

The quality is OK, the extras are there (the entire film commentary by the director and producer/writer is interesting), but the menus are appalling and wreck the whole DVD experience.Every transition is accompanied by two short clips, making navigation a real chore. This by itself is bad, but the subtitles menu actually spoilers the *final scene*, thereby ruining any impact it might have had (should you have missed this film at the cinema). For me, that is a shocking gaffe, and deserves to be thoroughly slated.OK, if you want to see this film on DVD, you have to get *this* DVD.

Action sequences so unrealistic that I could not suspend my disbelief. Neither boy gets either girl. Heavy-handed yet obscure symbolism.I feel like this is a movie we (the public) were programmed to like. The media blitz convinced us that it was somehow \\"heavy\\" and \\"spiritual\\" - something that our western minds should try to embrace. I felt a definite \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" syndrome - I know my opinion is not a popular one, but again, I just don't get it.I'll admit I found it mildly entertaining, and I must assume that many action sequences were incredibly difficult to film. But just because something is hard to do doesn't make it good. To me it's nothing but another surrealistic martial arts movie, albeit one with good photography and better acting than usual.

That said it had a great director.

People need to realise that things aren't always clear-cut. From a Western point of view, I guess this can be a problem as convention dictates that the good guys should always triumph over evil. Chinese cinema is different in that respect. To name a few recent examples: The Banquet and Hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Issues with Superbit Collection","review":"Overall a fantastic movie. However, buyers should be aware that the Superbit Collection may add audio clarity at the expense of the extra features typical to DVDs. For instance the the regular DVD edition contains interviews, commentaries, graphics, etc. Superbit has none of these. For the vast majority of buyers who will not be able to even notice the difference in sound quality, this is a more expensive product that adds little value. Stick with the regular DVD edition (which I'd rate a 5)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the greatest Chinese epic movie","review":"It's been a decade sinceCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonfirst came out, and there have been dozens of copycat and other Chinese epic movies in the meantime, but this one is still the best.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonis chock full of strong characters, beautiful music, and exciting fight scenes. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh make an excellent pair as warriors who try to suppress their feelings. Moreover,Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonhas a lot of heart. The movie doesn't have a lot of violence or special effects, but rather really focuses on the four main characters and their development. I'd go so far as to say that this is he best Chinese-language film so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done movie..","review":"I don't think there's another Chinese movie that weaves fanatasy, drama and romance so perfectly into one simple plot. Though not the best fantasy martial arts movie ever (Swordsmans 2 holds that honor), CTHD is still a remarkably well done movie. The acting is top notch.

But the action and excitement of the fantasy styled martial arts direction was totally captivating! I would highly reccommend this movie to anyone who enjoys martial arts movies. That aspect alone kept my full attention for the duration of the movie. I also felt the movie to have a very feminist spin to its story line, for those individuals who like to see women as strong and confident. But it did not go overboard in that aspect. I felt everything was well balanced. I went to this movie with my 9 year old son and my father. Both of them were also put off by the sub-titles, but we all agreed that the martial arts more than made up for the unexpected sub-titles.

It is a mythological story that is given justice on the screen by director Ang Lee. I thought that not only were the fight scenes excellent but just the entire cinematography, the landscapes, the acting, the music, everything had an equal part in making this movie great. It does have \\"Wire-Fu\\" but I don't believe that necessarily demotes it to \\"bad kung fu\\" movie.

Chow Yun-Fat (Anna And The King), Michelle Yeoh (007:Tomorrow Never Dies) and newcomer Ziyi Zhang star in a spectacular romance-drama-action movie set in a time where women were given more respect and ALL people were treated equal. The special effects really dazzled and amazed me and are EXCELLENT. This movie REALLY DEFIES ALL the laws of gravity to the extreme!!! Parents, this movie is a little too violent for kids under 12.

Given that there were a lot of amazing action sequences and the story was more than that of your regular run of the mill action movie it stands well in some places. It's the middle that sends me to sleep everytime I watch it. The love story is carried out to long and caused me to go, \\"Yeah I get your point...she likes him and he likes her but she's a princess and he's a renegade.\\" I've seen it a million times and it still plays the same as it did with Shakespeare...this one doesn't even have a twist. That is why I feel that the film doesn't hold its own and is in fact very unoriginal and boring. A vailiant effort by Ang Lee but not good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Wonderful, and Unusual","review":"Let's face facts, if you're here to see a Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan movie with high speed martial arts, then you are in for a disappointment. This is nothing like that at all, and what is left is breathtaking and beautiful to behold. Trying to relate this movie to the American Culture will leave you empty inside, especially with the ending. Trying to understand a different culture, one from at least a hundred years ago, will leave you with something entirely different. America's desire for a happy ending has left us spoiled, and this movie offers us something unusual that many do not want to accept, that in the end, it's not all roses and honey, and the ending is not always happy. One persons life may alter so many others, as the young girls life did here.

Who was the old man? Was he some kind of teacher? Why was he keeping the sword? How did that little girl get trained anyway? She was a governor's daughter and was unsupervised her whole life? What was this temple they kept talking about? What was all the hoo-ha in the beginning about the warrior's meditation anyway, what did it have to do with anything? It was like this was the fourth of a series and you were already supposed to know all the background.Some of the fight scenes were pretty, especially the bamboo tree scene, but it was laughable to me generally. People flying? Based on what? The Matrix had an excuse, a background, that permitted one to believe that it was possible for the characters to defy gravity and so forth. Here they just start flying around without any information aside from some vague reference to a manual.Can you spell \`\`exposition'' in Chinese?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Thank goodness for the breath-taking action sequences, cause this film plays like a bad martial arts B film from the 60's otherwise. The acting is plastic throughout and the (ahem!) \\"plot\\" if you want to call it that, is so far-fetched and unexplainable...I can't explain it! I tried this film in English and then, in Chinese with English subtitles but- still - it misses, badly. Either I'm just not able to connect in a cross-cultural way to a story that has deep meaning or the critics are crazy! I kept on waiting for Woody Allen or one of the Python boys to walk in and halt the proceedings with a laugh and pratfall. The English dubbing actors voices and performances are dreadful. I swear they sound like two actors from \\"Godzilla\\" or \\"Rodan.\\" The \\"love story\\" between the two \\"heroes\\" is flimsy and acted with inexcusable wooden gestures and melodramatic delivery. In fact, every \\"character\\" in this film is just that - a character. I know this puts me in the minority but - geez - what a stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOORRING","review":"The best thing that can be said about this film is that it has beautiful color and cinematography. The flight scenes with the characters flitting around like Superman or Superwoman just left me absolutely cold. Maybe if they weren't running up vertical walls and on the ceiling or across the landscape with their feet moving it would have been a little more believable. I mean why move your feet when they aren't contacting anything half the time. Why not just wing it like Superman did. His flight scenes were much more realistic than this amateurish attempt. The plot is feeble at best involving the theft of a 400 yr. old sword that looks like something Captain Hook might have been carrying.Sorry, but in my opinion this film is HIGHLY over-rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"...totally unbelievable ...with wonderful cinematography.

Breathtaking!Also the DVD has a lot of special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful film I've seen","review":"As well as being beautiful, this is actually the best film I've seen. Ignore any ideas that subtitling the film makes it any more difficult to watch. I'm sure you'll agree your brain can do two things at once quite capably. I actually believe that if the film was in English, it would certainly lose the majesty and mystique it instills. This film is not overrated. Gladiator is overrated. MI:2 was overrated. Godzilla was overrated. This is as close as movies get to perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Production","review":"This tv production pre-dates the famous movie by a year or so, but, has it's own character and story to tell. Some incidents remain the same, as well as all the major characters, performed by an attractive and talented group of actors (I've developed a little crush on the actress playing Shu lin). This was apparently a much longer work attested to by missing scenes shown in the opening and closing credits and it's a shame Tai Seng has not also offered the complete series dubbed for the serious collector. What's left is a sometimes choppy, but well edited story that expands into many different directions from the movie, yet at it heart never strays from the familiar. Great martial arts too. Very Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I'n not a fan of the martial arts, action movies, or even films; after seeing this I am converted on all fronts, and I am going out of my way to write this only because I think time will prove this film to be a masterpiece.Every aspect of this film has been given such meticulous attention: the fight choreography and special effects repeatedly upstage each other with jaw-dropping skill; scenes between the two leads are among the finest acting I've seen on film or stage, played with such tenderness and passion; the resonance of the story ricochets from the fairy-tale reality of the film to today's talented and impatient youth, unwilling to sacrifice anything to master their talents and too young to find the need for humility.It is a deeply moving, breathtaking, heartbreaking ride. Whatever you do, take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"chic flick with special effects","review":"This was a watered down adventure story of fulfillment (snore).

Michelle Yeoh is a good actress in addition to her physical talents as a martial artist. Zhang Zi Yi is a sexy vixen. Chow Yun Fat is an aging warrior who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. He loves Michelle Yeoh, but can't get around to telling her, and is attracted to Zhang. The unanswered question posed by Zhang is, \\"Did you want me or my sword?\\" The two women dominate this movie; their martial arts scenes are spectacular; Yo Yo Ma's cello is sad and fetching; the scenery is spectacular; the fate of Chow and Michelle is heart-rending; the fate of Zhang is puzzling and ambiguous. Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In spite of sub-titles, wonderful movie.","review":"If you are looking for a love story, intrigue, dramatic martial arts in battle, this is a wonderful file.

Based on what seems a very simple love story. Crouching Tigar Hidden Dragon is a brilliant mix of action, fantasy, martial arts and magic all mixed up in a colourful bowl of perfectly design music. Its a film you have to see more than once as so much goes on, the dvd is something not to be missed, slow motion options, so you can see how good they REALLY are and features that look set to take you deeper into this world of treetop battles. The best fight scene (for me) was the one in the court yard at night, like nothing i have ever seen... its really worth buying just for that.Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product with problems","review":"I've bought this BD because I love this movie, and it was announced in the Amazon website that was subtitles in Portuguese (I am brasilian).

And, worst: the website continues to inform the existence of subtitles in portuguese."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing and overwhelming","review":"I am not a fan of wuxia films, and I believe this film could have done with much less rooftop flying and bullet deflecting. It is an excellent story in itself and it also shows a lot about a dramatic historical period in China (late XIX century). In fact, in my view one missed opportunity of this film is that it could have told us a lot more about the historical context. Also, I think the plot is overly complicated, after a while I gave up trying to follow all its nouances. Yet, it is hard to fault the director for his imprint. It does make a coherent whole and it is impressive. It is also a movie about the endless dilemmas of love and loyalty.The sound track is beautiful as well and comes out well in the BD. Too bad there are no extras, at this price one would have expected some."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite movie-beautiful","review":"Well, words cannot express how beautiful this film is. I wish Hollywood would make movies like this. Ang Lee thank you for bringing this magnificent piece of art to us. I felt like I was transported into a dream,and I didnt want to leave. How could the academy give it to Gladiator? I believe that this will go down as a classic. If there is anyone who hasnt had the privelege of seeing this,it has everything. But I believe it is about finding yourself in life. And it revolves around two very different love stories,one is tragic,and the other is uplifting. There is nothing more to say,again Ang Lee,you are a true genius. Thank you for giving us this great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual feast","review":"First: This film is a fantasy film. Viewed in any other light it will be a disappointment. Absolutely stunning visually and musically. Scenery, costume, and fight choreography were all amazing, and second to none. The film's only downfall may be in the lack of emotion - but this is a downfall only in the traditional American film sense, and should not apply to a foreign film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, The Best Movie Of 2000","review":"2000 was not the great year in movies. Almost all the films I saw that year was either so-so or really bad. But I thak God for Ang Lee's \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", the best movie of the year 2000, in my opinion.The story of two legendary warriors (Chow-Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh)who fight to recover a legendary sword is beautifully told by director Lee. The fight scenes are well choreographed by the same choreographer who did the chops in \\"The Matrix\\". Many people would consider them exaggerated, especially the fact that the warriors fly over roofs and trees, but Peter Pau's cinematography and Tan Dun's enchanting music make those scene so subtle, so delicate.This is an excellent DVD, and viewers may find it a good addition to their collection. At least in mine, it's a great item. The extras are very good. Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamlike and Fantastic","review":"Crouching Tiger was perhaps the finest film of the year 2000, and some have not seen it because it includes subtitles. Watching this film for me is like dreaming, the lyrical choreography and beautiful vistas only serve to compliment an extraordinary story about love and honor. The DVD edition of Crouching Tiger is anamorphically enhanced and contains some nice features, including commentary with Ang Lee, and two making of features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Martial Arts / Romance story","review":"This is a great movie. It reminds me of \\"Braveheart\\" in that it was romantic enough to take my girlfriend to the movies but then at the same time it had enough action to keep me awake.To me it is a very classical Chinese love story, very tragical mixed with traditional Chinese values and awesome Martial Arts scenes. Remember those Chinese movies from way back in the 70's that had the dubbed English delay by a second or two? and those awesome fighting scenes.... well, they caught up with this movie. It is absolutely artfully done. We'll be talking about it for quite a bit. I hope the same director and actors / actresses get together again for another one.Well done !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extras on DVD","review":"I reallly liked this film especially with the extra features that you get to expect on the DVDs. English language soundtrack --- nice. I do have to say that the commentaries on the DVD by the Director and the Screenwriter/Producer were disapointing. I would have preferred just hearing from Ang Lee - who sounds to me as a very intelligent person - but James Schamus's commentaries were excessive, cynical and just plain stupid. Avoid hearing this stuff if you actually like the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Zhang refused to become Chow's student in the movie?","review":"This is the hidden plot of the movie. Because Zhang admired Chow and his sword so much to a point where she actually fell in love with Chow. In ancient China, romance between teacher and student was forbidden as she knew it. That is why she kept refusing Chow when he insisted her to become his student and that is why she turned to become so mean to Yeoh. Remember the cave sence, where Zhang was bewildered. When Chow walked into the cave and found Zhang. She seduced Chow and asked him\\" Do you want the sword or me?\\" which really showed her lust for Chow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not take the oscar","review":"I have gone to see the movie based on critics and commercial reviews that the movie is a candidate for OSCAR (best movie). I was disappointed as it lacks most of the qualities. 75% or more of the time were scenes for people fighting with each other, where is the art or creativity in that? The special effects are good but that is it. I remember I saw similar movies when I was a kid for Bros-lee and other Karatte heroes, but these were kids movies, not ones that compete for the Oscar. The acting was very unnatural and poor. And there was this long flash-back that took about 30 minutes, in which I thought I was seeing another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Martial Arts Movie ever made.","review":"Chow Yun FatEnough said.

This is a B-Movie at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrilling Action, Boring Movie","review":"A sure case of jumping on the bandwagon once this movie came out -- many people I talked to about it thought this was a big shrug and an awfully slow movie. Pack all the extras on the DVD you want, you won't catch me buying it. After a painfully slow first half hour, we finally get a fight scene and the action is pretty great (although, some of the infamous flying sequences are over the top). Unfortunately, the action is always followed by more dialogue and story, both of which are wretched. How this movie, with its ... dialogue (dumb lines like \\"I will avenge my master!\\" over and over) was nominated for a screenplay Oscar is beyond me. If you loved it, buy it. If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to rent this first -- I and others I know were excited when this came out in theaters, but thoroughly disappointed by the dullness of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the f...?","review":"What is this? Why is Hollywood so enamored with special effects and in this case having people fly through the air. It all started with Matrix and now it's everywhere. In this movie people are flying from tree to tree and jumping over buildings. I mean if you can fly, you've pretty much mastered one of the things that has always limited man. I would think there wouldn't be much to worry about after that. I known the martial arts movies of the 70's were also unbelievable, but those were usually the bad ones and were described as such. This one got rave reviews from the critics and it was annoying to watch. Unless you like fairies flying through the air skip this peace of garbage and buy a true martial arts movie like Enter the Dragon or The Chinese Connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product does not match the advertised on Amazon","review":"I was very disappointed when I received the product and available subtitles do not match the advertised.

Bad voice dubbing, melodramatic acting, questionable plot, ineffective special effects(you can see the wires in a few of the fight scenes!), etc...The flying effects reminded me of the wretched \\"American Ninja\\" series. Me and my wife suffered through the entire movie. I found myself glancing at my watch wanting the suffering to end. The ending left us with a feeling of... that's it?!?!?I'm sure that many people will see this as a \\"Deep\\" and \\"Moving\\" storyline... that might be the 'trendy' thing to say but the movie is neither \\"Deep\\" nor \\"Moving\\". It is just flat out bad.

Here's a list of reason's to stick with american movies:- The sub titles!!!!- The extremely fake action scenes. The sword parts were okay, but flying, jumping from buildings, and walking on trees was a little to much.- There was NO PLOT. It was hard to understand what was going on, when there was no story behind it.So if you have trouble going to sleep at night, rent this movie. Believe me, I know!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Martial Arts Oscar","review":"I suppose if your into Martial Arts and Action movies you could give this one five stars. Plot is thin, probably because it would get in the way of the action scenes. The action scenes have to be appreciated for the athletic ability of the stunt performers, not for how they mesh with the story, most of which seemed to fit in like a comercial does when watching a movie on TV. I can't see, and will never understand why this movie ever got a nomination for \\"Best Picture\\". The fight scenes were so long I actually fell asleep in the middle of one toward the end. When I woke up, I never bothered to reset the DVD to see how the end turned out. The Cinematography, Lighting Design, Editing, Sound, and Sound Editing, Score were all excellent. These are the areas where most movies of this genre fall down; which is why this movie could be rated 5 stars within the confines of the category.

As cinema, the movie is flat. As an action flick, this film is dull. As an \\"artsy\\" film, this movie is superficial and empty. From the first... flight scene to the last ridiculous scene (won't spoil it for you, but it didn't fit the movie at all)... I love the way the film tries at the final few moments to play itself as a love story across class barriers! \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" does not even compare to other Asian films--- anyone who preorders this is a follower of the trends!

It was quite obvious that the actors were suspended by wires.Remember the scene in Superman the Movie, when the young Clark Kent races the train, well thats how bad they are...O.K. the cinematogaphy was of the highest level, but, just because it looks good does not mean it is entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life and I don't know how it won any awards.

I am a Star Wars junkie, but this movie rocks!!! It is better than Jedi and that abomination called the Phantom Menace. The acting performances are top notch, and it is a wonder that Michelle Yeoh and Zhi Ziyang did not get Oscar nominations. It just shows that Hollywood still doesn't appreciate fine acting, and chooses to nominate hacks like Julia Roberts.Anyway, the DVD could use some more extras on it. There is a nice interview with Yeoh and a good single overview of the making of the film, but I would have liked to have seen more about how the story was conceived, other than what we learn in the overview. I did enjoy the part about the music of the film. It was very interesting.All in all, I highly recommend this DVD.

It has special effects which aren't just amazing to excite the audience but very beautiful to look at. It has a good script and story line. It has a somewhat spiritual connection.

Angus Macfayden,who's apparently done better work, stars as the flamboyant villain Komodo, who has memorable lines like \\"does purple suit me?\\"There's plenty of exposition.

I can see that the people who made this film were inspired by Eastern philosophy (using the five Chinese elements instead of the four Greek ones) but this movie was just a total wreck. The one female Warrior is presented stereotypically, with flowers and everything. It was obvious she was just the token female character and nothing more, and the villain was downright laughable, and the whole 'virtue' thing is overplayed.

Often lauded albums, most notably Sgt. Pepper's should never have been described as ground breaking. Much like that eyesore of a Mercedes SUV in your neighbors drive, or the new restaurant that insists on putting fruit in dishes where no fruit should be, the word \\"trendy\\" would be far better suited as a descriptive term. Plastic Ono band, with a few evident exceptions where Lennon reveals himself as the self-righteous demagogue he was (but none the less a pop genius) seems far removed from \\"trendy' as we listen to stark and raw, confessional rock and roll; something all together missing from the bloated Sgt. Pepper's, and inconsistently appearing on the White Album and Abbey Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul baring","review":"i always thought john frusciante was the only artist who is brave and strong enough to bare his soul to the whole world., then i heard this album and it just amazed me, from the stark sound of \\"I Found Out\\" to the thrilling soul touching \\"My Mummy's dead\\".so if you are ready to see the naked john lennon soul, buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius, but Tough to Hear","review":"When the re-mastered version of the record arrived, I listened to it for the first time in years. It's still a gut-wrenchingly difficult record to hear: John was obviously in a lot of pain and feeling vulnerable. This time around, however, I was struck with the simple power of his voice throughout the record. His singing, always great, is at its very best here. The arrangements are spare and hold up beautifully.Nonetheless, it's a tough record to listen to, precisely because it is such a fine example of brutally honest reportage of pain and alienation. Almost always earnest is his songwriting and performance, Lennon is heartbreakingly so here. The inclusion of \\"Power to the People\\" and \\"Do the Oz\\" is distracting to me. I appreciate the attempt to give listeners something extra, but the original record is a complete package in itself and is marred by these two tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest work Lennon created","review":"With a maximum of 1,000 words, I can't begin to explain why this is the great work of art that it is, or why it means so much to me personally.I'll have to leave it at this-- rock music doesn't get any better than this. I'm not going to even make comparisons between this and the Beatles-- I think this album stands on its own.

He was agnostic, ultra-liberal, a bad father to Julian, a drug addict, and manic depressive. He was also brilliant.Despite it all, I truly miss the man.

I'm glad I picked this up a few years ago, and at 47 I'm finally able to hear it for what it is: a masterpiece. This was the height of John's creative output, and those who thought he might not be able to shoulder the burden of an entire album's worth of songs were wrong, wrong, wrong.Okay, now I think I'm ready to go back and reevaluate \\"Goodnight Vienna.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don' get it","review":"From a die hard Beatle fan...

As a result, he produced a lot of twaddle, became a goshdarn real artiste (hooboy!), and made a couple of decent solo records. Actually, Imagine is pretty brilliant. POB is decent, barely. I do remember, though, that this was pretty cool stuff way back in the days when I was an angst-ridden teen. Knowing what kind of dad and husband John was to his first family - can you say NEGLECT? - it's pretty damn hard to care about his pain. Then again, he was too wrapped up in being ARTISTIC AND DEEP to really care about his responsibilities. That'd be OK, I guess, if he'd just made a better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!","review":"Poor, poor John.

It was under a rock. My young mind was reeling, \\"What's a Plastic Ono and why is it under a rock?\\" Exitedly I took my lucky find home, anxious to discover what was on the tape. Being only 12, I thought that since it was a tape there must be music on it. Boy was I surprised! I returned to the field bright and early the next morning to put the tape back under the rock. That was 30 years ago, it's probably still there. I learned an important lesson that day about not second-guessing the judgment of others and I vowed never to tamper with the underside of rocks ever again.

Its so melancholy portraying Johns highest emotional output of hate, self-doubt, sarcasm and a longing for love. Here are a few examples of the emotional lyrics: I found out:- I heard something 'bout my ma and my pa, they didnt want me so they made me a star. Hold on:- Hold on John, John hold on its gonna be alright your gonna win the fight. Working class hero:- Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV and you think your so clever and classless and free, but your still f#*king peasants as far as I can see. Love:- Love is touch, touch is love, Love is reaching, reaching love, Love is asking to be loved. P.S. There is a track called GOD which suggests that GOD is a concept in which we measure our pain.

No remixing and no hiss reducing software; this is the celebrated team that brought us the Beatles remasters of last year. You feel like you are in the studio with John when he laid down these awesome tracks. Trust me, if you remember listing to this album way back when and the visceral reaction you had to it, the goosebumps are back. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a powerful album !!","review":"For my money, John Lennon's best solo album is Plastic Ono Band. It is so raw and emotional that you do feel a little guilty listening to it. This was a man dealing with the break up of the band he founded. In addition, Lennon was finally coming to terms with the death of his mother Julia and his father's abandonment of him when he was, I believe, three years old. I absolutely love the proto-punk sounds of Well Well Well and I Found Out. The lyrics are cathartic and amazingly open. Lennon strips belief down to himself (and Yoko). He wants to feel his pain and not mask it with substances or belief systems. What an album ! It's hard to imagine a current artist baring his or her soul like this. Of note is that, through all of the pain, he still celebrates Love. I love Imagine as well, but this is my favorite Lennon solo album because of the vulnerability and openness here. The production is also less pronounced and lets the listener feel the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"My husband LOVES this book.

My long-time favorite has been Ozawa and I also like Boulez very much. Once in a while I decide to try out a new version and I always start by listening to the last movement, which is possibly the pinnacle of Mahler's work. I have never heard this movement with such an utter lack of passion as Salonen conveys. It is just notes and surface prettiness. So then I tried the first movement, which should convey a sense of mystery and sometimes terror. That was completely absent.

Swenson moves her voice with quicksilver speed. Every note is articulated. I love the intimate way she caresses Handel's intoxicatingly lovely, \\"V'adoro pupille.\\" Caesar would have been utterly charmed.

Here, she seems detached, clueless and stylistically at sea -- neither her tone nor her phrasing conveys the luscious sensuousness of Semele's arias, and her Mozart is similarly bland and uncomprehending.

They're also handy for cleaning up mud splashed legs after walking through a puddle, wiping off sand after a trip to the beach, or any other times when part of your body needs a clean up. They are thicker than the hand wipes or baby wipes that come in pop up canisters. They clean off the skin without leaving a sticky or soapy type residue.

Annie Proulx kept me voraciously reading up to the final pages. I put most of my life on hold (and cancelled a few plans) to finish this gorgeous work of fiction. Ms. Proulx's incredible style of writing and fantastic postwar dust bowl imagery make up for her ocassional predictability and melodrama. Though I was disappointed with its unclear and stale ending, I loved the roundness of the characters and the device of the mail throughout. Also, who knew that there were so many different shades of white?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE read Shipping News instead!","review":"I picked up this book because I was so impressed and entranced with the Shipping News... I was sorely disappointed. Everything I enjoyed about the Shipping News (the lovely flow, the fully realized characters whom you grew to care about, the simple and clear vision) was missing from this novel. It felt fragmented, confusing, muddled... and I had no sympathy with the characters because they seemed rather one dimensional. I would hate for people to neglect reading the wonderful Shipping News because of Postcards (or because of the dismal and horribly miscast Shipping News movie - Kevin Spacey as Quoyle! What were they thinking?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prickly Proulx","review":"I forgot how much I really liked this book. After my, oh, sixth or seventh read, I have to say there is much to admire with just a few complaints. Proulx is unique and her characters are almost always hardboiled and flawed, her settings depict harsh landscapes and tough surroundings : that's her, that's what she writes about. She's a realist, but appears to hold up every detail for examination, every act for rehashing, and her details can become so overloaded that I have to back up and reread just to get the picture in my mind before I can go further. Her people are eccentric, you really can't \\"like\\" them perhaps, but you have to admire them. Here are folks you probably wouldn't want to have as your best friends, but that's what makes them such good reading. The postcards at the beginning of each chapter are a creative introduction and cleverly segue you into the action. If you're just beginning to read Proulx, this is not a bad place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak","review":"Yes, I know Proulx is an award winning author, but she just doesn't do it for me. POSTCARDS traces the lives of the Blood family, which early on becomes known mostly through postcards sent to each other. Eldest son Loyal leaves home in the mid-forties after accidentally killing his girlfriend. For 40 or 50 years he writes postcards to the family left behind, never with a return address. They can never let him know of the tragedies that befall the family, and the family never knows the real reason Loyal left home. Before this book I'd read Proulx's CLOSE RANGE, Wyoming Stories. I liked two stories in that book. THE BLOOD BAY, and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. Even with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, the movie was better than the story. This is something I seldom find to be true of any literary work that is made into a movie. Proulx is a very \\"descriptive\\" writer. A lot of people love her...I am not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just taste what you want; you don't have to clean your plate","review":"As much as I loved -- I mean, really, really loved -- The Shipping News -- I found it impossible to completely read Postcards. The first chapters were fascinating. Then about halfway, I started to lose interest. So I decided to browse it like a volume of short stories. The book is perfectly named, to describe what it is. Little pockets of stories. If you get bored with one, you can always just move on to the next one, or the one after that. That's what several of the characters did, so I gave myself permission to do likewise.A search of Google maps shows that there really is a place called Cream Hill, in western Vermont. It probably is every bit as hideous in winter as Proulx describes it to be. Nobody writes descriptive prose like her. You really feel like you are there.The character of Jewell, she is someone that I ached to know better. I'd love to read an entire book from her point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, but so depressing","review":"Proulx is an amazing writer, and I was deeply drawn to her characters. Having grown up in a small town in New Hampshire, the Blood's saga was a little too familiar-accidents, lost love, cold family relationships, and the loss of the simplicity of a past age(which was actually never all that simple). While I appreciated her talent, this story was just so bleak, that I had to put it down for days before I was compelled to pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Unengaging","review":"I bought this novel solely based on the remarkable, relentlessly original novel \\"The Shipping News.\\" As much as I tried, I was not drawn in to the plot, the characters or the atmosphere of \\"Postcards,\\" and I finally just gave up and put the novel away. However, I will eagerly await Ms. Proulx's future works, secure in the belief that even though she stumbled in \\"Postcards\\", she will ultimately write fiction as good as, if not better than, \\"The Shipping News.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tough Read","review":"After reading the book, I looked at all the customer reviews, and thought it was interesting that the one reviewer said something to the effect that the less articulate among us seemed to have liked it less. Well, I didn't like it,and I think I am fairly articulate. I appreciate the high command of the English language that Annie Proulx seems to have. In some passages, she is brilliant and evokes strong feelings (usually of darkness and unhappiness). She can create a scene like few others, but her books (and I've read all of them) don't come together smoothly for me. I had to try too hard to really enjoy this one. I don't deny her talent, she has won the Pulitzer Prize and got nominated for the National Book Award this year, but I dont think think I will ever waste my time with another one of her books. There are too many other fine reads out there that don't leave you feeling like you are going to fail the class because you didn't \\"get\\" the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family saga, dysfunctional, depressing","review":"I loved Shipping News. I can't make it to the end of Postcards. Everytime I pick it up and read a few pages I begin to think \\"Where is Prozac when you really need it.\\" Sorry. Just too depressing. I know she lays words next to each other with the precision of a skilled bricklayer with a pile of mismatched stones, but then all you get is a mismatched wall that makes your heart ache every time you look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written - hopelessly depressing","review":"I stumbled upon Post Cards while looking up Pen Faulkner award winners. I was very supprised to find this book listed here. The book starts our with a rape-muder and goes downhill from there. The main charater ends up as an old vagrant after a series of adventures. Life is hardly better for her other charaters. I find Ms Proulx to be a very accomplished writer and thoroughly enjoyed \\"Shipping News\\". It is a shame she had to waste her talents creating this saga of the Blood Family. In fact her skill as a writer makes the story more wretched. I can't help but wonder what Neurosis Ms. Proulx suffered from that enabled her to create this tale. If you are feeling guilty about having a good life and want to be punished, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with some others..","review":"this book just didn't do it for me.

I hated reading the postcards at the beginning of a new chapter to find out what was going to happen.I really don't understand the meaning of this book, but am glad for one thing. IT'S OVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...","review":"Proulx is like Faulkner for me... I know they are both brilliant writers, but I don't really get them. Actually, I thought I got The Shipping News, at least I really liked it, and I was enjoying Postcards until the end. I won't give away anything (unlike some reviewers, ahem) but there were far too many unanswered plot questions and character motivations. I felt sure we would be given some closure on the opening event, at least that we would find out more of the circumstances, but no, we were left hanging. That is only one example of many. I wouldn't say this book is a toal waste of time, but it is far from satisfying. However if you liked it, may I recommend Reflections in a Golden Eye by Carson McCullers. Same kind of thing, but more evocative in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitously nasty","review":"Annie Proulx' vivid prose took my breath away. She has an amazing ability with words--metaphors, similes--every sentence an artist's delight. That to me is the strong point of this book. On the down side, it completely lacks a single sympathetic character. The characters, particularly Mink, were for the most part brutes, cruel to each other, and especially to animals. Had there been a single case of tenderness or love for someone or an animal, it would have been more fully formed. Because I couldn't care about the people in the book, the continuous chain of disasters were not so much depressing to me as just gratuitously negative. I certainly wouldn't see the book as a lesson of \\"what happens when the family farm disappears\\"--so much as a chronology of the lives of people making profoundly stupid choices with little grace. I liked the Shipping News much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postcards","review":"Found it depressing and cumbersome. Finding the Shipping News just as bad.

Proulx's The Shipping News is one of my all-time favorite books, thanks to her remarkable gift for vocabulary and powerful character development. I missed that in what fragment of Postcards I was able to make it through. An utter disappointment if you're looking forward to an absorbing reading experience. I can't wait for her next book.

I had hoped that the story would become interesting.I agree with the reviewer that gave this book 1 star for its burn value. I give it 1 star because, unfortunatley, that is a low as you can go in order to give a review.I highly recommend the Shipping News, also by Prouxl, because at least it leaves you with a glimmer of hope for the characters.However, leave this one on the shelf, let it collect dust, unless you want to be deeply depressed or at best, put to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"If i could give it zero stars i would it was uninteresting from the start I could not keep up with the extreme numbers of new characters introduced every chapter till it reached the end one word to describe this book.

This slim volume contains more Christmas magic than a huge department store, all of it delivered with delightfully understated Highland humor, and (a gift from the author?) decorated with some marvelous illustrations. Looking for a perfect Christmas gift? Put this first on your list, it will suit all ages (and particularly a pet lover). And no need to wait for Christmas - the cool, fresh Highland air and Hamish's gentle spirit were even able to blow away the heat and humidity of June in Dallas.

The villagers are in an uproar and naturally our Hamish, the local bobby of Lochdubh, is called upon to solve the crime.

This is listed as the 16th book in the Hamish Macbeth series, which is always good, if not spectacular. Though none of the books in this enjoyable series are very lengthy, this one is an especially quick read. I purchased it for the Kindle and found it to be a pleasant way to pass the time. There are no murders in this one. Hamish is too busy trying to locate missing christmas lights and making a young girl's Christmas memorable. All the while, he find the opportunity to help some people rekindle (no pun intended, though I do love my Kindle) their Christmas spirit.I would rate this squarely in the 3.5 star category, but I give a nod to M.C.

I love it because it uses the same yoga and breathing techniques that I do in my adult classes, and once she is old enough, we can transition easily into mommy and me yoga classes together:) The menu is great for kids because there are pictures next to every chapter title, and she is able to call out which adventure she wants to go on.

The cardboard taste especially stands out.Don't food companies have something better to do than come up with expensive new marketing ploys that offer nothing in terms of good taste, not to mention reasonable value for the buck?Blech"},{"rating":"2","title":"Done it Again!","review":"I've read other Mapson books and this one is right up there with the rest. These people in this book are true to life and people you can actually see yourself meeting. Chloe is a great independent woman and Hank is a hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely couple find each other.","review":"Hank and Chloe are not the kind of couple who end up together, yet their attraction to each other is red hot. Hank teaches English at a small college and is very cerebral. Chloe waits tables and lives in a shack and is not too far from being considered a homeless person. Yet they meet and end up loving each other intensely. The author describes the range of human feelings and emotions using a deliciously flowing prose. This is fun in the love scenes but also painful when Chloe is harassed by police. This is a good book to read and then recommend to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This pad is one of the worst products I've ever come upon.I ordered two of these on Amazon because the price was pretty good, and I thought it would be fun to do some DDR again.One of the boxes came in a bad shape, it looked like it was stepped on and the sides were bent and damaged.I opened the package and inspected the contents, upon inspecting I happen to notice a small lever that sets the pad to player1, player2, or off.I touch the lever and it just falls off...OK, I guess it was during shipping that the pad got messed up.So I decide to try it out anyway, the receiver cannot recognize the pad if you move more than 2 feet away from it (thought this thing was supposed to be wireless?)The battery dock cannot hold the batteries in place, it cannot lock after putting the batteries in.Pad also lags... so what the point of this thing... nothingWill be returning this as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted but old hat","review":"This is a well made film but it is just another take off on the theme of the seemingly good natured person who insinuates himself into a person's life and then proves to be very dangerous. It has been done about twenty times in American films - Fatal Attraction being the beginning of a long line of imitators. Unfortunately, the ending never explains everything. Is Harry really an old classmate? Why is he obsessed with Michael? What is the big deal with the \\"flying monkeys\\" story? We will never know because this film doesn't answer these questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In usual Hitchcockian fashion, this French thriller is about ordinary folk plunged into sudden terror, but it speeds up and slows down gracelessly; peppered with a few murders here and there, it's just your average two hours of ennui. The first murder scene is so shocking (because the film has otherwise been so dull) that it really wakes us up, if only for the next ten minutes. There's a lot of useless filler material, like phone conversations of which we only hear one end, which in any case turn out to be completely irrelevant to the plot. There's none of Hitchcock's crackling tension, sexual or otherwise, to keep things interesting. Harry has moments of humor, but they are out of place and oddly disproportionate. With all of its boring mystery and emotional detachment, it feels at times like an amateur L'Avventura, with an added scene of Anna being brutally murdered on the rocks, minus the lyricism and profundity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, not another Hitchcock wannabe...","review":"This film was \\"hyped\\" as something wonderful and new to behold. Unfortunately, the movie I saw had little to do with wonderful or new. The photography was excellent and visually it was interesting. The plot, however, was the same-old-same old strange stranger, helpful stranger, is he really a stranger? theme. This has been done time and time again, and this film presents nothing new. This is not one \\"hip\\" (their words, not mine) bandwagon to jump on. Filming a dull, unfunny movie in French does not change the fact that its dull and unfunny. I was really looking forward to what the previews advertised...something mysterious. Alas..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is scarry","review":"~I love psychological dramas, especially taken from this french perspective!

I like the acting and the realistic dialogue between the young parents trying to deal with a life less than perfect, but ultimately theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD !","review":"Excellent French story about a murder !The performance of every actor is suberb, in particular that of the Spanish guy Sergi Lopez(Harry, our friend). this story is not as usual about murders.This film has a special kind of quality in many aspects.I want to mention as a remarkable fact, the song listened by Harry (the murder). This is \\"Ramona\\" sung by the Mexican Diva Dolores del Rio. It is strange but I love it ! This song is so ancient but I think it was a very good idea to include it as a part of the sound track. Congratulations !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitchcock wannabe","review":"This movie was too \\"in-your-face\\" to be a thriller.It lacked any finesse. It was not polished and in the end, I felt a little cheated.I have many of the movies done by Alfred Hitchcock & David Mamet. I find their movies well directed and have some genuine tense moments that leave you guessing what's going to happen next.This movie however is about as subtle as a kick in the groin. The acting is passable but certainly not as enjoyable as a Hitchcock or Mamet movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable film","review":"This film is worth the price of the DVD or the VHS.

He said this to me due to my everpresent need to see the latest foreign film released in the U.S. I thought that this film would be one of a few lone bright spots in a horrid summer of movie watching but it was just a bad as any hollywood thriller. The film wasn't poorly made so much as it was like any film student's script. The elements for a winner were present. The idea of the friend from college becoming obssesed, and the novel needing to be written, these had the trappings of a true and unique film but fell terribly short of the mark, digressing into common b-movie techniques to portray... what? The same thing you could see in any American film in the same genre.Certianly a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book by Bernard Ruffin","review":"\\"Padre Pio: The True Story\\" is a wonderful book.

The book, which is in mint condition, was delivered in a very timely fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Person","review":"This book walks the reader through the life of the Italian Stigmatist, Padre Pio. Padre Pio's life is not the only thing that is facinating. His miracles and living with Christ's stigmatas truly elevated this man to another dimension. Ruffin's additions to the stories of individuals who knew Padre Pio and who have been touched by him are wonderful. God can touch people in amazing ways, and Padre Pio was a chosen one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Excellent!","review":"Ruffin provides an indepth and detail look into the life of Padre Pio. He not only describes the Padre's life but the Capuchin order, Italian society, and the Catholic Church in the early 1900s. He ties it all together to help you better understand what Padre Pio was like as a human being and Friar.I have read several books on Padre Pio. This one is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I love this book. The book is very well written. It is written by a non-Catholic and it is very fair. I am currently going through a fascination with Padre Pio and what to know everything about him. He was a very holy man and I have learned a lot about what it takes for your soul to achieve perfection. If only I could achieve a tiny portion of the perfection of his soul. If you want to get a true historical sense of Padre Pio, this book is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fasinating","review":"i had over the years heard a lot about padre pio, but not knowing in depth his journey. the suject of stigmata i think draws a lot of people in to think about religion, sometimes in certain so called horror films not in the right way. this to me is another fasinating subject which in myself brings me closer to my faith. even if you are not religious in any way, but caurious about life and subjects in general this is a great read within its self. i had hoped for some colour within the book to make it really come alive, but overall i would highly recommed this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can be from any religion and this book is great.","review":"I got this book as a gift wanted to learn about this man that people talk about so much. You start to read this book and you can not let go, is very good. People may think that Saints have wings or dont have problems in this world and we learn that Padre Pio was a human, but a great human. If we can only try to be good and help people no matter what religion, color, or country we can make this a better world and Padre Pio made it better. This book make me think that we can all be good and that we have problems in this world but that we can make a difference in this world.The book is very easy to read and I learn so much not only about Padre Pio but about the human sacrifice and the problems that we all have to deal. Big 5 Stars for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"PADRE PIO THE TRUE STORY","review":"BERNARD RUFFING IS EXCELLENT.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Read","review":"Though at times, Ruffin is repetitive you walk away from this book with a glimpse of a true saint. You are given the good and the bad side of Padre Pio; how the Lord uses both in building up the Body of Christ...this book will stir you emotionally; witnessing the power of Christ in the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven is Real!","review":"This is a book that changes how one thinks about spiritual things completely. As \\"moderns\\" we find it easy to believe in \\"spiritual\\" things, but we easily divorce that from religion. When one reads this book, one's eyes are open to the true depth of spirituality and traditional Christianity. The author is not a brilliant writer, but his prose and research are exactly what is needed to tell Padre Pio's story in a straighforward and truthful manner.Yes, this book brought me back from being a \\"modern spiritual\\" person, to being a practicing Catholic again.Read it! You will be amazed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story","review":"Ruffin gives a very complete picture of Padre Pio's life.

Anyway, while I don't rank DVYV as high as Depende it still has some outstanding tracks. \\"Cara de azul\\", \\"Dos días en la vida\\", \\"La luz de tú corazón\\" and the title track show JdP at their finest, but not all of the album is up to par (I won't mention lowpoints).

Now I only wish they would hold a concert nearby so I could see them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Spanish Rock of the year","review":"I definitely think that Jarabe De Palo is the king of spanish rock.

The best tracks in this CD is \\"De Vuelta Y Veulta\\" and \\"Tiempo\\" but I also thik that \\"La Luz De Tu Corazon\\" and \\"mama\\" are very good. Jarabe De Palo knows how to rock, and I can't wait for the next album, even if it's too early to think about the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a creative reawakening.","review":"De vuelta y vuelta is my third album from Jarabe de Palo. The first one being \\"La Flaca\\" and the second one being \\"Depende\\". La flaca was off the charts, just phenomenal. Depende was good, but a weaker showing for Jarabe de Palo. This time with De vuelta y vuelta, the group sounds even less impressive than before. In all fairness to the group, there are some good moments in this album, but alas, they are short ones. Mama is perhaps the best song on the album, as for the rest of the songs the best thing they have going for them are Pau Dones' voice. Back to the drawing board for Jarabe de Palo, they are capable of doing better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when a bath isn't feasible","review":"Had seen this product used in hospitals - and it was perfect when a household member couldn't use a tub or shower for a week.

The washcloths are MUCH thicker and sturdier than even premium baby wipes, and two could probably do most of a child's or small woman's body. I might use these when hiking or in other situations where I'd be away from washing water for a while. I think they were designed for nursing home use -- a regular washcloth would be much more practical and inexpensive for at-home use.

This is somewhat classified as horror (perhaps because it's scary feeling?), which is usually not a genre that particularly interests me, but I did enjoy this one especially because of statements like the previous one.The narrator did an excellent job with the different voices, and he brought the lighthearted, scary, and all the other parts to life. I was a bit annoyed by Tom's continual insistence that he had no choice for things, but other than that he was an interesting character to follow.If you like audiobooks, I suggest you try this one in audio. Otherwise, I still suggest you give it a read because the author does a great job of knowing what readers expect and not always following that expectation so there is a real element of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great!!!","review":"Was a good thriller with tons of suspense.

Unfortunately I only had purchsed the first one so I didn't want want to leave the world of the Spook and his apprentice.The story is in a dark setting and really does keep you entertained. The moral of the story was awesome as well I love how it is set around a young boy who makes a few mistakes. Of course the Spook has to rescue him but still it was very enjoyable especially if you are waiting for other books to be released. I just wish it was on the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful writing, but distrubingly misogynistic","review":"I have only read the first book in this series (Revenge of the Witch) and so do not know if the not so subtle misogyny works itself out in later books in a more hopeful and nuanced way. While the writing is wonderful, the plot gripping, it would be unfortunate if young men (or women) were to read this book without an attendant history lesson from their parents. My 10 year old read picked it up but I read it first, then my 14 year old. We talked about how the book portrays women as at best mysterious and often evil, with male characters only stupid and manipulated rather than evil, or the heroes of the tale. Again, I'm hopeful that later books in the series do something to explain why it's only female witches that need to be locked in a hole in the ground as a \\"charitable\\" alternative to being burned at the stake. The book's writing and plot deserve five stars but as a book for children, its rating needs downgrading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magical entertainment","review":"I discovered The Last Apprentice because my wife worked on the costumes for the movie adaptation. For a few months our family life revolved around the characters and their (amazing) costumes.I really enjoyed reading the book. The author has built an interesting world where witches can be really evil and scary; and magic is a serious craft. I could tell the author has done his research in the field of magic thoroughly. Which means that the content is sometimes very dark (blood cakes, eating babies, bone magic)--I'm not sure it's appropriate material for a ten year old (as the back cover suggests).I found the prose to be at time curious; but it's part of the charm of The Last Apprentice, Revenge of the Witch.Great magical entertainment.Guillaume Wolf \\"Prof. G\\"Author of The Last Arakadand reDESIGN: reCREATE"},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling fantasy","review":"Excellent book, highly recommended but read the back warning.

We were able to get a lot of toys into it, and my daughter likes it very much. It is colorful, and I do like the extra touch with the leaf shapes at the top that give it the look of a tree. My only complaint is that there is just one, small piece of velcro in place to hold the two sides of the top together when it's closed. My daughter likes to keep it closed and likes to close it herself; but, because it's just one piece of velcro, she has difficulty getting it to stay closed, and I usually have to help her. I suspect that the velcro will not last long, and eventually I'll either have to replace it or convince my daughter to leave the hamper open. If there were just two more pieces of velcro to connect the two sides of the top together and keep it closed, I would give the product 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"no novelist he","review":"Professors are not novelists.

The author is an accomplished scientist who wanted to play with some speculations in a novelistic format. The result is a novel that is not worth reading, much less buying: wooden, predictable, awkward, and generally bereft of the qualities that make good fiction good. You can read a couple of chapters from your library copy then skip to the afterword, where the author explains his scientific hypotheses.

It isn't funny to anyone who doesn't actually know the author and it just seems like a pointless exercise in self-aggrandisement.Vanity publishing has that name for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug and tiresome","review":"If cringe-inducing teen prose is what you're in the mood for, I suggest pulling your old diaries out of storage.

Well, it's what we all can be bored by in our own","review":"basements, attics, closets, or memories. I gave up halfway through this thing because it is exactly what it says it is, no less, and, more significantly, absolutely no more. Believe the billing. If you want to read a bad teen novel, read your own diary, get bored after fifty pages, put it away, and spend the dinero on a tasty takeout dinner. Because there's no insight, humor, or interest here that isn't in the most banal journal of the most ordinary schoolgoer of the late 1980s. Too bad there isn't some creativity or imagination here. Then again, the movies have applied plenty of creativity and imagination to that period and generation already -- it isn't like there isn't more to say, but to do it again will take someone with a truly fresh approach and the intelligence to execute it with originality. That ain't here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, but basically it's garbage","review":"A friend who is a fan of Ariano's web site loaned this to me. I thought the premise was amusing, but the novelty of the idea wears off damn quickly, and I more or less skimmed most of it. I can't believe self-indulgent crap like this gets published when actual writers with actual talent have a hard time breaking in. The bottom line is: Sometimes an idea should just stay an idea; when it comes to fruition, you realize how lame it really is. Oh, well, I suppose Ariano got her cheap thrill, made 2 or 3 bucks and will now hopefully sink into obscurity.

Much of it reminds me of when I was in high school. And I have always loved the Ramones. Joey's death was traumatic and the movie means all the more to me now that he is gone. The kids in this movie do what many of us have always dreamed of doing-getting rid of the school and getting the better of the principal.

I was surprised they put music from Paul McCartney and Wings in their since Paul isn't even close to punk, but thats cool wit me cuz im a big wings fan anywayz.

Still, that's not quite enough to salvage this Roger Corman vehicle. Bad acting, lame script, cliched plot and forced laughs are what we see here. Somehow, this has acquired cult status. And there are a suitcase full of extras with many of the cast and crew congratulating themselves on having made it. In reality, this story had been done better before, and much much better since this came out in 1980. Three of the four Ramones are now gone, and this was their only film appearance, aside from documentaries. So, if you liked them - and I did not especially - then watch this for the music history. They were really weird people to look at. Maybe it's better if you're stoned, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie that pioneered the teen movies of the 1980's.","review":"I love watching this movie anytime I feel like watching something that is purely funny and simply entertaining. It would be viewed as a B-grade movie, which in all repects is the style of it's director Roger Corman. Rock'n'Roll High School is not a movie to wow you or even thought provoke you. It is a movie to be enjoyed as it is and to make you feel perky when you are feeling blue or bored with school. Must I mention that Joey Ramone is very sexy in this film? I love the Ramones and I love listening to \\"Teenage Lobotomy, Pinhead, and Rock'n'Roll High School.\\" The movie is humble in it's premise and sweet as a teenage comedy. Also, it is one of the few movies where you get to see a female nerd act heroic. Cheers! Rebbecca McGarity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - terrible sound!","review":"I love this movie. This is a great movie. However, the sound transfer on this DVD edition is terrible. It distorts horribly in any scene where the music gets even moderately loud and there is even an undercurrent of hiss and distortion in the strictly dialogue scenes. I have seen other reviews stating the same thing so I know it is not just my system. It is bad enough they probably should be recalled. In lieu of that happening I guess I am stuck with this version if I want a copy of one of my favorites.

This movie quickly became a cult classic with a following more culturally diverse than one might expect. While it is a silly movie, you can't help but like the characters and its stars, The Ramones. This movie shows Joey Ramone in his true character, seemingly barely conscious except while on stage. This is what The Ramones were like in concert, an experience I will never forget. Few bands have maintained their style of music over the years, but The Ramones are certainly one of the few.

There are some reasons to watch this film, such as the music, the terrible acting by The Ramones, and P.J. Soles. Other than that, the film is worthless. There are fewer things worse than bad comedy, and that's what this film is. Just because something is meant to be cheesy doesn't automatically make it entertaining. Many of the jokes in this film fall flat, and I just couldn't get into it. I kept wanting The Ramones to come back on and do some songs.

All the characters return from the first book and there are some interesting developments. Griffin also gets deeper into the characters and how they relate to one another. The book is mostly cloak-and-dagger OSS stuff with a few other plot developments thrown in.

Sound quality on all is quite fine, as is musicianship.Of minor concern are the occasional post-session production enhancements. For example, brass on \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" pans between channels, and with an added fraction-of-a-second delay there's a 'bounce' from left to right that gives the impression of twice as many blaring trumpets as there really are.

As always, Keaton's antics and sight gags are a hoot, such as when he tries, feebly, to bust his dad out of jail for socking McGuire, the ferryboat proprietor who's edging into his business. His expressive facial gestures here rival Chaplin's for sheer sad-clown poignancy.

This tape is also worth noting for the presence on it of a recently discovered complete version of the short Convict 13, one of the last missing bits of silent Keaton."},{"rating":"2","title":"holy culture great writers","review":"all of holy cultures and branches from their tree great writers like gospel gangstas grits priesthood and idol king are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicles: The Cross Movement","review":"Chronicles: Greatest Hits, Vol. 1This was the first gospel rap album I bought.

When I researched the artist more and discovered that he had collaborated in the year 2000 ad. - the millennium year of all years! - with \\"Maxx, Terry\\" I was nothing less than astonished. Maxx - for those not in the know (as if!!!) - is a man with a tremendous name, not content with an appellation that signifies the most, short for \\"maximum\\" I suppose, that he has to spell it with an added x. Added x for added oomph. Anyway, I believe Terry's a musician or something similar.The song's pretty good.

Maxx's vocals are a far cry from those which he employed on his chart topping debut single 'Maxx's Partee' and Funkstar couldn't hit a dj's turntable with a barn door.Not even the 30 second lute solo could save this abomination of a track.A big phat thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the hunt","review":"Gwynn's first collection is out of print, so you'll have to search around to find a copy of it, but it is worth it.

Sadly, she seemed to forget how to write her humorous and charming relationships along the way.Trying to do a dual romance in this novel was a mistake. Time was taken away from both relationships such that one loses interest in either one. That leads a lacking dramatic finale because you just don't care.The writing appeared exceptionally juvenile in places where humor was intended.It was a nice try and I applaud an author wanting to grow her talent, but this Clayborne series never should have left the editor's desk. \\"Come the spring\\" was half-baked at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard put to finish this book!!","review":"Julie Garwood has been my favorite author for years and I have all her books.

It took me a week to finish this one. As there were two concurrent romances described, the reader only got to know the characters fairly superficially.

Cohen shows himself to have been sympathetic to the Serbian nationalist-expansionist project even while expressing a veiled contempt for Serbs.

In the process, the reader gets glimpses of the life of blacks in the 50s as an uninvolved bypasser would - no passion but plenty of color, detail and objectivity.Unfortunately the plot never quite thickens enough.

Easy's humanity, his violence and his constant evolution carry the story. After the indignities Easy suffered and the intelligence that he'd hidden for so many years, it was thoroughly satisfying to witness him put a few white men in their places.My main criticism is really a pet peeve: If Easy were really from Fifth Ward, Texas, he'd never think or say 'the' Fifth Ward. No native, black Houstonian would--it's simply 'Fifth Ward.' Also, for some reason, I had trouble keeping track of the male characters. Of course the one man I kept hoping to see never showed.

We were careful not to pull on the ropesIt definitely has some weaknesses as well:I didn't have much luck with the paddles separated. I found them more usable as a kayak paddle, using the supplied connector. But that's still flimsy and ineffective. Pieces are interchangeable with other cheap Sevylor plastic paddles we had, and I've had to replace a piece. Pretty much any other kayak paddle will work much better, but not pack as small.The boat makes for a wet ride. I'm really too heavy for this boat, but even for lighter people in my family, I don't think it takes very substantial waves to get over the front. Getting out without getting wet is hard. It's also surprisingly easy to tip this over when getting in; the width is more like a wide kayak than a raft."},{"rating":"2","title":"JL - TYPE:ill US D-n-B","review":"Amazing... Truly amazing...

I have used this stand for at least four years and it still works as well today as it did when I bought it. For the price, this stand is easily the best value in trumpet stands.

The slight additional weight you'll carry around is worth it to have a safer place for your trumpet when not playing. The stands that are more stable than this one are too large and heavy to carry to rehearsals and gigs.In other words, this is the one to get.The legs on this stand are aluminum. A fellow player stepped on a leg and it bent; I was able to straighten it by hand.I leave it in the bell of a Schilke trumpet in an instrument case and it doesn't scratch the bell's silver plating.Avoid K&M;'s 3 legged version of this stand, as your trumpet can easily be tipped over with that obsolete design."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great trumpet stand!","review":"This is the best stand I've encountered for holding a single trumpet.

But he wasn't the bon vivant playboy as shown in the movie, he didn't have a long struggle to develop conscious, and most of the plot is supposition at best.

Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Schindler's list is a masterpice. Filmed in black and white, it delivers incredible authenticity to the story, but most of all intensity. And whenever the director wants you to particularly focus on a \\"movement\\" he would add some colors and depicts the dramatics instants to the fullest (the little girl in red jacket and the candle).The story of Oskar Schindler depicted in this movie (whether 100% correct or not, who cares) is breathtaking. He's a man aspiring for power and money, or at least that's what he thought he wants. Scene after scene, oskar schindler will turn to the man who saved the life of more than a 1000 human lives from Nazi's forces.This movie is fulled with little details, and you'll enjoy discovering them one after the other especially that almost everyone will watch this movie more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Humanity Amidst the Ultimate Inhumanity","review":"These images will endure for a lifetime and they should.

Disney's non-skippable previews take that prize. But here it is 2004 and this studio has *finally* released this epic film on an unnecessarily (GAG!) two-sided DVD packaged in (GAG!) cardboard. What's even worse than having to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the film is that the stupid DVD won't default to the DTS sound track. It's got that insulting message that assumes we consumers don't know what DTS is. And on my first viewing, I realized 75% thru that I was no longer hearing the better DTS soundtrack after the flip. That was so annoying it just ruined the whole experience for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanities can be found where Inhumanities thrive","review":"This movie shows us that even in such an insane rule, such as was Hitler's, that there were men of concience. Liam Neeson's portral of such a man was wonderful. Anyone who views this film and does not atleast feel their anguish, and his is to be pittied. I feel that even though the film showed the harshness of the treatment of people of the Jewish faith, that it was still showing it to us \\"kindly\\". I hope we never forget and are reminded like this film has so very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie of All-Time, A Masterpiece!!!","review":"This movie is a classic gem that is, in my opinion, the greatest movie of all-time!!! Liam Neeson does an excellent job in portraying Schindler, a German owner of a factory that saved Jews from concentration camps to have them work for him in this factory. Schindler slowly and gradually disnounced the war and what the Germans did to Jews as it went on. Schindler tried to save as many Jews as he could by having them work for him. This is a true story and the director Steven Spielberg makes that piece of history a movie masterpiece. Even the style of the movie is brilliant! The movie starts out with a color vision of some Jews sitting down to perform a sedar on passover. The movie then turns black-and-white to tell the story of Oskar Schindler. Throughout the movie, there are different color segment that express symbolism and harsh meaning. I do not cry during movies, I just don't. But this movie made me bawl like a baby at the end. Highly reccommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"We purchased this item for my husband's mother. When we open the package, the two movies had been shoved in backwards.

However, good film-making is not so much the assertion of a truth as it is the making of that truth more evident to us. I failed to see the humanity of Schindler because Spielberg just doesn't know how to portray characters well. He is good at canvas but not depth (eg saving p. r.) Watch The Rules of the GAme (1939) or Come and See (1985)- which has very similar subject matter- as well. This film should be viewed, but it is not surprising that it is one of the best films of the 90's considering that the 90's are cinematography's worst decade. Good- but not a masterpiece. Spielberg is just too Jewish to make a film about the holocaust. Someone more detached could probably make the Holocaust more relevant on film because an outsider would present the humanity of both sides- and thus show that any human is capable of atrocities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film-Appalling DVD","review":"What a huge disappointment finally getting Schindler's List on DVD has been for me.It was like going back to the late Nineties...A DVD with an added extra - an Intermission!!

I thought flip-over discs went out in about 1999?I waited ages for Schindler's List to get a DVD release, and then this dog's breakfast. I cannot believe Mr S. would have sanctioned such a thing had he had the power to intervene.My advice is to continue to watch SL on VHS without the enforced break.

I can see why, given the subject matter. I think this is a movie people are afraid to criticize publicy, for fear that they will be labeled anti-semitic or insensitive, and to say the movie sucked it like saying the Holocaust didn't happen. They're completely independent of each other. The subject matter in this movie is shocking and grim. But let's face it: this movie drags and there's very little character development. If this were a documentary, it would be one thing, and it would be far more powerful. But it's a movie: it needs to do something. It's obvious that Spielberg thought he could just recreate the Holocaust, roll the film and, voila, instant critically lauded film that no one would DARE detract from because of what it's about. Sorry, but you need to have a little more than that. This movie does not cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schindler's List","review":"This movie was dated but the story is moving it brought me to tears. The language was tough to watch at times.

A black and white masterpiece about a human tragedy. This movie put all those nay sayers in their place who said Steven couldn't make a serious film, especially one about the Holocaust. The casting was done to perfection with every character being truly authentic and totally convincing. For me, Ralph Fiennes was the brightest of these bright stars. He was the Holocaust personified with all the nazi's foolish racism and sick habits built into him. It was remarkable for me to see this film. Before viewing it, I had read about the Holocaust in history books and heard some of my jewish friends talk about it, but I really didn't get the full impact of what actually went on over there. If you are a seious movie fan or even just a casual one, or even just ignorant when it comes to this matter, I highly reccomend this. It deserved all the praise and every oscar it recieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting, mesmerizing, and much too true.","review":"This movie (which my mom told me I wouldnt like) is one of the most vivid, haunting masterpieces of all time.

Spielberg doesn't hold back to show the world the true horror that we went through during the Holocaust, and the unlikely hero that saved 1500 Jews from extermination. Starring Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, it chroniclizes the events that led up to Oskar having an enterprise to a haven that saved Jews. Ben Kingsly is his Jewish accountant that helps him through troubled times. It even shows Oskar trying to show Amon Goeth, a very brutal Nazi, what's going on and what he his doing is very wrong.

So the whole movie would have easily fit on one side of a two layered disc, otherwise known as DVD-9. There is just no excuse. This kind of decision was deliberatly made since you just do not see this kind of mastering anymore. Every major DVD since 2000 has been Dual-layer. This is bad, but don't blame Universal. Look what they did for Rob Cohens' Daylight, Dragonheart and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story. Top drawer DVD's. Not only should this have been a two disc set, with commentary, trailers, photo gallery, featurettes, and dynamic menus, it should have been $3 less that what I paid for it.

To package one of the greatest and most important films of all time in a cheap, non-sealing cardboard folder that provides totally inadaquate protection from dust and damage to one side of the two sided disk is simply disgraceful. Like others who have expressed themselves in this forum, I feel as though I've been ripped off.There, I feel better, but I'd feel even better if Universal were offer a free replacement package that provided adequate protection for the disk.One the subject of the disk, the transfer is first rate. I don't mind that the film is split (presumably so that they could provide the image quality they did), but I would have very much preferred that it be on two separate disk.

It couldn't have been any more blatant if they had white hats and black hats.What upsets me is that these are great actors under the direction of a great director depicting actual events which should be shown with the utmost realism.

To say anything else about this visceral testament to the Holocaust is cliche.Let me put it to you this way- Spielberg's mother was being interviewed about raising him and her experiences with his films. She was talking about this movie and what she felt was the most emotional scene for her. As soon as she mentioned the shower scene involving the newly deported Schindler workers, she cried so hard that the interview had to stop for a few seconds before she could regain herself.

Now that i have a dvd player. i want shindlers list to be a Dvd. That would be the most compelling dvd movie ever made. i want to see how they made it. I hope everyone votes for this movie to be realeased for dvd so i can get as soon as it comes out.

That was my main problem with the film. It was really hard for me to get past that. It really took away from the intensity of the film. Also, I think many people miss the point of the movie. It was not so much about the holocaust as it was about a man: Oscar Schindler. It is a wonderful story of a rather immoral, dispicable character metamophising into the savior of the schindler jews. The plot was very good and that it was true makes it even better. Over all Schindler didn't do much in terms of the scope of the millions who died. But 2000 jews he saved and their decedants his memory will live forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is not for me","review":"I thought this movie is just Oskar Schindler to help the Jews to get out of their country, but it is not.

When I saw that Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes were teaming up under the comic tutelage of Steven Spielberg, I must say that my hopes were high. It falls flat. The comedy is forced and tired and just not funny. Sure, I might have smirked once or twice, but mostly this is just not funny stuff. It's just not funny. If you want funny, I would suggest Richard Pryor movies or maybe \\"Bachelor Party\\" starring Tom Hanks before he started making unfunny movies too.

But one can not underestimate the immense contribution that Hollywood, to which this person is a dear son, has had in desensitizing people to everything that is human. \\"Schindler's List\\" a simplistic, mathematically melodramatic attempt to, popularize a subject that should not have been popularized at all.

If one is to question morality, then do so, but do not give us the black vs white issue found in this film.

Be it the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the cinematography or the music score. This film is simply masterful in all respects.It is a highly complex drama that touches many issues (heroism, moral choice, human nature among others), still it is never pretentious or didactic. It also manages to be a technically superior film without being jingoistic or self-indulgent. Despite its three-hour-plus length, \\"Schindler's List\\" never loses momentum and sometimes even succeeds in being entertaining as well.\\"Schindler's List\\" is really an exceptional movie. A film of rare emotional and intelectual power and impact. The only Spielberg-films that were even more commercially successful in Germany were \\"E.T.\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\". If Spielberg had never made another great film (which he made plenty of), we would have to call him a genius because of \\"Schindler's List\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Hauntingly Beautiful Movies Ever","review":"I have to say that in the seven years since Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg has yet to outdo himself. From the opening sequences of the Nazi banquet, to the final sequences of Schindler's Jewish workers today, one's eyes will be completely glued to the screen; not because there is non-stop action, but because they will be intrigued at how a Nazi that seemingly only had his mind on money (and women) would save the lives of over one thousand Jews from the concentration camps.Schindler's List is a touching epic that combines powerful acting with directorial mastery, not to mention the effectiveness of monotone for a documentary.

I glad that this film is finally coming to DVD, because it time to reeducate the public of the most horrifying time in human history.

Is there really any difference for Spielberg between running from a killer shark or a killer dinosaur or a killer Nazi? I don't think there is. Showing bad things happening to people and saying, \\"Here's a great holocaust movie\\" is so insulting.

For People who already have the VHS versions, you pay more money for a little better picture and sound and you get cheated on features. Instead of a great commentary or documentary you get more preachy propaganda Spielburg dumped onto the second side of the disc. I have a feeling that Spielburg wanted the film to be the highlight of the DVD and not the extras, but in my opinion, extras never hurt...especially if your going to price it like it has tons of extras on it. If you want to be emotionally, or spiritually moved watch the movie, you don't really need to see the lousy extras.

Is Spielberg implying that the mass murder of Jews in Auschwitz never happened? Probably not, but this scene can definitely be interpreted that way. The only conclusion I can come up with is that Spielberg intended to convey some form of relief for his audience, but since the gassings of Jews and other \\"undesireables\\" was pretty much the cornerstone of the Holocaust, it seems to me that he just copped out. Granted there were other scenes that were difficult to watch, but if he wanted to create an accurate historical document, by some accounts, he should've portrayed the unfathomable horror of a gassing. However difficult that might've been I'm sure the audience would've gotten the message.

Schindler is a womanizer that loves money and the finer things in life. He uses these perversions to befriend Nazis and leaders to allow the Jews to work for him. Oskar uses the cheap labor to produce cookware for the Third Reich. Schindler begins to witness the violent killings within the ghetto and wishes by the end of the movie that he had attempted to save more lives. The movie is black and white to mirror the horrendous acts of the Nazi's. The film ends with real Schindler survivors visiting graves.

The story that this movie tells is not only sad, but very powerful and gives a great account of what people had to go through during the Holocaust. I believe that this movie should be viewed by all high school students in history classes so they can get a semi-real feeling of what people went through during this awful reign of Hitler. I'm glad a DVD version finally came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Powerful Movie","review":"How can I describe this movie? Intense, horrifing, heartbreaking, incredible. This movie is all of these and more. The movie portrays Oskar Schindler, a German capitalist who takes advantage of the Nazi's use of Jews as slave labor. As the movie progresses we see Schindler (portrayed wonderfully by Liam Neeson) begin to see the evil all around him and his determination to do anything he can to save his workers. This movie does not cut anything-we are forced to watch the horrors the Nazi's performed on the Jews. Ralph Finnes as the horrible Nazi Amon Geth should have won the Oscar he was nominated for.

While our hero uses his gift to help transform the lives of those around him, in the end he too goes through a metamorphosis -- evolving from a detached, \\"lukewarm\\" Christian to one who is both passionate and compassionate. For the most part, this is a very enjoyable story. The author's writing style is simple and entertaining, the concept of the story is very creative and original, and the lessons from the story may well be universal. The only things I didn't care for in this story was the tendency to feel \\"preachy,\\" referring to \\"unsaved\\" individuals as \\"the harvest,\\" and the main characters' constant crying.

I got home and listened to all three and couldn't distinguish any tracks from each other. I was so incredibly...bored. And even then, I knew that was not rave music. Looking back on that purchase, I still shake my head in disgust.This was quite clearly put together but someone with little understanding of the rave feeling. I don't know about other volumes, but if this one is just so bad, it does not speak well for the others. On top of that, all the artists are just so bland. Who could possibly think listening to them was good? It's boring, mundane, and absolutely no heart.You want rave music?

When I bought the CD, though, disc 3 was in front and disc 1 was in back. I didn't really understand what that was about. And to make it more confusing, I think they printed the track listing wrong.

The author is making up scientific explanations to make this accessible for the non-chemist. I understand that chemistry can be a non-intuitive subject, but if you actually want to talk about \\"chemistry,\\" (see what I did there?) you need to talk about chemistry.

Don't use these things for podcasting or if you're recording with a sensitive (e.g. condenser) mic, because the sound bleeds right through the open backs and into the mic.However, the sound quality of these headphones is undeniably great and they are the best I've ever owned from that perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"After listening to many different headphones I settled on these.

They look stylish, the thin edge makes it a pleasure to drink from, and the glasses have a substantial and well-balanced feel to them. These glasses are a lot sturdier and more durable than they appear, but if you load them into the dish washer too closely and too quickly, they will chip/crack. Also, if you have hard water in your home (as we do unfortunately), you may start to see water stains and scratches in about 4-5 mos. A way to avoid this is to wash by hand.

But the performance is ruined by just one thing: the absurdly slow tempo for the first movement. This movement is the very heart of the symphony and Beethoven wrote it allegro con brio. Klemperer turns it into a plodding andante, destroying the lofty heroism and revolutionary verve that is inherent in the music. It is not only my favourite Beethoven movement but my favourite music of all and I cannot stand what Klemperer does to it. The funeral march is excellent, the scherzo just gets by and the finale is back to the plodding pace of the first movement. I cannot believe the kudos this recording gets when it flies in the face of Beethoven's express wishes. Klemperer's earlier mono recording from 1955 is far better as an interpretation, far more faithful to the composer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dissapointment","review":"I was really looking forward to receiving this disk when ordered. I heard some reviews that the playing is too slow, but I like slow playing, so I didn't mind. Nevertheless, this is far too much even to me. I simply don't have the patient to wait for the next note. I even find it worse than Guillini, who plays this symphony much too slowly, but at least makes the Funeral March masterfully.I still adore Klemperer for his Mozart symphonies, for his Fidelio, and many more.

Danny Joe Brown will not be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly Who?","review":"That is not the Hatchet that I once saw in New York opening for Boston. The performance is weak, there is only one original member, which is ok. But the lead vocalist is a wanna be, out of tune, he can't even whistle. Once thing is the guitar work is good, with two guitar, even thought the other guitar player hides in the back and very duet guitar happens. And the audience in Hamburg is not lie the one in USA. They are quite, and not enthusiastic. The singer wasted his voice screaming at the audience. Back to him, he can not sing the songs. Don't waste your money, but if you have never seen MH in concert and see some good southern rock music it's ok. The keyboard solo is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need to know","review":"A really excellent book and the best I've ever read on the subject.

They all marry British men and all suffer the ups and downs of uncertain fortunes. Jennie marries into the Churchill family and is mother to Winston. Her husband dies of syphilis and she will marry twice more and have countless affairs. Leslie marries into the wealth Irish Leslie family and bears 4 sons. Clara marries (for love) Moreton Frewen who never succeeds in any of his business ideas.I get that these were important people, but I could have done without the laundry-list name-dropping in every chapter. The book was over 400 pages, but could have been half the size, just as informative and twice as entertaining. I struggled with the last third of the book because there was no development of the women there. Plus, how many more money conversions (of that time to present day value) can one person take?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fellow Ozzy Fans: Beware!","review":"Upon ordering this CD, I figured it was an Ozzy/Iron Maiden tribute to UFO.

However, thus said, I don't think a person has to be a horsewoman to enjoy this book thoroughly. It is very insightful, it deals with many issues and topics dear to women, it makes one think. It is a very good read. I found myself not wanting it to end; loved reading about Theo's progress, and about her and the author's bonding. As an owner of more than 20 show horses and school horses in my lifetime, not to mention the 100 or so racehorses I have trained - now retired and \\"totally dedicated\\" to a Morgan mare with a \\"former\\" attitude, I could relate to every aspect of the author's encounters with Theo. I'm married, have children, grandchildren, a full life... but it would be life with a void without horses. This book is indeed about how horses touch a woman's soul. As a horsewoman and author, I give this book two-thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, difficult read.","review":"I don't understand all the hype about this book. It is trying to be 3 or 4 books at once. The most interesting strand is the memoir. That is sweet and reveals a life growing up around horses. But it also tries to be a poetry collection about horses and a quotable quote book about horses and a book of lilterary references to horses. I found all of those parts distracting and not very interesting. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive book,worthless reading","review":"I fell for the title of this book, I know the feeling! I MUST have bought it because of the title. I am a horsewoman. I have been all my life. I have enjoyed Mary's informational horse books but, I am am sorry to say this was a waste of my time. I kept reading it waiting for it to [draw] me in like the title did that never happened. I considered passing it to a horsey friend and instead gave it to the Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Doesn't fly","review":"I am not a \\"horse person\\" and only read this book because it was selected by my book club. I found it of little interest and was unable to make any connection with the author and her intimate relationship with horses. The style of inserting excerpts from literature, poetry etc in the middle of the text was distracting and made the text disjointed. Perhaps if one is a horse \\"nut\\" it would be of some interest but personally I couldn't relate and found all this emotional and spiritual attachment to horses quite annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythology Metal","review":"Here's a band that you should pay some attention to. With power metal bands now a dime a dozen, and most of them [junky], Virgin Steele have something. This is the kind of sound I look for in many power metal bands, but usually end up disappointed with. I'm not saying they're the best of the best, but they certainly hold their own. It's similar to Rhapsody but without the extreme cheesiness(unlike Rhapsody, you could feel half way comfortable playing this in front of friends). Virgin Steele has the whole narration bit to pull the story along, but it fits well. Unlike Rhapsody, you don't have to turn the narration parts down or fast forward in fear someone will hear it. Even though it's metal, it's surprisingly soothing(for me anyway). I really like the vocals too. And I've always been a mythology fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hellacious Metal Opus","review":"I was in VIRGIN stacking up on Power-Metal CDS and saw VIRGIN STEELE'S \\"House of Atreus Act 2\\" marked down to $8.99, so I checked the first song on the store's CD sampler...and immediately threw ALL the other CDS away, and bought HOUSE OF ATREUS.THIS is one amazing rock opera. Bold, classy, well-researched (based on the legends of Orestes, son of Agamemnon) with excellent lyrics and instrumentality. It's up there with Manowar's TRIUMPH OF STEEL, but Manowar is a bit heavier than Virgin Steele. The reason being Virgin Steele is a trio, and David DeFeis is principally a keyboardist. Even so, THE HOUSE OF ATREUS kicks ass in classical power-metal style with the keyboards adding flair and class to the album, not detracting from it. DeFeis also has a great voice and writes excellent metal lyrics. All Manowar fans and power metal fans in general should check out Virgin Steele!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Seibels","review":"I have about 10 or 15 pairs of Seibels in my shoe collection, but the Zina has to be my favorite. It is very stylist and I own it in goldish/black as well as red. Every time I wear them, I get many compliments. I find them true to size also and easily the most comfortable shoes I own. I have a fairly wide foot and wear a 7-1/2 or 8 so the 39 is perfect for me. I can wear them all day long and walk and stand in them. If I could only own one pair of shoes (oh -- horrid of horrors!!!) this would have to be my choice. I like the fact that they look just as great with a dress/skirt as with my denim capris. I am an internet shopper who looks for the best prices, and I have great success with Amazon. Usually, they are a good bet and the service is superb. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seedy, Sleazy and Sexy","review":"Christopher Mealie has put together a book of photos for those of us ( aging baby boomers ) who remember when lingerie, and / or bare breasts were as hot as it got. There's something about what you DON'T see that makes it all the more sexy.

However the accompanying items [ostensibly a teabowl, a whisk, and a packet of green tea] have not the remotest possiblity of being functional, much less authentic, within the context of the Way of Tea (\\"Japanese Tea Ceremony\\"). To begin with, the small size and rough material of the bowl render it non-functional for traditional whisking of powdered green tea; then the coarseness of the whisk renders it incapable of producing the marvellous frothy beverage that powdered green tea is; last, the packet contains a substance that shares not a single quality with powdered green tea -- a point which renders the first two objections moot.This gift set is a cynical rip off of traditional cultures and trusting readers. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?","review":"Quoting John Lydon there. It seemed appropriate.Well, I received this as a gift (perhaps a re-gift). But, it was still wrapped in plastic, unopened.

I feel really stupid for that now, because the book is small, doesn't contain most of the information that the general etiquette book has on weddings, and therefore isn't something you can use separately anyway. It's completely lacking on information, and so if you have to choose between getting this book or getting the general one and having some extra information about other things, get the general one and save some money.Emily Post's Etiquette, 17th Edition (Thumb Indexed)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book has all the information you need about traditions, planning, pulling it all off. Every tiny detail brides are supposed to somehow know automatically is here and is easy to find.Much of the book is geared toward people planning very traditional weddings - which I am not.

It took too long for the action to start and once it did, there not enough of it. I'm also not a big fan of one the actors that played in this installment but thank goodness that person had a small part.Resident Evil and Resident Evil Apocalypse were much better. I'd highly recommend those two movies. Sometimes it's best to quit while you're a head and that is what they should have done."},{"rating":"1","title":".... Rent it....","review":"I love the first Resident Evil. The second one is ok. This one is the worst one for me. There are some good action scenes, but nothing new or interesting. It's quite boring I think. If you're thinking about buying it, think twice. Rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better.....","review":"i enjoyed the first two movies, but this one is better. They hired a gooddirector for this one that keeps the movie flowing pretty good. The script keeps the action going at a nice pace and never gets boring.

I don't know, but I've been a Mila Jovovich fan ever since The 5th Element. Although a little short on story, maybe because it's been carried through 3 movies, but it definitely makes up for it in action.I agree with the \\"Stop rating the unbox service\\" review. Please only review the movie at hand. I had no problem downloading this movie on the 7th of Jan., 08, so I can't fathom what problems others have experienced. I also liked that I could start watching the movie before the download was finished, and it worked flawlessly, my movie wasn't ever interrupted, (however, people with different Internet connection may have a different experience). ***** for Unbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"added to our collection","review":"Husband and son loves these movies, hence the purchase.

I know a lot of people are complaining that the end of the movie is a huge cliff hanger, but don't worry, because they are making a 4th movie. And it is shooting right now, and should be out by next summer or fall. Okay, onto the real review. The story in this movie is pretty much just setting up for the 4th movie, but that doesn't keep this movie from being good. I really like this movie. I think the acting is really good, and just the story. So you definitely need to check this movie out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The one thing I can honsetly say that I did not like was not getting an explanation for what happened during Alice's time with the Umbrella Corporation.Also the notable absence of Jill Valentine or Angela, the doctor's daughter.All in all the movie wasn't bad,but it seems to leave more questions than answers.I would have liked to have seen Alice's powers progress more seeing that in the last movie she was taken away to a facility where she could master them better.Still,it was a good sci-fi horror action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great movie","review":"I enjoyed all the resident evil movies there were great, so this was a great movie, resident evil degeneration is comeing out, but this was a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps on truckin","review":"I liked the first and the second. The third did not fail me.Actually, I liked the 3rd as much as the 1st.Lot of mayhem, good effects, considering alot was done in daylight.My main issue was that it was way too short.The dvd has some good features regarding the making of the creatures, the making of Vegas, etc. Features that should be standard in a dvd, but alas are not.Interestingly, there were about 10 deleted scenes that averaged 1 minute each. If they incorporated these scenes into the movie, it would still run about 105 minutes. Too funny.But overall, if you liked the first 2, you'll like this one, and with the features, a solid bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun","review":"This was an awesome movie. It moved a little fast, but otherwise, it's great. I really enjoyed imagining the apocalypse themes and being part of the story. Iain Glen made it all worth while, as he always does.

Abilities that allow her to essentially destroy any number of baddies with a grimace.You don't need to have a literary degree to know that giving your good guy all the superpowers doesn't make for good movie watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this movie would become extinct.","review":"These movies have been very bad and are to be listed as \\"unhealthy Cult Entertainment\\". The director of this movie would not know a good script or cast if he saw one. Everyone looks clueless and wooden in the parts, and Milla Jovovich should find better movie roles to do then this. That is if Hollywood ever sends her a good script to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Return to Form!","review":"After the disappointing second movie outing for this console game, I was expecting the third instalment to be a disaster of epic proportions and signal the franchise's demise. Wow, was I surprised! This is a really great action movie. The set pieces are all cool. The way they further develop the character of the lead is interesting. The special effects and story both bring something new to the franchise.There were a few minor niggles: the Vegas location could have been exploited for more; the super zombies were a little easy to kill with a knife to the throat(?); the climax battle was a little short. But all in all, I'll enjoy watching this again - always the sign of a good movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extintion is Extint!! Boring!!!

I was wrong. If you are expecting to find a perfect book-to-film in this (or any other for that matter) then, you are looking for something that dosen't exist. It's not possible to take a book and make a movie that has the same level of detail. You just can't do it. That aside, this is a truly geat movie. For the 50's, the visual quality of the the film is amazing. Mifune and the entire supporting cast do a superb job in portraing the characters brought to life by Yoshikawa. I must say though, if you buy one film then you have to get the next 2 and watch them in succession in order to be able to truly appreciate the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"I was blown away by how realistic this movie is. You almost forget that you are in another culture and another century while learning about the early life of this samurai.

I highly recommend and will be watching more by this director."},{"rating":"2","title":"The equal of the Kurosawa films","review":"I hesitate to give very many films 5 stars, hence only 4 here, but I definitely feel that this trilogy is the equal of the fine Kurosawa Samurai films mentioned in other reviews. in fact I think they are superior to the somewhat overrated \\"Yojimbo\\" and \\"Sanjuro\\".I think that the packaging of these 3 films separately is misleading, it really is a trilogy, even more so than the Star Wars trilogy - there is little point to just seeing one.The greater time and space of a triple-length feature allows the filmmaker to give greater depth of characterization, and it is used well in these films.Some of the cinematography alone makes these films well worth seeing. Admittedly, the expense of 3 unseen films is significant, so consider renting them - and then return here to add them to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book! Better experience.","review":"I have read Musashi by Eijo Yoshikawa, and I can safely say it is my second favorite novel behind \\"Old Path White Clouds\\". I decided to buy all three Samurai DVDs to see how they compared with the book. While the films generally capture the essence of the story, they are far too condensed to do the book justice. Where is Jotaro? Jotaro was one of the most entertaining characters in the book, and he is barely visible in the movie. Also, this is a small gripe...but could they have picked a worse actor to play Sasaki Kojiro?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight on issues of law and religion","review":"This book is an excellent summary of the law in this area.

In federal court in 1985, Wicca became recognized as an \\"official\\" religion in the U.S. (See Detmer v.

Guys - these boots are great if you want some sort of retro-mod 60's fashion boot to wear with paisley pants but they are not men's dress fashion in the 2010's appropriate for the office. They kind of look like girls' boots as the toe narrows to a tip and whoa, these babies have heels. Euro-dress boot at best. They should call them something other than Dress Boot for USA.

I would think anyone believing they are recreating a 60's thing with these were never themselves fashionable in the 60's.

At any rate, these boots are perfect for DRESS occasions, and possibly can be paired with well tailored designer jeans. Note: Wranglers and Levis will not make the cut!

I wish there was an option to select less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of trash","review":"Just rented this movie and didn't like the movie. The film quality and sound is simply too poor. You can't understand what the people are saying when they do speak. There is so little speaking in the first place that it is difficult to tell what is going on. Its a movie you'd have to watch again and again to understand what is going on. Probably be best to read the script while you watch the movie. Truth is, if this movie was not directed by George Lucas than no one would watch it. Its not that original. Just a rip off of the themes from 1984 and Brave New World. You're better off buying those books and reading them then wasting your time with this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry.....","review":"Love Spielberg, but you'd be better off with Soylent Green or Gattaca in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THX 1138.. What's Wrong?","review":"If you are a fan of the original THX 1138, I think you will be surprised by the director's cut. Yes, it does have CGI in it, but most of it blends well and isn't as noticeable. Some of it is too much and seems to be added just for the sake of adding it, and the end scene where THX gets attacked by the dwellers is really fake and looks like a video game. Aside from the one bad CGI scene, this director's cut is very good. The picture is very clean and the sound is incredible on a home theatre. I'd give it 5 stars, but the bad CGI at the end, which essentially ruins the momentum that the movie has been building up to, is unforgivable, so 4 stars (3.5 if I could)."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas ruining his movies","review":"I didn't want to give this movie 1 star because the original version was phenomenal but the extra cg scenes Lucas sliced in are totally out of context and in bad taste with the film. Granted there aren't as many edits as the Star Wars massacre's but they're still there and they're horrible. Try to get a vhs copy and transfer it to dvd, even though most vhs copies are in bad shape by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Respect!","review":"This review is about the Blu-ray version of this film; not the actual film itself. In a word- crap! I'm surprised that the fix for playing this movie is for the viewer to purchase more memory! Hey buy me some too! There's NO reason this film shouldn't function on current bluray players! WB is too cheap to fix this problem; and as long as people are willing to not complain, WB will continue to ignore it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta Start Somewhere?","review":"Watch as more curiousity than anything else, between Lucas and Duvall and I'd never seen or heard of this. It was a bust. I think Duvall did an excellent job given the story and abstract nature of the story and lack of surroundings. Much of it was him and the camera or 1 other person. It is easy to see the interest in technology and its potential impact in future generations. He copuld propbaly remake this movie and do a far bette job with special effects and dialogue. I was sadden that Weismueller was a robot cop. I was hoping to see my old Tarzan or son of. You better be a fan, this was painful to get through but the ending was well done and probably the height of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown Problems with THX 1138","review":"It might be that some areas got a hold of bad copies while other didn't. I have no problems with my Disc. They both play as to be expected. I listen to George Lucas commentary and I also freeze the frame and rewind in several places to check out what he was saying. I do not notice any problems of any kind while I was doing this. So, I don't know from what source you got your copy but I would return them.I also like to point out that every time I have seen this film in the past I simply got lost. I could not follow it but when I finally saw it in 2.35 some of the scenes and the subtitles help to make since out of it. I also enjoy George's commentary because he mainly talks about the story and what he was trying to represent. This is an excellent film and I hope you all find a good copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAM-less","review":"After 3 exchanged Blu-rays of this movie (none of which would load), I finally discovered, thru other reviews, that the Blu-ray player's memory was the problem. I put a 2GB USB module into the rear USB port on the player, as suggested by said reviews, and it worked fine. This is such a wide-spread, recurring problem, that it is amazing to me that Amazon hasn't attached a note to this item warning customers about it. Picture quality is quite good, and it would have gotten 5 stars if it were not for the loading problem. By the way, the reason there is so much data on the disc is because they included 2 versions of the movie....1 with SOUND EFFECTS ONLY. What the....???????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"The what you would expect with Robert Duvall or George Lucas","review":"I watched this today for the first time. I am doing a bit of a Robert Duvall movie marathon and this was at my local library so I checked it out.It is a rather complex movie. I got the impression that the story was so complex that trying to put it on film did not do it credit. The acting was very choppy. Everyone spoke in numeric terms, always citing numbers. I guess that is utopian perspective of the future.Overall, not a good movie in my opinion. Robert Duvall didn't get the opportunity to really act in this movie and all the characters were so limited in development that it was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The souless THX","review":"At first it doesn't seem like this film has been as reworked as Star Wars.The original cut tells a far different story.The Director's Cut of THX 1138 has entirely recomposed shots and loads of brand new CGI enhancements(not to mention new color timing) that completely ridicules the film's original message. I had high hopes for both versions to appear on Blu-Ray, but am now resigned to keep my cherished Laserdisc.Do yourself a favor-check out the original 1971 theatrical version (available on VHS and Laserdisc) and the original student film upon which this is based."},{"rating":"2","title":"THX 1138, George Lucas first movie","review":"This is the first movie George Lucas ever did. It is about a man in the future where emotions are illegal and supressed by drugs. As he works at an android building plant he soon develops and interest in his female roomate LUH 3417. As there emotions secretly grow they soon start having a deeper relationship(intercourse). Both are soon arrested and put in jail. THX with the help of a friend soon escapes jail and is then pursued by the android cops of his time.After watching this movie and seeing that is is a rerelease it appears to me that there might have been some changes from the original. While the there was a story unfolding it almost seemed pieced together. This is George's first movie after all.That being said it is a good movie. The part where it really gets interesting is in the chase. The feel of the movie is kind of like a mix between the inside of the Death Star and Cloud City. All white, really clean but with lots of pedestrians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's jar jar?","review":"The CGI additions are on the level of pre-pubescent graffiti under a bridge, or doodles you might see on the inside of a jr high school book. They are poorly conceived hastily rendered childish outbursts, serving only to distract and cheapen the original structure.Replacing a rodent with a scorpion and putting wings on a lizard, throwing cgi monkey things, masturbater machines and a fancy fast and furious car chase into a once solid thought provoking sci fi film doesn't result in what I'd call a directors cut.I'm actually surprised Lucas didn't cgi some mustaches and eye-patches onto some of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"an astonishing debut !","review":"George Lucas' first film is a frightening look into a future where mankind is ruled by computers and kept in line with drugs. Robert Duval is incredible as THX1138, the man who breaks away from the system and discovers his emotions. This is a small but mighty movie and a must for all sci-fi fans !"},{"rating":"1","title":"THX 1138","review":"I couldn't get into the movie no matter how I tried, I think the Police state type movie is so cliched. The only police state I am aware of is communism(slowly getting there here) and Nazism which is communism's enemy yet it's close cousin(Read Liberal Fascism). the only cool thing about the movie is the car chase in the Ex-James Garner White Racing Lola-Chevy, other than that the movie makes no sense and is boring,I watched it because of my appreciation of the Misfits(We are 138\\"). Maybe I am too harsh and biased to see the movie for what it is a product of it's time with an underlying subtle yet clear propaganda in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um - why all the stars?","review":"Huge, huge fan of Robert Duvall but hard to suffer through a movie with no real story just the same. That said - I saw/heard some similarities between the effects in this movie and those used in Star Wars 6ish years later so that was kind of cool. Plus now knowing the origin of \\"THX\\" that is touted in the theaters.I am guessing that this movie got some stars because the only people that have rated it on Amazon would be those who are old-school geeks who would have liked it an remembered it. For any other contemporaries - I am sure it is loooong forgotten. I stumbled across it while looking for \\"Open Range\\" and my curiosity has been satisfied no need to even remember this tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"This has got to be the absolute stupid movie! As stupid has Amazon making one wriye at least twenty words when a few words say all that I really have to say. Yes, I bought it on Amazon but I rarely shop here and I regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses Potential","review":"This film had so much potential and really could have been a cut above the rest. However, this movie failed to grab my attention or clearly show a story line or even explain itself. If you have seen \\"The Island\\" then you know that movie borrows heavily from \\"THX 1138.\\" Similar to \\"Logan's Run,\\" but IMHO, not as good. I can't really place my finger on what is lacking, but I believe a re-make of this movie could really be excellent. Watch at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Objectivist Lucas","review":"Interesting if anyone who has read Ayn Rand's \\"Anthem\\" can see the comparison in these two tales. What is even more interesting, however, is the contrast of independence of thinking in Thx's view on life, compared to the concepts of destiny and fate that the Star Wars saga illustrates. Does Lucas hold that we are beings of fate, who's history is written for us, or that we are independent beings who's actions and successes are a result of a greater purpose?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas has the creativity of a...(add cgi creature here)","review":"Replacing a rodent with a scorpion and putting wings on a lizard, throwing cgi monkey things, masturbater machines and a fancy fast and furious car chase into a once solid thought provoking sci fi film doesn't result in what I'd call a directors cut.The additions are on the level of pre-pubescent graffiti under a bridge, or doodles you might see on the inside of a jr high school book.

It's ironic that someone who wanted to challenge the Hollywood establishment in the 1970's is now the epitome of that very thing. An interesting and difficult film though, so watch it and try not to let the spliced on images distract you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memories","review":"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out with my dad. One of the few movies I remember going with him. The car chase was burned into my meory. I haven't seen it since, and yet that chase scene remains with me. But it was the mood of the film, the use of light and shadow, emotion, sound, that makes it stand out for me. I was looking for it just last week and was disappointed it wasn't out. So I'm glad it's finally going to be released!I hope the director's cut makes it just like Lucas wanted it originally, and not with his \\"refined\\" sensibilities. I'd like to see it through his eyes back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like, SUX 1138","review":"this movie wasnt as exciting or interesting as i anticipated. especially for being such a \\"classic\\". if you want to see a very moving and interesting documentary about social control or govt influence, WATCH \\"TERRORSTORM\\". that DVD will certainly surprise you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I wish George Lukas will someday go back to make other movies like that.

I put it in my player, and it just freezes. I could let it go for hours but it would never play. There's no USB jack on the player so the trick mentioned in other reviews will not work for me. And to top it off, I managed to just miss the 'return window' for this item, so I can't even return it for a refund. What a pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new scenes are OK, with exceptions","review":"Obviously THX 1138 is a sci-fi classic and necessary viewing for anybody in the genre. If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth watching.I've seen a lot of complaints about the Director's Cut and edited scenes. I suspect a lot of that is just people griping about George Lucas again. Overall, I'd say the majority of the additions do enhance the film. The edits make crowds larger, the robot technology more convincing, and the factory look more imposing. If you can only find the Director's Cut, go ahead and watch it - it's not as bad as the Star Wars Special Editions.That said, there are a few additions that don't work well. The car chase was unnecessary and undermines the sparseness of the rest of the movie. Then, there are a bunch of CG monkeys near the end. I have no clue what they were doing there or why they were needed. And they looked fake.Overall, don't be afraid to try this movie out. You'll have to watch it at least twice to really absorb it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does someone smell something funny?","review":"Wow, this stunk; no tallent at all found here.

Practically the whole movie is boring, even the ending isn't a whole lot good. The girl should have had some hair, and not saggy breats. Movie stars are suppost to look good. There was one funny part though. Robert Duvall trys fighting with a robot, when his jimmy's hanging out. That would be so stupid that it's funny.That's all I can say about THX-1138. That's about all that happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"terrible! dialog non existent.

I tried it on the other 3 blue ray players we have in the bedrooms, It would not work on any of them. The blue ray player on my home theater was freezing anyway so I decited to buy an new player, it would not play on the new player either. So I returned the movie to Amazon and received a new one two days latter, I would not play either. This player had a wireless internet connection so I updated the players chip, it still would not play. Before giving up and Just for kicks I tried it on my laptop which has an HDMI port to hook up to my home theater, It played!! The moral of the story is just buy the standard DVD and sit back and enjoy tht movie, the Blue Ray version isn't worth all the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's wrong?","review":"First off, let me say that I love this movie. That is, I loved it when I saw it on tv in the early '80s and again on my betamax vcr. As for this new DVD release, my advice is to avoid at all costs. Besides the fact that the English subtitles kept turning themselves on somehow throughout the entire movie (at least on my JVC player they did), I had no idea when I purchased the disc that this \\"director's cut\\" has had new CGI effects added. For me they detract from the realism and pretty much ruined the stark setting of the story. $20 down the toilet. It's ironic that Lucas and co. have probably spent many hours and gazillions of dollars working on the new special (d)effects but couldn't spend 2 hours watching 1 copy of the actual DVD to see the technical problems with it.The future is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of movie","review":"I purchased this DVD on a recommendation of a good friend. I could not get into it. To slow a pace.

First off, I must say that I love the original version of this movie, but George Lucas must have been on some bad acid trip to rework this the way he did!!! Throwing cheesy CGI graphics into a movie from the 70's is a terrible thing to do (as we found out with the Star Wars remakes), especially when the movie is supposed to be stark and confusing!!! I did not realize that buying the \\"director's cut\\" meant that additional scenes were filmed with 2004 technology and added to the movie!! The additional scenes may try to help explain the movie, but just end up hitting you over the head to explain the obvious. The new scenes really do nothing to help the pacing or the point of the film, and end up giving away the ending and therefore pretty much ruining the film. I guess I will have to go back to my old cruddy VHS copy of the movie since it is 20 times better than this farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated...But Still Just as Great...or Better...Widescreen!!","review":"I really enjoy watching this film. Yes, it has been updated with some CGI, but most of it is very seamless. The restored widescreen picture and wonderful audio are beautiful. The extra commentaries and shorts are a fun and interesting watch. I saw it on the big screen a few days before the DVD release and it only made me want the DVD even more. Again...Beautiful movie! If you really don't want to see the CGI (Droid factory, Car chase, Shelldwellers, winged white lizard...) which I like for the most part, just buy the VHS, otherwise this is a GREAT DVD! Forget the single disk version and get all the extras on the double disc set."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont care","review":"when i was reminded that spielberg did other movies like films when seen maybe other two for six but then remember rem sleeps till time out of. someone sed so lok before leapfrog two time ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sci-Fi, lacks in dialog, Super images","review":"I liked the film, it's images and general story line in the \\"orwellian\\" gennre'.

I bought this DVD before reading the reviews, expecting it to be a digitally REMASTERED director's cut in the true sense of the word. Then while watching, and seeing the glaring CGI scenes, I realize director's cut in Lucas' vocabulary means 'anachronistic CGI enhancement'. Why does George insist on doing this? I think there needs to be a psychological term created to describe what he's doing, because it's just not sane. What's next? Digitally introducing a receding hairline on Ron Howard in American Grafitti? Maybe he could digitally add more scenes of Harrison Ford in the film? This makes me so mad, I'm gonna drop some money for a VHS copy of the film so I can see the original flick, unadulterated, unmangled, unface-lifted.Oh yeah, the movie and the background docs gets 5 stars. -3 for the digital enhancement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A extraordinary film.","review":"When I first saw this film on video it was the name of the Director - George Lucas - that really prompted me. But the film has a very impressive atmosphere and for the budget, simply goes way above the head of 'similar' films like the much bigger budget Logan's Run. A classic film - though best watched alone - girls especially will generally not like this movie - much like 2001 - A Space Odyssey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre but thought provoking.","review":"I watched this flick many a moons ago.

It was not a position which this reviewer necessarily was comfortable with but one which explains, and yes this book even critiques, that world which has been closed to us.

It wasn't high quality, but overall it did a good job portraying its characters and the setting, even with some cliches.The second book, Kinslayer Wars, is unfortunately very dreadful. The characterizations, particularly of Kith's brother Sith, seemed comnpletely off, the romance with the human woman felt forced; the villain selected was dreadful, and simply disappeared at the end of the book. Add on to that some low quality prose, a thread-bare plot, and a very disappointing ending, and you have this book.Part of the problem was that, after reading the first novel, I had high expectations.

He has a limited range and I FOUND THAT MOST OF THE TRACKS WERE OVERARRANGED. There really are much better talents with a cabaret/jazz slant. Draxl at 20yo is just too young to sing many of these songs with a convincing delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored stiff","review":"really, I listened to this cd and couldn't believe how lousey it sounded .Completely over arranged and unconvvincing stuff.A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real mysteries are why would anyone watch it or why was it made.","review":"Well...someone else's review convinced me to buy it, but I may be able to help someone else avoid it. It was silly at best, as the actors (a term loosely used) waste their talent and time as they sleepwalk through this film before going out to kill their agent for getting them into it. It is meant to be light fare, but it is so poorly written and acted that the humor of the farce becomes pathetic rather than witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I had the Hollywood style lights in my bath (builders choice, not mine!) and couldn't wait to take them down.

I have been a fan of Sodom for a long time and of much of the old school German metal scene. I did not know what to expect of the performance, as I have never seen Sodom (I live in the US) and I did not know what to expect in terms of production quality as often these can be obviously low-budget affairs. Not this one. Great performance, and informative history.Even the videos at the end are really entertaining and refreshingly artful and even funny. Definitely a cut way way above most DVDs aimed at the metal market.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are into Sodom, you must have it!!!","review":"Great adquisition. Sodom is something unique as a band and as a figure. Watching this video explains in some ways why. The documentary is very interesting and the live music is great.

One disc very interesting and the other powerful live performances that becomes a must for a Sodom fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was aight","review":"The mix for this recording was horrible. It sounds like a bunch of noise, but kim did a pretty good job. The band sounded like the were in \\"everybody solo mode\\" which is unacceptable from prime musicians like sput, calvin, natural and maurice. the backround vocals were horrible, horrible, horrible, oh and did i say horrible.

Nothing more,nothing less.Too many egos in the house that night. No true worship or ministry. Just playchurch. Kim was a hot mess too. Watch the DVD.

If you're a musician, then you'll really feel this one (as far as music and beats are concerned). However, a singer wouldn't necessarily get into this CD. She can sing and all, but there was just too much going on. The backgroud vocals were flat (particularly the one singing soprano) and turned up too loud. Actually, this recording was not polished like it should have been----SHAME ON YOU TOMMY BOY GOSPEL. I like about 3-4 songs on the CD. Kim is annointed and all, but I think this CD would have gone over better if she would have recorded it about 4 years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this either.","review":"It sounds like the lead singer (Kim), the backup singers, and the band are all in different keys. If you have an ear for music, this effect will definitely make you cringe as if you want to reach into the radio and get them all on the same key. CD for sale!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"This CD was poorly produced and it sounds as if Kim,her band, and her background singers NEVER rehearsed together. The video for this recording was equally horrible and this CD should have never been released.

The novel, Power of One is an amazing epic of a man's coming of age. This movie is Hollywood's exploitation of this amazing book. I was nervous to watch the movie from the start because the images in the book were so clear and colorful. I saw nothing in this movie that even represented what I read. People were in the movie that were not in the book. The events did not happen the way the movie shows. I believe that this is a misrepresentation of the book, The Power of One. I was ashamed of the movie's message. This is not the story that this author wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely emotional film","review":"One of my favorite films. The Power of One focuses on key aspects on freedom, love, ideals, friendship but also on sadness and loneliness. Its the story of a little english boy growing up in segregated South Africa, fighting against life and misfortune until he finds that great unjustice plagues the African people. A myth, as they say, will accompany the dreams to unite South Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of One","review":"I had the Audiobook, which was terrific, so I thought I'd watch the movie. It was somewhat different than the book (no girlfriend) but enjoyable nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"enjoyed this movie tremendously, cannot believe that I had not heard about it before. I also bought the book because I was doing a report on the movie. Read the book first. I watched the movie because that is what the professor wanted, but I liked the book better, more detailed. would recommend either and/or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real tear-jerker with a history lesson","review":"I first saw this film in the theatre, having snuck in after another movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I have probably seen it 30 times since (no exageration). This film gives a history lesson about apartheid in S. Africa while the story line alows you to fall in love with all the characters. Combined with rousing African songs (some of which can be heard in more recent movies), this is a riveting although violent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother. Read/Listen to the Book","review":"I wish I hadn't watched this. I just finished listening to the Audio Book (which is WONDERFUL!!!) from Audible. The movie is an abomination of the Book. I can normally tolerate book-to-movie dissapointment, but in Power of One the plot is completely changed! (Where did Maria come from??? PK's mother didn't die! etc etc etc). They changed the names of major characters for no reason, left out some of the main characters, and switched the order of most of the happenings in the plot. I know changes are required for making a movie, but this was ridiculous.The novel, The Power of One, is a wonderful story; exciting and moving with great characters. Maybe if you've never read the book you might enjoy this movie version - but it certainly is NOT the story that Bryce Courtnay wrote.This was my first paid \\"video on demand\\" experience through Amazon, and I must say that it went flawlessly. I'll definitely use the on-demand service again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not watch this movie","review":"Under no circumstances should anyone who has read the book see this movie. I cannot think of another adaptation that ventures further from the plot, depth or quality of its original work.The book is up there with Mockingbird though. Amazing work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment after the book","review":"I recently read The Power of One and was blown away by the moving and triumphant story. One of the best books I've read in the last 5 years, hands down. So I was eager to see the movie rendition.Shocking let-down. Huge, important sections of the story omitted; central relationships between characters not explained; and worst of all, the movie has warped the \\"message\\" of the book towards apartheid, vs. the book's message of individual achievement and triumph.The movie story is hollow, confusing, and unbelievable. If you read the book and are excited to see the movie, rent it - do NOT own. You will be sorry.(One major plus, however, is that the soundtrack of Power of One is amazing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same story?","review":"This is yet another one of Hollywood attempts to bring Africa to the people who don't care and don't understand its complicated nature. The book was amazing and if you loved the book, don't buy this movie. There are no words to even begin to explain everything they did wrong with this one. I can just say that I am glad that they kept PK a boxer and did not turn him into a hurdler. One of the biggest dissapointments was that they totally forgot about the guy who actually introduced him to boxing. Funny how this movie teaches you to Hate those Afrikaners! Where the book was about understanding for all. Just a thought! From a true, proud South African!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD AT ALL!","review":"I loved the book, The Power of One. It was one of the best books I have read in years. Powerful, gripping...fantastic in every way. I couldn't wait to see the movie after enjoying the book so much. What I found was a movie that (for the most part) had nothing to do with the book. Characters' names were changed, the plot modified...oh what a disappointment. My wife, having not read the book, enjoyed the movie. I couldn't sit through it. It was so modified from what I liked about the book that I left the room and went to another room to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"After having read the amazing book, I thought it might be fun to see the movie. I knew there was no way anyone could come close of covering all the material the book has to offer, but I still thought it would be interesting to see how the parts that were covered were portayed.The story in the movie has been changed so drastically from the book, there was no need for the producers to purchase the rights from the author.Having read the fantastic book, that I would highly recommend to all, the film was drastic, however I find it hard to believe that even those who haven't read the book could find the movie even moderately entertaining.I watched the whole torturous episode then threw it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all Like the Book!","review":"I ordered this DVD after listening to the audio version of the book and was highly disappointed! It was basically a shell in comparison and very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the book","review":"If you've read Bryce Courtenay's book, you will hate the movie. It is nothing at all like the book. It deviates so much from the story that Courtenay told that it is almost completely unrecognizable. If it wasn't for the fact that the movie title and some of the characters have the same name, I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be the same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy of the great book","review":"I can't imagine anyone being able to adapt \\"The Power of One\\" into a film.

I could not even finish the movie it was so bad and distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screenplay very bad adaption of book.","review":"This has to be one of the worst adaptions of an excellent book ever made.

Apparently the girl comes from the sequel to the book, but I don't know why they put her in this movie...

Read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I think that this is one of the best movies ever! It has a good historical contex, and isn't doring. The movie is great to express to children what was going on during the segregation age in South Africa (RSA)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I've ever seen.","review":"The movie \\"The Power of One\\" is more than just another four-star drama. (I'm not sure it got four stars, but I'd be outraged if it didn't.) It's in a class by itself. It dispels any thoughts of movies being used just for entertainment or shallow, short-lived inspiration. The movie conveys the message of our very purpose on Earth - to promote the welfare of humanity by ending suffering, and we must do this through the power of one. When many individuals unite to promote the welfare of humanity, the power of one is achieved. The quality of the movie is not sacrificed for the purpose of conveying the message. Anyone thirteen or over should see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie that does its book justice.","review":"Well, I want to say, I read the book first. As happens many times with me, I didnt actually know there was a movie. I read the book (and its subsequent POWERFUL sequel, Tandia) by Bryce Courtney, only to find out they turned the book into a movie. I meet this with skeptisism as I have been burned this way before. However, to my surprise, the video does a great justice to book. They are very similar, however, the video will only whet your appetite. around 40% of the book is left out of the movie, some of these parts significant. I seriously reccomend that you get the video, AND the book so you can do youself the best favor possible. And do yourself another favor while you are at it. Get the book 'Tandia' and read what happens after. You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Powerful and Filled with Hope!","review":"I watched this film in 1992 and to this day still remember its powerfully hopeful message and its hauntingly beautiful music! It still remains on my 10 list of all-time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and impeachable","review":"By making a white kid into the hero of the struggle against apartheid and the Messiah of the African races this movie reveals that behind its fell-good anti-racist message there lies something much darker: the unspoken assumption that blacks can only be saved by a heroic white man. On top of that the plot is almost unendurably silly, full of easy cliches and ridiculous situations. This is shame, because the cinematography is excellent and Morgan Freeman and John Gielgud deliver, as usual, very solid performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"rough but effective","review":"Very good movie but a little tough to take at times.

I tried it in two different DVD players and it would not play at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth and beauty in the Power of One","review":"I grew up in Zambia, Southern Africa and so perhaps I love this movie partly because of my background, but I think that this movie is excellent beyond that.This movie shows some of the truest beauty of Southern Africa, the stunningly beautiful scenes of PK and Doc canoeing on the river with elephants bathing nearby. The score only adds to the movie with some of the most breathtakingly beautiful African music I have heard in a long time. Each time I hear it, it takes me back... I really think that it accurately captures the feeling of Africa.The movie may not follow the book, but that is not the point. So the movie is different from the book, no problem. The movie is aiming at showing racism for the ugly beast that it is and showing how just one person can really make a difference. Being different from the book is not a bad thing in this case, as the movie is powerful nonetheless.This is one of my favorite movies and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"I read the book, the original 500+ pages, before I saw the movie. If there are parts of the movie that you can't figure out, like the waterfall, you need to read the book. It's a great story and there is more to it than boxing. There is action, adventure, love, racial discord, courage, love of learning, sadness and joy. I would suggest that anyone, teen or adult, give the book a try. Sorry, the movie doesn't even come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"WOW! I have seen this movie so many times I can't keep count anymore. It is a griping story that covers the begining of the boys life with great detail, while keeping you up to date, never leaving you behind. It is a nerative so you can follow the begining easily. If you haven't seen it yet, all I can say is that you are missing out on a wonderful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid journey through the mid-century South Africa.","review":"The history of South Africa have never been told in such a living, colorful way.

However, if you have read the book...I think that this movie is absolutely terrible as a follow-up. There is so much more in the book and so much more action and so many more twists and turns.

Like most books made into movies, however, this film is so different from the book that they are almost two stories with the same title set in South Africa.I like using the movie when I teach the book, only because students are so unhappy with the movie and we can select the book scenes that SHOULD have been filmed instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANYONE?","review":"I saw \\"The Power of One\\" a few weeks ago in my history class.

It's so unfortunate that it's marketing was bungled when it came out in 1992, because the story, the acting, the direction, the soundtrack and the script are all superb.

I have not watched it, and I don't plan to. The description was enough for me. I don't think I would mind so much if PEEKAY's (NOT PK) mother hadn't died in the film. This doesn't make sense because she has a major influence on the rest of the story. If you are going to watch this film, do me a favor, and read the amazing novel by Bryce Courtenay. His account of Peekay's journey is wonderful. Also, once you are finished reading The Power Of One, read the sequel,Tandia.

When I first saw this movie, I could hardly believe what they'd done to it. The characters of Hoppie Groenewald and Solly Goldman were either cut completely or twisted. The drama of Barberton was erased. And who is Maria? Embellishing a character for a movie is one thing, but pulling one out of thin air is outrageous.

It was tough, reliable, didn't leave holes in my pockets, and was just a great pen to hold and to show off.And while it worked it was a charm, I took it with me everywhere. However it has one major drawback, and that is the pocket clip. After two months of having in my pocket, the clip broke off, and unlike other pens/pencils, that means that the entire device is useless. The pocket clip keeps holds the tip in place when in use, and hides it when depressed. Graphite would not come out of the tip after the clip broke.It is a good thing I still carry cheap bic pencils, some have withstood nearly a decade of use. This is a shame, because if it was more durable the Pentel Graph Gear 1000 would be perfect. Come on guys, at least give me a years use for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mercedes of pencils","review":"As an archaeologist, a sturdy, robust, and precise drafting pencil is an important tool to have in the field. I have used the .5mm Graph Gear 1000 for three years now, and could not be happier. I'm ordering another one now so I can always have one in my pocket and one in my field bag. The only problem I've had (and this is probably specific to mine and therefore not representative) is that every couple of months it will freeze up and the lead will not advance. I'll tinker with it for a while and eventually it fixes itself. Again, the quality of this pencil far outweighs the occasional breakdown, so I'm still giving it 5 stars.

The lead easily got jammed and was not gripped properly, even at the beginning of a shaft of lead.2. The eraser diminished quickly. Although you can push the eraser up to expose more of it, it would slip back into the lead clicking mechanism every time you needed more lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"I say i'm a little disappointed on how heavy this is, and how it fits in my hand.

It is incredibly solid and feels good to hold. I very much like the retractable tip, it makes it a lot safer to put in my backpack so that it doesn't damage anything in the backpack and it protects the tip nicely. The tip retraction mechanism is a bit noisy though.My only complaint is that it came with a really gummy bar code sticker on the barrel that was very hard to clean off. I don't really know why it needed this sticker but it may take some gasoline to get the residue completely off of the barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastes Lead and Very Uncomfortable","review":"Once you get down to about the last 1/4 of stick of lead you are using, the tip fails to hold the lead in place (so that when you try to write, the lead is pushed back into the pencil). This forces you to waste 1/4 of every stick of lead - which is not only an annoying inconvenience, but also is expensive. This should not happen for a 15 dollar pencil. Furthermore, although many may disagree, I found the pencil was exhausting to use because it was so heavy and unbalanced. Thus, looks and nifty features aside, this pencil fails at the most basic functions of a mechanical pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging was horrible.","review":"I received this as the pencil thrown into a large manila envelope with the small bubbles walls.

The amount of lead it pushes out every time I click it is always perfect. I lost one (I bet someone took it) and I immediately purchased another one.One thing I have to complain is lead may get stuck at the tip. It was a pain to disassemble it and put it back together.

Note: the downloading wasn't illegal, since even encouraged by the site, but was prohibited once they issued this DVD set. Unfortunately, despite the hefty price for 2 DVDs, only a handful of all production diaries are on each DVD; these easily could have fit on one DVD. Moreover, no pre-production or post-production diaries are on the DVDs. The only reason to get this set is if you're into marketing chotchkies which, though hokey, are creative.

My complains? It's way too dumbed down, first of all, they condensed the whole epic of Baldurs Gate II and shrank it into a book the size of an Enid Blyton storybook. Lots of the amusing quirks and plots I loved from the game never made it into the book, Minsc especially, the author wrote about him but just dumped him halfway through the story. It's either the author's a lazy !^(&^ bum or he didn't have time to write it all. I'm going for the former. Not to mention, I don't think the author even played Baldurs Gate II or even knows the story of Baldurs Gate II, it's so different from that of the games.

From my point of view there is nothing to complain, because the novel is easy to read, easy to translate, the words and phrases are easy, not taken out of the blue... but that's only one side of the coin. Maybe it's easy to read, but doesn't force reader's mind too become strongly involved. The plot is very simple, sometimes even lacking, on every step it is visible that this is the novelisation of the computer game and such books are not the artworks of literature. I recommend this novel only to the most devoted fanatics of the game and for those who read everything with the \\"Forgotten Realms\\" logo.

The characters were dumbed-down, the romance plot was sickening, and the events were poorly connected. The whole point of the book seemed to be stuff as much gore and \\"romance\\" in as possible, who cares about plot! It was de-evolved to such a degree that the only things happening were what you would expect to see in a book from a 99 cent sale bin. Which is where you'll probably find it.

However, i later picked up this novel just to use as bathroom reading, it seemed short enough.The author sure left a lot of stuff out of the game, which would have probably made it a better book too. The romance with Abdel and Jaheira was still really lame (but atleast it didnt make me laugh like Baldur's gate one did though,) and Imoen, seems more like a plot herself then an actual character. If you want to read some good fantasy/adventure, try novels by RA Salvatore or Cunningham. For a truly submersive BGII experience, play the game and dont read the book, it gives FR a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surpassingly Poor Adaptation","review":"Athans tries everything in his limited repertoire to save this bastardization of an epic story. Among his 'hooks' are gratuitous violence ([...]) and Lesbianism (Imoen and Phaere) but nothing can disguise the fact that Athans writes like a grade-school English dropout. His comparisons are overwrought and clumsy, his pacing is non-existent. This is Bulwer-Lytton material.I would like to emphasize that the problems with this book are not related to the differences between the game's story and the novel. It's common (unfortunate) practice to give a novelization author (ghostwriter) just the facts, and those facts can change during development.If you'd like to read some quality game-to-book fiction check out Mr. Gaider's maiden effort.

They look stylish, the thin edge makes it a pleasure to drink from, and the glasses have a substantial and well-balanced feel to them. This 14 ounce size is a pretty good volume for those times when you need ice, like with lemonade or a soda. These glasses are a lot sturdier and more durable than they appear, but if you load them into the dish washer too closely and too quickly, they will chip/crack. They also have a tendency to tip over in the dish washer due to the higher center of gravity, so load carefully. Also, if you have hard water in your home (as we do unfortunately), you may start to see water stains and scratches in about 4-5 mos. A way to avoid this is to wash by hand. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would buy more when the time comes to replace any broken cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased! :)","review":"I ordered 2 sets of these highball glasses and 2 sets of the matching 9-oz rocks glasses. One of the rocks glasses has weird ring patterns in the glass but since I had 11 good glasses, I didn't want to go through the hassle of exchanging it. Other than that issue, my family and I are very pleased with these glasses - we've used them for about a month so far. They have a good weight and feel (not too wide, easy for small hands to hold) and the weighted bottom makes it more difficult to tip over a glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised","review":"These glasses met all of my expectations. They look nice, they are not fragile (my clumsy girlfriend has certainly knocked them around quite a bit), and they hold a lot of fluid. One of them did get swept from the counter on to our linoleum floor and shattered into a thousand pieces, which wouldn't have been that bad but it was full of water. I don't know if the glass hit the floor at a weird angle or not, but I would recommend these glasses as they are inexpensive for the quality and pleasing to the eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and short.","review":"This clinical neurology book appears intended to help someone transition from the 2nd year med student-level to about 4th year student or intern level.

Yes, it's big.. but I liked the scoop for the toys, the holes for air-drying, the ability to hang things from it and the fact that it can hold the baby wash. But, like many others have said, it will not stick on the tile. We have smooth tile in the bathroom. I installed Mr. Frog and was happy with him... until he came crashing down with a loud boom and bangs as the soap fell. I was home alone with the baby and it scared me badly.

It is attached to the side of the tub with the supplied suction cup piece. About once a month, I come in to find it in the bathtub with all the toys dumped out because it doesn't stay stuck to the wall very well. Finally, last week it fell and the toes on the frog knocked a hole in the fiberglass tub. For the time being, I was able to buy a kit and repair the hole, but I'm sure this will be an issue when I go to sell the house. I know I'd be concerned purchasing a house with a broken tub.

My husband put it up and of course didn't read the instructions, i.e. the wall wasn't cleaned, wait 24hrs, etc. He just slapped it up there and it has stayed. Our shower is a regular fiberglass tub surround so it's very smooth, no fancy tile here so maybe that is helping it stay put. It is about half full and most toys are light weight. We do have one heavy toy that stays out and I am not going to test it out so that one stays by itself. I am very pleased with it and love scooping and rinsing the toys so easily. I will post a picture too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product if you are creative","review":"I loved the idea of keeping two childrens' toys, soap, and misc. items separate and organized. The plus is that the frog does that. The negative is that we couldn't get them to stay attached to the wall.

We have had no problems since then with them staying on the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not stick!","review":"We unfortunately bought this before reading the reviews. We followed the directions perfectly and it fell off within 10 hours. So we are going to try what another reviewer said, double sided sticky tape and see if that works.

So, I bought it anyawy thinking I was going to beat the system. I was slightly horrified at the size of it when it arrived, but proceeded to install it EXACTLY as instructed. I waited the suggested amount of time plus 12 hours, and put Jumbo Pod on it's mount, put a few toys in it and hung a little scrubby ball thing - not a lot of weight to say the least. Wasn't it exciting when the thing crashed down in the middle of the night causing the dogs to bark, our 17 month old to scream, and us wondering if we had been shot.Tried the suction cup thing.... Oh well.Now it sits in our hallway because Mommy is a dummy and threw the box away.

I followed the directions to the letter. Checked and double checked that I wasn't crossing any grout lines. (I'll admit I thought the others who said they'd had problems had not REALLY followed the directions like I would.) The bracket hung on the wall with nothing attached, but within 72 hours of hanging the frog and basket with foam letters, the entire household was awakened at 2 am as it crashed to the floor of the tub. So the stickie tape attachment gets a big fat zero. I like the concept so much I am debating on screwing it into the wall or finding a better adhesive at my local hardware store. (Hence the 2 stars) Currently it still holds toys while propped against the wall next to the tub. I attach the scoop after the water has drained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but good luck getting it to stay attached!","review":"This thing was a waste of money.

It's cute,large and not an eye sore. I was nervous when I read some of the other reviews about it falling all the time but I figured I would give it a shot and if it didn't work just return it. Mine came with the suction cups and from day 1 I've used it without any problems. My kids love it and it's a fast and easy clean up after every bath. I do not load it with heavy tub toys nor do I use the shelf to store soap bottles and shampoo. Maybe that has something to do with it not falling. It suits our needs just fine and I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great in small shower.","review":"We have a 3/4 masterbath and have been using the infant tub in the shower.

That's where the excitement ended. The first time I took a shower it fell off the wall with a loud crash, spilling the toys and shampoo all over. What a mess. I still was not ready to give up so I bought more double-sided tape and secured it to the wall again. A few weeks later, when I was downstairs I heard a loud crash. Sure enough, it was the stupid frog. When I called my sister to ask if she had problems with hers, she related the SAME type of story.Needless to say, I donated it to the recycle man. Let's hope they are able to melt it down and make something less worthless!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I really like this, it works great for bath toys and there is a little shelf for shampoo which is very handy and you can hang things of all the toes of the frog. Plus the holes in the scoop are really nice to rinse the bath toys(like getting all the bubbles off). The reason I didn't give it a five stars is because the suction cups are not that great, it always fell off eventually and good thing there were several ways of attaching it otherwise I would have returned it, you can either use the double sided sticky tape (that's what I did) or you can screw it in which there was no way I was gonna do that to my tiled shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large, but useful","review":"Honestly, I didn't read the measurements before placing my order and was rather surprised at how large this frog actually was when I received it! It's pretty big, but it serves it's purpose. We have it secured to our glass shower wall (shower is right next to tub), and it seems to be working for us. It holds all of my sons bath toys, as well as his shampoo/soap. I do like that it is made from safe, durable plastic, which prevents much (if any) mildew buildup. The detachable \\"back\\" is great to scoop toys and my son loves when I fill it with water and it flows over his head! Overall, I would say that this is a good bath product to store all of your bath essentials!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its huge!","review":"Luckily we have space in our bath for this frog but it is HUGE. I was kind of shocked when it arrived. Also, its just a big piece of light plastic. Seems very over priced for the quality. I also ordered the suction cup bracket so we would not use the sticky tape and that worked great. I just wish that it came with some toys (for the price it should). Its just a hunk of plastic with nothing else. Not sure it I would have ordered it if I had the opportunity to see it in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bath toy organizer!","review":"The frog holds plenty of toys and even has a nice shelf for products. Doesn't hurt that it's cute too! The scooper with handle is nice so when you go back 2 hrs later after getting baby dressed and in bed and the water is cold and gross you don't have to put your hand in it! We didn't have any problems getting it to stay on our shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Not Recommend to Anyone","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this item. I followed the directions word for word for installation via suction cups. The frog was attached to the base for somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes before it fell off onto my 6 month old daughter, who was in the tub. Luckily she was not hurt, just very scared. After this experience, while I understand that Boon will send me new suction cups, etc. if I request it, I don't want to risk traumatizing her again (although I'm sure it was more traumatic for me than it was for her, she got over it pretty quickly). I don't even want to give it to Goodwill for fear that it will fall on top of another baby. Nor do I want to drill simply to hang up a $[...] bath accessory. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute frog, but a no-stick here","review":"This was given to us at our last baby's baby-shower. It was cute, but didn't stay up more than a week. Wasn't even that loaded. I wouldn't waste the money on it - I was surprised to see the price and would have never spent that much money on it. It now sits collecting dust, just waiting to be put in the recyling bin. On second thought maybe the scoop can be used in the baby pool???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy if you have slick tile walls in your bathroom","review":"I bought this because it was the only cute solution to storing my son's bath toys but I went through 2 back plates (with the stickers on them) and each time it fell off. I did everything that the instructions said but it never worked. I think it is due to the texture of the tile in my bathroom. I then bought the suction plate and it will only stick to the inside of the tube and not wall so it is not ideal. Once the tub fills with water the frog comes down. It is really a shame. The manufacturer needs to come up with a solution that will work for all tile types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stay","review":"I bought this item in the hope that I would finnally have something to put my children's bath toys in. I tried using both the suction cups and the adheisive. I followed the directions and made sure to clean the area with alchohol and waited the recommended time for it to dry. With the suction cups as soon as I put the frog onto the holder it fell down. With the adheisive I had not even attached the frog pod itself to the wall attachment yet. I was still waiting the 24 hours for the adheisive to stick. But from one evening of everyone taking a shower/bath it fell down. Plus I was trying to attach the frog pod to the back of the bath as far away from the shower as possible. This product did not work for me at all.

It now sits on the floor in my bathroom until I can return it. I already called the company once and followed directions given to me by their phone customer service representative . . . they sent me new adhesive and even a new suction cup device they are trying now, but it fell even faster.

It has three different ways you can hang it: drill holes in your wall (who wants to cause that much damage?), use suction cups (honestly, how well will that hold them) or with sticky glue stripes. I have found that the glue strips work great. It works best of course if it hangs up where the water isn't going to get to it so that makes it too high for the kids to reach on their own but that's alright.Overall this product has turned out to be great. It allows the toys to dry out between baths and is a fun bath toy too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy cleanup and cute!","review":"my son never really had too many bath toys before this because they were such a pain to lean over and pick up one by one. now that we have gotten this he has a ton of little squirt, letter, and other bath toys. this frog allows such easy clean up! you simply just scoop and the water drains itself out. i also use it to hold all the wash rags, this flute set that hangs by a string all to the frogs toes. ive never had problems with it falling. putting it up was a little challenging because it uses 8 suction cups and aligning them all straight is hard because one might get stuck and you have to rip it off and try again. all in all its worth it. my son even started using it to cleanup without me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great and adorable storage, but won't stick to the wall","review":"I followed the attachement instructions EXACTLY and even waited the 24 hrs before hanging anything on the attachment piece before using.

Thank goodness no one was in the tub (especially kids) when it happened.Fortunately the attachment piece also has 2 screw holes and we will be able to attach it more permanently this way, but it needs to be done properly in order to avoid moisture problems with the screws and the holes created in the tiles in our bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing this on the tub wall makes me smile!","review":"After reading numerous reviews where people had trouble with this pod falling off the wall, I bought it with some trepidation, but it has been great.

I am surprised after 5 months that thing has not budged and can withstand extra pressure.I was prepared to use the screws if necessary, which I didn't. The screw in procedure is not as bad as I thought and could be filled in with basic tile caulk if you should ever remove it in the future. You do not screw into the tile, but in between the tile."},{"rating":"1","title":"very sad to return this item","review":"This frog is adorable and I wish I had read the review about writing to the company for extra adhesive before I returned it.

I, like others, read the directions twice, followed them to a T, did not put the rest of the pod on for MORE than 24 hours to make sure it was done curing, and it still fell off less than 12 hours later. I do not know if it is a manufacturing defect or if it only works on some tile and not others, but there needs to be an alternate method of hanging it.

After purchasing it, I followed the instruction to mount it on a clean surface, let it sit for 24 hours before loading it, and only loading up to 10 lbs on it because we were using the adhesive version. I came home the other day and found the frog fallen into the tub. I am very disappointed that this product did not hold up to the standard I expected of it. Now I'm finding out that although the adhesive is not that expensive, the shipping is twice the cost! I do not live near a store to do in-house shopping. I have to rely on shipping. ACK! This does not bode well with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless...","review":"I followed the instructions carefully and gave it an extra 24 hours to dry. We never had a chance to load it up with toys (although it didn't look as if it would hold much). The frog crashed into the tub while I was bathing my 1 year old. Luckily she was not hit, but that was the end of the frog. Since drilling into the tile is not an option for us, we gave it to a friend who was willing to drill holes. Now we just put her toys in a large plastic slated basked & leave them in the tub when we are not using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT STAY DONT WASTE MONEY","review":"At first this did stick but after a couple weeks we had to re-stick.

Our first frog pod did not stick (we had it over grout lines). I called Boon who were very professional and accommodating and then sent out new stickers, and gave me a warning about the grout lines, as well as sending me anchors and screws to secure it to the wall! We were very careful about how we cut the stickers this time but again after three days this poor frog was on it's back, in the tub with toys strewn everywhere. We made sure not to overload it, only light foam letters and numbers. I am at a loss as I love this product but we hadn't planned to make the long-term commitment to the Frog Pod of drilling it into the wall! As other reviewers have said, it's sturdy, useful, well made and very cute. However, if it doesn't do the one thing it's supposed to, maybe Boon need to go back to the drawing board, or buyers need to steer clear until this annoying problem is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I thought this was the cutest product and I was so excited to order it for my son.

I had registered for one so I was super excited when I got if free. Anyhow, it is studry and looks really cute, but it is really useless. it doesn't hold much and the stickers nor the suction work well. I think drilling a hole in your shower and using screws would have been the only way to make this contraption work well. It fell down ALL the time and it is LOUD when it falls. I didn't use it very long. I ended up freecycling it about 2 months after using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this system","review":"I had read all the concerns about this sticking, so I wasn't surprised when it fell after two weeks.

She cleans up hertoys at the end of every bath to store them in the frog. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Hassle","review":"This Frog pod was so cute and so practical for our small living space that we decided to get it for our baby daughter.. we followed the instructions perfectly, we have 4x4 tile, it wasn't stuck to a grout line, we left it to cure for longer and once the frog was in place we added a few items, very light items.. after a short while, maybe a few hours there was a loud crash.. we knew what it was, and I'm happy it didn't wake our baby!I can't even imagine what would have happened if this fell while she was having a bath!!! It's not worth our time to call the company and get replacement adhesives, we aren't drilling holes in our tile, it's going right back to the store!There's going to be a few dissapointed people during the holidays, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cute, Won't Stick","review":"As you've heard from numerous others, this thing doesn't stick. Our shower is completely smooth - I guess it's fiberglass. I followed the instructions exactly. About 12 hours after putting the frog pod up, it crashed down. Nobody had bathed or showered in there in that time - it just worked itself loose. All it had in it was one bottle of shampoo.I'm going to try to find the Command high-humidity strips like another reviewer suggested and will update here if they work.The frog pod itself is very cute and seems to be high quality. But if it won't stay up, that's not good for much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"Doesn't stick.It stuck for maybe a couple of weeks w/ the suction cups, then crash in the middle of the night.

Not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as other reviews","review":"Great at scooping up toys. Holds a lot of toys. Looks great. Falls off the wall at 2 am and wakes the baby up. The sticky on this thing is HORRIBLE. I guess you could go get gorilla glue and affix this thing to the tile permanently, but I'd rather have something that I order come complete instead of having to fix it when brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is HUGE","review":"While a great product it is huge. To get it in our tub we would have to drill it in. This is not feasible. Super cute and great idea, would be better if they shrunk it down a bit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute product.","review":"This is a really cute product, but it's kind of large. It's nice to have a designated place for all of our son's bath essentials, and the scoop is useful for gathering all of his toys and rinsing them off. I also like that it can be removed completely from the wall if more space is needed in the shower. This makes it easier for guests using that tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRASH in the night!","review":"We bought this frog pod and put it in our little girl's bathroom. About 4 months later at 2 in the morning, my husband and I were jolted by a loud crash. We looked all over the house looking for the source of the noise. It wasn't until the next morning that I realized that it was the frog pod that fell off the wall (the sticky tape stopped working I guess). This product is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Could never get this to stick on the wall, very disapointing.

It is huge! I don't know anything else about it because we never used it and gave it to my sister-in-law. We have a small tub and it was way too big to try to put in there. So if you have a large tub I'm sure it is wonderful, but don't buy it if you have a small one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, but huge and doesnt work on uneven surfaces","review":"I bought this item looking for something to hang in the tub. I didn't like the net versions. I had wanted to install it in the tub so the toys could drain and they would be easily accessible. Unfortunately it doesn't mount to a curved tub at all so I had to mount it to the wall and put a towel under it to catch the draining water......bummer because it is very cute and better looking than the other options out there.....at this point it should just get a wire basket and put a towel under it. Ohhhh well!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but does not stick","review":"I give this two stars for cuteness and for the practicality of it...IF it would actually stay on the wall. After a week or two, our frog took the plunge. We were using the self-adhesive strips. The suction cup option did not work at all. I followed the instructions to a T, but maybe this does not work with the slightly rough textured tile in our bath (the kind that is supposed to look like tumbled marble) since from the reviews it seems to work for others? I didn't want to drill into the wall, so I gave it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy Holder!","review":"My son loves this and at the end of bathtime, it is great to be able to put all of the toys in there and allow them to drain before you hang it back on the wall. Great product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick - Careful if you have small tiles","review":"We got this as a gift, but I would not buy one for myself. Its great idea - the scoop is wonderful for snagging all the toys at once. Except we can not get it to stick to the tub. When it falls off - inevitably in the middle of the night - it wakes everyone up with a very loud crash.The suction cup version worked ok, but does ultimately fall off (like, after a week). Double sided tape worked better for longer (a few months), but we have small tiles and as a result, that ultimately came off too. Second round on the tape and same story. After crash number three, we had enough \\"nightmare noise wakeups\\" and gave up. We now use the scoop as a scoop, but keep the toys in a a mesh bag instead that hangs over the side of the tub.That said, we get some use out of it, so its not a total loss. Still, not worth $20+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Bath Toy!","review":"I gave the Frog Pond to a friend who has twin girls. She felt it was the best thing ever invented for the bathtub!

I followed the directions exactly for using the stick tape but it fell off a few weeks later scaring the pants off all of us. It seems random as to who this product sticks for and who it doesn't, I wonder if it has something to do with the relative humidity where you live? We live in FL and we put it up in August, who knows. Anyway, it seems to be a gamble if this product will work for you or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it won't stick it doesn't matter how cute it is!","review":"Same problem as many others have noted - we hung it up and it stuck for a few days maybe even a week or more. At some hour in the middle of the night it came crashing down and woke us all. Since then I have tried to reinstall it and each time it falls. I am only willing to go through so much for a product that costs $25. It is more trouble than it is worth. Go buy one of those less attractive nets that suction to the wall - they are less expensive and work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont count ur chickens till they hatch","review":"Initially i loved the product. Was huge enuf to hold the biggest bottle of garnier conditioner bottle, shampoo bottles, loofahs etc..

Now its jus sitting in the bathroom occupying the space n not of any use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and professional service","review":"We had always struggled with what to do with the bath toys as they would usually end up in a puddle of water on the floor.

Looking forward to more Boon products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't stay mounted for me either!","review":"We installed this toy holder and followed the instructions to the letter.

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool but won't stay on the wall.","review":"This is a really cool thing for the kids' bathtub but I can't get it to stay on the wall. I tried the tape that came with it, I tried the suction cup attachment that the company sent (which reduces the weight capacity to 5lbs from 10lbs), I even tried automotive trim tape. It won't stay on the wall. I am not planning to use the last resort they suggest of bolting it to the wall. Maybe I can give it away as a gift or sell it on craigslist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off after one month","review":"I *LOVED* this product, until it fell off the wall after about a month.

Mackerras says no, giving us a decidedly light, dry-eyed Third Sym. I found it refreshing--his often elegant phrasing speaks in its own voice. Tempos are on the fast side, and although the first movement repeat lenghtens it quite a lot, Mackerras is never loggy or sluggish. The Royal Liverpool Orch. plays with energy and commitment. All in all, I would rank this vivacious (and very un-Russian) reading near the top.If only the filler, a loud, foursquare reading of the Symphonic Dances, were as good. Mackerras doesn't lumber, which is fine, but nowhere does the music really feel like it's dancing. This work benefits from a showy virtuosic reading, which the Royal Liverpool forces can't quite manage. Despite this earthbound effort, the symphony is good enough, particularly at such a bargain price, to carry the whole CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Masters at Work","review":"A wonderful combination of a great director and an actor/comedian not yet at his zenith. Fields shows his inherent warmth that he tried to conceal later on in his career. Grifith develops a story line that holds together in spite of moments that in lesser hands would drag the progress of the story. Characters are well defined and work together to make a believeable cohesive plot. A most rewarding bit of cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this or any other watches from Nike .. there's no after sales support","review":"WARNING ... i own a Nike Triax C6 watch and guess what Nike told me when i tried to get it fixed... \\"Sorry we've stopped manufacturing spare parts for Nike Watches\\" ...Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful","review":"thank you for the fast service this book is wonderful and very helpful to men who lose their Father hope you are encouraged to purchase and read this"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good effort","review":"Having read Alexandre Dumas Sr.'s entire Muskateer saga (including the lesser-known Louis and Vicomte books), I was interested in reading this entry from his son. I bought a 1984 edition (at a garage sale) that tied in with a TV-movie starring a young Colin Firth, and the book was enhanced with the inclusion of pictures from the movie, a Greta Garbo version, and two silent movie versions. It also shows one major difference between those movies and the book, but I won't spoil it. The book itself is lacking a bit. It feels too short and too shallow. The main character is all too willing to believe that his sweetheart is cheating on him if she won't meet with him, making it hard to like him. On the plus side, the author tries to show more depths to the much-villified career of prostitution. I'm not sure if I would recommend the novel, but it was an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Wow, and you already thought they were great!

Although a quick read, I simply loved it. Styles tells a superb story, broken down into small, digestible sections that all fit together depicting a phenomenal tale of personal growth. Socrates philosophically beseeched the world to \`Know Thyself', and this is a story that shows the precarious path some young girls take toward womanhood.

It wasn't possible for me to connect with any of the characters because of how underdeveloped they where. The entire book comes off like a creative writing project of a 9th grader. I'm sorry I've never ever found the need to write a negative review before but this book blew me. I literally had to force myself to read it, it took me over 2 weeks because I hated it so much.

I picked this book up a a local bookstore in Baltimore after seeing you on TV. I'm not going to lie, I'm a serious reader and was hoping that it would be a little bigger when I bought it.

Although there were some errors, it certainly didn't take from the storyline and the plot. Without spoiling it for others, I loved in the end how Tammy accepted Evelyn just as she was. She was so terrible throughout the book, that I was sure she wasn't going to take it so well. This book makes you do a double take and think twice on how seriously being gay affects people in our own families.

If you have read previous Harry James Denton books you might enjoy it, but if you haven't like me you won't find enough of a story to be worth reading the whole book. I felt the book started well, but it took forever to get to the mystery itself. There were about a hundred pages left in the book, when it got past the point where the description on the back of the paperback copy described. That in of itself tells you that there was so little for even the publishers to even tell you about the book. From reading the other peoples reviews Steven Womack has probably written some pretty good mysteries. The unfortunate thing is I won't bother giving another book of his a try, because I feel I wasted my time. Don't waste yours either."},{"rating":"2","title":"dirty money","review":"Wonderful book.

For most of us this is a very different world, different culture, and the author brings us into it so well that it isn't long before it feels familiar. The reviewer at Publishers Weekly is wrong. The tension exists throughout, but it is subtle, very cleverly done and perhaps not sufficient for those who prefer thrillers, but this is not a thriller. The homicides occur before the story begins and Kate is not in NY or LA but the Alaskan wilderness. In my view, this is perfectly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaskan Thriller!","review":"Learned a lot about Alaska, the Aleuts and some of the laws on the tribal lands.

Not much coming up to speed. A breakneck pace of cousins, friends, and trouble.Makes no bones about the drinking, loneliness, and other challenges of Alaska. At the same time, absolutely filled with the beauty and grandeur of this most remote of US states.I liked it. A lot. And there are a ton of books in this series. Will I be continuing?

I like who-done-its that depend on knowledge of the local culture to solve the mystery. That has meant a Native American focus, mostly in the southwest US. This is the first Northwest thriller I've read and I liked it! It does delve into the native milieu a bit, but includes the other populations and cultures as well. After this free selection I went and purchased three more of Stabenow's books and have four more on my Christmas wish list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Insight into Life in Alaska - is it really this tough?","review":"I did enjoy this book and was interested to learn more about a people and a country I have never read about before. That said, I found the beginning of the novel a little slow as we had to be introduced to so many characters along the way. However, I did like Kate and Mutt, the wolf/husky, and their friends and relationships. Dana's character descriptions are brilliant. One can picture the people (aspecially 'emaa' and Abel) and easily imagine their very different way of life. At the end, my appreciation was for a good story, well told.

I love books and movies about really cold weather places - like Alaska. But I just could not get into this book. I gave up at 35%, which I thought was a fair attempt. The author spent so much time providing details of unimportant things - like very detailed descriptions of how a bar looked, or what someone was wearing, that I could not pay attention. There seemed to be no actual story during that 35%. I would skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"well. I don't want my money back.","review":"I got the free kindle version, so I paid the right price for it. All in all, it's... an OK book. it's good for a little less than a week's worth of reading. and if you can get past the super detailed technical descriptions that don't really help to move the story or sometimes manage to be not quite right, you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another exciting book by Dana Stabenow","review":"This is my second book I've read by this author.

However, instead of the setting serving as another interesting character, the author's use and references to Alaska I found forced and contrived.

I found her typical and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One That Started It All","review":"There are very few authors whose hardcovers I buy on release day. Dana Stabenow is one of the few. A Cold Day For Murder is the book that started my spending spree. It is spare and a little bleak, not unlike the Alaskan landscape that Stabenow so aptly describes. On page 105 of the new hardcover edition, there's a sentence that starts out with the words \\"Fourteen months of suffering dark dreams in the dead of night...\\" and goes on for about 130 or so more words of positively Joycean length to describe the most horrific event imaginable with such vivid language. I was hooked and continue to be a Stabenow fan to this day. This book won the Edgar for Best PB Original when it was released. It deserved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brr!","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of my college roommate ( we are now 62 yo) who goes to Alaska to be a part of the races there.

My ear is quite critical of variations in speed and I couldn't listen to my records on this player without hearing it. However, most casual listeners may not notice this and, for them, this turntable might be a pretty good bargain. Keep in mind, though, that this is designed for DJ use and has the short, straight tonearm which is great for scratching - not so great for audiophile ears.

However, you can pick up some good tips.He also describes his life prior to making his name known in the world of poker and I found this to be the most interesting. He always had some type of bets going with his neighborhood friends, he had some hard knocks in sport betting and spells it all out clearly.

On the other hand, if you have a quiet lake and want to anchor a float for the kids to swim out to, climb in and out of, play king-of-the-float games, this will do. Or if you are a diver and want to anchor a float to hold your stuff after you bring it back up, this boat will do. But otherwise its an expensive toy, not a boat.Advantage over a regular canoe, difficult to tip over. Even when full of water, it will float high.Disadvantage, you can't go anywhere.

Just make sure you put some weight on the bow area to keep it level.-You can modify the craft with some homemade additions like an anchor trolley, wood floor section to stand up and a bench seat so you can seat in the middle of the craft and fish higher. Make sure you sand the edges and cover them to prevent rips.-I do hate the pinch type valves for the floor and seats.

Aaron Carter talks about all the different ways he would abuse Shaq, and some of it is extremely unbearable. I don't see how this can be put out on a major label and sold to little kids everywhere. All it does is preach hate. Oh, and not to mention the b-sides included on this CD, such as \\"The Clapping Song\\" in which Aaron speaks of his klan meetings where he and his fellow klansmen dance around a burning cross chanting and clapping. This music really scares me. Why should Aaron Carter be allowed to abuse people of other races? This isn't the 1800's people. Slavery was abolished for a reason.

His friends of course don't believe him. At the end you hear Aaron's mom telling him to get out of bed, or he'll be late for school.

This bookis a good read, with plenty of flashbacks and detaileddescriptions of monsters and battles. It even throws in some tense moments between Fly (our hero) and his buddy, Arlene.. The novel also reminds us of how soldiers can sometimes get cocky after a long battle, and how easily one can be killed unexpectedly during a war. All in all, a action-packed fragfest with a healthy dose of human interaction in the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. This book has everything a great sci-fi book should have,not to mention how exceptionally well written it is.

I first read this bookwhen I was younger, and I loved it then just as much as I love it now. There is a lot to take in, so reading this book 2-3 times will nothave you bored and discouraged. I tell everyone I know (that likes to read) to check this book out.

And then the only thingI could say was Wow. The book not only adds the completestory as to how Space Marines came to be fighting all thesemonsters, but it throws in a whole cast of new charactersand a well made plot.

This book(and it's sequels) set the bad guys up as aliens. The whole synopsis of the games were that you were fighting Hellspawn! Not alien clone things created to scare us! When I started out, I was interested by the way the author had the monsters act i.e Imps with their flaming phlegm. But I disgrunteled about the time the Lost Souls were reveiled to be metal. This book does have a few redeeming qualities, like the decriptions of both the Marines thought process and their days in the barracks. I also thought the opening gabit with the priests was a nice touch. These factors do not save the book, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't like using your brain, you'll love this book.","review":"It was simply violence for the sake of violence.

The authors do an impressive (and often fanatical) job of building on the most distinguishing features of a classic game. Knee-deep in the Dead is more than just a book about Doom. It is a fast-paced and masterfully written novel. The pacing is ingenious, the characterisations are strong, and the plot manages to as simple as it is compelling. While reading this book, I greatly resented anything that tore me away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BANG,BANG,BANG...BANG","review":"I love the way this book kicks off with action. It even tells why Fly hates Lt. Weems and doesn't just leave you hangin' to guess why. Non-stop action.

I love the game still, and Quake 2 has been on the shelves for months. This book is the best one in the series, containg descriptive fights, and action sequences seen only in the best action movies. The author's use of language and imagination bring the video game to a whole new level. The other books, on the other hand, get worse and worse, ending up with \\"End Game\\" which has no fights, a sad, sorry plot, and no true re-read value.

The best of all the Doom novels, with Endgame being second. This one is closest to the game, without throwing in a lot of weird stuff that mucks with the action. This book does a good job of expressing the characters, and couldn't be much batter than it is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I really, really hoped for something better. I am not one of those who think game-fiction is a doomed genre, but in many cases I doubt myself. When reading this book, I felt such. Not that I was expecting something well-written with a story of much complexity of substance, but I can find better fanfictions on the internet than this one. Doom the game could definitely have made an interesting book if they threw in a number of interesting characters, some kind of plot and at least a shred of writing skill. Sadly, this book has none. It is the same thing over and over again; main character goes into a room, kills monsters, finds a lever and then goes to the next room, while making snide comments.Even the Baldur's Gate books by Philip A. were better than these, and they were horrible.

The author did an awesome job of researching how a Marine thinks and acts, and he portrayed that in this book. I'm a fan of the game by ID, and i've put many hours in it, but i found myself beside the Corporal through his journies to find Private Sanders, killing \\"re-worked\\" pals, imps, and demons on his path to rescue his recon buddy. If there's any book i would buy two copies of, one to read and one to store, it would be this book, and all the others in it's series. Daffyd Ab Hugh also did a good job of keeping you interested in the next book, by cutting each one off in a suspensful point.

I picked it up and couldn't put it down for a good few hours until I finished it. I was already a big fan of the game (I own it for the PlayStation), and this book put an interesting and engrossing twist on the plot, giving it some direction so it wouldn't be a stupid, no-brain shoot-and-loot. Fly's thoughts and incessant ramblings throughout the game were a funny touch, and finding Arlene in the book was emotional and neccessary to the storyline.

Great film.Watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crucible","review":"I like this movie. The movie helped me understand The Crubible better than reading it. My personal reaction to this movie was shocking. It was really shocking on how the hanging and all was done to all those people. So many people confessed to doing witchcraft even when they really didn't,just so they wouldn't be beaten to death right then. When they did confess they went through the court. Afterwards, they were either hung or the reverends would try to \\"Save\\" them. The actors did an excellent job in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film","review":"I have seen this movie perhaps a dozen times, and never tire of it. It is one of the most compelling, well-written movies I can think of, and the acting is superb throughout, particularly from Day-Lewis, who gives a heart-stopping performance. Because of its theme about witches, the movie gets played a lot around Halloween, but it is by no means a horror movie. It's not even a thriller, really, yet it does manage to thrill and keep the viewer totally involved.

I tried to get into the movie and although it was alright, I don't enjoy those kind of movies that well. Abigail Wiliams (Winona Ryder), was not one of my favorite characters. She and her friends accused many innocent girls for being witches. I lost interest in The Crucible afer Abigail tried to push herself up on John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis). Although I fell asleep I feel as I missed a lot of good infromation. When I woke, John Proctor was about to be executed along with two other women, accused to be witches. This was the climax of the movie for me because then, I wished I wouldv'e watched the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made film, Poor history","review":"Miller goes astray with his own imagination. This is a good looking film with easy to look at talent all around. The story however is pure Hollywood BS. What happened was an incident of a African slave teaching some local girls about her native spiritual customs which included using an ergot style drug. The resultant hallucinations and behavior so scared the heavily oppressive church officials that they quickly condemned to girls to death as witches, using a kangaroo court to scare and intimidate the people from any further experimenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curses!","review":"This movie would have had a chance if wynona ryder wasn't in it. It still astonishes me how many movies she has starred in and she is one of the worst actresses and even more astounding she gets roles that require her to do an accent which is downright laughable hearing her poor abilities with them. The other actors however were quite authentic and passionate with their roles which saved my rating from being 1 star. The story of the movie is boring in itself but I understand it's based on a true story. It was a bit interesting to see the ignorance of those times."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Injustice of Salem","review":"I didn't like this movie because I disagreed with how unjust the witch trials were in Salem. One thing that I admire about the play and the movie was the way Artur Miller used historical facts in the story. My favorite character I think is John Proctor played by Daniel Day-Lewis because he might have cheated on his wife,but at end he admitted his faults,and also at the end he died as a true man, because he stood for what was right.Even though this movie ended very sad, I like the way they show how easily anyone that was innocent could be accused of witchery. Another thing that I didn't like was the way the judges tried to make innocent people lie just to save their own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I showed this movie to my high school students after we read the novel. Since the novel is rather difficult to read, the students really enjoyed seeing the movie version. It had some differences, but all in all stuck close to the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"This movie is surprisingly funny, I like the fact that the entire town goes crazy accusing people of being a witch just because someting odd happens when that person is around. Some of the language might be difficult to undertand. This movie is about the consequences when someone lies about what they did and then tries to blame other people for it. It is a great movie, I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I thought that at he movie was okay. I've read the play and watched the movie and the are very similar to each other. I like the fact that in the movie Arthur Miller put the scene in when the girls were dancing in the woods and you can see everything that happened and who did what. The movie could have been better if he used more light and could see what was going on in the movie. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis did a good job acting his character John Proctor. All in all the movie was okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ONE MR TIERNEY By: Jose Macias","review":"I thik that this is one of the greatest movies I have seen.

It came in a very timely manner and was in excellent (new) condition. Very pleased with the service and product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful allegory","review":"Based on the Salem witch trials of 1692, this powerful film also comments more generally on the consequences of sexual repression as well as upon how public hysteria may destroy private lives and how those in power may lack the wisdom, integrity, or strength to stand against the tide of public opinion. A group of adolescent girls are caught playing at pagan rituals in the woods. They invent charges of witchcraft to escape punishment, and one of their number, Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder), takes advantage of the situation to entrap John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis), a good man who made the mistake of commiting adultery with her. Soon, the authorities are involved, the girls begin to believe their own accusations, and the whole situation takes on a tragic inevitability. Well-performed by all involved, particularly Paul Scofield as the chief magistrate."},{"rating":"2","title":"very powerful movie","review":"I frst saw this movie in my seventh-grade History class in October. Since our textbook only briefly discussed the Salem Witch Trials, my teacher decided we should watch this movie. It took us two and a half class periods to get through it, and every moment kept us in suspense. The screenplay was very dramtic, and believe me, none of us were prepared for the shock of the ending. It just took us by complete suprise what happened to John Proctor. During the last twenty minutes, everyone, only a few boys, but mostly us girls, was crying. I thought it was very interesting how in just a few months, his whole life just completely changed around. From farmer to believed witch. I just love the speech he gives as to why he cannot confess. My class and I were all hoping that Abigail Williams would be killed or something, because she would deserve it. My little sister says this movie has taught her what lies can do to others, no matter what time period. Overall, this is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Value","review":"The movie \\"The Crucible\\" is an inadequate portrayal of Arthur Miller's original script. The main idea and theme of the production was given across correctly. The severe test of the townspeople's souls was portrayed clearly, howerver the powerful dialogue was compromised in translation to the big screen. The basic plot of the movie revolves around the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. People of Salem are accused wrongly by a group of \\"accusing girls\\". As accusations grow so many innocent people are put through a test of faith and must either confess or be hanged. The story line is very worth while, but as I said before, it is portrayed in this movie very poorly. I would not recomend this movie to people who have seen the live theater production.

Nicholas Hytner is a director who likes to take high voltage projects and materialize them (The madness of king George).Watch this film and convince by yourself that the religious fanatics may become heretics due the excess of their own fanaticism and if not consider the case of Savonarola.Tour de force performances, kinetic script and mesmerizing locations make the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought acting ruins it","review":"The Crucible is an important play and a very good one. But the self-important approach this film gives Miller's script is devastating. Primarily, the acting is so overwrought as to be nearly laughable.

I had to laugh at this lameportrayal of someone with Alzheimer's. (\\"It's time for me togo to the nursing home, darling.\\") Does anyone on this 4 starslist have a family member with Alzheimer's? A more realisticfilm is A Song for Martin - but even that only scrapes thesurface. Prepare yourself for one or all of the above in thereal world of Alzheimer's: violence, paranoia, total shutdown,hoarding, depression, delusions, bankruptcy, defecation on thefloor, someone who absolutely cannot utter a coherent sentence...I could go on & on. I wonder if any film could really dealwith it? Maybe a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Realistic","review":"This movie made me angry, because it makes Alzheimer's look so much more benign than it is. Most caregivers are forced to keep their Alzheimer's victim at home for much longer. And where are the rages, the suspicion, the accusations, the delusions, the paranoia, the halluciations, the catastrophic reactions, the hitting and screaming that a caregiver must suffer through? Where is the diaper changing? Where are the sleepless nights? To enter a facility like Fiona does, one must be exceedingly wealthy, even in Canada, I imagine.

But this DVD comes with a prequel, in which the actors explain to the audience just what a terrible ordeal Alzheimer's is.

The choppy sequencing does nothing to add to the story line, and, as another reviewer commented, none of the characters is very likeable. The portrayal of Alzheimer's Disease isn't very typical from my experience. Away From Her is one of those films that you begin watching, hoping a good story will develop...only to find out that you're still waiting for that story an hour into the movie. Overall, I would say this film would be a decent effort for a first-time filmmaker (which it is), but it's nothing near what an Oscar-nominated production should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant !","review":"I thought this movie gave a accurate view of the potential of this disease.

But, I knew if it was from Reference Recordings, the sound would be spectacular! Spectacular marches from a spectacular bandmaster from a spectacular recording label equals something much more than spectacular, to say nothing of the spectacular performances of the Dallas Wind Symphony! To describe this HDCD as a toe-tapper is setting the bar far too low. Listening to just a few of these marches can change a gloomy day to sunny - and I mean it! These marches are impeccably played with such verve and gusto that you are transported right to Main Street USA. And all this marching emotion is captured as faithfully as possible by the \\"Professor\\" Keith O. Johnson of Reference Recordings.If this CD does not get your heart pumping, better call 911!A GREAT CD not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Symphonic Sousa!","review":"This recording is unique. I've heard lots of march recordings, and the Dallas Wind Symphony takes a different approach. This is real music. Sousa was a great composer and this recording gets him out of the oom-pah crash-crash rut. There's subtlety here, variations, detail, and the recording itself shows it all with great dynamic range. It's as if Beethoven met Sousa in Dallas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a stream of consciousness novel","review":"This book covers a great deal of research in memory by condensing each paper into a 1-2 paragraph summary. As a result, the writing is often vague and confusing. Making matters worse, the book seems to be a rough draft published without the benefit of an editor. The sentences are convoluted, terms are poorly defined and used inconsistently, and the material is disorganized. There is no unifying framework for understanding all the research results presented. The lack of organization makes it unsuitable even as a reference.In short, this book has nothing to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"Although I am a psych student with a pretty good GPA, I find this book difficult to understand.

Shakespeare must get at the bottom of who means him harm, and why. It's a good enough yarn in its own right, but that isn't the real reason to buy the book any more than supplying basic nutrients is the reason for fine dining.There are books designed to be \\"page turners,\\" which the reader is to inhale quickly. This is not. Time's Fool is best sipped rather than gulped. Tourney's phrases, idioms, and word choices are a true delight to the discerning reader. I read it with a dictionary close by, not so much because I was in doubt about some of the archaic terms which sprinkle the book, but rather because I wanted to admire the author's skill and \\"wordsmanship.\\"When you have the time to savor a good book, you will relish Time's Fool: A Mystery of Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Bad is This Book? Let Me Count the Ways.","review":"Well, it's really just bad in one way... it's badly written. The conceit is that it is a confessional Shakespeare wrote in his final years, so it is written in this precious pseudo-Shakespeare jargon that comes across as creepy and convoluted. Probably will be unintelligible to someone who doesn't enjoy Shakespeare, but then, someone who does enjoy Shakespeare wouldn't waste time on a book that can't get out of its own way.

However, the writing is dull, the plot is dull, and the story never gets off the ground. It is likely a mistake to assume fiction based on a possible even fictional chapter in the life of the Bard would be as interesting as the works of Shakespeare himself. Always provided, of course, that he wrote them. A question for scholars--they are great works whoever wrote them.

Yet, by the time the third figure is unveiled in similar fashion, a reader might begin to wonder--could Chesterton have been serious when he has the narrator express shock? I wasn't shocked.

For those of you who like your thrillers to pack their punches in terms of caliber, pints of blood shed, or body-count, you can all sod off. This is a thriller for the mind and the soul -- its aim is to save you from yourselves.If you want your English simple, straighforward, fed to you in easy subject-verb-object format, leave as well. This is more post-modern than any of those douchebags you've been fed in your graduate classes at U.C. Santa Barbara.If Chesterton is not the greatest modern author, then that is only because T.S. Eliot or Evelyn Waugh is slightly better.The chief pity is that Americans -- most direly in need of this sort of instruction -- will not read this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read first, let it brew, read it again","review":"This book is not about anarchy or suppression of thoughts; that is incidental in this story. TMWHT is about a man's journey to discover: how much he cares, the mysterious and powerful \\"gut feeling\\", what it is he actually cares about. His life is essentially opened up to understanding and life. The message of Sunday would seem to be: I know YOU; I found you to be of worth; now that your eyes are opened, go really live your life.

Anarchists and detectives romp around England and France but in the end it's all very allegorical and metaphysical. Lots of religious imagery and aphorisms. Only for fans of Chesterton who want something deeper than the Father Brown stories. Also, this novel is in the public domain, and this particular edition was sloppily printed and had some typos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, right-wing, Christian-oriented schlock","review":"This proto-fascist parable takes place on two levels simultaneously: it's both a mystery story and a piece of Christian edification. Unfortunately, it's a lousy detective story--as such, it simply makes no sense at all--and an ugly, fundamentally mean-spirited dogmatic work.Let's just begin with the hero's premise: he's a good guy, he works for the thought police. His job is to find anyone who promulgates dangerous ideas, and to stop them. By dangerous ideas, he means anything that goes against conformity, against the mainstream. This, in Chesterton's view, is a noble cause: to suppress any ideas that could undermine tyranny.Unless you're intending to study how an intellectual like Chesterton became involved with some strong anti-semitic groups, I recommend you avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic along the lines of \\"Mein Kampf\\"","review":"This book is, quite simply, an attempt to express some of the most despicable ideas any human being ever had.

Chesterton, starts very well, with a policeman so succesful in trying to infiltrate a group of anarchists that he is elected one of the bosses of the cell. Then things slowly becomes more muddled and the plot collapses halfway through the book, as it becomes more and more confusing and improbable and the author tries to feed on us too much indigestible philosophical baggage (Chesterton was a notorious political ultraconservative who seemed to find nothing worthwhile in the Europe after the Middle Ages). If you want to read a novel about early 20th century anarchists, I suggest instead you read Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an allegory.","review":"I agree with the reader who called this book a fascinating cheat, and I must disagree with the reader who said, \\"...is not a detective story; not an allegory; especially not a work of theology.\\" It definitely IS a religious allegory, and it is a cheat. (By the way, despite its subtitle, it is NOT a \\"nightmare\\".) The abrupt bait-and-switch transition from political thriller to religious parable makes for some gaping plot holes. And the religious message is exquisitely worded, beautifully phrased, brilliantly developed, and COMPLETELY unsatisfactory. That's Chesterton for you. He is well, well worth reading, and there's nobody that compares to him for thoughtprovoking cleverness and brilliant wordsmithing, but his message always, always reverts back to a very annoying, smug, and poorly-thought-out Anglo-Catholic neo-medievalist neo-Platonism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man Who Was Thursday","review":"This book which was written in the early 1900s is about a Policeman/Poet that infiltrates a group of anarchists who are bent on breaking down society.

By Wednesday I got the drift of the story, although the denouement held a little surprise. Chesterton is an old master and it is difficult to be surprised by someone so often imitated, but as a wordsmith, his art is difficult to imitate.

I suppose i have a sort of literary crush on GK Chesterton-- I fall in love with his whimsical, clever writing and so even a short book like this can take me weeks just because I really savor his lovely sentences. As I pour through his perfectly-chosen words, I can't help but feel deeply inspired and impressed. Is it wrong to swoon over a book? *sighs dreamily*My favorite: \\"... his black seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him, as if it were compounded of profound colour. His black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple. His black beard looked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue.

Its not hard but I've seen it happen.2: The quality is ok but not great. It could be better.3: It does not have over flap sides. I dont know how to describe it but its just a square net where as all my others have sides on them that better hold in your catch.4: The main low rating is that for $2 - $4 more you can buy a better quality net from Cabela's that is already put together, a little plastic bag to keep it in when not in use, two different sizes, a little rope to use and sides that better hold your catch.So in the end this net works but could be better.

It is fascinating to see the evolution of these stories. (One can only imagine the level of perfection Tolkien would have reached had he ever completely finished his epic.) The Tales give a unique glimpse into the life of Elves on Tol Eressea as the human Eriol is introduced to it. This fascinating vision of life in the Western Lands is augmented with history of the Elves as told in their own oral tradition. Both books 1 and 2 are fabulous and intriguing, answering many questions and yet engendering many others.

Just because you like the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit doesn' t mean you will like this book. It is not light reading and requires some patience and concentration.But for the serious Tolkien fan it is a treasure you won't want to miss out on.

The issue isn't with the version of the song chosen, but with the sloppy mastering. Quite simply, the track starts late, thereby affecting the overall impact of the song's opening. Although only a split second or two off, it's the equivalent of dropping the needle on the record part way through the track. Ugh! Buyer beware. If this doesn't bother you, than go for it.

Most books I've found, force grammer and pronounciation through the first few chapters.People put down Latin and are afraid to learn it, saying it is hard. Considering the romantic languages and much of English come from Latin, it's a lot easier than people think. Just use common sense and you can learn to pick out words. I gave a few passages to my Latin-free husband and he got the idea of some of the sentences. It took a bit of figuring, but anyone should be able to do it.The only negative, is using this book alone.

After establishing their Gnawa credentials with the traditional-sounding first track, the remaining songs grab the listener with a mad, exhilerating rush, firing shot after shot from the cannon as traditional North African sounds are mashed seemlessly into reggae, ska, Jamaican toasting with hints of dub, and even speed metal (?!). In one song, a muzzein call from the sunset minerets of Istanbul turns into a hybrid belly dance cut with greek bouzouki. Wonderful! The musicianship, arrangements, and singing are impeccable, as is the whole concept of this group and this album. To my ear, it sounds like the vocals are in Arabic, French, and English. There is tremendous variety on this CD, and each cut is done exceedingly well (ie. it doesn't at all sound like they are hitting a bunch of styles just to show they can, with the danger of their reach exceeding their grasp).

Besides, when you're watching The Simpsons, maybe you'll start to get the Tito Puente jokes.This father/son re-creation of Afro-Cuban jazz brings new life to an old favorite, The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite.

No where do the publishers indicate that this book contains only a portion of the text of the original.

It was the pick up. No volume control is lame BTW. You need to be able to turn it down or off IMO. I borrowed a guitar and returned it.The sound is not terrible, it delivers OK tone.

Every other alarm I have had resets itself after a time period. This one has a flashing indicator light that tells you it is hushed, but it's easy to miss and easy to forget what 1-second, 2-second and 10-second flashing means.

Yesterday I pulled the flashlight out and broke the side off of another one. I will remove these clips from my Jeep and look for something more dependable. I wanted to mount a light in my Jeep, RV, and my truck, but these clips are way too brittle to be dependable. I have one brand new set still in the packaging but I will not be mounting them anywhere.

We installed it ourselves using the harness specific to our truck from quickconnect dot com, and that was worth every penny! Think it cost around $65 or so, but it was cheaper than paying someone else to do it, and it gave us a perfect installation. Took about 30 minutes to install. Instructions aren't perfect, but they are good enough that you can figure out what to do. Hint: follow the instructions that come with the harness. At first glance, they seem not so clear, but slow down and read them carefully, and notice that various wires on the harness are actually labeled; then it becomes a piece of cake. When we buy a different car one day, we can just get a different harness and then install the Parrot on that car.Although I never actually heard any other hands-free devices, I did a lot of comparison shopping online, and feel like we made an excellent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The Parrot CK3100 looked like just the thing I was looking for. I drive a tractor trailer so have been looking for a handsfree system with high volume and this is to be incorporated in your sound system. I can hear calls just fine but the microphone BITES!!!!

Non existent installation instructions","review":"Took me 8 hrs to install. Absolutely no instructions whatsoever. I understand that instructions can vary by car - but this is plain simple ridiculous. Had to do a lot of searching online to get the job done.. After installation - seems to work good so far. Full radio volume is not muted on call arrival.

My first unit didn't save any of my settings so the dealer replaced it. The second unit works great if the person I'm calling is on a land line. If they are also using a handsfree phone while driving they complain of very loud background noise and I have a very hard time hearing them (thier voices seem to be muted even at full volume).

I would advise you not buy Parrot."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I was surprised when I read the negative reviews on this book... I read it several years ago and found it very believeable. Human greed, the senselessness of bureaucracy and the competition between goverment departments... these are some of the very real things that are explored in the book in a 'spy-story' setting. Of course it is more of a serious novel than a thriller... those reading it for getting kicks out of following the heroic adventures of a glamorous spy will be disappointed. The people are human, with real peoples' weaknesses and faults, and the enemy people (east germans) are all too human. I can understand the average thriller fan's not liking this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Tragic","review":"Not great LeCarre, but perhaps it is a good looking glass hold up to our own Cold War policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst spy book I have ever read.","review":"This whole book is absolutely pointless.

While the story line itself may seem a little bit unfeasible, it very often is more closely aligned to governments than we think. Some argue that a government would not do that to one of its' men, however the U.S. sort of did that in the Bay of Pigs. I won't even go into Vietnam! Basically this is typical le Carre.

It is not up to the best of what Graham can do. Her writing is always weighty, and in that mode can work wonders but not-- for the most part-- here. I'm afraid reputation has taken her professional reviewers into praises unwarranted and undeserved. The metaphysics doesn't reach; the reality doesn't call; the experiences don't tell-- the poetry doesn't work.

This THICK book breaks everything down pretty simple but still packed with a lot of information.

The excitement and freshness of the topic is maintained throughout, the breath and depth are astonishing (as another reviewer has also said), and the authors put the topics into their proper perspective.It was ten years between the 1st and 2nd editions: are we to be lucky enough to get a third one soon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"college textbook for intro to electronics","review":"I'm teaching a calculus-based 1 semester intro to electronics, and this is the best I have found. My students complained of its denseness and detail, and those are valid issues. But I just haven't found better. Floyd's Electronics Fundamentals is suited for a 1 year course, too verbose for me, and no calculus. It takes 700 pages just to get to the first silicon device! Agarwal and Lang's \\"Foundations of analog and digital electronic circuits\\" is brilliant, but more theoretical than H&H. So for now, I'll tell my students to grin and bear it -- H&H is at the very least a valuable reference once you know something about electronics, it costs significantly less than other texts (cost is a real difficulty for many of my students these days); and I'll do my best as a teacher to ease their journey through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still excellent, but old in the tooth, and preposterously overpriced","review":"Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now, and all college texts seem to have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth and it's preposterously overpriced. Another big drawback is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Being a mechanical engineer by training and working in an automation environment, I found myself asking questions that electrical engineers take for granted. I called one of my professors and asked her for advice on a reference book that will bring me up to speed. She recommended this book and having used it at least 2-3 times a week since I recieved it, I consider it a great investment! While I agree with some of the previous reviewers remarks on the quality of the index, the judicious use of tabs, post-its and writing in the margins allows me to cope with this deficiency. The major impact this book has on my professional life is it allows me to ask an \\"intelligent\\" question to an electrical engineer which is focused to the task at hand. This is done without going thru peripheral theory and application explanations of which this book does an excellent job."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't understand how it can be ranked higher","review":"I have a Ph.D degree in this field and I can't stand this book. I don't see it how you can learn anything from it unless you know the subject thoroughly already. The explanation is terse and leaves a lot to imagination. The claim to provide a simple and intuitive model (such as transistor) doesn't hold up. It might serve as a reference for very limited few, but largely useless for the rest, especially if you want to learn something to start with.Avoid the frustration and waste of money, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok Reference Book","review":"The book does an ok job explaining various parts of electrical engineering. Some parts break things down such that any person could understand what they are talking about.

As you work through the equations, you realize that in 20 feet, the cable will have lost all ten megawatts (due to the resistance of the copper) and will reach a temperature of over 3500 kelvin (gaseous copper, anyone?).The practical angle is: the result is obviously preposterous. You'd really use multiple cables and supplies.What's also impressive about the book is they cover so much, ranging from basic microelectronics to building a signal convertor with the Motorola 68008 (with code supplied!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly good book","review":"I'm a retired electronics engineer that wanted to get back into the field as a hobby. I had the good luck to learn about this book and I've been blown away by it. It handles so many topics with such great detail, and with such clarity, that I have to wonder how the resources were marshaled to develop this book as it would require very high finances and a great body of technical experts to produce.But produce it they did and it's the bible to end all bibles.

The subject, Britain's Royal Navy and its impact upon history and the world we know today, offers an extraordinary range of possibilities for any writer. In this case, beginning with a strong intriguing premise, the book fails to deliver on a number of levels. Most significantly, the number of historic errors totally erodes the reader's confidence in the writer's general proposition. There are just too many mistakes and for me at least, the scholarship of the entire book is called into question. Despite the Royal Navies full, rich history and the exciting possibilities of the writers premise, sadly, I found this book to be very disappointing and I would not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"To rule the waves","review":"Herman takes on a massive subject and whilst by need providing a detailed history with many references to dates, places, ships and people, writes in such a way to ensure the reader both remains interested and enjoys the story.

Articles are dropped all over the place, unless it's a matter of style to refer to \\"French navy\\" rather than \\"the French navy,\\" and the author's nontraditional use of commas is a little jarring.

In much the same way as tide and currents flowing though the world's far-flung oceans can be known and purposely used, Professor Herman very skillfully uses the continuity of the Royal Navy though the ages to allow the reader to flow through the course of Western Civilization. This enables the reader to \\"connect the dots\\" of 500 years of what might otherwise be only a progression of unrelated events, and, thus, come away with a sense of the whole. From this, we can then begin to draw conclusions as to where we might be going.This is an outstanding book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Educational","review":"To Rule the Waves is one of those rare books that you find very entertaining and at the same time really learn the subject.

In 1977, Sun had him change his stage name to \\"Orion\\" (meaning \\"reborn\\") and his first LP for the label had \\"schlockey\\" artwork showing a Masked man rising from a coffin! In early 1978, this LP was released with the specific intention of fooling the public into thinking the \\"duets\\" were Elvis and Jerry Lee, when actually, old Jerry Lee tracks were overdubbed with cheap strings and Ellis' Elvis-like vocals.

The author is obviously qualified, but it is interesting that he has been involved in so many denomonations (7) in his own youth ministry. I sense that he has had bad experiences with small churches and has unresolved issues. There are many jabs at them throughout the first half of the book. The last parts of the book consist of \\"approaches\\" that will not work in small churches for reasons given in the first half of the book. One of the three main approaches requires that youth be divided into groups of 6 to 8 with similar interests and of the same sex. Another requires a cast of leaders with very specific roles and qualifications. A much better book is \\"Youth Ministry in Small Churches\\" by Rick Chromey. It is a very positive book written with the small church in mind, and with some ideas that are really geared toward a church with only two to a dozen or so high-schoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it 35 years ago; can't wait to read it again!","review":"One of the first sci-fi books I read as a kid was a paperback copy of \\"What Mad Universe\\" from the 1950's, and I have never forgotten it.

I had already read the Sam's VB 6 in 21 Days book, but the VBA section helped reinforce what I had already learned, and most importantly, taught me how to understand and use ArcObjects, even the Object Model Diagrams, which is really important for a beginner to grasp.This is a great tutorial and reference to have for anyone with no computer programming background, because it really teaches you from the ground-up, and contains easy-to-follow exercises. I doubt more advanced programmers would find the book too helpful, and they should probably stick to Zeiler's \\"Exploring ArcObjects,\\" which is a reference book, not a tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what I needed","review":"This book is exactly what I needed for my class.

Too many how to books start off explaining the very basics in great detail and then jump to expecting you to how to do the more complex. I am no programmer but can follow Burke and feel that not only am I able to complete the exercises but that am actually learning as I do so.This book appears aimed at people like me, have used GIS programs without ever having dived into programming.

I'm about to tick a lot of people off, but this story was average. I read all the 5-star comments and figured, wow, this must be a great book, so I bought it. I kept reading, waiting for the parts that generated all the excitement to come, but 300 pages into the book I realized that they weren't coming. I forget the heroine's name, but she was too wimpy and obsessed about being ugly for my tastes. She was nice enough, but I didn't find anything extraordinary about her. What I did find extraordinary was the fact that so many people were fooled into believing that the blind hero could see. Talk about dumb! I don't want to insult anyone because I know every reader has his/her own likes and dislikes, but this book was pretty weenie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing reading","review":"I am in love with this story.

I'm not sure why people liked this book so much, there was basically no plot, I don't even remember the h/h's names, I liked the secondary characters better and that's not saying a lot. I think this book was just too sappy for me (no offence to anyone who liked it). I kept reading the book hoping it would get better, it didn't. I think everyone just got sucked into feeling bad for the poor abused heroine and blind hero, I didn't. This was a forgettable novel. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"Having read quite a number of wonderful historical fiction novels and romances, I was \\"up\\" for another when I began this book. Alas, I was stuck with one of the most repetitive and banal stories ever written! In fact, how did this ever get published? The characters are stock and insepid, the premise is dull and dimwitted, and the plot is non-existent, as well as redundant (which might sound like \\"something,\\" but trust me, the \\"nothing\\" that keeps getting repeated is not worth your valuable time). The main character keeps threatening to run away every five pages, and I wanted to throw the rotten book in the fire and be done with her! Do not waste your money. I wouldn't even give my copy away to an evil co-worker.

I checked it out & read it & found it to be really stupid. The girl is a freaking idiot--she should be in a nunnery (where she might fit in way better than with her lusty & sexy husband). The father of the girl is such an extreme caricature that he's pretty much unbelievable. The hero is pretty good--overcoming his blindness as much as he can (sometimes to the extent that it's completely unbelievable), but his interest in Gemma seems quite forced. I've read much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Read!","review":"In \\"This Is All I Ask,\\" Lynn Kurland has succeeded at what I feel is the most difficult type of romance to write--the kind driven by character, not by plot, where conflict is caused by personality clash that can only be resolved by personal growth and self-awareness. In this novel, the hero, the heroine, and their friends are not cardboard cut-outs but actual people taking up residence in your imagination for the space of the story. They have strengths, and they have weaknesses, and how they overcome those weaknesses, and find true strength in uniting against evil, will keep you riveted to the end. A beautfiul love story, a tense battle between good and evil, and characters worth getting to know--this book has it all. I also enjoyed the gentle humor of this book, based upon the characters' foibles and small vanities rather than on some sort of sitcom joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that is deeper than just sex","review":"I will admit that I was a bit surprised at the very low end \\"intimate\\" scenes, BUT, the way the story of two fate stricken characters was such a breath of fresh air that I did tear up twice! Especially when Christopher let go of his emotions to his master, It was almost impossible to keep the tears at bay. No matter the other reviews, this is the first story by Kurland that I have had the pleasure of reading, and I look forward to her other novels as well. Unlike most novels that I read with wars, gallant warriors, brave and outspoken from the get-go female leads, this novel was truly a story worth reading. There are not many in this time who truly understand what it is like to survive a childhood wrought with abuse, and still be able to grow into adulthood and learn to trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I bought this book over a year ago and I don't know how many times I have read it.

It has funny moments (the fans showing Smelly no love), touching moments (Fat Mike missing his daughter's birthday), tense moments (an anti-religion band in religion-heavy territory), and moments where you just have to admire the band's ambition and what they're trying to accomplish on this tour.

Although it is a bit difficult to maneuver because it is so huge, if you have a table to sit at to read, this book has a ton of fascinating information from the roots of New York (including First Nations tribes) right up to the current day- or close to it.Photos tend to be more black and white, but the information is so extensive, our family gets it out for entertainment and reads it to each other for fun. We learn SO much! It has information about almost every town you can think of although a few hamlets were missing that we looked up.If you are a home educator, this book is a fantastic addition to the New York State educational requirements as it is much more informative than wandering endlessly around the internet and finding bits and pieces of information.We really love this book and are very excited to have purchased it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sexy","review":"With the exception of a few images (including the one on the cover) this book is much more focused on the couture than the kinky. The latex-clad models look bored rather than aroused, and the artist's interest in clown suits is one I do not share.I was also surprised to see photographs of men in this collection, since both the reviews and the product description indicated that the models were female. Furthermore, the men she chose were not attractive, and instead of being nude or erotically dressed, they just had on some wild latex gimp suit. Just not my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average in every aspect of film making.","review":"This movie was recommended by a friend whose opinions I no longer trust. :) I felt this movie could have been better if there was a larger budget and someone to punch-up the script. The story was okay, but the script just couldn't bring me into the story. In the long run it came across as a bad \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" episode. I found myself frequently checking how much time remained on the movie and was not in the least scared, on edge, or spooked.

I usually don't watch new horror films anymore, but I heard this was good and I'm a sucker for this kind of movie but I really think I'm done. Even paying $.50 at the library was too much for this banana. The plot is so by the numbers it's ridiculous, and as is typical nowadays you can't see half of anything because it's so dark.

I'm getting tired of these horror movies that take themselves too seriously. I miss the horror movies of the 80's and 90's. They had a sense of fun and humor to them.

This movie is \\"AWFUL\\".. One of the worst I've seen this year. Besides a total lack of continuity in the story, the screenplay is awful, the acting is awful, the premise is hackneyed, and it is about as scary as a Disney film.

The part with the Darth Maul look alike behind the father, had me and my friends cracking up a lot though. This movie is dumb to the extreme. The non scariness factor is amped to 11 with tired jerky camera work that seems to accompany most of the recent horror flicks, (seriously what is gonna keep people up at night about twitchy jerky camera effects and characters, the stupid non-smiling twins to instant smiling twins scene was dumb times dumb to the dumb power, featuring dumb, amplified by dumb, bathing in a vat of dumb, stirred by a dumb person with the dumb stick.

I'm sorry, but I see no hope for this movie, and if you're a true horror fan I wouldn't recommend this piece of garbage. If this scares you, you might as well not even touch any real horror movies.

It's good for a couple of good scares in the beginning, but the movie quickly deteriorates from there. The big slogan was, it's not the house that's haunted, and it was compared to the exorcist, both couldn't be further from the truth. Without going into details, the story is just stupid. The special effects are laughable, and the acting is so-so. The kid, newcomer Ty Simpkins, was mildly entertaining and did do a nice job. The parents weren't too bad either, but the rest of the cast were just terrible, a perfect fit for a movie that is pure garbage. If it wasn't for a couple of scares and the fact that I was laughing at how stupid some of the parts were, this movie would have gotten zero stars. It's a complete and utter waste of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creepy movie In the tradition of Poltergeist","review":"I found this to be a sort of updated Poltergeist. While not a true reboot, it does have some of the same mix. A small child caught up in an unknown \\"otherworld\\", 2 parents and 2 siblings left to deal, a trio of experts to help the family out, and in the end a parent goes in to retrieve the child.Now I'm sure others will question my analogy, but it's how I saw things.As for the movie, it has a nice spooky element to it that sets the pace all the way through. Small things at first leading up to many more unexplained happenings. The scares were not in your face, although there were a few well placed got ya moments! Overall I enjoyed this movie and consider it one of the better horror movies to come out in recent years. I will be buying the blu ray version as it does have a few special features not on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, creepy, CREEPY","review":"I watched this movie for the first time today. This is by far the creepiest movie I've seen in a LONG time. Just like with many scary movies, I didn't have much hope for this one when I first turned it on, but I figured $3.99 was ok to rent it if I didn't like it. However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the story line and how it grabbed at you from the first moment. I would have liked a slower lead in to the \\"ghost\\" part of the story, but still, they did a pretty decent job. Overall, I'd recommend it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insidious=Inidiotious","review":"This film totally builds you up for suspense then pulls the plug on it.

Paranormal Activity used the less is more formula to great effect. Amazing how scared you can get on a budget flick.Anyway, Insid builds it up but lets it down in the end, where the film just implodes, turns on itself and removes any sense of fright created so clearly in the start and middle.The most frightening film since The Exorcist? Demon, please.The most terrifying film since Poltergeist? Shame on you, promoter-voice guy.A two-star one-night rental to enjoy and forget? Right on, daddy-o."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me... scary?!","review":"I made the mistake and let the trailers and \\"scariest movie in years\\" tagline fool me.I loved Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, so I thought this one should be a decent horror flick.The demon/devil creature looked like a combination between Nacho Libre's wrestling partner and Darth Maul from Star Wars, that's suppose to be scary? The story was slow paced and the main character felt lacking.I love horror flicks and live for them, Insidious had me fall asleep 3 times during the movie and this was when the \\"scary\\" parts were about to happen.I tossed the Bluray to a friend, told him to keep it and to never give it back.

You'll probably watch the sequel also","review":"Starts quiet then gets pretty scary, then ends medium scary. It had some really oddball stuff in the netherworld, which added interest during the not as scary portion.

It just has a big uh-oh scene to set the stage for part two."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Different Movies","review":"My wife and I really enjoyed the first half of the film.

The movie actually became quite silly and slipped into absurdity. And that ending...ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scares are overdone and predictable","review":"I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because I did think the beginning scenes were pretty ok. For instance, I thought the home invasion scene had some suspense to it. I also liked the scene where the ghost is pacing back and forth outside the window and then suddenly appears in the house.However, for the most part the scares were overdone and predictable. I also thought the plot twist was predictable, too. The ending could've been good, but ended up looking cheesy instead.

My standards for horror are VERY high. This movie misses the mark by about 700 miles. There are a few creepy moments scattered throughout, and places where you see the potential for a truly terrifying movie, but it pulls back from every good idea it has. The concept is great, the movie is NOT. It gets super cheesy toward the end, like, unforgivably cheesy. Look, some men's trash is others treasure. I was wildly unimpressed with this movie.

It's bad enough to have to put up with bad behavior from moviegoers without having to suffer through the same annoyances on the screen. A lot of reviews trumpet the first half of the film... I guess compared to the second half, folks are trying to be generous in looking for something to put a positive spin on.

Out of body traveling. This is a cross betweeh Potergeist, Amityville Horror and a little of The Exorcist. It kept me on the edge of my seat hoping something really scary was going to happen. Forget that. A couple scenes were good. The demon with the red face and the fork tongue was interesting. The people with the stupid grins were good as well but that was all I liked about this movie. The whole concept of a person traveling out of his or hers body. without being dead is fiction. I bought the Blu-Ray hoping it would really make the movie good. No chance. I want my $19.99 back. If paranormal mumbo jumbo stupidity is your thing then this movie is de-finitely for you other wise pass on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Yes Scary Ehh","review":"Insidious is a movie that I would classify as being creepy and less scary. It starts off with a family moving into a new house with their 2 little boys and baby daughter. Soon strange things start to occur, like books being knocked off the shelf and boxes being moved to the attic. To make a long story short and without giving anything of importance away, one of the boys is being haunted a little more than the others. I do believe that Isidious and Poltergeist share a lot of similar elements. All in all I did feel slightly uneasy while watching it and had the urge to look over my shoulder, but I didn't jump or feel actually scared. While the ending is somewhat predictable, I just accepted that I knew what was gonna happen just let myself enjoy it. I definitely recommend watching it if you love scary movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scary movie ever made!","review":"I rented this movie for a solo night. Bad idea! I paused it a few times, made some snacks and tried all sort of diverting stuff to move my mind away from this movie. It is that scary. It's not the typical story of poltergeist, or possession or any other spooky theme so worn out by Hollywood movies, it's a completely new idea they describe as the Further. The limbo world where evil dwells.By the way, the bluray cover for this movie depicting a child and a house on the background is misleading. I thought it would be something like \\"The Orphan\\" or \\"The Omen\\" where there is an evil kid who does a lot of evil things. Here is not that way at all.Try to watch this movie alone and I bet you will turn it off before half an hour. Better yet, get someone to watch it with you and enjoy what I consider the best scary movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Low budget Poltergeist rip off.

The first half was a lot better than the second half. Something that really turned me off from this movie was that they copied a lot of the plot from Paranormal Activity 2. It was almost the same thing. I think in Paranormal Activity 2 they even had something that had to do with pictures.Also what paranormal activity does very well is that it doesn't show the \\"demon\\" and when Insidious does show it, its flat out laughable. Its like a man with a Halloween costume and some face paint. Total fail. The movie could have been better with just better directing and set design as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insidious is half good, half terrible. I recommend watching the first half","review":"Insidious starts off great. It begins with great camera work and a real eerie style. It's actually really good.

The last part was some stupid, goofy bad movie which you wouldn't want to have anything to do with.How did this movie go so far off track? Did the director go home or the writer's get fired?

I had never heard of it before and the premise did not seem that interesting. However I was greatly surprised by Insidious. Yes It may look and borrow from other horror movies but I think it stands up on it's own.

From the bad make-up jobs on the dead to the ridiculous costume work, this movie will go down as a cheesy paranormal fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, Quick Shipping","review":"Insidious can be summed up in two words: awesome and creepy. The story, with a boy who inexplicably falls into a coma one night, his parents weighed down under caring for their comatose son, and the unexplained 'bumps in the night' all fall into place when it is revealed that the boy - Dalton - is being followed by the spirits of the dead, accurately summed up by the film's tagline: \\"IT'S NOT THE HOUSE THAT'S HAUNTED\\". I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes psychological horror and the movie did pretty good at achieving that, and without copious amounts of blood and gore (virtually none, in fact), somewhat rare for horror films these days.

Sure it's formula, but so what -- it made me chuckle a little, smile a lot, and remember that even when it seems like the best part of life is behind you, there still may be a surprise or two in store.

He's charming enough to pull the whole befuddled guy who won't mature. Except in Lyrics and Music, a movie as generic as its title indicates. And even though Drew Barrimore is usually delightful, she can't save this wreck, with a lame plot and unfunny jokes. And what's with the girl who plays Cora? She's a terrible actress, on the plain side, and I couldn't believe for a second that she's a pop star--or a star of any kind for that matter. Couldn't they have hired anyone with at least a modicum of talent? Maybe they spent all the money paying Campbell Scott--at least, I do hope he got paid a lot; otherwise, what's the point of selling out?The introduction video --of the 80s band Pop-- is very funny and the song \\"Don't Write Me Off Just Yet\\" is beautiful, and those are the only two reasons I don't give this lame movie a one-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drew is The Movie","review":"Before anything else I have to say that Drew Barrymore is just beautiful. I mean a woman who could look stunning on a worn out Tee with her hair pulled back, is just beyond us mere mortals.That being said...The movie definitely has its moments that might be considered as funny. The parody of Wham in this films opening scene, I think, is simply amusing. One cannot get enough of the bad fashion sense, choriography, and music video-making of the 1980's.That's just about it. I could see how some reviewer think the cinematography was done beautifully, because they were. I could see how others think that the songs were catchy, because they were.

It was a cliche parody of itself from the beginning. And that is part of what makes it so wonderful. It doesn't try to pretend to be something it't not.Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are thrown together in the oddest and most unlikely of circumstances when Grant, a throwback to the 80's pop music scene, is offered a chance to write a song for an un-and-coming 21st century teen queen that is an almost annoyingly accurate parody of Shakira, Christina Aguilara and a host of other would be starlets you could name.When a struggling Grant can't seem to find the words to express his heart's melody, Barrymore walks in completing a pairing that is as wonderful personally as they are professionally.This is a darling comedy/drama/romance/whatever you'd like to call it...

I seldom buy a DVD or a video unless I think it is worth seeing many times.This is a really nice movie. The figure that Hugh Grant plays reminds me of Andrew of Wham!. The song Meaningless Kiss is absolutely homage toward Careless Whisper. The talented singer Cora Corman is fascinating and makes the movie more enjoyable.At least in Japan, I think most of the people who saw this movie rated excellent.

(Wham! must be turning over in it's . . . wait George Michael and Andrew Ridgley are still alive, sort of.) The synthro drum and the silly cliches in the video took me back 25 years.Yes, this movie is predictable. Yes the plotline will not be a surprise ending, but it never takes a false step and keeps you laughing until the end credits.My one complaint is that the pop-up's at the end are a bit hard to read on the small screen -- but perservere!

Pairing him up with the witless Drew Barrymore didn't help this fallen angel one bit. He is still getting on in years, and it shows. Drew Barrymore's lack of talent also shows. But, when you consider how vapid the plot of this movie was, and how awful the writing, you really can't hold Music and Lyrics against either one of them.

Hugh Grant, who played a rather decrepit 80s popstar - was it that long ago? - must \\"by Friday\\" write a song for \\"Cora\\" (= \\"Brittany/Jessica/Avril/etc.\\"). \\"Cora\\", for some reason, idolizes the fallen star and his music. Grant's problem is that he just can't think of any lyrics. Enter Drew. Well, you know the rest.Grant has all the appeal of any wet, sotted Englishman, could not kindle any kind of chemistry with anyone, let along Drew Barrymore were he given lessons by Clark Gable. (I would not think to mention the other Grant, whom Hugh seems trying to be: he is so far out of his league.)

I do need some level of writing skill and some level of commitment from the actors. These two very attractive and talented people seemed to phone this one in, and it was more a sketch than a fully developed screenplay. There were a few good moments between Grant and Barrymore, but not enough to earn more than two stars. Recommended only for the hardest core fan of these two actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted Romantic Comedy","review":"If you enjoyed the trailer, then you will laugh through this film at the light hearted self-deprecating comedic style of Hugh Grant which fans of his have savored over the years. It's wonderful to see that Hugh is still on top of his game, and Drew Barrymore blends wonderfully into his style to produce a quirky aging rock star flick that has all of us who survived the 80's laughing at ourselves along with the characters.

I was worried about the assembly. I shouldn't have been. The directions came written and with pictures that were very easy to follow. It took the two of us a little over an hour. One person could have put it together, but two worked better for us. It is a sturdy (and very cool) little peddle car. It has 3 size adjustments peddles for child's growth. With no rough edges, it is very well made. I love the peddle action...not rotary. It was very easy for our grandson to master. This very much reminded me of the peddle car my sister and I had growing up.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool looking...Not so cool working...","review":"I bought this car last Christmas for my three-year-old son. I really don't recommend it. Assembly was a little difficult as some of the pieces are held together by small screws and bolts. A couple of these screws snapped when I was tightening them. I had to compromise when attaching the rear wheels to the pedal assembly. If I tightened the wheels too much, it was impossible to move the pedals. Even now, it is still difficult for my son to pedal. I would look for this item in a bicycle shop, and take a test drive before buying it online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriotism in a Soundtrack","review":"Anyone who has seen STRIPES must certainly remember the overall theme music. This is a classic Elmer Bernstein score. Bernstein was a prolific composer who wrote the music for iconic films such as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE GREAT ESCAPE, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, ANIMAL HOUSE and GHOSTBUSTERS. The list goes on and on. As with many of Bernstein's soundtracks, there are some familiar cues in STRIPES. At times I detected hints of THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN and SPIES LIKE US. All the better.Unlike other slap-it-together soundtracks albums for non-blockbuster movies, usually limited to 12 tracks, this CD, as well as its MP3 download, have 20 tracks. The 20th track is actually the Elmer Bernstein music tailored for the movie's coming attractions. Essentially you have the entire film soundtrack.This is a great CD to listen to while on a long drive. The main theme sticks with you long after you shut off the stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a read and as inspiration...","review":"Although I was a little disappointed by the feeling that about 1/3 of the designs shown in the book were all in the article that convinced me to buy it (Critique Magazine), I am about halfway through reading it cover to cover (on the subway to and fro work), and I almost never stop smiling, nodding, or saying, \\"Hrmph\\" during the ride. As a student currently making a rough transition from Apparel Design to Visual Communications, this is the kind of publication that reminds me of why I made that decision.

There are some good pieces, but most of them are out dated. Get this book if you want a history lesson about 80's design. The only good thing about the book are the interviews at the end and that is not worth the price of admission. Phaidon has done me wrong again.

The language is, on the whole, very clear and the methodical approach in which he puts forward his arguments is very persuasive. I recommend reading this along side another historiographical work such as E. H. Carr's 'What is History?' or Richard J. Evans' 'In Defence of History'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent police novel","review":"This book is in keeping with Daley's usual standards of quality, with well-drawn, realisitic characters and relationships, an intricate and twisting plot, and plenty of gritty action.

It offers great tips like keeping frozen onions on hand for use in meals and making beans ahead of time to freeze for future use and to save money. One of my favorite recipes in the book is for Turkey Sausage Stew (p. 85) because it uses ingredients I almost always have on hand in the freezer and they go straight from the freezer to my stockpot. It's a great recipe for company and of course you can freeze the leftovers.

These 17 year olds think that because they swore enough to get a parental advisory sticker on their album that they are punks.What these kids didn't understand is that when punks grow older their music becomes more structured and melodic (i.e. better).

The searing intensity of ELO, Daddy, Ballad, ..., tempered by the rich soaring tones of Mandocello ... the overall package is just sublime.

See why everyone from John Lennon to Smashing Pumpkins loved Cheap Trick from day one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil power pop majesty...","review":"On their debut album, Cheap Trick's masterful pop hooks were cut with a nasty metallic edge that quickly got sanded down on subsequent releases. Rick Nielsen's guitar crackles with a palpable electricity, and the sparse production refuses to add gloss or tidy up in any way. The vocal melodies are Beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by Robin Zander's uncanny ability to sing like both Lennon and McCartney. There's an adult malevolence at work here that is completely at odds with the harmless cartoon the band became.

The first day we used them our girl clutched on with a little help, and through one year she would play with them and hold on while eating. Better than a smooth bottle to learn how to grab on. We have since bought the \\"training cup\\" or whatever it's called from Avent, and I was happy to see that these handles transition to the cup, too. It's always nice when a product has a longer life, especially when it's for babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy But Good","review":"I bought this product based on the good reviews and I have to agree that it works great. It cuts very easily and without the pizza moving around too much. It gets through thick crust wonderfully. The only drawback was that it was a little too heavy for a pizza cutter. It feels like a metal paperweight. But, it works great, so I can't complain too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The performances are dull and dragging, but the greatest problem with this collection is the 3rd Symphony, whose first HALF of its 2nd movement have been CUT! (If you're not familiar with this piece, that includes about 7 minutes of music). For serious Beethoven fans, there are many fabulous and exciting box sets of Beethoven's Symphonies, Szell, Karajan (1963 recording), even Solti, and then Gardiner and Hogwood on period instruments (the latter two are such fast performances as to be especially thrilling). For those new to classical music and Beethoven, I'd recommend buying the symphonies one at a time, maybe even from some of the conductors listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T GET IT","review":"This collection may seem enticing to someone who would like to become familiar with classical music without spending a lot of money. I bought this many years ago before I knew a whole lot about classical music, for the price. The Beethoven symphonies will provide you with a lifetime of musical enjoyment and appreciation. Get one of the best collections available: Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can NOT follow the math and NO CODE!","review":"You better already know the basics of Monte Carlo Simulationto get anything out of the book.I STRONGLY disagree with one reviewer who thinksall one needs to know is :1) The definition of Brownian Motion and2) What a Probability distribution is.FAT chance.The book requires knowing Linear Algebra, Probability,PDEs, Stochastic Modelling, and SDEs to be of any use.Where's the CODE, baby!There are very few examples put into code!One reviewer on Amazon.com, says the book is sodetailed you don't need code. Funny, I have neverseen anything \\"so detailed\\" that an example (code)would make the explanation less clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is pretty good as it covers lots of different areas of Monte Carlo simulation and some of the newer stuffs, such as copulae, etc. The math presentation is brief but to the point as application of the mathematics to Monte Carlo methods is the emphasis. Intuitive ideas behind the formula is explained pretty well as it tells you where certain formula can be used for. It would be helpful to have taken an advanced course in Monte Carlo methods in Finance to appreciate the book. I would personally suggest Glasserman's course at Columbia U. Prof Glasserman is also writing a book on the subject that he uses for lecture notes now.

The first story was perhaps the stongest from a narrative point of view. It was also the most suspenseful. I must say, I did not see that ending coming. The second story was the most emotional.

How like so many other individuals of noteriety through the centuries, her grandiose popularity not only had to hidden behind disguise, but added to the torment that continually plagued her. I believe Ms. Simmons depictions were written with sincerity. Confessing with sadness of the erosion of her relationship to Diana shortly before her death, left this close friend and comrade without the closure so many others were left with on August 31, 1997."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, insightful and under-rated","review":"What an under rated book this is. I've just finished reading it, after Paul Burrell's book in which he speaks so well of Miss Simmons' friendship with Princess Diana. Although I'd heard of the book, but not Ms. Simmons, I took Burrell's mention of her as a recommendation.I was surprised that some of the so-called \\"new\\" revelations in our newspapers and on our TV, were first written about in this book which was published in 1998.I found this a genuine and very warm account of a close personal friendship between the author and the Princess. I'm just sorry I never read this earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make a few dollars out of sensational gossip!","review":"I love the way that the author tries to justify herself at the start of the book by saying that Diana wanted her to write this book.Somehow I doubt that Diana would have been anxious for a trusted employee to let the world know that Diana went out without underwear on when she was wearing tight clothing or that she suffered from regular bouts of PMT. Too much information! - not things that a loyal friend would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"load of bunkum","review":"This is the biggest load of trash I have ever read.

I always feel very clean after using it, it's vegan, and it's pretty cheap. It also lasts much longer than other vegan soaps I've tried--the bar is pretty hefty. Also, it lathers really well. I don't have sensitive skin, so I can't speak to whether it is safe to use on sensitive skin--I just always buy fragrance-free everything because it annoys me to have 12 different scents on me from all the products I use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"With a name like \\"Kiss My Face\\" I was hoping for soap with a pleasant smell but it smells like wet cardboard.

Shanachie, correct me if I'm wrong, is new to the DVD business but has been manufacturing CD's for years which is probably what they should stick to. For \\"Car 54\\" the four DVD's of this set are not even mounted on spindles. Instead they are placed on top of each other with no protection and only a slight plastic tab to provide tension to hold them in place. When I first opened the package, two of the DVD's immediately fell out and landed on the floor - of course they're scratched now. The other two DVD's also became scratched when I removed them from the box because you actually have to slide them against one another to remove them - guaranteed scratches everytime you view them."},{"rating":"1","title":"car 54 where are you?","review":"THE FIRST TIME ON DVD WHAT A SCREW UP THIS COMPANY SHOULD REDO THE FIRST SEASON AND SEND A NEW COPY WITH THE SHOW IN THE PROPER ORDER IT WAS MADE AND SEND THE PROPER ORDER DVD SET TO THE PEOPLE WHO ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON.COM AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE INCORRECT EPISODE ORDER THEY PUT THE EPISODE ORDER LIKE THIS DISC#1 EPISODE 6,19,15,23 26,24,25,5.

The preview summary, which is on the back cover of the book, doesn't hold true to the book's contents at all. The true main characters are not even mentioned in the preview. Also, the most disappointing thing about this book is the fact that the first 80% of the book was wasted in building up a suspense drama, only to be abruptly converted into some secret romance novel at the end.

Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have passed....","review":"I found all the characters in Passing to be very superficial and unrealistic. I am not denying that this type of discrimination exists, but the author did a poor job portraying the lives of the characters. The story was about everbody and nobody.

She's always had a problem with those of us who were not darked skinned and did everything she could do to \\"pass\\" as she grew up. She was phony and had the strangest family of misfits. This sounds like a biography. I am glad to hear that she has a life because her cancer caused her a lot of grief when she was 16. I hope she decides to write something different the next time although I don't know if it will be possible since I hear she is still color struck with her near white husband.

This was an excellent, well-formed story about class. You always know about these certain types, but I know that I've never been subjected to it, and Ms. Jones made it very clear. Whether it was a tad-bit exaggerated or right on the mark, I loved it. A lot of people say the title is misleading, but I don't think it was. The word passing can have many different meanings, we just decided to go with the most obvious. After reading the book, you found that Eulelie wasn't passing for white, yet she was passing off as something she was not and bread her children in the way she transformed, so in actuality, the title fit perfectly. This made me think in a bigger realm of our world and how racism and things of the sort are \\"passed\\" down to children who don't know otherwise, except from what they over-hear or were taught. This book was great because it makes you wonder who's who, and if who you think they are really is who they are.

I thought it was a fascinating insight into a world filled with class prejudices. I liked how Eulelie's humanity was brought out in bits and pieces causing me to feel pity and sympathy despite all her wrong doings. I haven't given it five stars for two reasons. I thought the characters could have been more developed, even Eulelie and especially the daughters. I also thought the characterizations of the uptight, snobbish upper middle class African-American family represented by Eulelie and the saintly, generous, forgiving working class African-Americans represented by Sandra's family and friends were too definite in their stark differences. One was all bad, the other all good and no in-between. The book could have been even better if there had been more complexity in the characters and by blurring the line of good and bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookie Making Resources","review":"Grandma and Ben are making cookies--from scatch--starting with the cow. Grandma shows Ben the source of all the ingredients in their honey cookies. This excellent story is illustrated with bright energetic paintings and provides young children with an understanding of natural, human, and capital resources necessary to create a favorite food. These basic economic concepts are taught in many elementary schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive but difficult to read","review":"The book contains hundreds of photographs from the air war over Europe (1942-45), many of them never before published, as well as a wealth of first hand accounts of the terrible sky battles. The main drawback of the book is that editors tried hard to put too much text in the pages, resulting in a very small letter font which really made me grow tired after reading a few pages each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much minutia, not enough strategic picture","review":"This book has an enormous amount of small details (i.e., exact airwings participating in specific battles, etc.). The problem is that there is so much of this detail that it bores and swamps the reader with respect to the greater picture. There should have been much more emphasis on strategic considerations and history at higher level. If you are a deep and serious history buff in this niche of history then this book would be a four star for you but, for aforementioned reasons, for the general history interested in overview of the subject the book would only rank one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor","review":"I just purchased this at a Home Depot for, get this $169. It was on close out. I just got the last of 3 remaining. I thought I would have to get a new video card but didn't. It loaded easy and works perfect. This is a wide screen but for now the picture does not fill in completly. I have a black margin left & right about 1\\" or so. I have not hooked it up to a TV, I'm just enjoying it off the 10 yr. old Gateway CP. Keep your eye out if this goes on close out. It was not advertised just sitting up in front of the store. So you never know!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool industrial design, poor engineering.","review":"I bought this monitor from j and r over the phone which saved my 10 dollars on my purchase and since i live in nyc i picked it up from the store, downtown. I was so excited to plug it up noticing how beautiful the outside design was beautiful. I hooked everything up and found the picture to be terrible. I fixed the contrast, brightness to the best possible and the picture became a bit more clear however, i still noticed the blurriness whenever there was fast motion and text is still pretty blurry. In addition, the picture is very grainy and does not have much color depth.I thought maybe it was just the TV, but I was wrong. I used the monitor function, and found the quality of the monitor was even worse! I tested some text by opening an internet explorer window. The text seemed to blur every other character, and when I moved the window around the blurriness would move as well.Overall, this monitor is mediocre and will be returning it promptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect picture and great deal!!!","review":"I also purchased my computer from J&R in Manhattan but I found no problems with mine. The image when using it as a computer monitor is the best ever because its shown in High definition, and used as a tv monitor it's great. Being it's an Lcd it's not meant to be viewed right next to it. If you stand atleast 3-4 feet away you'll see a huge difference and an excellent picture. I have mine hooked up to my digital cable with and s-video line and the image is just as good as my 36\\" sony tv. I would recomend this just because of it's great price, plus there is a(...).

Also, it's a nice large bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first thing noticeable about this product is ...","review":"The first thing noticeable about this product is the smell. It's very medicinal and not appealing at all. I used it for three days until I just couldn't stand the smell anymore. If you can get past that, it's very soothing, lathers nicely, and leaves skin soft. Because of the smell alone, I don't think I'd purchase this product again or suggest it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR WHISTLING OR SINGING ALONG","review":"The gifted Richard Hayman (Boston Pops arranger for more than 30 years) offers an interesting collection of holiday favourites. The back cover says \\"Orchestra and Chorus\\" - beware, there is no chorus. The sub-title \\"Philharmomic Symphony Orchestra\\" is rather pedantic. Why not simply \\"Richard Hayman and His Orchestra\\"? The opening and closing numbers are sing-along medleys... the liner notes offer the words. Two Leroy Anderson numbers receive a fair treatment: SLEIGH RIDE and SONG OF THE BELLS, the latter being played rrather slowly. There is a beautiful rendition of MUSIC BOX DANCER, the only version I know that uses the music box. The counter-melody is too loud and takes away the charm of the main theme. A few compositions by the conductor himself. A great collection for tree-trimming, whistling or singing along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"It was not a boxed set; only 1 CD. I had the boxed set previously (at least 4 discs as I recall, maybe 5 or 6).

Nicholas is a toddler and Goldie is the big sister. Veronica is her doll. When Nicholas sucked on Veronica's head, Goldie yelled, \\"Veronica hates baby spit. I hate baby spit!\\"When Goldie gets mad, she (and Veronica, of course) have bad thoughts -- like making Nicholas disappear. But, when Nicholas is good, Veronica loves him, and Goldie does, too! A time-out makes Goldie and her doll realize that they are really sorry.This book deals with the real emotions that little children have. Addressing them in a humorous manner, which also shows that they are not right, makes Goldie is Mad a winner in any household with young children. Adorable illustrations and very clever writing make this book a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get beyond the hate.","review":"This book was in an \\"emotions themed\\" pack sold by Scholastic. The other two books, Today I Feel Silly: And Other Moods That Make My Day and The Way I Feel were great. Goldie is Mad however will not be read a second time in our home simply because the girl in this story can not navigate her anger in any other way but to say that she \\"hates\\" her little brother. I know that my preschooler has used this word in the past however when the issue came up we discussed how we should not \\"hate\\" anyone or anything and thus she needed to find a new way to express her frustration. When reading this book for the first time we came to the page which states that \\"Veronica hates baby spit. I hate baby spit. I hate Nicholas!,\\" my preschooler gasped and said \\"That is not a nice way to talk about your brother, is it Mom?\\" Simply stated, we will not be keeping a book in our house which endorses the concept of hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Starter SR7533N","review":"After 142,000 miles with the original starter, a new one was long overdue. The OEM solenoid for many Cougars and T-Birds of the early 90s are notorious for retaining moisture, which impedes the operation of the starter. I would turn the ignition switch and nothing would happen. I would hold the key and after a number of seconds, the starter would engage. Even though the starter worked, I was tired of waiting for the solenoid to do its job. And unfortunately, the solenoid is attached to the starter. I shopped around for a new unit and compared makes. I've purchased Bosch products in the past, so I was less hesitant to buy that brand. The price offered by Amazon was unbeatable, the free shipping was fast, and the starter came with a 2 year roadside assistance. After it was installed, it was easy to tell that lots of power was getting to the solenoid/starter, and no hesitation. It's a great product, at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wunderbar!","review":"Rick and Ade in this Video take slapstick to new level, in fact so far that eventually C4 pulled the plug.

I have a Canon Vixia HF G10 inside it and I've been able to put all the accessories in the pockets all around this bag. Doesn't leave much room on the inside when the camcorder is in there, but this is actually what I wanted out of a camcorder bag; to hold it in there snugly and safely just in case. I own photography equipment which I carry around in a photographer bag and this pouch can actually fit right inside it making it easier to carry around with me along with my other goodies. That bag is also a Lowpro, Slingshot 200 (newer version is 202), which I also highly recommend.

Indeed, Harold Budd's influence on Mr. Fink grew into an interesting expression. I would recommend this CD to be listened in moments of solitude and contemplation. I would also consider it a good source of inspiration in moments when the creative spirit takes over our thoughts. The 9th track performed with Marty Walker creates an ambiance full of mystery and if compared with the rest of the CD has a much deeper sound than the solo pieces.

I'm constantly in the fortunate but also difficult position of having to refuse prospective students. As such I am constantly keen to offer a viable, productive alternative to student singers who I can't facilitate. One of my first pieces of advice to them is ; \\"YOU CANNOT LEARN SINGING FROM A BOOK\\". If regular singing lessons are outside your budget, use a birthday or christmas present to pay for a 'consultation' with the BEST singing teacher you can find. Get guidance from him/her on excercises and repertoire and take it from there. A book can't hear - it can't advise - nor can it nurture! Good Luck!

The Dummies series is known for its unique ability to take technically complex subject matter and break the concepts down in a simple, clear and entertaining way. This book is no exception. While Pamelia S. Phillips does a wonderful job of tackling in-depth topics, I think most beginners will have a difficult time digesting and applying all of the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, helpful, and easy to read + excellent CD!","review":"I've always wanted to learn more about singing and this did the trick.

If you want to learn how to sing for a rock band, it is definitely not. The people who sing the exercises and samples on the CD are opera and musical theater singers. Most of the exercises are extremely lame and haven't helped me in the least. I found one or two chapters to be of interest, and that's the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Way too much of the text in the book is what I consider filler, nothing that's going to help me improve my singing. All in all, my recommendation is to not waste good money on this book. Buy it used, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for live singing lessons","review":"After trying this book, I am convinced that nothing compares to live singing lessons. Although chapters are written fluidly and are an easy read, real singing improvement after finishing seems minimal compared with the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring to read and very limited with regard to style","review":"Although there is some factual info that one can learn from, the book is very boring to read. This book only places focus on singing in one style which is the style of singing they tried to teach you in high school chorus class. There is no contempory point of view such as Rock singing and all in all I think there are much better books out there. Mark Baxter's book is much more informative and is much more to fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK OVERALL","review":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK OVERALL.

I thought it was going to talk about how to sing. It had plenty of info. about posture, music vocabulary words, and what to expect from singing different types of music but the stuff about actual singing seemed to me more like something for the beginning of a chorus class or something. It just explained what stuff is but not exactly how to do it. There are some other books that explain more about your voice and specifics about how to sing. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good resource","review":"This book is a great overview of singing for the beginner. (Not that singers are Dummies) When starting off without a teacher it is great to pull from as many resources as possible to get a feel for correct singing.Check Out:Vocalize!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting point","review":"Great book overall. The author got to the point and didn't over-emphasize any part that wasn't important or relevant. The only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because my voice teacher disagrees with some aspects, so until I can figure out who's right and who's wrong, I don't know which way to sway. But the CD is by far the best part. After reading the whole book and getting the recommended songs, I still do the CD occasionally. The only gripe I have about the CD is there's no just straight out warm-up session. It's all practice, no warm-ups, which would have made the CD useful after you've learned what you can from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"M1 booklet","review":"The booklet was just OK The price delivered was horrendous.

She lacks vocal range and you can hear it when the back up singers carry her inability to hit certain notes. This song has a fun beat, but the target market is musically narrow minded. A producer genius for a husband, good marketing and a savvy to bridge the Pop/Country gap add to her popularity. But when the cookie crumbles, musical ability is mediocre at best. She's just another pretty face, and that don't impress me much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beat, voice, and mean-I like Shaniah!","review":"Twain writes of what she wants to see in a guy. I think this entire album is made up of perfect songs for everyone to rock to. It is a great album, because you are filling up and finishing off what your own basic expectations are about rich snottish people. It brings you to where looks and stuff isn't all you look for. Twain also has great music and beatwith her strong voice. She will be hangin' with the top 10 for a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here We Go Again","review":"From an album of bad songs comes what turns out to be the worst of all. At first I thought the treacly You're Still The One was the worst - compare Shania's version with the solid 1970s rocker of the same title to see how bad Shania's is - but Don't Impress surpasses it in idiocy. Not only does it basically urge women to sell themselves short for the sake of some action, the song fails in and of itself. Shania's singing lacks any kind of believable depth, suffering from a nauseating slur throughout. The backing track is like something from Weird Al Yankovic - for that matter, this song and its parent album deserve the Weird Al treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Country","review":"Yeah, this is country... and that's where it needs to stay.

The first time I opened the kit to take stuff out, the nail clippers broke. The bulb syringe seemed a bit stiff as well, but I never got the chance to use it since I took it back before my baby was born. Now that my son is 6 months old, I realize I would not have used half of the stuff in there. The only things I use often are nail clippers, files, nasal aspirator and a brush. You can buy better ones for less than the whole kit. Also, the hospital will provide you with a better nasal aspirator than anyone you can buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless. Very disappointed!!!","review":"I got this on my registry and was disappointed when I used it. The thermometer does not work. The nail clipper is of adult size and not made for infants. The nasal aspirator is too hard to use. The comb is too big for my baby's head. Nothing worked as I had expected. I would have returned it if I kept the packaging. I had to go out and get another set to use on my baby. Please don't buy or register for it. It's a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific set","review":"I received this set as a gift. I do agree with one of the reviewers you get some of the items in the hospital, however, we didn't get all of the items and when you're a new parent pressed for time, it's awfully convenient to have everything you need packed into one kit.The one \\"add on\\" that we put into the kit ourselves was a digital ear thermometer. Other than that, it had everything we needed.It's great for travel, and the items are well made and attractive in appearance. It would make a terrific gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"I got this for my baby shower and was very disappointed when I opened it. I know the clippers and thermometer are necessities, so was excited to see that this kit came with both of us. However, when I opened it I realized that the clippers and thermometer are both cheaply made, therefore I will have to purchase them both separately. Everything else is just \\"fluff\\" that you don't really need. Most of it you will get from the hospital and a syringe comes with all medicines you will buy. Save your money...buy clippers and thermometer separately and don't worry about the rest...you don't need it or you'll get it from the hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it + clippers are scary","review":"This kit provides all the essentials, yes. But some simply don't work or, worse, they work badly. In the case of the medicine dropper having unreliable suction, so be it. However, the nail clippers are dangerous. I thought it was just my new mommy lameness that caused me to snip off the end of my baby's thumb. Then I bought some generic nail clippers for a couple of bucks that were so much easier to use, and don't result in spewing blood. The bulb syringe is pointless and doesn't compare to the one provided to us in the hospital. Likewise for the thermometer. Some of the grooming and teething items are useful, but you can pick up comparable or better ones anywhere. Overall, if you want a kit, I'd say avoid this one and try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"The thing I use most in this kit is the hair brush. The nail files are okay. The medicine dropper was useless. It wouldn't suction up any medicine. The fingernail clipper is also useless. It's just an adult-sized one with an attachment. Should have gotten a baby-specific and -sized one even though right now I'm just trying to file their nails rather than clip then (on their pediatrician's advice). I'm using the nasal aspirators that we took from the hospital, which I'm told are the best. So, in all, if I were to do it again, I'd just buy the pieces one-by-one rather than in this kit since I haven't used much of it, and the parts that I have used, have mostly unimpressed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really necessary","review":"to all first time mothers: this product is really not necessary! i bought it and im only using daily the brush and the nail clippers.

After 2 months I haven't used a single thing. The nail clipper is an adult size, and I had to buy a baby one (about $2 at the drug store). The emery boards didn't work at all on the baby's soft nails. I use the nasal aspirator from the hospital. The baby bathtub we have has a built-in temperature sensor, but it is easy enough to just feel the water and know if it is right. Maybe once the baby is older, things in this kit will come in handy. Don't bother putting it on your registry- there are more important items that you need and this is a lot of money for nothing very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Variety Not So Good Quality","review":"I like the variety this product offers, but after only using the nail clippers a couple of times, they broke- the top unsnaped from the bottom and I was unable to put it back together.

Also liked that the clipers have a large grip handle to them. I am thinking these kits come in various colors but if not I would just like to suggest that maybe they could make them in green, blue, pink and yellow as well. I like the purple, just thinking along the lines that some people are picky about colors go for boys & girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good set","review":"I received this as a shower gift. It's pieces are overall very useful- but some of them are rather bulky for use on a newborn. I attempted to use the clippers and the scissors- both were too big and clumsy for use on a small fingernail.The thermometer and the medicine droppers are great, and the rubber grips make them easier to use. The set is very attractive- if that makes it more appealing to you. But it may be more economical and easier to assemble your own kit with the best of individual tools. I reccommend a small curved nail scissor for your newborn- the kind you would find in an adult's manicure set. Very dainty and precise for use on tiny little nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy set","review":"The Nail cutter broke right after being taken out of the case....when I tried to flip it over. Buy these products individually and you can ensure better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, it's nice to have all the items, if they weren't cheaply made.","review":"There are a few things in this kit I use all of the time...The nail clipper I love, the hair brush my 9 month old loves (I don't know why, but he finds it fascinating). But overall, this is cheaply made, and overpriced to boot. It's all made in china, I'm pretty sure it's not bpa free (I will never let my baby use the included teether or toothbrush), and some of it just doesn't work (for us, that would be the nasal aspirator-the free one we got from the hospital was far superior- and the thermometer, which broke after three uses, never read correctly). Seriously, go to target and look at other kits, or take my advice and buy each item separately..you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it because of the nail clippers","review":"I agree that the majority of things in this kit are worthless. I think the only things I have used are hairbrush, comb, toothbrush and nail clippers. I have to say that I love the nail clippers! I have had mine for almost two years now and they are the best. I have tried other clippers and they just don't compare. Definitely worth it because of the nail clippers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this because...","review":"I love the in tub thermometer!! My husband and I live overseas and do not have the benefit of experience or a grandmothers helping hand. I was really nervous about the temperature of the bath but this made it so ease. The suction cup sticks to the plastic bath surface and the metal sink perfectly!! I haven't tried most of the other things but the themometer makes it worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"seriously you only need baby nail scissors, clippers, a thermometer, and a bulb syringe...you get a bulb syringe from the hospital and a comb, too...the other things in the kit i haven't used...ask other mom and find out the items you really need and just buy those...for the money...not a good value"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"The very first time I used the nail clippers, they broke! The bulb syringe is worthless. It was way to hard to depress and the suction was not good. Thankfully I took one home from the hospital. The nail scissors work OK but they are hard to use because the handle is so big.I haven't attempted to use anything else except the brush which is fine. I found the whole set to be worthless and cheaply made. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend to anyone.","review":"Nasal aspirator is too hard, and is of no use(the free one from the hospital is much better). The nail clipper is too big for a baby. The medicine dropper is also lousy. Hair Brush is only thing I like.It has soft bristles ideal for baby. Did not use other stuff. I do regret spending money on this. Would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap!","review":"I got this last weekend at my shower. I took it out to look at all the little pieces. The nail clippers came apart, the tweezers don't line up and the sticker on the thermometer is bent and crooked. I will be returning it and looking for something that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I read the reviews for this set and was looking forward to having all of my baby's needs in one package. Unfortunately, many of the items don't work. The nail clippers, the nasal aspirator and the dropper are very weak. Most of the rest of these items you can buy individually and be guaranteed of the quality. I would not recommend purchasing this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a waste of money","review":"Your much better off getting another all in one kit. This kit hardly works. Everything just seems to big for the baby, the nail clipper the comb, the brush. The nail clipper works better on adults than infants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary and poor quality","review":"Nail clippers broke after a few uses. As for everything else, I rarely use any of the items...practically everything in the kit will be given to you when you take your baby home from the hospital. I thought it seemed like a smart idea to register for this. No one needs to waste their money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so products","review":"I picked this set apart and most of the pieces never get used. The aspirator is too stiff and hard to clean. The clippers are pretty good. The sissors are too bulky. The tweezers aren't sharp enough. And the medicine dropper is too stiff to use. I bought a separate 10 second themomoter so this one is now my back-up. As a set its not worth the money, buy the pieces individually you get much better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a neccesity","review":"I put this on my baby registry cause I thought it would be useful, but I found that it really isn't. The only things I use are the comb, brush, and nailclippers. The nasal aspirator is very weak. When you get medicine from your pharmacy they give you the measuring tools, and you're not supposed to use any other than what they give you. Other than the brush, and comb it just looks really nice on the bathroom cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh.","review":"I probably would have gotten better quality if i would have bought a kit for the same price at Walmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is another Must","review":"This is another must, I LOVE the brush and the nail clippers, they are perfect for her little fingers and she loves chewing on the handle of the tooth cleaner.

I wonder why? Im still waiting to hear back when they would send it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"The thermometer didn't work, and neither did the room temperature gauge (I think that was what it was, there was no instruction booklet). The nasal aspirator is too hard to depress. The brush works fine and is soft enough, and the nail clippers aren't bad. I'd buy those 2 items separate and get a digital ear thermometer -- I've been through 2 digital thermometers and my daughter hates for me to take her temp under her \\"wing.\\" You can use your own nail files and tweezers and a comb was unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not what you really need.","review":"I have to admit when my cousin and I first saw this in the store we both wanted it. It looks nice because everything matches. But then we started to really look at what is in there. Yes we both agreed that you need a blub, but then with both of our children we received them at the hospital. The tooth brush is not the type you would use for a newborn/infant. Medicine dropers and spoons...again if your baby needs meds you receive a despenser. My cousin then pointed out the water temp. gauge. I looked at her and asked if there was something wrong with her elbow. Point taken and we moved on to the digital thermometer. She stated that the ones she has had have never lasted that long. So yes it looks nice and comes all together, but when we got down to it it didn't have what we really needed or wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chopin - Truely one of the all time greats!","review":"I was brought upon this 2 disc collection on the fact that the movie \\"The Truman Show,\\" featured the title, from disc 1, \\"Romance: Larghetto!\\" It's also on the truman show soundtrack. So after hearing this music over and over I decided to buy a album from other music the composer of that piece did. My choice was this one and what a good choice it was. You'll be very pleased with the results. I highly recomend it to all you chopin and classical music lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, really.","review":"The topic and the story line are really compelling--there's so much potential. The note on the cover that it's an Irish Bestseller sets readers up with very high expectations. For me, though, the storytelling was bland: not enough vivid description to really put me there (and there's SO much opportunity for this, what with the contrast between the open and wild western part of Ireland and stuffy, confined Dublin) and a lot of awkward dialogue (with a great many exclamation points!) makes the characters seem stilted. There are quite a few moments where things are repeated, or explained so similarly to other things that much of the story's potential momentum is lost. I'm glad I read it, for the topic, but I was hoping for a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective BirthControl for Teenagers","review":"A lot of feeling sorry for yourself in this book and no redeemable characters. Society was a lot harder on teenager pregancy 50 years ago, especially in Ireland. The nuns provided a home for these girls and I'm sure the nuns didn't live so much better than the girls themselves. This wasn't 1990s America. I guess I'm not such a fan of having teenagers \\"bring their babies to school every day\\" and \\"playing parents\\" as is accepted today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good foundation textbook","review":"This textbook clearly presents the health issues specific to urban living. It provides an excellent foundation for a range of urban health topics. I find the extensive references at the end of each chapter to be especially useful as a springboard for deeper investigation when needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great quality...Extra large fit.","review":"Bought these pants in a 30w 30l for my boyfriend. We have purchased Ben Davis brand items before, ie. work apron, vest. The quality is excellent but the fit on the pants was extremely too large. He looked like he was swimming in them, even after ordering his correct size. These pants must be made for larger individuals. We are disappointed that they aren't true to size because they are really nice pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad customer service","review":"The item I received wasn't good.. quality wasn't great..The merchant will not respond to my emails requesting a return label..I will never buy from this company again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received in pieces!","review":"Received the product quickly but was unusable. Package contained two. One was cracked in many pieces and crumbled in my hand. The other was badly chipped. I decided not to return as the cost to repackage, take to post office and pay to ship would probably be more than item cost. So, they are in trash. I wasted my money....don't waste yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Craft Warnings","review":"Slow and dreamy. Track 2 reminiscient of Underworld's Born Slippy. Overall, this cd is very relaxing. Almost too relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!","review":"I got this recording while I was on vacation. My dad was visiting his friends, so he just dropped me off at Borders Books and Music..... so, I went in and looked around. I saw so many Sarah Brightman top hits, and thought \\"Wow! I really hope they have that Christmas in Vienna thing\\". Well, as I was cruising through the store, I all the sudden saw \\"A GALA CHRISTMAS IN VIENNA\\" sitting there.... since I had just ordered SB's new CD \\"Eden\\", I knew my mom wouldn't let me get the CD..... I begged her over and over again, and she FINALLY let me get it..... This is the best album.... get it if you can!Jeff"},{"rating":"1","title":"humorously horrible","review":"This album is so wretched it made me laugh. In the store I looked at the artists and the songs and thought it would provide nice holiday music. I put it on when I got home and wondered if maybe Spike Jones had slipped in some joke tunes. I can't believe these people sound so bad. Sure, some of the numbers are very nice, but then you split a gut laughing at the others--or worse, cringing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleasant.","review":"After unsuccessfully trying to enjoy this CD over the past several years, I finally decided to throw it in the trash -- and write a review to share with you all. This may have been enjoyable as a simple TV variety show, but it's unpleasant to listen to as a CD. The vocalists have such different styles and degrees of quality, that they don't belong on the same CD. The different types of songs are jarring when put on the same CD. The pairing of some of these vocalists with some of these songs is downright unpleasant. The orchestra music is simplistic, non-nuanced, and does not stand on its own; it is simply at the service of the vocalists, with songs generally starting with the briefest of orchestral introductions before some vocalist starts belting out the words. I give it 2 stars, because the title still gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling -- I LOVE the idea of Christmas in Vienna!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Noise","review":"I tried several times to use this cable with a couple of Ipods and amplifiers, and I simply could not use it because of a strong noise (I don't know, but its like a ground loop noise). I will try to change the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great documentary","review":"This edition of the High Times Cannabis Cup DVD is much more of a documentary style video than the one made in 2003 which contained a lot of strange outtakes. The overall quality is also much better and this is a very well made and entertaining video as well. Good commentary from the select cast about the behind the scenes of the event and about some of the culture of Amsterdam, as well as some stories of their experiences in the city during their visit. It goes inside the coffee shops, gets into some of the politics of the event and gives a good in depth look at how it all works. Overall a really well made film and would definitely reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally misrepresentation of actual necklace","review":"My necklace just arrived and I feel very angry. It is NOT the same one as listed in the photo at all. The chain is smaaller and thinner than the one advertised, and the toggle hook is much smaller and cheaper looking,as well. This is a huge misrepresentation of what you actually get. For the price, I feel like I've been ripped off.I make a lot of jewelry purchases and this is the first time this has ever happened to me. It is NOT worth the money and not what I was expecting to recieve for what I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and not scary in the least.","review":"Giant, indestructable, maneating crabs move into a loch and begin tearing apart the tourists. Guy N. Smith is a terrible writer and this is a terrible book. Gross and so badly written it reads as a parody of the genre Smith is so crassly exploiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey but good","review":"I would have given it a full 5 stars if not for the exorbitant price! I teach HS Biology and was never really satisfied with videos regarding protists - they were either too juvenile or very technical for my level of students. I think this video is just about right for the age group I teach. The video is a bit dry at times but does include the classification of protists as well as their ecological importance. A brief segment includes human diseases caused by protists. But, honestly - sixty bucks for a single DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A all around good book.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I love the fact that Ian Nottingham(who is turning out to be my favorite character) returns in this chapter of the witchblade. And also whenever Sonatine is involved you can believe there is bound to be a good storyline. My only gripe is that Witchblade spends a lot of time developing storyline and not enough on action I would like to see a little more action in the next titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable Ref. for Admins of large AND small networks","review":"The volume of relevant background information contained in this book is impressive. What is even more helpful, however, are the detailed instructions for what to do in case of failure. I never knew there were so many options for recovery. There are many tips included to help you avoid certain modes of failure, as well as suggestions on how to take a proactive approach in dealing with the inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for Tchaikovsky fans","review":"This 4-CD set is a great compilation of work from this Russian composer. The pieces include the last 3 symphonies, the entire Serenade for Strings, the famous first Piano Concerto, and the more popular parts of the Swan Lake and Nutcracker ballets. The style is symphonic in a studio; i.e. no audience clapping in the background. The sound is quite nice, and very rich; of the various recordings of the Serenade for Strings; this is the only one I've heard that performs it with an entire symphony. Altogether enjoyable and worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the $","review":"Make sure you get all 4 discs. The labels are almost all alike except for text on the bottom of them; sometime the sellers get confused. If you can find this, it should be cheap (~$4 with shipping for all 4 discs) It's worth every penny; DDD and well-mixed, full and rich. Maybe stylistically not as good as some, but all in all, very listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I received","review":"I do not know whether the 4 cd's box set of \\"A Tchaikovsky Festival\\" ASIN B000003QW7 as advertised in Amazon's web page is good or bad, because I only received 1 cd (supposedly the number 3 of the box set). The only available action was to return the cd (unopened), for a refund (and not an replacement for the item I bought) which I did. The seller answered very politely that (my order) \\"was fulfilled by Amazon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda","review":"This \\"documentary\\" was highly selective in the material chosen to represent and reinforce the producer's predetermined conclusions. Having been to Angola numerous times to visit inmates, it is obvious to me that the producers of this film have a very negative agenda that does not mirror the reality of today's Angola. Injustice exists, to be sure, but the vast conspiracy mentality is indefensible. Broad strokes were used to paint a very negative and false portrayal of the warden and the institution. A waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite book","review":"Even though I don't read much in this genre anymore, this still has to be my all time favorite book. The characters are written with such life to them that I could picture them clearly in my mind. With each page I fell more and more in love with the story of two such total opposites finding each other. It's a heartwarming tale about a bunch of misfits that come together to form the strangest family you ever wanted to meet, from the prim and proper milliner to the rakish saloon owner, to the former prostitutes, and let's not forget the old, superstitious mammy.I let someone borrow my copy years ago, and just couldn't get this story out of my mind, so about two years ago I found a copy in a local bookstore and nabbed it up. My \\"new\\" copy is just as tattered as the first one was, and I'm not lending it out this time. I highly recommend this story for someone who is looking for a true \\"romance\\" or \\"love story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with several other reviews. The first part of the book was good. However, it became a CHORE to finish. I finally gave up, skimmed through the last few chapters to get to the end which was so pollyanna ridiculous I was disturbed that I even bothered to finish it.I have read Years and Hummingbird by Ms Spencer and really enjoyed them. This book does not hold a candle to either of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!!","review":"Oh my, what a book. Lavyrle Spencer creates some of the most realistic and likeable characters Ive ever met.I absolutely LOVED Scott and Agatha together. I always adore Spencer's Heroines;They are flawed and so human. The writing was,as usual,incredible. The books pacing was perfect and the scenery and all of the characters were so colorful they nearly jumped out of the pages. Only one thing bothered me about this book and that was the situation with Justine- it felt thrown in...otherwise...PERFECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gamble was Worth it","review":"Wow! This love story was like none other! I have read many romance novels, but this one surpass them all. I'm so happy that Agatha isn't drop dead gorious like many heroines in other stories, but she is actually human! Thank goodness! Everyone should read this because it will always be in your heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read for lovers of romance novels.","review":"This is one of my favorite books in her collection. I have read it many times. Miss Spencer makes me relive the wonder of falling in love each time I read one of her romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"This is a great read. Very sweet and interesting. It is a touching story and I put it up there with my top reads of late along with Fantasy Lover by Kenyon and Anything, My love by Cynthia Simmons. All page turners you shouldn't miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than How To Eat","review":"While the author's first book, How To Eat, gave an overview of the entire cooking process with some desserts thrown in, How to be a Domestic Goddess focuses entirely on baking. Being a domestic goddess she says, (and I paraphrase) is returning to a basic love for cooking minus the hassles of daily life.Lawson's trademarks are evident here with her conversational style and easy to follow recipes - (you must try the dense (fallen)chocolate cake: it is superb). Aside from the usual baking sections, there is a chapter devoted to recipes that children will have fun helping out with as well as a holidays section.This book is hardback and printed on beautiful glossy paper. The photos are well-lighted and look so real that they jump off the page and will make you rush to your kitchen. This is definitely a better and more focused book than How To Eat (but then again, I prefer to bake!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW AND YUMMMMM!","review":"This has the best jam recipes without all the horrible canning stories you hear about. Nigella makes it simple and easy. There is also a GREAT recipe for brown sauce ( an English staple) great bread and cupcake recipes.

This book kept me entertained for hours on end and it still does when I decide to read it again. Nigella is very gifted and really knows how to write. Luckily, not only is it a good read, but it contains fantastic recipes as well. It is a large book, and I haven't tried near all the ones I've wanted to, but I've tried 5 and they have all turned out beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baking porn","review":"Can't give this book five stars yet because I've only made one thing so far (cream cheese brownies and they were GOOD). But it is a lovely, lovely cookbook with terribly attractive color photos that I feel are integral to any good cookbook. If you're a fan of Nigella's TV style, you'll enjoy her written recipes and advice. This really could be a coffee table book, but I'm sure mine will be all stained up after a few years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Ok, I'll give this book a five star rating for pictures and style. But the two star rating is for the recipes I've tried to date...the culmination being the \\"Snickerdoodles.\\" I've made snickerdoodles for 25 years and thought it would be fun to try a different recipe. These were the worst cookies I've ever made! Wasted a sunday aftenoon. I'll keep trying to come up with some favorites from the book, but so far, it's none too promising. Are these really her favorite recipes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy as - Cake!","review":"Lawson has infused recipes with her wit and straightforward cooking style. She reveals that she often 'messes up' a recipe, and yet her error does not affect the final product. She is a steady guide for young cooks or, those tired of cooking for perfection. Lawson is a comfort in the cooking world - however small or large that world might be to you. Her book is easy to read and her recipes are intriguing. They are simple and beg to be tried - over again. This is a great book for a first timer who is intimidated by baking, and for a well seasoned cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domestic Goddess Confuses and is Unclear...If you're an amateur baker like me, don't even think about it.","review":"Wow! What a ridiculous way to write recipes. It's kind of a narrative approach--not a step by step approach. This is not for amateur bakers in the least. If you want to play with this book, read the whole recipe before you begin, get up to speed on your baking vocabulary (yes you need it), and get ready to shell out a lot cash to buy teaspoons of things you can't really taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Yummy Yummy In My Tummy!!!","review":"I bought this book for my current goddess of the kitchen and she loves it. Better yet, I looooooove what she's been making. The author (British hottie Nigella Lawson) writes in a witty and concise manner that seems to be very effective--my sweet housemouse has been cooking up some of the best desserts (pies, cookies, cakes, you name it!)

After reading the other reviews about recipe discrepencies that occured in the uk/us conversions, I now understand why I've had mixed results from this cookbook. That said, this is my favorite cookbook to read. She is chatty and fun in her descriptions of the food and times she's used them and there is great pictures in the book that really make you want to start baking. I have also found some recipes that I love out of there (even with the recipe issues)- and i will now be checking my recipes against the website like that other reader so hopefully I'll have more even results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 4.7 on a scale of 1 to 5-a beautiful, thoughtful cookbook","review":"How many times can you say that a cookbook is thoughtful? Yet, Nigella Lawson injects so much insight and thinking into her writing about the art of baking. This book is as much a treat to read as her delicacies are to eat.Lawson's recipes are straightforward and relatively simple (she warns you when there is work). I would heed other reviewers' cautions about keeping an eye on the fats-clearly, she does not worry about cholestrol. However, all of the recipes that I have tried (about 10-15) worked beautifully both when I modified the fats and when I didn't.I would recommend this book for the beginner who wants to try baking and the more experienced cook who wants to think about it. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for ways to cut calories out of his or her diet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yum yum","review":"I saw this book on vacation in the UK this summer and couldn't wait for it to be published here.

I have the buns in the refrigerator for the second rising in the morning & am anxious to see how the final product fares, after adding several more cups of flour to get the dough to a reasonable ball shape.So far, I am not impressed at all, and find the ...price high for recipes that are not accurate.

Now I don't know if the scented version does a better job at masking odour, and I don't think that I sweat or smell any better or worse than the average person, but this product does nothing to deoderize for me. And I'm talking about from whether I do light (common day to day living) to moderate activity (playing outside with my kids), this deoderant just does not work from the moment I put it on to a few hours later. Period. It's as if I didn't apply anything at all. I feel that I've given this product a fair chance by wearing it for 2 months regularly. I wouldn't use this again or recommend this, and I am very disappointed. The only reason I gave it an extra star is at least the container is a #2 recyclable plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$","review":"I wanted to try a natural deodorant so I bought this product. After purchasing, I noticed that this deodorant still has aluminum in it just like the name brand deodorants I was trying to avoid (although they call it alum). I wondered, if this stuff is still full of the same nasty substances as regular deodorant, why bother, but since I'd already purchased it, I decided I'd still try the product... and I was very disappointed. The deodorant takes probably 10 minutes to dry after you apply it (which is a big pain!) and then after the product finally dries, it does nothing to prevent sweating or odor at all. You'd get the same results by not wearing any deodorant. Liquid rock is a complete waste of money, it doesn't work and it's not even a healthier product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"Not only does it not work, but it smells terrible.

Finding an effective, natural deodorant was a long trial and error process, but I finally struck gold with this product. Because the mineral salts are conveniently in liquid, you don't have the issue of wetting a crystal or dropping it on the floor to see it shatter into a thousand pieces. There is no gooey, gummy feeling like I get from clear, stick deodorants. This one really works with my body chemistry, so it may not work for everyone, as we are all so chemically unique, but I'd give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss my face deordorant lavender","review":"Works great!

I don't really care for the lavender's smell so I will try the fragrance free one next time but it does work great! Plus it is more natural which is a major plus.

Robert Schambach wrote this short book to encourage you to step out in faith by releasing your faith in giving to God. Not just of money, but of faith, time and your life being dedicated to Him in everything you do.This man of God, who recently passed away in January, 2012, was an evangelist for over 50 years, so he has the \\"right\\" to speak all about faith and belief. He was \\"mentored\\" under other famous evangelists, A.A. Allen and W.V. Grant, Sr., then went out on his own with their blessings.If you are feeling down, depressed or that God isn't helping you, read this book...read it again. Walk away and then go back and read it again. It's meant to build up your faith and uplift your spirit; true to the Schambach fashion. His famous line that he said whenever he was on the radio still holds true: \\"You don't have any trouble: All you need is faith in God.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a Laugh?","review":"Patrick McManus is the needed boost to your days!

I recently rewatched it and was disappointed. Betty Grable is as gorgeous as ever and does a good job with what she has to work with but the story is silly and the movie drags. Betty, in a dual role as Angelina, ruling countess of an Italian principality, and her ancestor Francesca, struggles to save her country from a Hungarian invasion. In the process the ghost of Francesca makes the Hungarian leader fall in love with her and, by association, with Angelina. There is the typical Hollywood happy ending even though it defies all logic. I wish I could recommend it higher but it was all I could do to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not even finish watching it","review":"The worst Betty Grable movie I have ever tried to watch.

Depend on Me, Ghetto Godzilla, Did What I Had To Do, Money Don't Make Me, No Limit, and many many others. The only weak song I found on the CD was the last one, Chastity, a tribute to his fiance.

It essentially provides a foundation for further study as opposed to being a comprehensive self-help/development manual.

I knew I was reading something very powerful, but the reason I didn't finish reading it is because I found it to be a hard read at the time. I thought I would pick it up again when I had a little more life and educational experience behind me. So I decided to order it after I noticed it on a shelf in a book store a couple of months ago. I realize now that the way the author words his sentences is what makes this book a hard read in certain passages. However, now that I have read the book, my only regret is that I didn't finish reading it earlier. It isn't the only book one should read on success, but the principles in this book will generate residuals for a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Spiritual Laws say it all!","review":"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is easy to understand, yet beautifully written. The 3rd Law, the Law of \\"Karma\\" or Cause and Effect, helped me change my perspective during a difficult time in my life from feelings of extreme guilt to a sense of empowerment.Deepka wrote that under the seventh spiritual law of success, the Law of Dharma, that we have \\"taken manifestation in physical form to fulfill a purpose... You have a talent that is unique in its expression, so unique that there's no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that expression of that talent. This means that there's one thing you can do, and one way of doing it, that is better than anyone else....\\" I draw upon these words for strength when I doubt my ability to do the work I wish to put forth in this world.This is one of those books that might make a terrific gift for someone who is curious about spiritual concepts, but feels intimidated about getting into the subject.

This is not, however, for those of us out there that assume that simply buying a book will change their lives or make themselves feel better. But this book is definitely a good start, and a very sound grounding in the art of living a happy, wholesome life. It teaches us the simple things that many of us forget in our day to day lives: how not to hurt people, and how not to hurt ourselves. If you're bored of all these preacher types, then this book is for you: Deepak Chopra is by no means a preacher, merely a humble teacher, happy to give you a guiding hand on your journey through life.

When I asked the doctor what the most effective things I could do to live a prolonged and happy life in the future, he recommended three things: Eat right, Exercise, and Learn to manage stress.While eating right and exercising are merely choices that one either decides to do or not, learning to manage stress is much more difficult. That's where The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success came to the fore-front. I have found the Laws to be on target and an immense help in both learning to manage stress as well as in enjoying life to the fullest.As a side note, I am a born again Christian. While my beliefs deviate from Deepak's in a couple of areas, for the most part, I found these Laws to be pretty consistent with the teachings of Christ... particularly as laid out in the 'Sermon on the Mount' found in Matthew 5 thru 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Enlightening","review":"I read this book in a few hours, shuffuling errands and laundry in between.

How much easier it is for me to just don saffron robes and/or spout meaningless drivel. I can make much more that way within a year than a lifetime of programming. This author has done just that.

The successful application of reason is all that is needed to debunk the ideas put forth by the author in this worthless tome. (I would have selected zero stars had that been an option.)Two points of many I could make:(1) The author states, \\"judge nothing that occurs.\\" Who gains from an application of this maxim? Clearly not one who aims to be moral. moral persons judge, and prepare to be judged...Work hard -- despite what Chopra urges -- and may your dreams be attained as a result!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Mary R.

However, the pump burned out after only 3 months. I went ahead bought another one because my cats liked it so much. I know things happen and sometimes u may get a lemon. Well, i got a new one and the motor burned out in the new one in about 3 weeks. I returned it to the store and they exchanged it for another one. Once again, that pump burned out last week.

Would be a GREAT product if the pump kept working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a short while...","review":"I've gone through two of these fountains already, and each time the pump died after only three or four months. While it worked, I had no complaints - it was very easy to disassemble and clean, and the flow of water was acceptable. However, given how quickly the pumps seem to die, I've since gone to the Drinkwell Fountain with far better results. I highly recommend the Drinkwell over the Petmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely advertised capacity","review":"I bought this fountain because it is advertised to hold 6L / 216 oz. It does not. This fountain, when filled per the manufacturer's recommendations to 1/2 inch below the rim, only holds ~160 oz. In this state, it is still possible to move it from the sink to the floor with minimal spilling. If you fill it on the floor, and fill it to the very rim (including the clear reservoir and the top fountain reservoir), the fountain maxes out at ~190 oz, anymore and it promptly spills over the edge. That's only ~5 L. I called this to Petmate's attention, who did nothing... I even offered to send them a video demonstrating this and they ignored it. If you buy this thinking it holds what they say, be forewarned that it does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is still a live album!","review":"I have never understood why bands would want to put out a live album. After all the whole point is that live music has a certain quality that can never be replicated on tape or whatever. This record only really serves as a momento of the tour for Portishead fans such as myself. I saw them in Milan and it was a special evening for me and I love the CD. However I would not recommend the album to somebody new to the band as some of the flaws in their live performance are a little too obvious. The only highlight, in my opinion, is the version of Sour times which is a well executed heavy metal pastiche. I would stick to the studio albums and if you really want to hear the band experimenting buy the re-mix EP of Glory Box/Sour Times on import."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live electronic music album ever.","review":"I read a review for Third in the New Yorker, and I found out that this live album existed. I had to get it right away because the reviewer was basically saying that Third is great, but nothing can ever beat the Roseland NYC album.. I have to say that Roseland is genius and I am extremely sd to have missed out on it for so long. Roseland really is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesum","review":"This rocks. Anybody who compares Beth Gibbons style to Geddy Lee of Rush probably only listened to sound bites of both. Beth's voice is much more complex, and her use of minor keys really gives her songs an edge. Perfect for tuning out the world for hours on end.The best way that I could rate this album would be by agreeing with the other reviewers that recommend not skipping any tracks - this is one of very few that I would listen to any of the tracks with equal anticipation. One of the few that I would not mind accidentally programming the player to repeat one track infinitely (and not noticing for several hours)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're A Portishead Fan, Buy This Album","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of live albums, and I wasn't sure if Portishead's music would sound good live, but I absolutely love this album. To hear the version of Sour Times, with Beth Gibbons absolutely blowing the roof off at the end, is worth the price of this cd alone. Can't wait to hear what's next for this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live albums ever!","review":"This is the album that made me a Portishead fan! The amalgam of Acid Jazz and Hip Hop combined with sultry voice of Beth Gibbons peeked my curiosity from the very first track.

This recording is on its way to becoming a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best U.S. Release since \\"Dummy\\"!!!","review":"A MUST FOR ALL \\"P\\" FANS!!! A someone who has seen this band live more than once, I highly recommend this recording. Their live performances always surpass their studio efforts, and this album is no exception! The PNYC version of \\"Sour Times\\" is one of the best I have heard, Beth Gibbons' vocals on this one blow me away! \\"Over\\" and \\"Roads\\" are tracks to check out as well. I conclusion, if you love this band, as I do, YOU NEED THIS ALBUMN! The Portishead experience is best savored LIVE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhibit #1","review":"At last! Proof that Beth Gibbons can sing in front of other people! This also shows that electronic music CAN (no thanks to bands like Underworld) be performed live to great effect.

Crossing Neptune was interesting enough to get me to pick up Strange Attractors, but unfortunately I couldn't make heads or tails of the book. I gave up after about 100 pages.The characters just aren't that interesting, and their motivation, to keep moving so as not to be eaten by the mysterious boojum -- no joke -- just couldn't persuade me to stick with the story.

And you could start pecking at a typewriter (as this woman has done) and you could come back with a tale, of sorts. But this desert miasma is no romance worth reading. I tried, bt could not get past the sappy writing, which, it must be said, is on par with that of a high school freshman so wide-eyed about the pimple-faced boy sitting next to her that she sees dating, marriage, and everything else in one clouded frame.

It also did not mark up my black shirts like some deodorants will if you are not careful when you get dressed. The only difficulty I had with the product was in the application.

I wouldn't have thought of this book as humorous if I hadn't been primed by the reviews to think so. It's an entertaining story of characters in a small town who are tied together through interactions in their daily lives. The overall theme questions the idea of what constitutes madness. Unfortunately, the plot just kind of petered out.

Raw food diets are ridiculous and this one is no exception. They're all based on the false premise that parasites (of all kinds) either don't exist, are harmless or even beneficial.

The author did a very good job documenting the very difficult task of making sense of what in the world happened in Rwanda. He put it very clearly and honestly at the beginning of the book in that the reader will likely not find any new insight or answers to the many questions that are related to Rwandan issue... simply because it's such as complicated problem with many different factors etc...2.

Gourevich is a sharp analyst and is biting in his criticism. My only complaint was that too many of the personal stories seemed to come from people he met in a single hotel. It's one of the best books out there in it's effect on informing the West and waking people up. I gave a copy to a friend in Tanzania who is half-Tutsi. He and his family were very impressed by the book and want a copy for their family library The opening and end of the book are especially moving.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, compelling, sad","review":"I never thought I would be reading a book on Rwanda, but I had to for a class I am taking. I have to say it was one of the best books I have ever read. It gave me so much more information about what was going on and what happened in Rwanda than one could find on the news. I remember hearing about Rwanda when I was a junior or senior in high school, but it was mostly on the refugees. This book gives you the information on what led up to the refugee camps and a little beyond. It does make one cynical, however. There were many times in the book that I would get angry, not only at the genocidaires, but also with the international community. Though it makes one cynical in ways and the author does seem to take a side, he has interviews from both sides. I'll let you read the book and see for yourself. It is excellent reading, I couldn't put it down. It shed so much light on things I couldn't get out of the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and Life-Changing","review":"This book will change your worldview. Gourevitch makes you realize how much we marginalize Africa, and how we refuse to recognize unpleasant realities to avoid the responsibility for dealing with them. While his account includes a lot of horrible examples of inhumanity, there are also some splendidly inspiring examples of humanity, which make you believe that change is possible, and even ultimately inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Experience","review":"Gurevitch tells a wonderfully moving, and disturbing portrait of one of the most horrifying experiences of civil war and genocide in the 20th century. And he tells it the only way it should be told - recounted through the eyes, ears and mouths of both the perpetrators and survivors. Amazing and harrowing, ... you will never think of the words \\"Never Again\\" in quite the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful and humane account","review":"This was an excellent account of an incomprehensible horror. Gourevitch presents the Rwandan genocide with a skillful balance of anecdote and analysis, and a justified sense of moral outrage. How could \\"civilized\\" Western governments have done nothing, or worse? Is there any hope that the U.N. can ever become a muscular agent of enforcement in this world? This was a spectacular failure of international will, and more than ever do we need to invest in a strong, independent body that operates from humanitarian values rather than provincial self-interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex anti-soundbite account of the Rwandan genocide.","review":"Gourevitch's writing does justice to the horrible history of the Rwandan massacare of 800,000+. He never simplifies the extremely murky and complex and questionable actions that most involved chose. His keen eye and pen take it all down.Gourevitch's account is gift to a mostly daydreaming civilized world. This book is a reality check. A call for vigilance and a recognition of our common humanity.I never knew it was that bad was what I kept thinking. It felt really bad to not have known that another holocaust occured. And then to learn it was totally preventable. I didn't want to talk to anyone for a while after finishing it. One of the few relevant books on our world and culture.'Never again'. That idea would be wonderful if we could make it reality. Still, most sleep on and the slaughters continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Africa is terrible","review":"I read this good book, here in Brazil.This book is about the genocide, in Rwanda.Blacks exterminates other blacks, in massive numbers; hundreds of thusands.No religion- animism, christianism or muslin- did something with force to end this genocide.In all times, Africa is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too biased to contribute anything to our understanding","review":"Gourevitch's book has a central flaw: it tries to draw a much closer analogy to the Jewish holocaust than the facts actually warrant: the author comes with a module, and appears determined to hammer reality into that module, inevitably casting the Tutsi in the role of the Jews. But the Tutsi are NOT the Jews: they were monarchs, land and cattle owners and pretty consistent abusers of the Hutu peasantry -- which does not explain the genocide, nothing ever could (Gourevitch sure as hell doesn't) The book might have contributed something to our understanding of the genocide had it taken a closer look at power relations between Hutu and Tutsi prior to the Hutu revolution of 1959 rather than limit itself to an outraged chronology of injuries inflicted on the Tutsi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks critical thinking","review":"The subject matter is powerful, and the author's self-appointed task, that of drawing our attention to the atrocities committed in Rwanda, is an important one. However, I found that the book lacks critical thinking and does not go beyond the surface on an intellectual level. It is a shame, because the subject matter deserves more serious attention than this emotional, and even glossy, treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning fusion of emotive erudition and postmodern doubt","review":"The text is an ruthless delineation of a culture turned askew; the question remains which becomes the incomprehensible: Hutu Power or a Western Civ. redefining itself through posturing. Its chief weakness, scholarship's sacrifice to emotion is perhaps, as well, its most vibrant hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"My prep for going to Rwanda was reading this book. This is a snapshot of the state Rwanda was in during the 100 days and the aftermath. However, much has been done to repair the damage. This is a time of reconciliation and healing. Go to Rwanda and see for yourself. It will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gourevitch highlights role of the complicit west","review":"Although many reviews have already been posted which cover most of the bases, the thing about this book which most confronted me was the disasterous way in which the international community sought to respond to the Rwandan crisis. Gourevtich documents two chilling subtexts to the story of the genocide: 1) the west's role in shaping the political climate towards the explosion of 1994, along with the complicitly and collusion of the \\"free world\\", particularly France, and 2) the way in which the Rwandan Hutu Power troops manipulated the well-meaning international aid community into shielding them from just retribution at the hands of their victems. In fact, the refugee camps under UN protection guaranteed further bloody conflict, as was seen in 1996. For those who think the genocide has nothing to do with us, think again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Primer","review":"After reading Naomi Benaron's novel Running the Rift, I wanted to know more about the Rwandan Genocide. This was a great primer, with lots of context and personal stories. I took issue with some of his assumptions, but I was glad I read the book. If you want to read more deeply in the topic, I'd also suggest the more immediate and penetrating books of Jean Hatzfeld or Alison Des Forge's Leave None to Tell the Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review after vIsit to Uganda -book from amazon","review":"I visited a friend living in Uganda who recommended this book.

At times the prose in this enoumously self centered book is so staggeringly bad that it's hard to believe it was published. See a reader from Alaska for a sample. However,the author gets kudos for going to Rwanda and making the world more aware of what was going on. But boy, did he need an editor. By the way, he also refers to himself almost constantly-- I mean who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrable writing style","review":"First the book brings up an important event a modern genocide. However, the author does a terrible job of writing this book. By the end of the book i found myself unable to sympathize with either party. I would recommend reading this only if you are required for a class but other wise this work is more akin to twilight in its writing level; I mean, even Wikipedia has better writing standards then this! Ultimately it covers a lot, but it's clearly Tutsi biased writing style removes a lot of credibility from this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"good writing, important subject matter, but what's the point","review":"This is an odd review. I enjoyed reading the book, I found it well documented, well written in the sense that it had an arc to it.The only thing , after about one hundred pages or so, was that I started to wonder why it mattered that I read it? When dealing with events that have just happened, and the ramifications are still extant, isn't it more important to go out and do something about problems then just read about them? I worry that books like these are just for the bourgeois to gape at far away terror, but I read it for school, so I may be biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard reading","review":"The book presents a grim summary of the events in Rwanda, and the author works well with the recollections of others during the war. Where this book offers a truely original and even more disturbing analysis is in the subsequent international efforts to bring some resolution to the situation. I believe it is the author's view that there can be no peace in Rwanda without justice, yet it is not clear that any kid of justice is possible given all the conflicting interests of the international community at work. This is a smart but depressing book about the inner workings of a war zone in central Africa that will be growing in importance and brutality in the next century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A indictment of the international response to genocide..","review":"Those who think \\"pece at all costs\\" would be well to read this. There are times when a person, a country, a WORLD, must take action. The Rwandan Genocide was one of those times.The most sickening aspect of the tragedy of Rwanda--indeed all genocides--are that they were and are preventable.Philip Gourevitch does a superb job of expressing his outrage over the lack of will displayed by the UN and US to the mass murder of the tutis by the Hutus'.I highly recommend this book. This book should be required reading in high schools throughout the country. It is a real eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I wish someone had urged me to read this book 5 years ago. I can't speak highly enough of it. It deserves more than five stars. So now I urge you to read it.The book's subtitle is deceiving. It gave me the impression that this was a collection of different news stories. I couldn't imagine how a bunch of news stories about Rwanda could be \\"riveting.\\" So I borrowed the book from the public library because I didn't want to buy a book that I might find dull.The book *is* riveting. Now that I've read it, I want to buy it.Each story builds *the* story. The author's comments on the stories and the way he relates the history add so much to it. Unlike a history book, _We wish to inform you_ doesn't just spit out facts; the facts are personalized.My only criticism is that this book really should have included an acronym list. Part 2 contained so many acronyms that, although they were initially spelled out, I had a hard time remembering which meant what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrogance and Ignorance: How the World Failed Rwanda","review":"It's not easy to help other people, let alone other countries. Gourevitch's book shows us how the international \\"community\\" managed to misstep over and over again in Rwanda, making an already tragic situation even worse, first through its inaction and then through its misguided charity. What makes Gourevitch's thoroughly researched account of this tragedy so compelling is the way it focuses the reader's attention on the circumstances that made this evil possible. This writer not only looks unflinchingly at the ugliest aspects of humanity, but he persists in peeling back the layers of human stories piled on stories, searching for the truth. As he points out early in the book, \\"...power consists in your ability to make others inhabit your story of their reality...\\" and in the case of such terrible human suffering, perhaps healing can come from the courageous effort to insist that this story be the most true account that we can discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"A great piece of work on this little known tragedy. Everyone knows about it, but not the details and how horrifying they are. Not just brutal acts but the events leading up to and after them, the general apathy of the world community, UN, and the hand the French played. This is yet another book that also brings to light the fact the UN and other aid agencies may be doing more harm than good in the name of helping people in Africa by unwittingly helping the wrong regimes and power structures. It has been repeated so often and so much that one wonders why nothing is being done about it. Heart rending read, but a compulsory one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book!","review":"This is an excellent book, pure and simple ... far better than other accounts of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. A must read for people interested in/traveling to Rwanda."},{"rating":"2","title":"an invisible genocide investigated","review":"In the invisible continent of Africa, a million can die in state-sponsored genocide without making any great impact on the West. This is a movingly written, well researched, and immensely troubling account of the history and events of and surrounding the 1994 war in Rwanda that destabilized all of central Africa. The current \\"First African World War\\" in Congo, another invisible war that has claimed more lives than any conflict since WWII, is indebted to this earlier conflict of its neighbor. Africa was scarred and humanity tainted. You ought to read about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Superb , Read IT!","review":"There are no words to describe what a privilege it was to read this book. I think anyone who reads it will afterwards be a different person. I think for the better but certainly with a broadened knowledge of the human experience which he/she will take to the grave. Please if you are reading this review, get the book, and read it. We all have a responsibility to know and I hope learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and in depth personal perspective","review":"The author ties in susinctly the historical background of the genocide and his own personal experince in Rwanda to give the reader a moving story of what happened in 1994. The narrative is very readable and the storires of the people who went trhrough this nightmare left me deeply moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONSIDERTION","review":"GAVE THIS TO MY SUPERVISOR AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT.

I also love her no nonsense approach to the Word. Reading this book is like listening to her, every word is necessary, there is no filler. The point is delivered and in my case received joyfully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This was the first Joyce Meyer book I have ever read. I know, I know, you're probably shocked. I have never had any desire to read her books because I always thought she was a fad. Well I have to say that just after reading the first few chapters of this book it began to change my life. I started to see things that I was doing that were stealing my joy. I was getting to a point where everything was frustrating me but this book helped me to see that I can find joy even when I don't think it's available. I would recommend this book, not only to Christians, even though it is Biblically based, but to all men and women who find that joy is sometimes hiding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible Study Materials","review":"Our Sunday School class can really relate to the books written by Joyce Meyers. Our class has really grown since we started using her materials. She uses scripture to relate to everyday problems faced by women. I highly recommend her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying Where You Are","review":"This is a wonderful book, and I can think of several people I know who could probably benefit from reading it. Its basic message is about not saying to yourself that you'll be happy when such and such thing happens. You can be happy NOW. Wonderful wonderful book that is MUCH needed in this day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading some parts everyday","review":"The chapter entitled \\"God's Waiting Room\\" is the point of this entire book. It could be read again and again to remind the reader that God hasn't forgotten you. Joyce really knows what Christians go through and this book hit me hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good digital recording","review":"There is a 'record player' hum in the background when you try to listen to various tracks on these CDs.

Don't be deceived by the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"The item is fine, except for the fact that I THOUGHT I was supposed to be getting 4 CDs. I don't like how there's this chance of a fine print where you don't get the whole product. I bought it through a seller, and even though its not technically \\"Amazon\\", this is the 2nd time I've had problems with this site in the last 2 months.

Even as a young kid, standing next to him as he described \\"Peter Cetera doing duets with different women\\" to numerous unimpressed clerks was horribly painful. Somehow the actual album managed to be worse. Track after track of totally saccharine, lowest-common-denominator soft rock. Peter's voice accomplishes the amazing feat of sounding like a horribly cheesy digital synth from the 80s. It's just horrible. The songs are written competently in the pop mold, but it's just that what he's writing is vomitous. I have nothing against soft rock, I enjoy Hall & Oates and several other artists/groups from the era, but this just seems like a horrible caricature of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is great","review":"I love the words in the song.

Simple as that. Brilliantly crafted with faultless casting and performances across the board. It has the most minimal soundtrack I have ever heard for a major release. The whole tone of the film is established from the outset in a series of classic scenes reminiscent of the great westerns of John Ford. It stays with you for a long time and says more about contemporary society than any recent film I have encountered. A major comeback for the Coens and a deserved Oscar winer for best picture. If you detested this film, you should ask yourself.....why? Too close for comfort perhaps. Ending...too ambiguous? Perhaps you should grow up and start challenging yourself a little? The Hollywood studios are increasingly reliant on tired and recycled ideas and atrocious remakes of classic films. This film proves that there's life in the old dog yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Country for Old Men, DVD","review":"DVD arrived within a few days - like brand new.

Corporate fat cats will try their best to grab moneys from your wallet. The movie was pointless and senseless to begin with only redeemed by good actings that the film didn't really deserve........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"This movie has so much going for it at the beginning. Starts out building a decent plot and for the most part, the characters are developed well, but after you reach the half way point, everything seems to fall apart an start making little sense. You can try to explain the 'deeper meanings' to yourself all day long but in the end this is just a shallow, boring, over-hyped snoozer film. If you do manage to make it to the end without falling asleep you will be greated by a non-ending where three of the main characters stories are never completed and your left wondering what happened with a bad taste in your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Title, Bad Movie","review":"Y'all - Bang - Y'all - Bang - All y'all - Bang, bang - Sigh - Y'all - Bang - SighHateful nihilism disguised as art.Not only did I hate the movie, but now I hate the actors for their complicity in this celebration of death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is trash cinema.

This is yet another example why their movies just do not cut it. As always, the movie in stunning in it's technical execution, but the story is lacking. I guess the Coens would ally themselves with the realism school of moviemaking, because there is no STORY here. It is just a moment in time where nothing gets resolved. That said, it is saved by great filmmaking and acting, but it isempty. In the end, it is the story that matters. Since this movie doesn't have one, I give this a one star, the equivalent of cinematic garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"academy award??? really???","review":"seriously folks this movie won best picture??? maybe I'm from another planet or something because I just watched this movie and THIS MOVIE SUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Oscars are crazy!","review":"Why are critics giving (as well as most Amazon reviewers)this movie such great reviews? The movie does not make sense.The Javeir guy had a stale perfomance as the villian and somehow won an oscar. The movie was uneven and left to many loose ends, I mean nothing was solved where did the money end up, when the josh brolin character got killed I thought that was one of the mexcian at first( you could not see his body cleary) The villian kills a dozen people and walks away, after he is in a car accident, that makes no sense and what is that story Tommy Lee Jones is telling at the end of the movie about? I think the critics have some kind of favorable blind eye to what ever the Coen Bros. do. I just don't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ENDING MAKES NO SENSE, REALLY BAD","review":"What a terrible ending. Here the movie was pretty good, and it all built up anticipation as to how it would all turn out.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!It was like the filmmakers suddenly ran out of money or something. The movie just suddenly STOPPED. No ending!There was no closure, it made no sense, and it leaves you saying \\"HUH??\\"Therefore, it really made me MAD that I sat through almost two hours for nothing. This is the most unsatisfying movie of all time. Don't waste your two hours on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR TIME.....","review":"I tried to watch this film 3 times on one of the premium channels and fell asleep each time. I guess I don't find the characters that exciting. Sure the film is violent but that doesn't equate to interesting for me. If you like watching a senseless hood track people down to kill them with a \\"souped up\\" cow killer, this film is for you. FOR THE REST OF US - WE HAVE BETTER USE FOR OUR TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"I borrowed this from the library, thank goodness I didn't pay any money to see it because I would have felt ripped off. As it is, I'm sorry I wasted two hours watching it. I loved Fargo, which is why I tried this, but I've never, ever seen a movie as bad as this one. Total piece of garbage. It shouldn't get any stars at all. Seriously bad movie and I can't believe it was even nominated for Academy Awards, let alone win some. Just terrible. Forget it, and watch Fargo again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Turd","review":"Worthless waste of overhyped garbage.I can't believe all the awards Javier Bardem won for this role.Wow!

A bowel movement is much more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Movie for Intelligent Men","review":"This movie was the best comedy of the year.

Some say it was a great production, if so it was wasted on this story. The ending is no ending. It was just one long depressing film of a violent nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a lame movie","review":"This is the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I can't fathom what in the world justifies this receiving nominations for anything except maybe directing/cinematography. The protagonist is a completely unbelievable character in his motivations. The plot has no depth to it whatsoever - NOTHING HAPPENS!! - AND IT HAPPENS SO DAMN SLOW!! If all you care about is seeing a string of murders then this is your movie. If all you care about is seeing tommy lee jones rehash every other character he's ever played then this is your movie. If you don't like having any closure or sense of completion to the story then this is your movie. If you think stealing the two-face character from batman by doing the \\"coin flip for your life\\" bit is original and cool, then this is your movie. Otherwise, move along - I can't get back this time and I can't believe I went along with all the reviews and watched this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie murders the word entertainment","review":"Should you find yourself strapped to a chair, immobile, without a remote to turn off this movie, then you have no choice. Take your punishment. A story of a crazy jackass just shooting at everyone and everything, even a bird. Totally senseless. That's how the movie depicts that this country is no place for old men. This movie is a waste of time and I refuse to spend any more time writing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelieved Hopelessness","review":"I'm a big fan of The Brothers but I was sorry I watched No Country for Old Men. Blood Simple had incredible atmosphere and a perfect, clever story; O Brother, Where Art Thou had humor and heart, as did Fargo. This film, as well-made as it was, simply became another candidate on my ongoing list of Most Depressing Movie Ever. Add the animal body count to the human, and I was really ready for a \\"Seinfeld\\" rerun by the end of the DVD. I find it ironic that the brilliant Coen team should get an Oscar for this one, and that every major critic's review I read was so worshipful. It was, as another Amazon reviewer put it, nihilistic; that's considered hip, I guess. I've been reduced to tears by many a cinematic experience but this was different, a movie so dominated by hopelessness and ugliness that (for me personally), the humanity of some of the characters didn't have much chance to make an impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Won The Best Oscar??? The Academy Is Nuts!!!","review":"This has got to be the worst best movie Oscar ever!!! If all you care to see is a psychopathic killer (how in God's name did this guy when the best actor???) on the rampage, then this movie is for you. On top of that, the movie has one of the worst endings ever where everything in the movie is left up in the air. It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best picture???","review":"To keep this short, this is the worst picture I have ever seen that won the Best Picture Oscar.

When it was over, my wife and I both said to each other \\"give me back the last 2 hours of my life\\" or at least give us our money back! This was a very violent movie (not unexpected) but, the ending left us wondering whether we were cheated because it made no sense! While the acting was reasonable, the ending was the dumbest ending to a movie I have ever witnessed. This was not award winning in any stretch of the imagination. I want a refund!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Country for old men","review":"That was the worst movie we ever started to watch. Half way through the movie, we stopped it and threw it into the garbage. It is getting very hard to find good movies today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture????","review":"I purchased the DVD though I had not seen the movie in its theatrical release. I honestly thought my copy was missing some scenes at the end...it did not really end as much as it just stopped, as if the writers/directors/producers had no clue where to go next. Also, there were so many holes in the story that they are way too numerous to write about here. Suffice to say, this movie is worth a look as a rental just to see the Academy Award winner for 2007, but don't waste your money buying it...not worth seeing again (maybe not even worth seeing the first time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country for Old Men","review":"There is a lesson here that movie producers should heed; the availability of exceptional talent and technical craftsmanship is not a sufficiently good reason to make a film. This grim piece of cinema is a perfect testament to the fact that even an unapologetically offensive script about the absolute worst dregs of society can be turned into an award winning movie. I am quite sure that someone won a bet over whether style could overcome the lack of humanity in the end product. This is not entertainment, it is an assault on goodwill and common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously overrated film","review":"Perhaps in an era of corrupt leaders and illegal warfare we don't deserve better films than this, but my hope is that we can begin to rise above our sad appetite for the sort of pointless violence glorified in this movie. No Country for Old Men is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's a predictable (and often boring) epic of graphic killing with a thin plot and even thinner characters. Despite all the hype surrounding this picture, there's nothing redeeming or insightful to be found here. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Fest","review":"Not sure what all the hype was about, but this movie was a better inducer of sleep than any over the counter sleep aid.

Don't waste your time on this overhyped movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Lameness","review":"This film has Academy Award written all over it. And by that I mean that it pretty much sucked. Reading even the positive reviews of this movie and they all admit that the story is lacking and the ending is weak/non-existent/stupid take your pick.Unfortunately telling a story is the whole point of a movie. So if the story is not there the rest of the fluff does not really matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Feel Good Movie","review":"Well done but not an upbeat story - left me wondering what happened to several of the characters.

The Coens strike it out of the park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I'm honestly stumped on this one. This movie has many parallels to \\"Fargo\\" in its representation of stereotypical characters \\"the small town Sheriff\\", \\"the emotionless hitman\\", \\"the uneducated blue collar worker\\", they are all represented here and as for violence, well there is plenty. There wasn't much in the film I could relate to obviously, but I will say I couldn't turn away. I watched every moment of it to the end and was indeed engrossed and I'm not sure if it was because the lead character was so bizarre he was interesting or because the movie is so unpredictable. You are sure of one thing while watching it: anything can happen in this film and does. If you're looking for a thoughtful film that leaves you feeling enlightened, this isn't it, but if you like films that sit just left of center you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"Brutal film that absolutely works and with no fairytale ending it's the reason why this exceptional film has and continues to be praised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazyflick","review":"Love this movie a little frustrating in parts but all in all great story line, excellent acting and spooky good.

Javier Bardem is creepy as a \\"grim reaper\\" type and Josh Brolin is excellent as an opportunist who gets in way over his head. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson have small but telling parts as an old cop and \\"fixer\\", respectively. The only thing that detracts from this film - and the same is true of all Coen films - is the frequent and unnecessary brutality that the Coen's enjoy wallowing in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid if depressing","review":"Great acting, suspenseful, but with a message that evil often wins...riveting at times, disgusting, heart thumping, great action...great acting...worth the effect if you enjoy a kind of lingering depressive effect.

I highly do not recommended it for the young or the faint of heart.Having said that I wish to say that it was one of the best films that I have seen this year. The writing was 1st rate with a lot of unexpected twists and turns. The Cast was also up for the challenge especially for Mr. Jones and Mr. Brosin. But it was Mr. Bardem who stole the show as a symbol of incredible evil and injustice. You could easily believe that he was pure evil in his insane way in the beautiful setting of West Texas. Altogether a great morality tale of our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What masterpiece?","review":"I saw this film with high expectations due to the all the praises I've heard lavished on it. What a let down. Sorry, but it is totally predictable and tries to make up for the well used story line with unique weapons for the graphic violence. What sort of hitman/killer is going to drag around a compressed air tank? The ending was an absolute let down. No one wants to see the bad guy get away, what after so many killings including the lead fellow's innocent wife. This movie actually pissed me off, which I won't normally write in a review.

Not an easy watch, partly because the only character who keeps to his code (and to the code of the West, that whole \\"man's gotta do what a man's gotta do\\" thing) is the homicidal maniac. The sheriff quits before the job is done in direct disobedience of his dad and lawman mentor, the bounty hunter begs for his life instead of toughing out his death, the cowboy is too busy flirting with the pretty girl to watch his six and gets killed. And the killer walks into legend. Spooky.

It was nothing more than a sequence of set piece opportunities to show people being killed in various ways. In fact the violence became so predictable that I found myself groaning at certain points in expectation of yet another murder. The only thing lacking was the obligatory helicopter chase scene so common now to every American movie that involves gun fire. I agree Bardem is a compelling actor but for a much better Bardem movie see Goya's Ghosts, which by the way received no Oscar mention at all. I guess because there was no gun fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Was So Over Hyped....","review":"I was so disappointed in this film, as everyone Raved about it. American Gangster ran Rings around this \\"attempt\\", ten times over. Yes, it was interesting for a brief period, but ran out of gas real soon. Especially the stupid ending. But, to those whom Loved it? More power to you. The acting was Not all that Great either. I would have given this film 1 star, but i enjoyed seeing \\"Maurice\\" from Nothern Exposure. This movie just proves how Much politics goes into being nominated, and winning an Academy Award. Best film? Hardly. The only thing that made me happy, was that i didnt have to buy it, nor rent it.Save your money, get American Gangster, and see a Real Film worthy of Academy Awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Fresh Air","review":"In a world where every movie seems to be a re-make of some sort this movie provides a fresh story of its own.

I did have to replay the ending to make sure that the DVD hadn't skipped or something. When I sat back to think about the point the film was making, I believe I understood its point. Every generation once it reaches a certain age thinks things are getting worse. The whole 'back in my day' soliloquies we give, but the truth is elusive sometimes. The wickedness of mankind has always been violent. We are the ones that change. Our tolerance, our view of the world and what we think our place is in it. Everyday there is some story in the news that makes absolutely no sense, but in our films we want the motivation spelled out to us. In this piece I think the Coen brothers and McCarthy does a good job in portraying \\"senseless\\" violence. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAD GUY IS INSANE !","review":"This is a great movie. Not what I was expecting, but still great. The bad guy is scary as hell!

Just google \\"Jim Emerson\\" and you'll find it.Read Jim Emerson on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and read a letter Emerson received from a viewer of the film. I promise you that these two commentaries on this film will help you better appreciate it.What I want to say here is something people have to understand is that a movie is not only about what it is about but also HOW it's about, what it's about. OK? Meaning is to be found in the way the story is told and what is left out of a picture sometimes adds to the picture. Less can be more and what is not there can say just as much, if not more, than what is.Let go of super conventional western/American hang-ups about having a concise, tiddy ending. It ends exactly where it needs to. The way the movie comes to a close has to do with what the story itself is about.

This is a very violent and sometimes just plain gory movie. But Tommy Lee Jones is awesome as the sheriff who, although very savvy, always seems to be one step behind the bad guys... Josh Brolin's character is smart and seems like he can outsmart the psycho killer. The tension in this movie will literally keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. You'll be looking in the shadows for a day or two later, just to make sure there's no one there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flawed Masterpiece From the Coens","review":"\\"No Country for Old Men\\" is the best Coen Brothers film since \\"Fargo.\\" Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, this existential modern-day western features knockout performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (a classic villain despite the Beatle haircut). Though excessively violent, the movie provides a disturbing meditation on uncompromised evil within its cat-and-mouse framework. When the Coens go full throttle, the results are exhilarating. However, Joel and Ethan occasionally stumble in their over-faithfulness to McCarthy's source material. Another misstep is the needless subplot involving Woody Harrelson's sharp-dressed bounty hunter. Kelly Macdonald, on the other hand, makes the most of her limited screen time as Brolin's devoted wife. Admittedly not for all tastes, \\"No Country for Old Men\\" is a flawed masterpiece that defies convention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Picture of the Year","review":"\\"No Country For Old Men\\" is the best picture of the year, hands down. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film. The actors are perfectly cast, especially the terrifyingly brilliant Javier Bardem as the best villian since Hannibal Lector. In fact, I think this could be the best film of it's kind since \\"The Silence Of The Lambs.\\" Lead Josh Brolin has been somehow over-looked during awards season for his understated performance as vetran who wears all that he has witnessed on his face. Tommy Lee Jones is great as always.I can't wait to get this on DVD. It's the kind of movie you're thinking about days after you watch it. Those kinds of movies are few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"In his review of this film in the New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote:\\"Mr. Jones plays Ed Tom Bell, a world weary third-generation sheriff whose stoicism can barely mask his dismay at the tide of evil seeping into the world. Whether Chigurh is a magnetic force moving that tide or just a particularly nasty specimen carried in on it is one of the questions the film occasionally poses.\\"To me it seems apt and a simple, clear summation of my opinion of this film to paraphrase that and say that regarding\\"...the tide of evil seeping into the world, is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN a magnetic force moving that tide or just a particularly nasty specimen carried in on it\\"?I say that it is both.Zero stars. Shame on the Coen brothers. Artistic license doesn't excuse such evil as this film represents."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes of Cinema.","review":"This movie is boring, rambling, pointless, and dull. Furthermore, it's badly produced, poorly acted, and incompetently Directed. There's a reason why it tanked at the box office, and the Oscars that featured it was the lowest rated in Oscar history. The reason is this: the movie is pure nonsense from beginning to end. The less said about the ending the better, but it's unbelievable to me that people are actually praising this movie for it's lack of anything resembling professionalism. For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, the main protagonist is killed off-screen, without any build-up or explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worse movie we ever saw","review":"The acting is wonderful, but the writing is absolutely terrible. On the back of the cover you are told the movie will \\"take you to the edge of your seat and beyond,\\" but what is suspenseful about a guy killing everyone in sight over and over and in exactly the same way? And what we really can't forgive is the cover blurb continues, \\"right up to its heart-stopping final moment.\\" Is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? The movie dribbled slowly to a miserable unsatisfactory ending that was so lousy we weren't sure it was even over. First we backed it up to be sure it really was the end and we hadn't fallen asleep, then we thought there must be something after the credits. But no, it. really was that bad. Don't waste your money. We threw ours away so no one else would waste a minute of their life on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point being there is no point","review":"I found this movie to be of poor cinemagraphic quality, lacking any characters of investing interest, and just a tad racist.It's an ugly film, first off, done in a style reminiscent of a 1970s made-for-TV movie. I suppose this was intentional, but why?None of the characters made me care whether they lived or died. They were all cliched, underdeveloped and generally unsympathetic... not because they were \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" but because they were boring.Finally, every latino character in the movie is a violent and mindless criminal. I suppose that since all of the characters are basically stereotypes, I shouldn't take it to heart, but I couldn't shake the feeling when we left the theatre that there was a pinch of prejudice in the mix of generally bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Joke?","review":"Is this a joke? Does the book end like this? That would be the only good excuse. What a waste of so much acting talent! If you like films that provide some kind of conclusion or completion at the end, don't watch this film. It would be like buying a thriller, ripping off the last 20 pages, and then reading it. You ain't gonna be happy when you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country for \\"double dipping\\"!","review":"It was a great film and deserved to win Best Picture.

Unlike \\"Fargo\\", however, the plot of \\"No Country...\\" lacks any cohesion other than authentic-sounding local-color dialogue and it's excellent delivery by the film's performers -- all of which is ultimately meaningless, in the absence of a larger narrative context. Yes, the Bros.' fine production values are also well-displayed here, but overall this film feels like an empty exercise in attempting to recapture their previous brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!!","review":"Ok...I saw this at the movies and it was terrible.

I felt very let down by this film, especially because I liked the first half so much. What was the purpose of the Sheriff? Was he only there to comment on the action, like the Chorus in a Greek play? At some point -- at least at the conclusion of the movie -- he needed to interact in some meaningful way. This never happened. He was just there.

However, the Blu-ray is shipped in some sort of cheap, paper thin case unlike anything I've ever seen before. It looks like a normal case and the edges are plastic, but the main part of the case is just paper. There is literally nothing there. It almost feels like a cheap knockoff you'd buy from a sidewalk vendor.If this product is so cheap because it is housed in budget, amazon no-frills packaging (or whatever), it should be marked as such. Passing it off as a standard product is disingenuous. I know that the important thing is the film itself, especially at this price point.

Unfortunately this is accompanied by one of the worst endings to follow a thriller movie. It provided the watcher with no satisfaction and ended very inconclusively, by letting the bad guy get away while killing off both the main character and his entirely innocent wife. The violence in No Country for Old Men is relentless, excessive, and takes away from the movie by making it far more predictable and repulsive. On the upside there are only a few very suspenseful and scary part but the graphic violence keeps this film out of the family movie section. The movie did the novel by Cormac McCarthy justice but could not rival the description and setting of scenes that occurred in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont see what the hype was all about","review":"Bought it because I bought into all the hype, now I cant force myself to watch it again.

That's just way too much. The movie looks great and has a digital copy and Bardem is genuinely spooky as an assassin. But you probably have a Cormac McCarthy poster on your wall if you're ready to buy this. And putting out a pricier Special Edition on BluRay after putting out the already expensive original BluRay release is highly questionable. This is the last thing you need to do when launching a format -- make people who have committed to it feel like they bought a title too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violence was a Bit Over the Top!","review":"First, let me say that the PQ on this disc was phenomenal! Contrast and resolution were of reference quality. The compressed audio track was good.The movie itself was gripping, yes...but the over-the-top cold-blooded killing got a little tedious. Yes, you were tense in anticipating when Javier Bardem's character would strike, but the plot could have used a little more depth and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for us.","review":"My family and peers believe that a story needs to be in a good movie. This action flick just didn't seem to be driving in that direction. It feels like one of those old 1960s films, a slice of \\"real\\" life. Yeah right...It felt like it wanted to be Thelma & Louise. It wasn't. It seemed like it was running for a little Silence of The Lambs action, it missed. It's too bad the writers didn't take their script through a few more editorial sessions. Just not for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most violent...","review":"I hated this movie and can't believe that out of all the films of 2007 this was considered the best. It is one of the most violent films I've ever seen and I'm including Quentin Tarantino's blood fests in that. At least with Quentin you know what you'll be getting. In this film starting with with the first 5 minutes there is a violent murder almost every 10 minutes. I just got sick of the violence.

I just think it was a movie about a lot of senseless, brutal killing. I just could not believe it got the academy award for best picture of the year. It in no way deserved it in my opinion. It did have some good acting, but for what? It was senseless. If you compare this movie to others throughout the years that have won the best picture awards, this was a pitiful, pitiful choice. It definitely is not for young people, and not for people who have a problem with depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depraved","review":"I don't understand why this film is so highly praised. What is it really about? If the answer is that it is an examination of ultraviolence, then what is our response, our counter to this spectacle? The film seems to say that there is no counter, that we're stupid, greedy, idiots who can't get out of our own way enough to save our own skin. When confronted with evil we sell out our families, betray our morals, and act so stupidly that we're all but predetermined to fail. That's a harsh indictment of man's ingenuity, perseverance, and moral fiber; I think it's BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"If I could give this movie less than one star I would.

Doesn't need a reason, doesn't care. Kills people that stop to help him, kills people on a principal, his own that is. If you enjoy killing without purpose than you will love this movie. Even the big shoot em up and blow em up movies have killing with a purpose.This is the only movie in years I lost sleep over. Has it come to the point where filmmakers can't do any better than this? It is just this kind of movie that contributes to the attitude our kids are getting about life in general.This movie would get less than one star if I could do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my two hours back!","review":"This movie started out pretty good, even though the idea of a down on his luck dude finding money has been done already (A Simple Plan, etc).However the movie breaks down rather quickly into fantasy and implausible occurrences.Primarily, it is unbelievable that the main character is so easily traceable, especially since this movie takes place in the '80s.Secondly, the Tommy Lee Jones sheriff is completely tertiary to the action and plot. Waste of time.The ending was horrible - made me wish I never wasted my time watching the movie in the first place.This is a case where they probably tried to make it too close to the book (haven't read it, but that's the only reasonable explanation) but forgot that in a movie, you have to have someone tell you or show you what's going on.

Nevertheless it left me feeling as if someone had emptied the contents of their bowels in my lap. Its slick, taut surface serves to push Cormac McCarthy and by extension the Coen brother's virulent misanthropy to the end. If you think cynicism is good film making then I have an antidote for you: Frank Capra's 1936 subversive screwball comedy, 'Mr Deeds Goes to Town'. It will make laugh, it will make you think and it will make you glad to be alive.

Once you get past the first half dozen or so random killings and the deadpan acting, the rest is even worse. The idea that the film is sending some sort of insightful message about random violence is without merit. After about the first 10 minutes anyone with an IQ above about 30 should figure out random violence is bad and by the way have you noticed random violence is bad?

As a matter of fact, it is actually annoying because it almost seems as if they were trying to make it unsatisfying. Who are they trying to impress? If they think that is art, it is not. Rather, I think they are trying to hard and it shows. Real art appears effortless. Michelangelo said his David was already in the rock. He merely chipped away all that was not David. By trying to hard, this movie actually bends truth (the essence of art) by depicting a human being who is so depraved and devoid of any humanity that he must kill every other person he meets in the film. I'm sorry, really, every other person? That is a bit of a stretch. Are there really people like that?

The killer goes about his grim business with impunity, in a world that is practically devoid of people other than his prey. What utter non-sense! When are the American people going to wake up and realize that Hollywood is insulting their intelligence with a steady stream of such TRASH? Unless you equate gratuitous violence with so-called entertainment, you will not enjoy this film. I came away from it feeling, not entertained, but drained and dirty - exactly like the filth it is.

I understand that sometimes the bad guy gets away and that sometimes the small town sherif can't cope anymore, but in movies or even real life, the police never stop looking.

I am surprised Tommy Lee Jones agreed to this script. Totally unredeeming. If you watch it do not watch it at night, as it is not a good way to end your day.

If you have any concept that this will be a good movie...forget it. It has half a story, literally the story just sort of stops at the half way point. Despite what some reviews have said, not showing what happens to the main characters is not revolutionary story-telling. I know a lot of people don't want to say that this film sucked because the makers are well respected, but it sucked. If it had been made by an indy director it would be getting blasted hard by the same people now singing it's praises. Real life may end with people saying, \\"Heck with it...I'll just retire\\", but that's not an ending for any dramatic work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche violence","review":"In its attempt to shock, this movie, in typical Hollywood style, pushes beyond its own credibility and overshoots itself. Psychopaths invariably are neither a) intelligent - the protagonist almost outdoes Hannibal Lecter in his diabolically acute temporal/spatial judgement and absurdly enhanced tracking skills - nor are they courageous - I'm not sure that there are many people capable of performing major operations on themselves without anesthetics, but a common narcoterrorist - get away! Where's the motivation for this extreme behavior. Not money, not revenge, not anything. This character, looked at closely, is a giant vacuum, a chimera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this review...'friendo'","review":"By far one of the best films of the 21st century and defineately of all time. Every performance demands attention that is well deserved in incredible performance from every actor/actress. The characters are incredibly lifelike, and this story, while sounding simple, is complex and heart-pounding through its characters and suspense, every line delving further into the story and its many emotions. This is what happens when every person involved lays down every card they have in order to bring this story to life, relying on the all-too-good performances and directing to carry it to 4 awards and a place amongst any movie lover's wall of fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Really like this movie, looks great on blu-ray.

A mediocre-quality digital transfer with distracting levels of blurring, over-saturated black-levels, and compression artifacts.The Blu-Ray version looks waaaay better.I've seen plenty of DVDs that looked nearly as good as HDTV (HD-DVD or Blu-ray). Not this one. There's a substantial difference here. I use a Toshiba HD-A2 (720p) and a PS3, on new Pioneer 50\\" Kuro 720p plasma.You'd think they'd take care to make an excellent DVD transfer of a new release of this caliber, but apparently they didn't think it was important enough to spend the time and money to do it right since this is \\"just\\" DVD.

This movie contains death at every turn. It is filled with people who do stupid things and get killed. There are also a lot of people who do nothing wrong or bad but they get killed too. There are a lot of long \\"clever\\" conversations that end in murder. There are some very short encounters that contain barely a word that also end in murder. I like Tommy Lee Jones but I am sorry I actually paid money for this movie.If a young person wrote this story for his or her high school English class they would probably be made to get counselling for being a complete psychopath.The reasons why No Country for Old Men received such high praise and awards is a mystery to me but there is a greater mystery... what is the point of this bleak depressing movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"If you like movies that give you a murder a minute, this is your movie. IF you enjoy basic themes where psychopath kills everyone in sight to get a case of money with virtually no other plot substance, than this is for you. If you delight in movie endings that have you saying outloud \\"what the hell kind of an ending was that\\", this is a good choice for you. If watching blatant brutality gives you an adrenaline rush, than this is a good pick.If you're a fan of the Coen Brothers as I was, than this movie will seriously disappoint you.Definately not a chick flick.Mind-boggling to see so many positive reviews. Makes me wonder about the inherent nature of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Need Closure","review":"There isn't much I can say about this movie, I just had to come up with something so I could rate it & hopefully prevent amazon from bombarding my inbox with it. I hated this flick. I love Tommy Lee Jones, and his character was quite good - actually, the characters weren't so much the problem as the plodding pace of the movie itself. Even the plot was ok, but I was hoping for something a little faster. It reminded me of all those foreign intrigue dramas from the 70s & early 80s that I'd fall asleep to when I was sick home from school. I also need closure in my movies. I need to know what exactly happens to the characters without having to visit forums and 'cons. Twist endings are fine, the occasional cliff-hanger here and there, but in long, drawn out movies I would at least hope to be gratified with some closure. I suppose I could pick up the book somewhere and flip to the last chapter, but the movie left me afraid to pick up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzzzzzzz","review":"A veritable snooze fest occasionally interrupted with acts of gratuitous violence. I understand what the story was trying to get across, but this was one of the least entertaining films I've ever had the misfortune of viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy piece of suckwipe","review":"The Coen Brothers have completely lost sight of excellent filmmaking in this horrible piece of obvious meta-fiction that depicts a few days in the lives of a group of forgettable dimwits who are implicated in a drug deal gone bad. It's like watching the evening news and realizing that the entire show is about stupid victims, for stupid victims. The movie is completely dismissive of characters who figure largely in the movie--the Mexicans--and comes across as an amateur film student work that requires a longwinded explication of its motives and subtexts. Yawn....If we want to get meta-fictional, let's examine how the film depicts the Coen brothers' getting too tired to film anything interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country for Old Men DVD","review":"It was a well used disc that used to be an old Blockbuster rental. It also didn't have the 2nd disc with bonus features. Don't buy from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Acting and Direction","review":"First and foremost, this sure is not a feel good movie. It is a violent and rugged movie about the world of drugs and money. What this movie is; however, is an incredibly well-acted and absorbing film. There is rarely a suspense-free or tension-less moment. The movie, featuring excellent direction by the Cohen brothers, stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and the downright spooky Javier Bardem. Woody Harrelson is also one of the stars. There is no need to spend time discussing the plot as that has been done several times already. This movie is worth seeing for the fine acting and directing, as well as the gritty realism of Texas and Mexico. The three primary actors - Brolin, Bardem, and Jones - are each excellent. I expect that we will see a lot more of Brolin. This movie is not for everyone, but for those looking for a great movie with great acting, I highly recommend this 4 star film."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I watched the movie, never read the book, heard the hype and read other reviews. I have to say I am very disappointed in this film. It was great until the last 5 minutes. Then it just.... wandered off to nowhere. No closure, no real ending. Did they leave it open for a sequel? Are they going to create serial killer serial films? That is the only thing that makes sense with this ending.The acting is very good. The cinematography is great. The sounds are great. The plot is good... until the end.I would recommend this movie only if you have 2 hours of time to waste... and remember you won't get it back.The coen brother have done other great films. 'Blood Simple', 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing' come to mind immediately and each of those is superb. I would recommend watching one of those first, or instead of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coens don't dissapoint","review":"Interesting story, great acting. Leaves you asking a lot of questions - in a good way. Great visuals/directing. Worth buying if you're a fan of The Coens or just like good drama/action/mystery that looks cool too. I thought Tommy Lee Jones sucked, which is why I didn't give it a full 5. His character felt boring and underdeveloped. Otherwise, no major complaints about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coens at Their Best","review":"This is easily the Coen brothers and cinemas best movie of all time. The characters are so true to life that if one were to travel into the part of West Texas that borders Mexico you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the movie and the real thing. Each character is perfect and Tommy Lee Jones should've been nominated for an Oscar for his role. This is one of the most spellbinding movies of all time, and the grocery store scene is the most intense scene ever. Javier Bardem and all the actors are absolutely AWESOME. Do not miss this one. The ending is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Coen Masterpiece","review":"A wonderfully crafted movie that purposely evokes genres and expectations and then purposefully dashes those expectations. I also was caught off guard by the ending and its lack of a big showdown between the main characters. But upon repeated viewings and thought, it is abundantly clear that this is exactly what the Coens and Cormac McCarthy had planned. For them, the important things are the questions that are raised, not the answers that are left somewhat open to interpretation. Cinematically, it is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs Geritol, a plot , and an ending.","review":"NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is so old and tired it can't get out of it's own way. It doesn't even struggle to its feet in order to at least end well. After a couple of tedious hours of the bad guy dragging about a cattle gun attached to a compressed air tank, the Coen brothers are so pleased with themselves, they decide to insult the audience with nothing more clever or novel than a blank screen ending. I was, however, relieved it was over.I understand the existential angst of the film. The Coen's do portray convincingly the aching despair, hopelessness, and helplessness of the human condition. They point to the gathering storm and darkness on the horizon. Unfortunately, this particular film does not illuminate. I want to tell them that they got it wrong and it's okay; the end has been written; evil is vanquished and the prince of darkness loses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 2 hours back","review":"Hey, thanks for ending it right after Tommy Lee Jones shares a couple of pointless dreams on his way to a pointless decline towards death.Seriously, this movie makes me want to rip a quantum hole in nonlinear time so I can creep back 2 hours ago and put my own self in a choke hold until both of me passes out. Yes, I would induce a cosmic time loop paradox, causing the suns of several billion alternate universes to collapse, just to avoid the waste of time. Let that rest on your conscience, Coen brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country For Old Men","review":"Incoherent. Meaningless. Vacuous. Mind-numbing. Pointless. A crucifixion to sit through. It redefines the meaning of senseless. Academy Award stuff? ARRGH! Better, much better, to have sat in a closet and spent the time more usefully contemplating the vagaries of the Chinese language. A lot of people should go to jail for their involvement in this travesty. Abysmal is inadequate. Talk softly, kill a lot of people for no reason, and whatever happened to the money? The reason it is on DVD right now is that folks would throw up the theaters -- better at home. More sanitary. In the history of films, this ranks below Ed Wood's worst effort. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, however, it stank to the high heavens. MISS IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distant and Disconnected","review":"I give this film as much credit as the self proclaimed artiste who hurls paint to the wall and calls it art. The characters where NOT well defined and the purpose of the movie is somewhat meaningless. The direction pointless and a certain disappointment. I keep wondering if there is some guide I am supposed to read that explains it all as the movie did nothing. Some great individual acting but the outcome moot and amateur which I find surprising.

You had to keep a score card, just when it was getting a little interesting...Pan over to Tommy Lee Jones who gives a soliloque that sounded like the rambings of a man precariously close to Alzheimer's Disease. The movie ends and for a few seconds you are like a deer in the headlights, when you get over that you walk over to the DVD player, slap the DVD back in the case, hang your head and admit to God and the world that you just wasted a little over 2 hours of your life.

The plot was weak, the premise was depressingly dark; after the initial killings suspense pretty much disappeared, because there was no surprise in anything that followed. Gorey? Yes. Dark to the point of hopeless? Yes. If the theme was intended to be the age-old \\"Good vs Evil\\", well, the point was driven home ad nauseum, and, well, let's just say Good looks pretty outmatched.

It is difficult to believe that it received an Oscar for best picture. Technically it is excellent: in cinematography, acting, editing. But the subject is crazy -- just an excuse for one pointless bloody scene after another as more than 20 people are brutally murdered for no reason. Some critics have seen this as a profound comment on violence in our time. To me it is just sick, sick, sick. Of course, if you like numerous closeups of bodies and jagged bloodily wounds, you might really dig this film.

If you enjoy watching semi-graphic violence with strange insertions of characters who's lives have no importance, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is a waste of 2 1/2 hours of your life.

This movie will get you so deep into the mind of a murderer that it's frightning! You watch this movie and you realize how crazy this world is. The Coen Brothers have a uncanny ability to put you right into the story without you realizing it!

It was so full of suspense that I found myself squeezing my husbands hand or hiding my face so as not to see what would happen next.

We can't wait to see what the Coen Bros. come up with next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cohen Classic","review":"By far the best Cohen film ever, and that's saying a lot. This movie is glorious. The Javier Bardem character is fantastic; his cool efficiency is very impressive. I particularly like the gas station scene - great interaction with manager guy. The dialog throughout is very good, the tempo is great, sense of dread, etc. Note, though, this is a good degree of a cerebral film, not your standard killer fare. Lots of mood setting, slowly building events, etc. Brilliant though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is the Coen Brothers at their best. It has a knuckle-biting story, a superb cast, and a great script. Javier Barden as Chigurh (sounds like \\"Sugar\\") is perhaps the most pathologically malevolent character I have ever met. He makes my skin crawl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Ass","review":"What is not to love about this movie?! Disturbing, exciting, even funny - I don't think I will ever tire of this movie.

The movie was a bit on the violent side, but had me on the edge of my seat, which is what you expect from this type of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"Instead of a taut thriller like Blood Simple, their first film of this genre, the brothers have made a violent, unbelievable, repulsive film.Javier Bardem is a reverse Rambo who kills practically a third of Texas with impunity. Tommy Lee Jones was good in a role like this twenty or thirty years ago. He probably was using Barden's oxygen tank while not is use on the set.The ending was pathetic. After Tommy Lee Jones mumbled obviously \\"heavy\\" dialogue that needed subtitles for those who could not read lips, the film ends.After watching this film, I will not go to another Oscar best film for many years. Shame on all involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"i'm amazed at the positive reviews of this movie. it was terrible in my opinion. very slow, couldn't understand half what everyone was saying. about as bas as 'the happening'...i got nothing out of this movie....let the comments ensue lol.i watched it for free and feel like i got ripped off"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie. Ever.","review":"I wish I had some of what the Academy of Motion Pictures was smoking the day they voted this as Best Picture. I see in other reviews a lot of words being tossed around, crowing praises about this film: \\"minimalist,\\" \\"thriller,\\" \\"classic,\\" \\"bone-chilling,\\" and \\"masterpiece.\\" I heartily disagree. As much as I love movies, as many as I have seen, this is hands down the most pointless, heartless, meandering, and senselessly violent movie ever turned out of Hollywood.People who say they understand this film, were excited by it, loved it or whatever strike me as the same folks who praised the Emperor's new clothes as he paraded around naked.Save your money. This is not even worth a one-time rental. It will leave you depressed and disturbed. If there is a message in the movie, it is that life is a random crapshoot in which you cannot escape your fate, that no one will be spared, and that evil will win in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suicidal","review":"i don't seem to appreciate coen brothers--call it lack of intellectual capacity or the urge to see something worthwhile. it was a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made","review":"This dreadful excuse for a movie should never have seen the light of day.

It was very good up until the end. 1st of all, I think Tommy Lee Jones' character was utterly useless. So was the deputy. My goodness what was the point. I won't spoil the movie, because I dislike when reviewers do that, but i will say that the end is extremely disatisfying.The acting was excellent, in every way, but the character placement was very out of place. The ending is so utterly ridiculous that I got the sense that they ran out of ideas for an ending and decided to end it for the sake of doing so. I don't understand why movies like these are Oscar nomination worthy. I felt the same about American Beauty. What a waste of a nomination.Still, I thought the acting and the story did provide a reason to watch. The ending is the reason I gave it only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coen Brothers Movie","review":"I am a Coen Brothers fan. Fargo, and O Brother Where Art Thou, are in my top ten all time favorite movies. No Country For Old Men just doesn't cut it.Yes, there is some witty dialogue(\\"Can you validate?\\"; \\"I work at Walmart\\"), but as an overall movie I was extremely disappointed. I could go on and on, however, as an example of just one of the flaws in the movie......- You discover a transmitter that lets the bad guys know exactly where you are, but you don't destroy it. You just let it continue transmitting. And then you sit directly in front of the hotel room door, when you know from the shadows underneath the door, that the guy who is trying to kill you is at the door?? HELLOOO!!!!!????I really looked forward to this movie, but after seeing it, I can't help but shake my head. I was thinking of buying this, sight unseen, just because it was a Coen Brothers movie. I am glad I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Plot","review":"I really dont get why this movie was hyped. Saw it when it first came out. Story was pretty week. Ending was lame.

Plot zero.","review":"Purchased and watched when first out on DVD. Could not believe the idiocy of the plot. Racism on all fronts and nothing but mindless violence. Perhaps the Coen bros. are making attempts at anti-gun political leanings, but so worthless I was shocked.Don't waste your time or dollars on this. Every level reaks of reverse racism. Perhaps that's the true reason for making such a waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dips","review":"There is no way I am buying a second Blu-Ray copy of this movie. As much as I like the movie and everything the brothers Coen do, there is no possible justification for spending more money on it. Great way to annoy and alienate early adopters of Blu-Ray. At the very least, they should offer a upgrade path or buy-back for those of us who bought the original release on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"This was received in a timely manner and in good conditionI did not like this movie....To much killing.I would not recommend this, but this is my opinion.Also the actors names were under the wrong pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Country For Old Men","review":"I was SO disappointed. It was senseless and left unanswered questions. I can't EVEN believe it got awards. I rarely do reviews, but I felt compelled to pass this one on. Don't waste your time unless you enjoy a story with little direction and nothing good comes out of it. Thumbs down. If you like killing for no reason, watching decent people murdered, and an ending with no closure... perhaps this is for you. It was not for me! The only thing I CAN say, is the acting was okay. I really felt this could have turned out MUCH better than it did. Again... Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As disappointing as the book","review":"This movie has no ending. The narrative as it's established suddenly takes a left turn at the end. But I guess we're supposed to like this because the critics said so or that it won Best Picture. Or that the book was praised. This movie has one plus -- it has a great killer character in Javier Bardem. But the film's ending goes nowhere...just like the book. Faithful to the original material...and dumb. I prefer stories to be complete. I don't care if ending is happy or not but this sort of 'originality' is pointless--like the documentary Leviathan. Don't waste two hours of your life. Avoid the godawful boring book, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Over-Rated Oscar Movie","review":"Once again the Oscars prove that they have no ability to label what is a \\"good\\" and entertaining movie. This is the biggest over-hyped, 2-hour long \\"AVERAGE\\" movie I have seen in quite some time. I love movies, love them...and in my opinion have a very wide range of tolerances towards movies that want to bring the viewer into the film, surround them with characters and scenarios, but those wonderful movies also leave you at the end with closure.I understand this was an \\"artistic\\" movie as so many other people have commented.

I'll have to watch it again. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent film","review":"I, personally, found this movie to be quite excellent.The opening scene is just terrifying with Javier Bardem. (Although, the thick accent of Tommy Lee Jones' voice over was a bit of an obstacle at first.)I think the overall film was just great, and true to the novel it was based on. Every performance was mesmerizingly good! The eerie absense of a score made it all the more real for me as a viewer. And the cinematography was well executed. I could not have asked for a better adapation.A word of caution: I know many people cannot stand this film, but I think it deserves at least one impartial viewing. I liked this as a modernization of \\"the western\\" genre. In stead of trying to cram modern ideals into an historic setting, the Coen Brothers updated the western using great source material as their guide.I highly recommend this film, especially for Javier Bardem's chilling performance as one of the greatest maniacs in movie history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most suspenseful movie i have ever seen","review":"I'm not sure why this great movie has recieved only a 3.5 average review on here, because it is quite simply the most intense, well-acted and suspenseful movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. The best part about this is that it uses complete silence, rather than some random dramatic musical score, to achieve its suspense. Really, it is almost a flawless movie with hidden themes and great, memorable characters. The Coen's are masters at their craft and in my opinion this movie is even better than Fargo, albeit barely. Ignore the negative reviews, these people are clearly unable to appreciate good film-making. This fully deserved the Oscar it got and is a must see for absolutely everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You call it....it can't call itself","review":"I understand how some people do not like this film. This film is not an obvious film. By this I mean, at first glance you can be turned off by the violence, and the seeming purposelessness of it all, but a real movie fan will know different.This movie is probably one of the best films not only of it's time...but ever. An intimate tale of America and it's downward spiral into a culture of violence, \\"No Country for Old Men\\" laments the USA of old, and it's values while it assaults you with the violent today and a grim prophecy for the future.Not only a great movie..but a well stated thesis on pop culture America"},{"rating":"2","title":"instant top 10 favorite","review":"the movie was magnifecent. i have watched about 4-5 times now and every time i pick things up. great movie to add to anyones collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Road to Nowhere","review":"The acting was superb and the direction was excellent, but I felt as if I just wasted two hours.

I mean, these guys are genius. But this is a bad adaptation of a very, very good book.They've taken the bare plot bones of the book and shot it literally, nearly scene for scene. The problem with this approach is that the heart of the book isn't in the plot. It's in the inner life of the protagonist, the sheriff, and in the book the reader is taken by hand through this inner world of aging and dread. The Cohen's obviously think they've captured this by implication, and by a couple of scenes with the sheriff and his wife and father. But they have not. So, in the end, the viewer is just left hanging, wondering what the hell just happenned. This movie is, ultimately, as phony and one dimensional as The Blair Witch Project. Granted, everyone gives dandy performances. But to what effect? If you liked this movie, and if you didn't like this movie, read the book. Now that's a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"intensely gripping!","review":"The Coen brothers are two of a kind--exceptionally talented.

It is a cinematic meditation on violence-- masterfully made-- and soa must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Coen Brothers Masterpiece","review":"The Coen Brothers create another film that passes the threshold for greatness once again. This time with an undisputed Oscar. Tommy Lee Jones gives one of his greatest performances ever as a quiet West Texas sheriff feeling out gunned and in a more violent world than he ever imagined possible. A man played by Javier Bardem travels the area as a unrepentant murderer while others try to win money and drugs in a Texas/Mexican horror. The movie is similar to Blood Simple in that few characters beyond Tommy Lee and his wife have any moral feeling or backbone. The good doesn't win and the bad seems endless, no one does the right thing. An upsetting movie but a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie, wonderful picture.","review":"First of all No Country For Old Men is a perfect movie that tells the tale of men who feel like they are no longer cut out for this world. In midst of death who is on the move and striking with no indication that he is coming, there just isn't any more room for the old school way of the law. No respect, no remorse, and certainly no morality. This movie is a must see for its overall structure and narrative. Also, it is one of the finest transfers on blu-ray that I have seen to date. Study the opening scenes in the desert and with the car. The depth and clarity in the desert scenes are impeccable. When Javier Bardem's character gets picked up by the one cop, the road is so clear you can see almost every piece of sand glistening in the sunlight. This is a must buy for any serious blu-ray collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"no country for this ending","review":"The only reason i did not give this movie 5 stars was because of the ending.this was a great movie from start to finish. plenty of action and every body gets killed my favorite kind of movie;there are really no heroes to root for. the end leaves you hanging so i guess there will be a part two or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"an expensive piece of junk","review":"This filterbag is simply the same filterbag comes with the unit.

The 3rd and 4th seasons were rattling around in their individual DVD boxes, with two discs each sliding around getting scratched. Luckily, the damage was superficial.

Both children and adults can be entertained by the Fraggles. Don't let the packaging stop you from buying a really great show. Jim Henson doesn't make bad stuff.I've since reordered this collection.

It is truly a slap in the face to the fans who bought all the other series as they released them. We supported them, now they do this to thank us for our loyalty to their company? ARE YOU LISTENING HIT?A set like this is great - if all the other seasons have already been released. But it's not the case. Although I will have an incomplete set, I WILL NOT buy this just to get the last episodes. I refuse to buy something twice, just to fall into HIT's marketing gimmick.

Boycott this product until they give season four a standalone release."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Season Four? WTF?","review":"I don't write many reviews, and I really don't like posting a \\"review\\" before a product comes out, but HIT provides no easy way to give feedback on their website.I'm a big fan of Fraggle Rock and have been since I was a kid. I've bought all three seasons released so far, and I simply cannot understand why HIT isn't releasing a stand-alone season four instead of this ridiculous complete set. Way to milk the fans for every penny.It makes me sad because I really like the show, but there's no way I'm going to buy it a second time. Guess I'll just miss out on Season four.Please HIT, get on the ball with this and release a season four set. This is absolutely ridiculous. What were you thinking?Also, weren't there five seasons and 96 episodes of Fraggle Rock? Where did they combine seasons to make four sets anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money........","review":"My grandchildren are HUGE Fraggle Rock fans, which makes me happy. However, this \\"complete collection\\" is a huge disappointment. The DVD quality looks like the 1,000th copy of the 1,000th copy. At LEAST 7 wouldn't play at all! Packaging is horrible with all just thrown loosely in a box; not what one expects for a \\"collection\\" of anything. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING, if not total ripoff. The only reason for a \\"2\\" is that SOME play...but even then not well.Amazon should drop this product/provider.Fraggle Rock: Complete Series Collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Defective Sets = Refund","review":"First dvd set was defective. Replacement dvd set was also defective. Some of the discs did not play properly/skipped/screen blacked out. I was then issued a refund. If you order this product, please be advised to check that all the discs actually work before putting it away on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Fraggle Rock!","review":"What is there to say? It is fraggle rock, just one of those things that you love or hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Fraggle Rock Rules!","review":"This is a great set, and a perfect addition to any Fraggle fan's collection. I already had season one, but while I was looking for other seasons; I stumbled across this set.You will see many reviews knocking this set because season 4 is not available by its self; these reviews have nothing to do with this set so ignore them.The quality of this set is great, and box looks nice on the shelf next to my other series collections. It is a little light on the bonus materials as others have mentioned, but this in no way should stop you from picking it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed muppet fan","review":"Very disappointed that the production company would stoop to trickery to steal from would be fans. After faithfully collecting the first three seasons, we are forced to rebuy them to get season 4. In a word \\"Diththpicable!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - but get the newer complete set","review":"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.That being said, I'd recommend getting the newerFraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionDVD set. It has the complete series and is higher quality. For the price, it's a steal. I hope you enjoy your time \\"down in Fraggle Rock\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't have the same problems.","review":"I got this as a birthday gift, and didn't have the same problems others have had with the cardboard sleeves. Even though I know my dad mail ordered it, all my discs were safe and sound in their little beds, waiting to be viewed, not a scratch on them. In fact, they fit pretty snugly in there, and I can shake the folder upside down and not have them fall out.As for the actual content of said disks, it's worth having. Picture quality is better than I remembered, and the shows are great. Like most Henson productions, you may love it as a kid, but you come to appreciate it on another level as an adult. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving me cause to whemble","review":"I could understand if it was next holiday season, but they seem to have skipped a step by not even releasing season 4 separately. Even if HIT is convinced to release a stand alone Season 4, I can guarantee that they will take away the bonus features that are included in the box set...and that Michael Frith poster map sounds really cool. What a predicament for the die hard fan... wemble, wemble..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and great!","review":"Fraggle Rock was a classic series and this is all 4 seasons. Each episode has at least one great social lesson kids (and adults) can learn from. I'm a psychotherapist and I have some kid clients who can't wait to come in each week to watch and talk about it. Some have reviewed this package disappointed in the packaging. I don't get it. You get 20 DVDs in a cool hard case with raised cover that resembles a rock. I didn't buy this for a poster, I bought this (at a GREAT price) for the content. The DVD quality is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Form, HIT . . . Way to alienate your fans!","review":"Lame.I, like so many other fans, purchased the first three seasons individually, and eagerly awaited the release of the forth. HIT, you screwed this one up for a lot of us . . . Shame on you. I wish I could give you ZERO stars.Entertaining your fans = FAIL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Down in Fraggle Rock","review":"Wonderful set of DVD's for children who love to sing songs and enjoy Jim Henson's creative genius"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Box Set Packaging- Discs fall out and come scratched:(","review":"One star because of the way the box set packaging is made- a folder paper holder and each page has two slots to hold discs... the bottom disc slides out and then gets scratched in shipment. Exactly half of all my discs have minor scratching from this- every bottom disc became loose during shipment. So beware if you are ordering this and it has to be shipped to you! But if you can buy it in a store and you don't hear any loose discs when gently handling the box, GO FOR IT. Its otherwise a decent set, as long as you take care to keep it in such a way so the discs don't fall out.. which could happen easily if not paying attention."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",N,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-f8a2ff16"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/61.md","filePath":"library/61.md"}'),W={name:"library/61.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
