On the plus side; the acting is great and the plot is pretty offbeat. But the stuff about the weird stone and the \\"cult\\" (?!) doesn't really work to say the least. People who hated the plot of \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" should also avoid this. And Mira and Harvey as a couple didn't really convince me (even though when I'm at Keitel's age I would surely love to find a young groovy chick like Mira!).

It's an oddball movie which will have some viewers irritated; the premise is too out there for mainstream, yet the high qoutient romance will put off the cynics. But if you're a devout auster fan, you will enjoy this. His recurring themes of coincidence and chance, and questioning identity, translate well to film, and of course, the kafka influence.I look forward to his next one. hopefully he will fine tune his ideas more. a bit more of his literary tone and depth (see philip haas' adaptation of auster's the music of chance, which is a structurally comparable film). i'd love to see new york trilogy done as a film.the disc looks good, but it's only shown in full frame.

Yes, I like enigmatic, intricate movies. Yes I can suspend my disbelief. Yes I like it when movies enter a realm where reality as we know it loses ground. But this story is a mish mash. See Donnie Darko or even, as suggested by other reviewers, Jacob's Ladder for better made, well-constructed films that touch on the same subjects.Only about 10 minutes of this flick retained my attention. The rest was at best a yawn and for the most part, a frustrating eye-roller.

The quality of my skin degraded when I used this product--within a few days of use, the most sensitive areas of my face got a little blotchy (reddish), and the skin around my nose as well as between my nose and upper lip became persistently itchy. I think that most people will love this product--the first day that I used it, it went on so silky. It felt so light and my face looked finished.

I'm only in my late twenties and don't have many lines, but I feel like the foundation aged me twenty years. My skin was dry and taut and it actually made my pores look larger. I felt like it sapped all the moisture out of my skin. This product might be good for women with oily skin who live in humid climates, but if you live in a dry climate like me, do not buy this product! I've found better products at the drugstore, Neutrogena Healthy Skin Tint is excellent for the price and it will leave your skin looking a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't wash it off fast enough","review":"I was in their store yesterday and had the tech give me the full treatment: moisturizer, foundation primer, foundation, concealer, veil, warmth, blush and lipstick. I looked in the mirror and was positvely aghast -- where had all those lines and enormous pores come from? I never knew they were there. The color seemeed both too yellow and too dark, but the tech insisted it was the right one for me.I thought it was maybe the lighting in the store so checked myself out thoroughly in the rearview mirror (while stopped at lights LOL) as I drove home and then in the bathroom mirror at home. Yikes. I truly felt and looked hideous, and this was with a professional application! I couldn't wait to wash it off and see my own moist rosy cheeked complexion again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...

It took me a while to figure out it was the makeup, but once I stopped using it, my skin improved immediately.

I am middle aged with very good skin and I am not very wrinkled. This product accentuated my pores and the tiny wrinkles I do have. If I used very little like it says, it did not provide any coverage. If you use too much it covers but makes your face shiny and not natural. The colors were also hard to match. The darker too dark and the lighter, too light (almost ghost like). I don't know what all the fuss is about at all. I gave it to my 15 year old daughter to try who has acne. Maybe it would work for her. What a mistake, not only did it also accentuate her pores, it did not cover the acne, not even using the bisque and she broke out more. This product also takes a long time to apply. I did not like it at all nor would I recommend it but apparently I am certainly in the minority on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"thoroughly disappointing... and a little upsetting.","review":"I have a basic and non-time consuming make-up regimen, I also have very fair skin. I had hoped that Bare Escentuals would deliver as a shortcut to UV protection and providing light coverage with a natural finish. No such luck! I swear this product INVENTS fine lines and wrinkles. It is bizarrely \\"glowy\\" and makes me look shiny everywhere. It magnifies pores and lines by settling into them. It also takes much more time to apply than any other face powder I have ever used. The color wasn't bad, but the application, required brush, price, and performance were truly disappointing. Spare yourself and do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of hype for nothing","review":"The way I tried BE is by purchasing the introductory boxed set that had several colors, brushes and a video on how to use it. I used BE for an entire week following the video instructions exactly. I use a good skin care regimen (cleanse-tone-moisturize) to make sure my skin was properly prepared, and all to no success. IT MADE MY PORES LOOK HUGE. It accentuated fine lines. It made my skin appear overly shiny. It clogged my pores. I tried to make it work, but finally gave up and sent it back. I did end up liking the Mineral Veil powder applied as a finishing powder over my regular foundation (rather than over their foundation). It is very translucent and easy to apply. The rest of the BE products really were a lot more hype than substance in my opinion. I tried the eyeliner powder too, and it really irritated my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic Reaction- Bismuth Oxychloride in this product","review":"After using Bare Minerals for a Saturday morning and a Sunday morning application I have a horrible sunburn-like dry itchy raw face for 3 days.

I finally did a search on google over this last weekend about complaints people had with Bare Escentuals and found the culprit: bismuth oxychloride. I haven't used this product in 5 days and my skin has cleared up so much- its amazing!

I take full advantage of using the concealer brush and the kabuki brush for full coverage. I find that the shade I chose was a perfect match, it has good coverage, feels light and is less fussy to put on than regular foundation. I also like that it doesn't make me break out.I only gave it 4 stars because I find that it doesn't last all day.

I am rating this with 1 star because I believe it is a knock off or a fake. I'd actually give it 0 stars if that was an option. I have been using Bare Minerals Original Foundation Medium Beige for nearly seven years now... What I received is NOT the original foundation. What I received is more like a tinted mineral veil. It has a shimmer to it which the original foundation is not supposed to have. The coverage was not that of the original foundation but more of the mineral veil. Be careful who you buy from. Before I bought this from this seller, I always got it from Sephora. Lesson learned! I will never order from anywhere else again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly the same product I purchased at a Bare Escentuals boutique","review":"I am very satisfied.

I then tried the new matte version of B.M. and disliked it. It made my face look chalky and rested in my fine lines. I then switched to Silk Naturals brand and I used it the past 2 years. I recently bought B.M. at Sephora to try again and I was dissatisfied.Pros: I like the packaging, ease of washing off makeup, hardly any residue, keeps my skin clear & blemish free, light airy feel, natural ingredientsCons: I makes my face look oily on T-zone after 5 hours, does nothing for redness on my noseOverall: Silk Naturals is better, I can customize my shade, covers better & reduces redness, is all natural and doesn't make my face look oily even after I wear it 10 hours! It is slightly harder to wash off but that is ok since it has everything else I'm looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"BareMinerals","review":"Packaging is correct, but I'm not sure that it's the same make up.

Although I liked the way it looked, for some reason, my face felt itchy. So, I stopped using and started wearing MAC. But, MAC often made me feel like I was wearing make-up. So, one day, on may way to the MAC counter, I stumbled across bare minerals again.This time, I learned the proper way to apply it and what a difference that made! And, I love it! It really looks and feels natural. It makes me look better but not made up. I can wear it every day. And, people compliment me on looking great. So, my suggestion is that you take the time to go to a make-up counter and learn the proper techniques before you buy.My only concern is that bare minerals does not cover dark circles very well. So, I use Bobbi Brown for that. But, the other bare mineral products can help to give you a natural glow of beauty. And, the brushes are reasonably priced compared to other high end cosmetic brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be a fake.","review":"This makeup doesn't seem to be the same as real bareMinerals makeup.

I started using this from Amazon on Sunday and was not happy with it. The foundation does not cover as it has previously and the color is off. I supposedly received the correct color. I bought another foundation from Sephora yesterday and will compare the two. I will not buy from Amazon again due to this past experience.UPDATE - I received my foundation from Sephore and IT WAS EXACTLY AS EXPECTED. The foundation covered exactly how it and how I expected. I will NEVER buy Bare Minerals from Amazon due to this experience. It is a shame that the quality of the foundation cannot be guaranteed. Since it was fulfilled by Amazon, I thought there would be no quality issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even the real thing?","review":"I ordered this thinking I was getting a good deal on bare minerals foundation that usually costs $27 in stores. When it arrived, the color didn't look quite right and it didn't cover very well. And after using it for a few weeks, my skin was blotchy and was constantly breaking out. I started wondering if i was using real bare minerals because in my 3 years of using it, i had never experienced this problem. Then this weekend I went to sephora and bought the bare minerals there to see if it did the same thing. After one use I realized that what I had bought from amazon was either not the real thing or something that was mispackaged. Maybe this supplier has worked for you, but my recommendation is just to bite the bullet and pay a little bit more at sephora or ulta. Otherwise, this cheap bare minerals gets a lot more expensive when you have to spend $30 on the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the product I get at the Bare Essentuals Store.","review":"Arrived very quickly, however, this is nothing like the product that I usually buy at the Bare Essentuals Store.

To top it off, the breakouts came anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the fuss?","review":"I have tried mineral makeup on several occasions. When it first came out years ago, and just recently. I should have learned from the first time. I tossed it. I can see where woman who don't wear makeup would like it - it looks like you have nothing on. It doesn't feel that way, however. My pores felt smothered. If you want the no-makeup look - why bother spending the money. Go au-natural!Another thing I did not like was the mess of the fine particals.

I loved it at first then began having problems with runny, irritated eyes. I was told by a professional that the foundation causes respiratory problems and eye irritation. I stopped using the foundation 2 months ago but continued to use the eye shadows. My eye symptoms were reduced but did not go away completely.Last weak I had a routine eye exam and reported a decline in my vision. After examining my eyes, my Dr asked if I wear Bare Minerals makeup. I was shocked that she knew my make up brand by an eye exam. The Dr went on to inform me that the lining of my eyes and tear ducts were coated with the makeup which is not only unhealthy but was causing some vision problems as well, this is common with Bare Minerals. I spoke with my esthitician who said she is no longer recommending or selling Bare Minerals due to these known issues.

In theory I like it--I don't like applying heavy, oily feeling foundations to my face so the thought of a powder was intriguing. I found it covered well, but no matter what color or tint I used, it made my skin color look off. The sales person said this sometimes happens and suggested I try a similar mineral foundation from another company which worked much better with my skin tones. What I found hard to believe though was that none of their hues that matched my skin tone managed to look natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not like this product","review":"I really don't understand what all the fuss is about this make-up. Using it with the concealer brush seems to cause the powder to cake up in creases like around your nose and under eyes throughout the day, which is gross. Also, it seemed to make my face oily by the end of the day rather than keep me from getting shiny like it's supposed to. It's also supposed to have staying power (doesn't come off in water??), but I found it does not stay on very well when you're working out rigorously, so I ended up removing before going to the gym. All in all, I'm totally disappointed and am sorry I spent the money on the kit. I'll stick to traditional concealer and pressed powder, which looks much more natural than this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best foundation I've ever used","review":"I am so delighted to have started using the Bare Minerals line of products. I've had problem skin most of my life. Any foundation I used created acne flair ups.

And the built-in sun protection is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"You wouldn't think that just a powder like this could give you coverage, but yet give you a natural glow, but this does. Must use the professional makeup brushs for applying to get the full benefit (make sure to clean them with warm water and mild soap regularly). Also, the other products are great with it: blush, bronzer, eye makeup to create the maximum overall great look. Also, the products wash off nicely, and stay on well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product ever!","review":"I first bought this off of an infomercial 3 years ago hoping that the claims were correct.

It wears off in 2 hours and gives me a strange yellow cast to my skin. Since it wears off so fast I was buying very often which became pricey. I LOVE my $12 foundation from Physicians Formula that is mineral based, does not irritate my skin, and last ALL day!

It is very sheer and absorbs the shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake one","review":"I use Bare minerals for 3 years now, I really love it. I was thinking that was a really good deal on Amazon, but I can tell that is not the real bare minerals!Bad coverage, even I try to put more on my face, the result is not uniform at all and looks like I don't have any make up on my face. I am very disappointed. I don't recommend to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me look older","review":"I really wanted to like this product.....but I did not. It is expensive, and it settled in my fine lines, making me look older than I do without make up at all. The \\"concealer\\" didn't conceal anything. It says it's not a powder, and feel more creamy, but it just felt like powder to me, and I felt like I had to put too much on to try and get any coverage at all. Then it just looked like I had too much make up on. I would advise anyone that wants to try it, to go to a Bare Escentuals store, or Sephora, wherever.......and try it before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone: Bad for SOME skin types","review":"I loved this product at first: the coverage was great, especially for my adult-acne skin. But there's the problem. I've always gotten breakouts from powders. A friend convinced me this \\"wasn't a powder,\\" but if it looks like a powder and spills like a powder, it's a powder. Sadly, this product gave me the really bad kind of acne I haven't had since I was a teenager (I'm in my thirities now). It's accurate to say that it polluted my skin. Eventually I realized I was using this makeup mainly to cover up the very blemishes it was giving me. It's sad, because the makeup did make my skin look flawless--for about three weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bare","review":"The bareMinerals does not cover.

However, it does help the foundation you have on look fresh all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away if you have sensitive or oily skin","review":"I too got sucked in by this overly-advertised product. While it did reduce the appearance of large pores, it irritated my sensitive skin which itched like crazy. Also, this product seems to make my oily skin appear extremely oily even with the mineral veil applied over it. The concept of mineral makeup is wonderful but perhaps this product needs more refinement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for Sensitive Skin!","review":"If you have sensitive skin, BEWARE! This product gave me dermatitis after using it, and it took me weeks to get rid of it! My skin is extremely sensitive and so many people swore by it but I will never use any Bare Escentuals product again. If I had to keep one thing from what I bought, it would be the Mineral Veil (due to the reflective properties). I've had a much better experience with GLOMinerals and didn't experience any of the irrtation that I did with Bare Minerals. I will never buy this product or any Bare Escentuals product again. Unlike the very long infomercials, this product is NOT PERFECT FOR EVERYONE and can cause irritation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bare Minerals","review":"I love this product and will continue to purchase!

I love the fact that you don't have to wash it off (even though I do because I like a clean face to go to bed in at night) but knowing that it won't damage my skin or plug my pores if I don't. And I love the fact that you aren't putting harsh chemicals on your skin.

My daughter started wearing Bare Minerals so she put her make up on my wrist. I liked the feel and blending of Bare Minerals. The next week I bought the starter kit. I have fair skin and it is in good shape except I have had cancar on my nose which was removed. As I have gotton older it shows more. I put on the Bare Minerals along with the bisque concealer and it looks great. I have had no breakouts and sooo many compliments on my skin. I am looking forward to putting a kit together for my eyes and lips. I love the product.

I apply jojoba oil and let it absorb before adding the foundation. I have purchased 3 colors, fairly light which I mix with fairly medium which I also mix with medium.

Nice value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cakes oddly after a few hours","review":"I've seen this recommended before, but it didn't work for me.

I have to apply more than suggested to get medium coverage, and by mid-day.. its like it has washed off and I have no makeup on, and I have to re-apply! It also has a very shiny sheen look to it, which is okay in person, but I spend most of my day in front of cameras and it makes my face appear oily as if theres no makeup. I don't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bare Minerals Products","review":"I have been watching these TV commercials since they began and always wanted to try the products. I saw them at Amazon and decided to give them a try. What a wonderful set of cosmetics for several reasons. First, they are easy and quickly applied,taking less than five minutes. Secondly,they give you a natural, sheer appearance-not a liquid foundation look. Lastly, they make you look amazing and refreshed! People keep telling me that I look great. Well worth the price! I'm extremely pleased with this product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the product, not Flawless Beauty","review":"I absolutely love bareminerals, but I don't really like the price so I was trying to find it cheaper then $25. I had about a week of foundation left so I went ahead and ordered the Medium shade from Flawless Beauty and they sent me Warm Tan - not even close! I had to ship it back and wait for them to receive the returned item before they would ship a new one. Long story short, I ran out of this foundation and had to go buy it at Sephora anyway. They did finally send the correct product but it was a hassel - I'd much rather pay the extra $5 then order from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Note that the item is bigger than typical bare minerals size. But i love the sifter since I travel a lot and it's nice to control the powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good!","review":"I've been using bare minerals for over 5 years. In the beginning, it did make my skin a little irritated but that's because I have really sensitive skin. It took me a couple of days to get used to it and I don't use the primer. I think it works great and I also like the new cream concealer. It is awesome paired with the powder foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent wrong color","review":"I was happy to receive it as I was out and needed to take some along on vacation only to find out the wrong color was sent and it did not work with my complextion. I didn't look at it closely upon receiving it as I took for granted that the right color was sent, thus throwing out all of the packaging it came with so I was unable to return it.Next time, I will be sure to look closely to make sure the correct color was sent. Only for that reason....I was dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a click, lock, go sifter","review":"This product was shipped quickly, however it does not contain the new Bare Minerals sifter design.

It didn't provide that glow that I had expected, but instead a dull, flat color. The bronzer only made my skin look unnatural with my fair complexion. I have combination skin, and I also found that even after a couple hours of wearing Bare Minerals, it became cakey in my most oily spots, and built up in the creases of my nose. The makers of Bare Minerals say \\"It's so light you can sleep in it.\\" Well I wouldn't recommend sleeping with this product on your face. YOU WILL BREAK OUT. Overall.. I wouldn't recommend paying $25+ for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oily & Cakey","review":"At first I loved bareminerals and pur minerals. But after only a few hours My face feels so gross and oily. It feels very heavy on my skin. I can't wait to get home and take it off everyday. That is not how you should feel about your makeup. I switched to Neutrogena's mineral makeup and so far love it. It is missing 2 ingredients that the other mineral makeups have and I think that is what makes the difference. It's light and covers well. The only thing is the lady at Ulta told me to get a light concealer then the foundation, well that was wrong, I looked like a ghost. I am getting the same color today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coverange, better skin","review":"I would never go back to liquid makeup! This make up is great. It has great coverage and keeps my face from breaking out as much. One application of liquid makeup and I am fighing blemishes for weeks, but with BE I don't have to worry about it. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the hype","review":"I have tried to like this foundation. I understand that many women love this stuff. I find that is is caky on my skin. Also the color is not quite right. They seem to think their fair shade fits all fair skin gals and it just doesn't. In certain lights it looks blotchy and yellow on my skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those days when only light coverage is needed","review":"I am partial to the Bare Escentuals bareMinerals line. This was the first bareMineral line I used and they only one I came back to after trying others brands. This product has a spf 15 and everyone needs this kind of protection. The formula is light and never cakey. It has been my experience that the chance of a break out using this foundation is minimal. It doesn't settle into every wrinkle on the face. It blends very well on the skin and the shades are easily matched to one's skin tone. I have used this whenever I need just a very light makeup coverage. This foundation glides onto the skin and looks very natural. But if you are looking for a heavier powder foundation that gives more coverage, then this probably isn't for you. I use another brand when I need more coverage. All in all, this is my go to coverage for those days when I only want a little color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coverage if you get the right shade for your skin tone","review":"I tried other drugstore mineral foundations - neutrogena and l'oreal - and thought that if they were pretty good, then this would be even better - but I was a little disappointed that the shade I purchased was not as medium as I thought it would be. I understand that I would probably achieve better results with the kit so that I could mix the colors in the hopes of getting closer to my skin tone. I would recommend going to sephora and trying out the colors if you're having a difficult time deciding on a shade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive skin","review":"I have lupus, and this is the ONLY foundation my skin can tolerate. It's also a wonderful sunscreen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use but not for all faces","review":"My thanks to MJ for the extensive review and the common sense advice about skin care. I have used Bare Minerals Foundation and Soft Focus for several years on my normal-to-dry face with generally very good results. I agree with those who caution about expecting this product to hide or cure all face problems. My complexion is texturally smooth with some unevenness of color due to age, and the products have done well to minimize (NOT HIDE) the imperfections. I like Bare Minerals ease of use and the way they feel on my skin, so I accept the incomplete concealment. With a couple of other people, I find that as I age, I have to use the powders with more care, since even a little too much can accentuate lines and shadows. At some point, I'll probably have to abandon powder makeup, but until then, I'll stay with the Bare Minerals products that have been so good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE This Brand.","review":"I absolutely love this fondation. It feels nice and light and evens my skin tone very nicely. It can't cover up anything though- I have some small freckles on my cheeks and they fade with the foundation but they don't completely dissappear, which I have no problem with. It also doesn't cover up dark circles under eyes very well.What I love most about this foundation is that I actually seem to break out LESS when I wear it, specially when I wear the mineral veil over the foundation. I've been using it for over two years now and I'm still pleased with its quality.A side note: I have pretty normal skin, I barely break out. My skin used to get pretty oily on my forehead (which has stopped since I've been wearing this foundation) and some portions of my face would dry out (which also rarely happens now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"White heads eruption!","review":"It was time to purchase some new make up and I had seen the infomercials regarding Bare Minerals.

I have sensitive skin, but this make-up didn't affect me immediately. Slowly, I started seeing little bumps form on my forehead. Then the bumps spread everywhere on my face and I realized many of them were transforming into little white heads. I tried to extract them safely, but they have now become too much for me to handle. When I wash my face, I feel hundreds of tiny bumps under my skin. I haven't been using it for 3 days now, and I'm hoping that my skin will return back to normal soon. I never had any of the itching like some of the others, but the break out has really affected my self esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Mineral Foundation","review":"I love minerals make up because it is light and you do not feel like you are wearing make up. I have light skin with golden undertones. I used Bare Minerals fairly light foundation.Bare Minerals goes on smooth and blends well and looks natural. Bare Minerals sits on top of your skin and makes your pores look bigger. Unlike the commercials claim you do not \\"look as if you are not wearing make up\\" in fact your look like you are wearing tons. It is a natural look but still a make up look.Frankly, there are better mineral foundations than bare minerals my favorite is E.L.F. (eyes lips & face). It has a great mineral foundation which is better than the bare minerals foundations and a fraction of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Works!","review":"I don't know what I would do without Bare Minerals. It is THE best foundation I've ever used, and I wouldn't even think to use anything else now. My daughter in law turned me on to Bare Minerals last Mother's Day. It was a great present, and I've been buying the products ever since. I love it so much, I bought this for the females in my life, for Christmas Presents this year!What's great is that it doesn't look like you are wearing anything at all. It's a foundation that blends with your skin tone. No lines, or any indication whatsoever that you are wearing makeup......just a beautiful finished face! :) Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is ok, but overrated","review":"I tested it first on the sensitive inner side of my upper arm after reading the bismuth oxide warning someone posted on this site, but did not have an adverse reaction, so I went ahead and tried it on my face. I was less than impressed. It evened out my skin tone somewhat but also did make my pores look larger. I do not think I will buy it again. I have had better results with drugstore brand foundations (such as L'Oreal's True Match) and I do not think this is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks!","review":"I tried this product after I heard people raving about it and was not pleased at all. It made my skin look very shiny, even after I used the mineral veil. Also it accentuated every little line and pore.

Would not recommend this product to anyone over 35....(I am 42)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I bought this foundation at Ulta awhile back and I'm NOT pleased with it. It does not cover blemishes or redness, and makes my pores look huge. I would NOT reccomend this to anyone with dry skin, as it it makes you look like a flaking beast. I tried Clinique's Soft Finish foundation and am much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning, Contains Bismuth Oxide!","review":"Itchy! This face powder contains BISMUTH OXIDE, which is technically a mineral, but has no place in a face powder.It turns out that I am highly allergic to bismuth oxide, like many people. I couldn't wash this product off my face fast enough! Ouch ouch ouch! There are other mineral powder products that do NOT contain this toxic mineral, and I'll be trying them.Many of the glowing \\"reviews\\" on this page were very likely written by people who WORK FOR BARE ESCENTUALS. I used to work for a (non-cosmetic) company, and the manager had everyone in the company write gushing reviews of the products we sold on Amazon. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horrible for me","review":"I saw this in an infomercial about 2 years ago, and I was really excited. I ordered it right away.

I was really disappointed. Everybody's skin is different, and I just wish it worked for me as it did for everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coverage lacking in this mineral-based foundation","review":"I wanted to like this product so much after reading all the glowing reviews here and on Makeup Alley; however, bareMinerals is just that -- too bare for anyone who needs decent light to medium coverage.No complaints about the color match. No complaints really about the effect on skin quality or health (I didn't wear it long enough to notice breakouts or any other reactions). The real complaint is that bareMinerals was too sheer and should not be recommended to women unless they have unwrinkled skin, teeny-tiny pores, and no blemishes or imperfections to cover.BareMinerals just didn't cut it for me although I'm sure it works well for women with skin that's good enough not to need foundation in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal!!!","review":"I have used BareEssencials/BareMinerals for many years and I LOVE it, but, this definitely was not an official product.

My daughter has suffered with acne and has some minor scarring, although the acne has since subsided. We (she and I)were looking for something that would cover her complexion, but not be heavy. I used to think the woman on television who says, \\"this product saved my life,\\" was pretty corny, but this product is amazing. I can't tell you how well it is working for my daughter. It looks very natural, but does the job of cover-up. I am thinking about buying it for myself, as I have a mild form of rosacea."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good.","review":"I have pretty dry skin, so finding a foundation that works is hard. After this sets down on my skin, it looks very cakey and makeupy, the girl that sold it to me claims that it hydrates, but it does not hydrate enough and I truthfully don't know how much it could really hydrate for something that is in powder base. This is a nice product, for people who have oily/normal/combo skin, would not recommend for ladies with drier faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"bareminerals","review":"It seems like this product is diluted.

I have dark circles and acne problems that are hard to cover, so I am always willing to try make-up that says it provides good coverage without looking heavy. As soon as I put BareMinerals on, my face started feeling tight and cakey. It was hard to tell where I had put in on already because the coverage is so poor. This foundation does not cover at all like it says it does. It did make my skin look fresh and healthy, but the acne showing through kinda ruined the effect. I would recommend this product to someone who has nothing to cover up, but then why bother wearing foundation at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant aging","review":"I've never put a product on my face that instantly added 20 years to the look. Suddenly I had lines and wrinkles that I never saw before. All the moisture was sucked out of my face pulling it taut. Horrible! I even tried several different shades and colors. All of them did the same thing. Who are these people trying to kid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I was the only one who didn't like this","review":"1 star for the warmth powder. If you're fair skinned and want to look slightly bronzed the warmth powder is good, but you have to apply it very lightly. The rest of it, like some others have already mentioned, doesn't necessarily live up to the infomercial's claims. I realize now that I should've gotten the primer lotion to use with it. But how great can it be if you have to buy more stuff in order to make it look right? The best foundation I've tried is by Bobbi Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved how it looked, BUT NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.","review":"I absolutely loved how BE looked at a minimal coverage level, but that, for me, was the only positive. (1) It does not last--with or without a primer. I believe that due to infomercials and unhonest selling techniques, we just assume it does and think it's there even when it's not since it's so \\"sheer.\\" (2) It's not sheer and it does look like you're wearing a powder makeup. You're not fooling anyone except yourself while wearing it. I, however, did not wear full coverage, so it gave my face a glow as if I had used a powder highlighter--and I liked that. Full coverage looks hideous. (3) I have sensitive skin and I had an extremely itchy, burning, tightness of the skin allergic reaction to this product. It has taken a week to leave my system and caused my face to turn bright red and peel as if I had sunburn. The negatives definitely outweight the positives for me. Beware for those with sensitive skin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't leave home with out it.","review":"I have been using this product for three years, and will not leave my house with out it.

This color is supposedly for those with golden or olive skin, but what I found out from a representative at a local makeup store (after trying and HATING this color) is that the \\"golden\\" color line was created for people of Asian descent, so the Golden Medium base made me look like I had a nice case of jaundice. Generally I love BareMinerals products, this was just a bad description for color matching purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switch over to this superbly light foundation","review":"I have been wearing makeup of every make and this foundation exceeds any and all other makers.

Cuts my preparation time down by 1/2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great for awhile but everyday wear produces cystic acne","review":"Applied sparingly this does look nice and photographs well but some component of the powder made me itch and burn and resulted in some very painful contact dermatitis/acne that took a week to clear. In fact some of the fallout from my use of this product left scarring. I do not recommend. Look around on make-up review sites and see for yourself. My story is repeated over and over by other women who wasted money on this product. This stuff is very, very irritating and applied heavily it does not look natural or good. For being photographed maybe. Otherwise little to no make up or a quality tinted moisturizer with SPF is the way to go.

So I went to the mall and tried out Pur minerals and their line of products. Tried and true pur minerals is AMAZING. I can wear my regular moisturizer, dont need a seperate concealer, and it looks airbrushed just like bare minerals...without the dry feeling. Pur minerals has shea butter in it which helps hydrate and I highly recommend the mineral spray which has vitamins and essential oils to spray on after you apply your mineral makeup and it sets it. The spray is awesome I spray my face to rehydrate about every 5-6 hrs and pur minerals wears ALL DAY litrally!!!! Try it and the best thing is its half the price of bare minerals!!!!! Try it and you will be sold I promise..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Coverage","review":"I paid $65 for a bare mineral kit and must say was extremely disappointed with it. The mineral foundation does not offer any coverage and it actually starts to look cakey within an hour of wear. It settles into your pores and any lines you may have. I've recently switched to Youngblood mineral makeup and LOVE IT. It has amazing coverage and lasts 8 hrs without having to apply more. I do not recommend bare minerals and wish I would have known about it's poor performance before I dumped $65 down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although it doesn't work for everyone, it covered my acne scars","review":"This product just like every other product out there is not for everyone and i agree with one reviewer who said that this line is not a solution for skin problems. However, i feel for some, it can pose as a temporary solution. I suffered from minor acne and acne scars and the BE covered my flaws beautifully. I really like this make up and will continue to buy it because I can have the illusion of clear skin and it makes me feel good. It's light, it blend in with my skin tone and it's doesn't take long to take off. However, this is not for everyone and i know it hasn't worked for everyone with the same problems as me.P.S. I still continue with daily and nightly regime even with this make up. This make up did not make me give up caring for my skin whatsoever. The make is not a solution to my problem but something to make the situation not as bad.

Got this last year. When I applied it I thought, \\"oh nervana finally a product that lives up to its claims\\". It looked absolutely fabulous. I loved it! That was before the skin burning & itching started. I tried using it again, same result, had to wash my face immediatley.

If you must try it, use with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No dice","review":"While this stuff does feel pretty nice and could look good as just an overall powder, I looked at myself in better lighting and actual sunline and saw lines I never knew I had! I'm 27, and let me tell you it looked like I suddenly aged quite a few years. Basically rubbing powder into your skin isn't helping things. I use the cheapest crap foundations, but I use very little and do it right -- hence it seems to work just fine. I'm sure most of the glowing reviews here are by the company itself, or women who just don't have very good lighting to see what they actually look like with this stuff caked on. This foundation is okay in very small doses after applying mositurizer, but I wouldn't dare rub it near my eye area again. It also makes my skin look drier, but moisturizer seems to help a bit.

Everything gives me hives or a rash or acne. This stuff is tops. I love it. Doesn't cause any problems, has buildable coverage and is so easy to use. Ok, if your skin has a lot of acne and you want it all disguised, this probably isn't for you. But if you have a couple small blemishes and want to even out your tone, it's great. My skin is a little oily and I think this foundation holds its own pretty well. Before I apply I do put on some generic Oil of Olay moisturizer because it helps set the powder better but after that, you're done. So easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Upon first buying this product- a hefty $60 plus tax- I was very excited to use it!

I have good skin and have never had a breakout as bad as this. I have little clumps of whiteheads together on my cheeks, zits on my chin, forhead, and hairline! It is absolutely disgusting, it won't go away even though i discontinued using this product around 3 weeks ago. Now I have to go to the dermatologist so I can be prescribed retinol for my acne.

Like another reviewer, it also makes my skin itch.The most annoying thing I found is that, no matter how little I used, the powder seemed to 'migrate' down my face and end up on my mouth. I ended up constantly rubbing it in clumps off of my lips. Yuck. No other powder I have used has ever done this. This was $25 not well spent.

I thought the Fairly Light would be better for my lighter 'winter' skin color. WRONG. It looks pasty, and I feel like I look like I have makeup on. Generally I use the bisque concealer in the inner corners of my eyelids to offset the darker skin color there, and then down the sides of my nose and fan the bisque out towards my cheeks. Then allover with the Medium foundation using the big kabuki, then Warmth for blush using the baby kabuki, which I also swath across my eyelids. That's it, 5 minutes and I feel like I look natural but not tooooo natural (I'm 57) Anyway, the Med Beige is a great color, and evens my skin tone.

In order to confirm my suspicions, I went and retrieved an old container which I purchased from Sephora, so I knew it was legit. Sure enough the imitation was the same in appearance, but the major difference was that the fact that there was no batch # on the imitation (There was one on the good container) and the font on the bottom label is different.Buyers Beware as there is no telling how this makeup is composed and that in itself is scary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great for Me","review":"Nice clean finish, looks natural on the face and does not clog pours.

I thought I would need the lightest (fair) one, but the sales rep told me it would be too light (surprising), but she was right. If I had bought lighter I would look like a ghost. So, great for pale skin.It covers up my red cheeks. It is soft and smooth and my skin just feels great. It stays on most of the day (unlike the concealer, which wears off much more quickly on me).

Actually, even Wonderbread grilled cheese sandwiches are better made with some other Lodge devices that serve multiple duties, such as any cast iron frying pan over 8\\" diameter. That leaves this little 5 inch square as being square and basically useless, which it is. Avoid wasting even a dollar on this. The \\"wonder\\" in this pan is that it sells at all.

It comes sliced or unsliced Two eggs scrambled works fine when paired with sliced ham and a slice of cheese. The whole sandwich can then be grilled in the still hot skillet in which the eggs were cooked. I am amazed at the comments about the size being so small when the description clearly stated the size as 5\\"square. 5' is the same the world over, so why the surprise.

As the other reviewers said, my home made bread does not fit perfectly, and I had to trim some slices slightly on two sides. Also, the handle is small and gets extremely hot. Now for the reasons I assigned 5 stars. Because of its size, in comparison with other cast iron pans, it is very light weight, which is great for people with joint problems or who want to avoid even moderately heavy lifting. Also, there is never enough storage space in kitchens, and this pan takes up little space; it can be hung if desired. Although it is pre seasoned, after using it, I scrub with hot water, heat it, and rub with oil; there has been no sticking. I also cook with a tiny amount of margarine (or butter), much less than with my previous pan. My family has really enjoyed what I prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Bad Product Coating","review":"The \\"seasoned\\" coating on this product is horrible.

Nicholas Cage contributes heavily to the awful stench that permeates from 8MM with his dramatic over acting and stiffness. 8MM tires its hardest to be dark, edgy, and surprising, but fails at all three. Luckily, Joel Schumacher decides to explain the entire movie to you at the end with his character \\"Machine\\" giving you the entire synopsis behind his mischief, much like a James Bond villain. If you enjoy abusing yourself with obnoxious and tiresome movies, then 8MM is definitely for you. However, if you like movies that are entertaining and have a redeeming quality, stay away from 8MM."},{"rating":"1","title":"not true to life","review":"This could've been a deep and disturbing descent into the alleged world of snuff films; instead, it is undercut by incompetence at every turn. To begin with, you cannot just go into a porn store and ask about snuff films expecting to get a lead on some \\"hot stuff.\\" I also thought it was totally unbelievable that a private investigator (played by Cage) would be so completely shocked by viewing such a film-- where does he work, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood? And why he wasn't killed by the bad guys early on is beyond me. It degenerates into a vigilant revenge drama with a poorly-shot chase scene at the end. A very unsatisfying film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schumacher - Fooeymacher!","review":"This guy could ruin Casablanca. He is horrible. Only he could make Cage look like he had just read the script fifteen minutes before the shoot. Schumacher supposedly made a couple of Batman film too. Batman? Ha ha ha.

On the plus side, James Gandolfini puts in a really solid performance as usual. There is about four minutes of film worth watching here. Bite me Schumacher.

When is Cage going to start actually reading the script before he decides to star in a movie? The story line is just O.K. and yes the music was interesting but once again they made a film that missed almost every aspect of good movie making.

It's not Cage's best. I wouldn't like to call it his worst since it's not all THAT bad, but this is my least favorite Nicolas Cage movie. Boy, Schumacher did it again, huh? First he ruined the Batman series, and now he blemishes a great actor's filmography. If David Fincher would have directed this (not because he's my favorite director or anything; this is just his kind of movie cause he did such a great job with the dark atmosphere of \\"Seven\\"), this could have been one great movie! Lousy Schumacher... he outta stick to his John Grisham novels and leave the cool things alone cause all he does is ruin them. The film is disturbing and it's a little effective cause you feel so sorry for the girl and her mom, but it's just lacking a story and just drags on.

I know he can do better than this (and Snake Eyes)But it's not entirely his fault. The story was full of holes and did not flow well. I guess he did the best with what he was given to work with.

He is great in this movie....just like every movie he is in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An overall horrible performance","review":"My friends and I went to see this movie in the theater, expecting Nicholas Cage to have an incredible outting, but to our surprise, the movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and definitely Nick's worst role ever. Overall, about an hour into the movie, all it seemed to be was an expensive porn that they actually would show in the theater. My friends and I were very discouraged by the horrible footage seen in this movie, that we walked out.

All that can be said is that it must have read well in script format. The issues that it brings up demands a director with better respect for the intelligence of any audience. Considering the self-importance of the director audio - anyone who respects the idea of film exploring serious issues will note the instructional value of what not to do. One can't blame the actors/writers on this vanity project.

But he had help. The film, a lurid journey through the sexual netherworld, becomes bogged down almost immediately by starchy dialogue and forced performances. Nic Cage painfully overacts here. See his reactions while watching the eponymous film alone, unable to voice his disgust. Or the way he wipes his fingers on his coat after handling pornographic snapshots. Hardly subtle. Schumacher must shoulder some blame here. From behind the camera he must have seen his actors getting away from their roles and should have reined them in some. Self-conscious editing unfortunately does not distract enough from a story that decends into simple-minded gratuitousness and revenge fantasy. And an annoying sub-plot involving his wife mars the film further. One element of \\"8mm\\" that intrigues is the music, a blend of contemporary Middle Eastern rythyms, though it has no place in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"i found it very over-rated","review":"This over-rated, if not cheesy, film left the same bad taste in my mouth that HACKERS and AMERICAN HISTORY X did. In both cases the filmmakers exploited something that they obviously did not know much about in the first place (the hacker and skinhead subcultures, respectively). That's what I didn't like about those movies and it's what I don't like about this movie. It's a glossy pseudo-sad (the ending is pathetic) movie that uses stereotypes of the porno industry to tug at heart strings. Also, Nicholas Cage suffers from extreme over-acting the entire time. I would have given this negative stars but that just isn't possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a real life hero!","review":"Very powerful movie. It strikes you from everywhere. Pretty original story and very good acting by Cage.

He is angry and he lets his anger out! He hates and he lets his hatered show him the way! That may be the \\"path to the dark side :)\\"but that's the way people are. If I were in his place I would have done the same thing. I hate movies where the hero will not hurt the bad guy cause it ain't right.

Both were written by Andrew Kevin Walker. But Joel falls short in this unpleasant, clichéd film. With Se7en, you were swept along with the characters. In 8mm, you can feel the hand of the director pushing you were he wants you to go. 8mm is blatant in it's attempts to manipulate the viewer, but is so clumsy you end up resenting it and the director for doing so. A film like this needs to be more subtle in it's attempts to coax the desired response from the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Descent into Hell","review":"PI Nicholas Cage must investigate a film which is part of the estate of a millionaire. After viewing it (and thinking that it might be a \\"snuff\\" film), Cage accepts the assignment from the widow of trying to determine the identity of the girl in the film and what really happened to her.I have always thought that Cage is this era's Jimmy Stewart and the first half of the film stengthened this belief but as the movie descended into extreme violence and extreme language, I kept on trying to imagine if Jimmy Stewart would appear in such a movie. My answer is probably \\"yes\\" because, unfortunately, we are in a different era.I loved the first half of the film (especially the scenes with the victim's mother) but the second half was, maybe, a little over the top. It shows a decent man's descent into Hell and is definatly not for the squeamish or the young.Overall, a good film but not for everyone. It did remind me of George C.

Yes, I sat through the whole thing minus the credits and watched the making-of and trailer, but this film is not owner's material...for anyone, unless you're depraved yourself. Friends/family told me about this film, some giving me a warning about the content, but I decided to try it for myself, I don't regret that decision, but its definately a one time watch.

I'm from that part of California, and I certainly would have.Or how did Machine know Cage was after him in the house? Cage seemed quiet to me. And where was the mother during all the action? And how did Machine hide in the house so he could restart the record?The movie depends heavily on characters who are evil without real motive. There may be people like that, but they are quite rare.

However, all of this is unfortunately shadowed out by the disguesting subject matter. I honestly had no idea what a snuff film was when I went into the theatre. When I left (I walked out about halfway) I had a very good idea, to put it lightly. I'm sure that if you a) enjoy this type of violent pornography, or b) are desensitized to this type of violent pornography, then this is probably a good film. Basically, know this before you see it, because this is one of those movies (actually there aren't many)that you see and think, damn, how in the hell did that get an R rating? I found myself wondering this to myself many times throughout the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The critics were correct, for once.","review":"I'm not exactly the most discriminating movie goer. I watch -- and enjoy -- a lot of bad movies. That being said, 8mm is the only movie I've seen in the last two years that I felt was a complete waste of time and money.Nicolas Cage's performance is weak, the plot is unbearable, and the conclusion is predictable. The result is an unpleasant, mean-spirited movie that you won't want to watch all the way through.Avoid this movie. It's not even worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you gaze into the abyss...","review":"Those who panned the film should ask themselves whether they are capable of reading the info on the cover of the DVD. It definetly doesn't read \\"nice little film for a romantic evening with your loved ones at home\\" 8mm shows how a P.I. gets deeper and deeper involved in a case of so called \\"snuff\\" pornography. The whole thing becomes a 'tour de force' for his own conscience, a process which is excellently developed throughout the film. It is not some \\"Death Wish\\" like avenger flick for people with extremely low IQ's. The only thing one could criticize here is the way the whole Porn industry is portrayed in the film. Black latex, leather masks, punks and freaks.Talk about the worst cliches ever here as well as Hollywood puritanism. Besides that, extremely disturbing film you will end up watching again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out okay but gets boring","review":"I thought this movie was well done.

They remind me of the crew from Blue Velvet. Dangerous and twisted. Acting; Great. Sound; Great Music; Could have lived without the middle eastern music. I hate that shilling ... they call music. Other than the middle eastern music I can't complain about this movie... Nicolas Cage is a great actor, but he could have sacked it up a bit... The crying at the end was ... The movie is great, the DVD I have issues with...The Directors Commentary is realy ... The guy is about one breath away from lisping and start ranting about rainbows and and being proud about coming out of the closet... I got about 30 minutes into it and could hack it anymore.

I just wanted to let people know that there really aren't \\"snuff\\" films. Most people wouldn't film the murder of someone, and then sell it. It would be too easy to track down the person who made it. Some deranged people videotape the torture of someone, but rarely does the actual murder rake place on film. I just wanted to let some of your minds at rest. One more thing, the Faces of Death videos are not snuff, and anyways, most of the clips are faked.

Nick Cage's character was a brown nosed wimp who had Hollywood textbook reactions to everyone and everything. I don't even know why the writer had this character carrying a gun considering how scared and involuntary he was of using it, some pepper spray or a big \\"HELP\\" sign would have suited him better.If you want a story about a great PI then I suggested you refrain from buying or renting this movie and pick up a book from Robert B Parker's Spencer series. Read anything with Spencer in it then you'll be able to compare what a naive wimp Cage's character is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable and pretentious....should be in the comedy section","review":"This film is about the fakest snuff ever seen. I haven't laughed this hard at mock depravity since I saw an Insane Clown Posse music video.If the acting was any worse, I'd want them to kill me.However, what it lacks in conviction, emotion, articulation, and sincerity, it does manage to be stylish.But seriously- likening the whole SM scene to crazed murderers is really not fair. It's just more garbage pumped out to sustain a stereotype.This is not disturbing. If you think it is, you haven't seen much. Go rent \\"Ilsa, she wolf of the SS,\\" and then tell me this is disturbing. Rebeca on Sunnybrook Farm scared me more than this did. Barney and friends made me quiver in fear, this only put me to sleep.Something with substance, such as American Beuaty, Titus, or Magnolia should be garnering attention. This pretentious poof should be forgotten.Unless of course you're into mental slumming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Potentially Great film that never gets going","review":"This was the weekend of Potentially Great Movies, and Joel Schumacher's dip into the world of the infamous \\"snuff\\" film tops the list. It could have been an astounding movie, had it tried a little harder to break some barriers down (and had Nicholas Cage's role been better cast-- Cage just doesn't play a guy slowly having a nervous breakdown well) and been a little more subtle in its approach. As it was, it was a little too gratuitous, a little too exaggerated, and a little too detached. Which is too bad, because in the places where it shines, it really does shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average thriller","review":"Upon watching this movie I never knew what a \\"snuff\\" film was now I know.

IGNORE THEM!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to expectations","review":"This is really a let-down. Touted as the best Tristan and Isolde of the present generation, Heppner and Eaglen both fail to deliver the goods. Besides the extremely poor acting of the lead couple, the singing of Heppner is constricted and there's little variety in tone. Eaglen is even more disappointing, for her top notes lack force and her emotional response strictly one-dimensional. Indeed, I think that she's over-parted too.Levine and the Met forces are on good, but in no way exceptional, form. However, without two good principal singers, this opera cannot come to life, as has been the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre performance","review":"I'm not too satisfied with this performance on DVD. The production is very static. (The poor acting doesn't help.) The singing is far below the standard of vintage Wagnerian performance. Levine and his band do better justice to the music. But on the whole, it is an uninspiring performance. Not that worthy to be presevered on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring production, inadequate singing","review":"I really find little to recommend in this dvd. The production is boring and undramatic, while the singing is often strained and unbeautiful. What's most disappointing is that the two lead singers neither look nor sound like the protagonists of Wagner's great music drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull production","review":"This dvd is just so dull! I'm bored by the directionless direction and the poor acting. Heppner is ok in the part of Tristan, but Eaglen is really not up to the task. Levine has been caught off guard (musically) in a few moments.I don't think this is really good enough to be released on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for rival version","review":"This release is not match for the rival dvd version with Meier and West as Eaglen and Heppner aren't as good as the former pair both in terms of singing and acting. In fact, this dvd is big disappointment, as the production is sloppy. I will not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate casting","review":"I don't think that Eaglen and Heppner are good in this opera. Both do not have the requisite volume and stamina for the parts. Their singing is effortful and unidiomatic. There is also little attempt to act, which is important for a dvd production. On the whole, this performance is a bore. I won't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"dear oh dear","review":"one of my fondest wishes has been to see this work on stage. this dvd is the first representation i have seen. the staging is excellent. but it should have been released only as a cd and never as a dvd. the problem is that i find Heppner and Eaglen so repulsive to look at that i can only watch the drama in snippets. how different watching the Boulez Die Walkure with Hofmann, Altmeyer and Jones, all beautiful people who i can never tire of watching and empathizing with, such that each time i watch it i feel i have lived another life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Voigt's Isolde","review":"There is no doubt that Jane Eaglen doesn't have the voice and technique for the role of Isolde. Her performance here is so bland and vocally precarious that I fail to derive much enjoyment from this dvd.I would suggest that those who like Wagner's great opera to wait for Deborah Voigt's Isolde, which is truly sublime. Then, you'll know that Eaglen is simply not \\"the real thing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"Any release of Tristan und Isolde is an event. It's therefore even more disappointing that the performance on this dvd is so unstandard. As Tristan, Heppner is vocally ok, but not much more than that. As an interpreter, his singing lacks imagination. Eaglen is totally miscast as Isolde, her voice constricted and her interpretation generalised. Unfortunately, both can't act, and on dvd good acting is essential for the enjoyment of viewers. The other cast members or adequate, but again no more than that. The production of the opera and the directing is unimpressive and uninspiring. The Met orchestra performs well, but Levine's direction is not exceptionally good. In all, I'm very disappointed with this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in both production and singing","review":"I can in no way rank this dvd production high on my list of good classical music releases. The reasons are simple: The production is dull and the acting rudimentary. The singing is uncharacterful and vocally inadequate. Both Heppner and Eaglen are over-parted in their roles, and Eaglen often makes some ugly sounds. Even Levine seems to be nodding off, as he's caught off guard at a few instances. This is quite a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tristan ohne Isolde","review":"Alas, Jane Eaglen just isn't good enough. We have yearned for so many years - since the retirement of Birgit Nilsson more than 20 years ago - for a really fine Heldensopran. But sorry, Eaglen isn't it, vocally or visually, and I don't mean just the tonnage. She's unattractive. I know, lots of us are not so beautiful, but then we are not presenting ourselves to a paying audience as the Shamrock that launched a thousand ships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpraised recording","review":"I was amazed about the kind of praise heaped on this dvd by some. I've now watched it and am of the view that this is merely a mediocre production. Although there is nothing very wrong with the direction, it is rather boringly done without a single inspiring moment.As regards the singing, Heppner and Eaglen definitely are not well suited to the role. In no way, whether in terms of voice or their understanding of the parts, can they rival the many great interpreters of the past. In fact, Eaglen, in particular, is rather out of sorts in the role of Isolde, and Heppner's performance is lackluster.A disappointing release for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!!","review":"Jane Eaglen proves that she is Birgit Nilsson's sole successor since Nilsson's retirement in 1981. She has about 4/5 of Nilsson's vocal power. Her voice is warmer and more flexible than Nilsson's, and above all, it is a gorgeous dramatic soprano voice - a rarity!! A lot of dramatic soprano sound ugly when they force the tone too much. Not Eaglen!! Same with Heppner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A generally disappointing release","review":"I was simply bored by this DVD. Even though I love Wagner's opera, I can't help feeling that the static production, which didn't work too well at the opera house, does not transcribe well at all through the video. Dramatic verisimilitude is further hampered by the acting (or non-acting) of the 2 principal singers. While Heppner provides some decent singing, Eaglen, greatly overparted in her role, sounds strained and uninvolved. The Met orchestra does a good job (as always) and Levine provides good leadership, even though his interpretation lacks dramatic tension."},{"rating":"1","title":"A declining pair of lovers","review":"I am really very disappointed with this DVD release, and in particular the casting of Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner in the title parts.When the two singers first burst into the scene, they showed great promise. However, after singing a few years in roles that are plainly too heavy for them, both suffered a precipitous vocal decline, which is plainly evident on the soundtrack here. Of the two, Eaglen's parlous vocal condition is a greater liability while Heppner can still singing with a little authority once in a while.With the other roles merely competently cast, and that Levine and the Met orchestra are both not on their top form, this release cannot be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing release","review":"This album is most disappointing. Heppner and Eaglen, touted as the best Tristan and Isolde of their generation, aren't really up to the demands of their parts. Their singing is unimaginative and musically bland. Yes, they hit all the notes (with a bit of strain here and there) but that's not enough for the opera. The Met orchestra gives a good performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"I am greatly disappointed by this DVD. The staging is static to the point of boredom, and the acting is rudimentary. But I am most dissatisfied with the singing, which is less than mediocre. Jane Eaglen, in particular, is a bland and vocally threadbare Isolde, and Heppner seems to be out of sorts here. The Met orchestra isn't on top form either. A missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Meier and Voigt","review":"This dvd is thoroughly disapppointing, as the singing and production are both substandard. I'm particularly disappointed with Jane Eaglen's Isolde, who is no match to Deborah Voigt or Waltraud Meier's assumptions. Those who want to have a decent representation of the opera on recording should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stumped!","review":"I was stumped when I heard this. Is Tristan und Isolde THAT good? Yes!! It is. Even after having heard Nilsson's legendary account, this Tristan has something DIFFERENT to offer. Not only DIFFERENT but also exceptionally BEAUTIFUL. You'll regret not hearing it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb performance","review":"I agree that this is a superb performance. It is captivating from first to last. Imagine - the Met had not staged Tristan for 16 years. Everyone was on their toes and in top form - they wanted to show the world that there still exists talent who can pull off this difficult piece, and they succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Isolde","review":"I'm disappointed with Jane Eaglen in the role of Isolde. She doesn't have the voice for the role. She sounds indifferent and can't act at all. It must be the blandest performance that I've seen. Heppner is better, but not exceptionally good. The others roles are merely adequately filled. Levine and his orchestra are in good form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"This DVD is unsatisfactory in 2 major respects. The first relates to the production, which is a bore. The singers are also under-directed and that fail to bring the characters to life.The second relates to the casting. Jane Eaglen simply does not have the vocal material for Isolde (just compare her ponderous and vocally pallid performance with that of Waltraud Meier and you'll know what I mean.) Heppner is also far below his best.I won't be recommending this dvd to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"I am going to tell it like it is. Here we have some of the most romantic music ever written, and we have a portly Tristan singing to a \\"morbidly obese\\" woman for over 3 hours. Opera is both visual and musical. You opera buffs that cling to the idea you go for just the singing is ridiculous. If I just wanted to hear the singing, I can buy the CD many times over.I want my Opera people to be real and for passion and sparks to fly off the stage into the audience.Check out or buy the Met's Tannhauser, and watch the interaction of Venus and Tannhauser in Act I. You will never look at another opera duet, and not think of them. Great passion and expression in that opera.Sorry, Opera is visual. I want real life looking lovers with passionate singing and expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointing","review":"This dvd is so disappointing that I have little urge to watch it again. The production is dreary and there is so little acting that, for such a long opera, it almost amounts to torture.Unfortunately, the singing provides little compensation, and especially Jane Eaglen, who doesn't have the voice and temperament for the part of Isolde. Heppner is ordinary. Even the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera House and Levine sound less than inspired.A forgettable release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed","review":"There were some things I liked in this production, but some things that drove me to just sell this DVD so I could get a different one. I know the standard \\"Wagnerian soprano\\" image is one of a fairly girthy woman, but good God there's a limit! The Isolde in this production is GARGANTUAN, which in itself is completely distracting considering Isolde is supposed to be this ravishing beauty who captures the heart of Tristan and the King. Between that and her horrible acting, the portrayal of Isolde in this DVD was not engaging at all (all she did for three hours was stand-sing-move-stand-sing with the blankest of expressions.) She is my main issue with the production; if it was another soprano who wasn't so morbidly obese and who was much more expressive physically and artistically, I probably would have ended up keeping the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to this new dvd recording of one of the great operas of all time, but I'm greatly disappointed by what a saw and heard. The production is bland and lifeless, while the singing is just not up to the music's requirements. Even the great Met orchestra sounds below its best.What a wasted opportunity it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Voigt","review":"I've heard the Voigt release under Thielemann. This is far far superior to Voigt. Not because Voigt is not good but because Thielemann holds back too much.Here Levine and Eaglen are an EQUAL match and that makes the results utterly thrilling!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT ORDER THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON OR AMAZON SELLER!","review":"The 1 star isn't a comment on the movie but a warning to anyone considering buying it on this site. Twice I've tried ordering it and from 2 different sellers and both times they sent me the original Fred MacMurray version rather than the Harry Anderson remake.No doubt the original movie is the best, but you order a specific movie, you want that movie.

Not only is it one of the greatest movies ever made, it's also one of the most entertaining and likeable movies ever made.\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is set in the roaring 20's, during the transition time when movies started to talk. The whole movie is just flawless from beginning to end. There just isn't a bad song, there isn't a pointless scene and there isn't a character that shouldn't be there.The movie stars Gene Kelly as the screen star Don Lockwood, Debbie Reynolds as the dancer wanting to make it big, Donald O'Conner as Don's best friend and Jean Hagen as the dopey Lina Lamont.Exciting, delightful and entertaining from beginning to end, \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is one the greatest movies ever made that will never lose it's popularity or it's status.This is what a great movie is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singin' in the Rain","review":"One of the greatest,if not the greatest musical ever made. Usually voted on most of the top ten movies ever made. I have the DVD and I watch it over and over again. The story line is fun as it pokes fun of the silent movies ,the songs are wonderful,and the dance numbers are fantastic. This movie should be on every musical lovers video shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Non-Musical Lovers","review":"This musical is not for everyone, but i know plenty of people who as a general rule don't like musicals, but loved this one. Even without the music, the plot itself is hilarious and masterfully carried out through the acting. The songs are great, and the dancing superb. Some parts seem a little random and odd, but it only serves to contribute more to the overall theme and mood of the peice. I forget the name of Gene Kelly's sidekick in this film, but he is one of the best reasons to watch the movie (besides Gene Kelly and Deborah Reynolds).The ending is the icing on the cake, and is a hilarious ending to a great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing at clouds so dark up above.","review":"The perfect movie musical, an affectionate look at the transition in American popular culture from vaudeville to silent film to talkies. The direction is very stylized and exact - whoever finds this film \\"hammy\\" should realized that it is a parody of film and acting styles from the 1920's. Those styles were hammy and this picture catches them perfectly. The choreography is breathtaking and danced sublimely. Kelly and O'Connor are airborne, Reynolds is sweet, but the real wonder here is the much-underrated Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont. From her squeaky Betty Boop voice to her Bette Midler walk (years before Bette did it), she nails this role. She is on the money, friends. Perhaps her star didn't rise because Judy Holliday was doing the same kind of thing in Hollywood at the time, but this performance is stellar. And look for an impossibly young Rita Moreno as Zelda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singin' in the Rain","review":"An obvious choice, but hard to resist what is likely the best film musical of all time. The period music is delightful, and the dancing routines sensational. Thanks to a golden Comden & Green script, this is also among the funniest musicals ever made, especially with Hagens side-splitting performance as Lina. Must-viewing for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"when the dancing added to the storyline---gene did this","review":"Can't add anything to what has already been said re: this being one of the best musicals ever made, except that this was one of the finest examples of what Mr Kelly had hoped to do with his dancing: use it to help move the story along. In the past, musicals had used songs and dances as mere entertaining sidelines. Mr Kelly sought to create dances which would add to your understanding of the character and help tell the story better. He did this here, as well as in Summer Stock, Thousands Cheer, On the Town and a little known, but very enjoyable Living in a Big Way. He was not only a fabulous dancer and an excellent actor, he was one very intelligent man. I feel lucky to have known him. Even at age 82, he was still handsome, well-built, huggable and with a great mind and a fabulous Irish smile. Thank you Gene!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu- Ray wouldn't play","review":"It was probably a fluke, but the blu-ray wouldn't play so we returned it!

Unfortunately, this 2-disc \\"improvement\\" is a [disappointment]. The digitally remastered sound is harsh and grungy. Worst of all, there's a horrendous piece of censorship in Gene and Cyd's classic Broadway Melody dance number, a cut so obvious that it verges on sheer, criminal stupidity. I'm returning this 2-disc edition and searching for an uncut version to replace my ancient home-made VHS tape from the early 80's off a PBS station, where this dance scene is complete (and really gorgeous). What a shame. [updated Sep 2009: OK, so I'll paste another star or two for vivid image quality, and I kept the 2-disc set because of the great extras and some priceless antique clips you won't see elsewhere. As far as I know the only uncut scene of that dance number was on the ancient VHS tape I made years and years ago.

An intriguing and ambitious effort on the part of Donen and Kelly in coming up with this crazy yet delightful musical. Who cannot miss but the classic scenes involving him 'singing in the rain', 'gotta' dance', dancing with the scarved woman, and dancing with Cyd Charisse. All scenes accompany an already legendary and strong film even with inconsistencies and a slightly rushed and muddy third act. Above all, it is one of those American classics you cannot compromise. Even with it being hailed as one of Hollywood's best works, don't take its message seriously. The film is best seen for fun and for film aficionados alike.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing In The Rain","review":"We were very pleased with our purchase.

It has a number of truly outstanding numbers, Donald O'Connor's 'Make em Laugh'is one. But the piece-de-resistance is of course Gene Kelly's most incredible 'Singing in the Rain' number.This particular piece when he dances with his umbrella under the rain is filled with carefree joy, with simple sheer utter happiness. From time to time it simply ' breaks out inside me' when I am walking, whether in the rain or not. It is a case of Art enhancing Life of something you have seen on the screen not simply dying the minute you cease to look at it but resounding through the rest of your life.It just 'makes us happy again.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Singin' in the Rain was not filmed in a \\"widescreen\\" ratio","review":"\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" was filmed in the Academy ratio of 1.37 to 1 (which was the standard for film until 1954).

Kelly truly makes you believe that dancing isn't for sissies. I am enthralled by his grace, athleticism and sheer love of dancing everytime I see this film.The song and dance routines are superb. There's not a bad one in the bunch. I don't know how they did it. It is hard to choose a favorite with such numbers as \\"Make Em Laugh\\", \\"Good Morning\\", \\"Gotta Dance\\", \\"Moses Supposes\\", etc., but I must admit that the title song makes me want to go out just \\"singin' and dancin' in the rain\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie has it all!

The cast is tight and the music thoroughly enjoyable. It is especially fresh given today's films with dark sarcasm and anti-heros. What truely boggles the mind is the full-screen release! Was this movie originally released in a 4:3 format? I think probably not. And to see the effort that was put into restoring the soundtrack yet none was spent, seemingly, on trying to find a suitable original in the theatrical format. In this day of HDTV monitors and widescreen signals, this is unforgivable.

Sure, he, erm, sings. And anyone who has seen Gene in motion can see him influence even the martial artist/actors of today. He just makes dancing COOL. And I defy anyone to see the title sequence and not just through out a joyous laugh, easily one of the most famous and greatest dance scenes in films ever.Donald O'Connor is a very funny man.

We were on the verge of trying Ritalin in an effort to suppress our son's impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Before going the medication route, a friend of mine recommended homoeopathic remedies. We decided to order the Bright Spark along with the Focus Formula. The first three weeks were usual with no changes. During the fourth and fifth week, my son's symptoms began to cease. Gradually, the phone calls and conduct reports minimized. I wouldn't call this product a miracle (he's not perfect), but it has definitely made a difference in our child's progress at school, without sacrificing his immense fun loving personality.FYI- We only give one dosage per day. Two Bright Spark pills before breakfast and 6 drops of focus formula after breakfast. This system seems to work for us, not sure what affect it may have on other children.Good Luck!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUTH","review":"Episodes 37 to 72 of the series press on in a refined approach. Fist of the North Star (\\"Hokuto no Ken\\") has heart and soul yet simultaneously also carries the elements of love and loss. In addition to those qualities the series has great character designs and is accompanied by fantastic and memorable music. The narrative is broadened by many characters and is carried out admirably with its philosophical and spiritual components. These episodes 37 to 72 really elevate the series to new heights that justly place it to the status of being called a classic.Highly Recommended for those who enjoy animation, martial arts, and good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw all 152 episodes in English for sale","review":"One of the best series I've seen.

A. Salvatore's more original works, and although I thought this book was entertaining, every element of it was plagarized from Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, with the Lonely Mountain and the Mines of Moria combined to make Mithril Hall. Even the scence in which Bruenor descends into the abyss with Shimmergloom, and his subsequent escape, were just take-offs from Gandalf's battle with the Balrog. With an imagination that virtually created the Underdark, I don't see why Salvatore had such a hard time coming up with something more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just never makes an impact","review":"I am quite a fan of Merchant/Ivory films, and I love Kazuo Ishiguro's novels. The cast is also made of wonderful actors. So why is this movie just OK? They recreate 1930s Shanghai with a sort of \\"Cabaret\\" theme (you can't hide yourself in a nightclub while WWII is clearly beginning outside), which sounds promising, but the whole film feels flat and emotionless. The script has much too much exposition. The Countess part is severely underwritten, which is unfortunate as she is supposed to be the center of the movie. There is no chemistry between the two leads at all. The more interesting relationship is between Jackson and his mysterious Japanese friend. It is also very annoying that Jackson's blindness is overly used as a metaphor. This 2 star rating is in context--it is a 2 star Merchant/Ivory film, but of course with all the awful movies out there this at least a 3 star film among all films."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright film nothing special","review":"this film takes place in the 30's and is suppose to be dreamlike on so many levels. the performances in this film are good but predictable and nothing ever jumps off. i expected the film to find a centeral to tie all the elements together as one,but it was long on style and short on substance. the directing and overall pacing of the film is nice,but the storyline and the actual purpose of the film gets burried by the gloss of the film. the acting is solid but that is the best thing i can say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours!","review":"It took two hours for Ralph Fiennes whose blindness isn't even noticeable to ask Natasha Richardson who is nothing like a Russian to \\"date\\" him. OMG. This movie is ridiculous. I can't believe this was a Merchant and Ivory movie because the cinematography was so clumsy. Most of the shots were small screen quality but less interesting and creative than Jerry Bruckheimer produced small screen fare. I'm sure people who are interested in wartime era Shanghai/expat culture will give this movie a scan but for the rest of us, OMG. Ralph Fiennes rarely has chemistry with anyone. I have no idea why he found Natasha Richardson compelling. The costumes were not flattering.

You'd think a blind guy would go falling down a lot, banging into furniture and walking out into traffic.

Surprisingly, Vanessa Redgrave and Lyn Redgrave don't steal the show; that's reserved for Natasha Richardson, who looks stunning in gown after gown and whose smile shows a vulnerability consistent with the storyline. If the pace had been more in time with the march of the Japanese, there would have been a more suspenseful build of emotions. Still, I thought the movie was enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious film","review":"The White Countess is, to me, a film along the lines of European dramas and probably isn't quite to most Americans taste. To follow the film, you have to concentrate. Its not a romance (although one develops), not quite drama, and of course not an action flick. More of a film to watch alone when the rest of the family is gone for the weekend. The setting is old Shanghai of the 1930s, where a lot of Russian bluebloods fled following the 1917 to 1926(?) civil war. Pre-WW2 Shanghai is not well remembered or understood by Americans today.The acting is TERRIFIC; Ralph Fiennes does a great job of keeping a neutral accent for his American character, although his British inflection bleeds in a bit sometimes. All the cast were very professional in their acting.Good flick, along the lines of a classic serious novel. But not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth watching","review":"As usual Ralph Fiennes is magnificent!!The story is slow moving with an under current of suspense that keeps you very interested.

If you saw the movie, don't try to compare it to the book - movies are one form of media, and books are another.

She uses four different narrators and weaves between past and present. The style worked and held my interest.The many scenes she describes are very realistic.

His kids don't like Julia, Julia and Susan don't like each other, but through predictability, a personal tragedy brings them all together (as you can imagine). So apart from the predictabilitly, this is an excellent film that will make you laugh, cry and bawl.

So if u like comedies, dramas,and a tearjerkes I would go the the video store right away and rent this movie because it has has many mixed feelings and because it is the best you will ever see!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful joyous acomplishment","review":"Stepmom has everything, drama,comedy,and even some suspense. THis is a remarkable mircolous movie. A very touching romantic dramtized movie . With splended acting, and very good story plots, I have to say to the director Chris Columbus this is his finiest achievment since Mrs. Doubtfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but not enough to make me cry","review":"I probably would have cried if Susan Sarandon burst out balling in the end instead of being a strong person and dealing with her fate. Both Sarandon and Roberts had great chemistry in this movie. I tended to pity Roberts but that may be due to us being closer in age thus able to relate better to her. That quilt made me think what a great gift that would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very touching movie","review":"i saw this movie with my friend and her family. i was so touched by what i've seen but i was very ashamed to cry. but then the tears just keep rolling down my cheeks and i can't help it. i have been a follower of julia roberts and susan sarandon for as far as i can remember. i guess seeing them on screen together made a big difference. very seldom do i see films with two of my favorite actresses in it at the same time. i really love this movie. if i could, i'd watch it all over again on the big screen. for me, that is the only way to really enjoy the movie---it makes you feel like you are part of the movie or something. i don't know, that's just how i feel. whenever i watch a movie i really, really like...i imagine that i am a part of it but i'm only a spectator. i guess my imagination takes me farther than i expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wholesale and manipulative","review":"It's pretty bad when the most likeable character in your movie is a life-threatening disease. The two leads are so caught up in winning the affection of the children, they don't stop to wonder what's best for them. And while I normally like Ed Harris, his character basically boiled down to a likeable slimeball. And please, oh please, let there be a moratorium on Lip-Synching to Oldies as a method of plot expansion. If you're looking for quality, don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be joking - only Hollywood could sell this","review":"Predictible, sob-story melodrama with a girlfriend agenda to boot! I'm surprised that Sarandon went anywhere near this, it's such a boring Hollywood take on the mom vs. younger girlfriend scenerio. Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round! If you like soap opera drama-rama or you're a younger stepmom/girlfriend who wants justification and wants to demean the original mom/wife (I'm not an original mom or first wife, BTW, just an annoyed viewer), you'll think this is a great film. Otherwise, this is one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD doesn't work!","review":"I give a zero rating - the DVD I purchased said it can't be used in this country!?!?! What a waste of money and time waiting for it!!!! Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good talent wasted!!!!","review":"Three very talented actors were wasted in the sappy movie. Susan Sarandon is dying of cancer, but you hate her character for her attitude. Harris is weak, Roberts is cowardly. And the children are brats."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of love and jealousy, conflict and fustration","review":"A future stepmother's struggle to gain the respect and love of her fiance's children and the approval of his ex-wife. The children are loveable brats and their mother, Jackie (Susan Sarandon), is conniving, jealous and GREAT! Isabel (Julia Roberts) is always being faulted by Jackie, and caught in the middle is Ed Harris as dear, dull Dad. A must-see! I loved it because it shows what happens in this day and age to so many women who truly love their husbands and stepchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dull at the start, but the end is a classic tearjerker.","review":"The first 45 minutes of STEPMOM were draining and dull. It was like a Jerry Springer catfight without all the sex and only some of the foul language. What blossoms in the next 80 minutes is a classic tearjerker that spreads great acting from all the actors and actresses, especially from Liam Aiken as Ben, the cute, love-to-love character. His acting charisma is almost perfect, the best of the excellent crop of acting. It's hard to know who to root for in the first half, it's boring and flat. But then everyone gets along and the movie becomes enormously refreshing and fantastic. I recommend this film to everyone. Loved it so much!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed something... maybe?","review":"This movie is a UK version and does not play here in the us.

I DID NOT CARE FOR THE PISSNG CONTEST BETWEEN THE EX-WIFE AND THE NEW LOVE INTEREST. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT ADULTS WOULD ALLOW CHILDREN TO ACT THE WAY THESE DID AND LET IT CONTINUE. NOT ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR UNDER ANY CONDITIONS. (TAKE NOTE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN COLORADO IN THE PAST WEEK.) KIDS CAN BE ALLOWED TO GO TOO FAR. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS OKAY BUT NOTHING GREAT. I THINK ALL OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE MOVIE WERE SHOWN IN THE TRAILER FOR THE MOVIE. I SAW THE MOVIE IN THE THEATER AND THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE WAS WHEN SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE SAID (NOT KNOWING HOW LOUD HE WAS SAYING IT) \\"I WISH SHE WOULD HURRY UP AND DIE\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is an Old Tape","review":"The video tape was as advertized; however, the lighting was really quiet dark. Whether it was because of the age of the print (it was apparently in its original container) or this was a bad print I don't know; the poor quality took a lot of the enjoyment out of showing this to my grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eloquent Memoir on the Meaning of Identity","review":"It seems that several reviewers turn to this book as way to inform themselves about Burma before a trip. And there is valuable cultural information in the book that makes it good for this purpose. However, the book truly shines as a memoir that explores the meaning of identity and how culture, geography, and personality shape an individual. The writer's perspective is unique as he brings his heritage as a native of Burma, a person of Chinese decent, and an American to the mix in an attempt to explore how these identities meld together in sometimes immutable ways. A great read for anyone interested in Sociology, or simply looking to see Buddha and Shakespeare brought together at last."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is the best!","review":"I started buying FA in Germany and I got my friends hooked on it.

Sometimes called \\"hollywood b---- slaps on youtube, there are numerous great slap scenes that just make you happy. There is also a great LB scene here with a typewriter and ribbon. The best physical comic ever (tho Ellen DeGeneres sure had the talent, back when she did that sort of thing). A fun movie that youngsters can see, tho it's filled with old-fashioned double-entendres, but those seem to fly over their heads. Sexist, of course, but nothing as bad as MadMen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's 'Kidnapped'","review":"Closely follows Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel.

But this CD EP is mainly worth buying for the other three tracks, performed by \\"Byrdhouse,\\" a.k.a. Crowded House with Roger McGuinn). They are \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" \\"Eight Miles High,\\" and \\"So You Want to Be a Rock'n'Roll Star,\\" recorded at the Pantages Theater in L.A. on April 7, 1989.

A little old lady owns Herbie, and she is trying to keep it away from the somewhat ruthless villian, Alonzo Hawk. This movie has action, especially when Hawk's men try to chase Herbie. It has romance, like when Wilibe falls in love with Nicole. Best of all, there is laughter throughout the movie. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because twards the end the movie started getting weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic comedy","review":"This movie is one of my very few comedy favorites. So many of the ones out today use material, that just flat isn't funny. This is one of those films that puts a smile on your face without all the garbage they use in 'comedies'(if you want to call them that) today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first....","review":"I enjoyed this movie much better than the origional Love Bug. I found the actors/characters more likable. I enjoyed Helen Hays character and all her little oddities. The movie is a nice family movie focusing on slapstick humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herbie Rides Again is no good.............","review":"This sequel to The Love Bug, lacks a good plot, and an interesting cast. Set five years after the original, this film finds Herbie now sold to an annoying old lady living in a fire house. The fire house is the only building left in the way of Alonzo Hawk's new sky scraper being built. Robert Stevenson enters the plot as Hawk's nephew and goes against his uncle to help save the fire house. This film has nothing to do with the original and loses the formula. I would pass on this movie. However, Dean Jones and Don Knots returned in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo to give the series back it's good name........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take My Advice PLEASE (See for ALL the Herbie Sequels)","review":"Disney is NOT adding any features whatsoever for the Herbie, the Love Bug sequels. As a dedicated fan of the star car, I have discovered that so far ONLY Herbie Rides Again will be in Widescreen. The only other thing that could possibly be of any good quality within these discs would be a remastering of the picture and sound. Unless you've given up using your VCR or you are a collector, don't waste your time purchasing the Herbie sequels. Only the original movie, The Love Bug is worthy of it's \\"Special Edition\\" title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for little kids","review":"My two year old loves Herbie, so we rented this to give us all a break. Now we are paying for it! The villian in this movie rants, raves, screams, and bosses everyone around conitinuously. Perhaps it is coincidence, but our mild-mannered son has become a mini-version of this tryant. After two weeks, he is finally returning to normal. I would not recommend showing this movie to suggestible children. It is difficult to find live-action, non-violent movies with good role-model characters. Stick with \\"The Love Bug.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good newsletter with lots of information","review":"I've been a subscriber off & on for years.

The first, main article is usually the most interesting.If you have strong opinions and aren't willing to read things that make you think to defend them, then this is not the newsletter for you.

There were many moments I recognized from my own experience in the roller coaster-like highs and lows Ms. Kephart experienced, the sterile and absolute reports from the medical community, and, worst of all, the rejection of her child. The only additional experience I've had that she didn't report is the blame that others would like to lay at the feet of the parents of such a child. Like Jeremy, my son has made great progress and is a high school honor student at our local public high school. While he doesn't spend time with friends, he's gained enough social confidence to enjoy social functions.I'm glad that this book is drawing an audience beyond those with an interest in autism-like disorders, however, if you finish the book and don't question the way we as a society define \\"normal,\\" then you've missed the point of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"lyrical and poignant","review":"I'd very much like to echo the enthusiasm of the other reviewers of this book. Kephart's prose is gorgeous, and her insights are heart-rending and soulful. What truly impressed me about this book was its honesty. Kephart deeply loves her son, but she also struggles with the ramifications of that love, as all conscious, hopeful, thoughtful parents do. This is a beautiful book, extraordinary reading for the parents and caregivers of all our blessed children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing heart","review":"Beth Kephart writes with so much love and grace.

She guides us through the stages of grieving and awareness that she and her husband experience as they begin to recognize that their son, Jeremy, lives in a world that is not like that of his peers.Rather than looking for a \\"cure\\" for Jeremy's exceptional behaviors, Kephart searches for those situations and strategies that will maximize his gifts while shaping his weaknesses to help him function within society's norms. While searching for the best instructional setting for her son, Beth Kephart instructs us in the ways that love and persistence work together to develop teaching strategies that work.This book is valuable for anyone who works with children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders. It is also a beautiful story of the possibilities that reveal themselves when we refuse to bow to adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slant of Sun","review":"Anyone that has a child with a developmental dissability or dely should read this book. True to life, and full of touching moments, A Slant of Sun has definetily made us feel that we are not alone. Superbly written, Kephart is an excellent story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for young people t0 learn","review":"This book offers very specific advice on how to build shelters in snow of from snow. I found it very useful and accurate, but do not depend on this book alone for snow survival. Another good book for young people is the Opkik:Cold Weather Camping book. I think the 2 together make a great pair.

This CD is packed with melodies that'll stick in your head long after you hit the power button. The production is crisp and his guitar playing is masterful.

What else can you ask for? Sean Connery? Actually researched Irish legends? Incredibly beautiful effects and cinematography, even for today's standards? Perfect movie. The extras are also outstanding. You get to watch the adventure of the Disney crew as they learn about the real Irish legends and incorporate them lovingly and respectfully into this movie. Funny, sad, frightening, exciting. In addition, Albert Sharpe played the part of the true Irish storyteller and keeper of the fairie legends. There are very few left in the modern world. If you are interested in checking out one of the only true Irish fairyfolk storytellers alive and in print, I highly recommendMeeting the Other CrowdEddie Lenihan.This movie awakened a fascination with Irish folklore at an early age, and it's still as strong as ever as I approach 40.

Sean Connery stars as Michael McBride,a new arrival in a small Irish town coming to take the O'Gill's property. Of course,he falls for Darby's daughter. Don't expect Connery to bring out his 007 charms; Darby O'Gill's daughter is hardly a bikini-clad Bond girl.\\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\" has a surprisingly complicated (i.e. boring) plot. McBride is the target of evil witchcraft,while Darby is off making deals with Brian,King of the Little People. There's magical mischief galore,along with banshees&pranks.; In the end, true love triumphs. After all,it's Disney.For a children's movie,\\"Darby O'Gill and the Little People\\" has a convoluted plot. Sean Connery sings,and there's an attempt to be true to Irish culture. Still, it's a dull movie that deserves to be pinched for not wearing green on St. Patrick's Day. The Little People are short on thrills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Amazed as an Adult","review":"I saw Darby O'Gill when I was a small child. I loved it, but the siren and Death's Carriage scared the pants off me. So much I didn't watch it until I was much more grown up, when I caught it on TV. The siren and Death still creep me out, but the story is amazing!Sean Connery is, and forever will be, my god. The effects for the siren and Death are very basic compared to 21st century digital animation (they're very similar to the dancing ghosts in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland), it gives them a more realistic quality. While the 3D graphics of today could make a siren without effort, it's the see-through, looks projected graphics that make it look like something that could be real and haunting.I absolutely love it, and recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best live action films Disney has made!!!","review":"Set in early 20th century Ireland, this tale involves the good-hearted caretaker Darby O'Gill's adventures with the fairyfolk of Ireland.

The animation sequences with the \\"Little People\\" are simply inspired as most of Disney's family animation genius are. darby might be a little intense for kids under 8 or so. There are sequences with an Irish banshee - the harbinger of imminent death - but Darby saves the day.

One essential element of this movie is the beautiful effects for the time this film came out. The Leprecahns and banshee look believable & realistic.

This movie should be shown on every St. Patricks Day as a classic and placed in a catagory with The Wizard of Oz.I just can't say enough about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous fantasy film!","review":"This is a quintessential disney film. good special effects and the story is timeless. connery is at his best, and youngest! the story is great for anyone to watch! I love the behind the scenes also! fantastic to find out how disney did all these great effects when it was in its infancy for special effects! you'd never know! it's so facinating! you just want to watch, instead of analyzing it! Great for any age, it's a great fantasy film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Connorey","review":"Even though sometimes you can't understand what they are saying because of the acsent it's still a good movie. I did recommend this to someone and bought two when I ordered this...one for me and the other for my cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Review","review":"I have grown up watching disney movies, and I love them. Darby O'Gill is a classic irish tale about the king of the leprachuns and the man who manages to catch him. I remember as a kid, my mom pulling this movie out every St. Patrick's day. It is a great movie for kids and adults alike to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney at his scariest.","review":"This remains one of the all time best feature films from the Disney studio. An unreliable but likeable old Irishman gets in trouble with the leprechauns, causing plenty of amusing (and even scary) complications. Albert Sharpe is excellent in the title role, as is Sean Connery, in one of his earliest roles, as the handsome hero. Special effects are excellent. The hilite of the film is the banshee, which plenty of kids in 1959 (including this one) found plenty scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"back to my childhood","review":"First seen when Sean Conery and I were both a lot younger.

If you want a dumb, campy story that's more laughable than scary, then you might enjoy this. I wouldn't bother watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic horror/revenge with a twist","review":"This movie tricked me because it was about a cop who just went insane.the way its presented in the movie though is much better.the maniac cop seeking revenge for what happened to him in jail was brillient.the violence,blood,gore are all top notch as is the pacing of the story.i wish there was more flash back scenes about what happend to him but thats ok.bruce campbell was great in this as he is in all of his movies.this movie has something for everyone...horror,slasher,zombie and bruce campbell can all rejoice bacause this movie is the only one to combine all those great elements.deffinatly worth buying and having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create Art With No Training And No Talent","review":"I have always wished I had artistic talent but I think my left brain has been atrophied since birth. My mother always said all my taste was in my mouth and she was right... I'm an excellent cook. Still, I wanted to create something pleasing to the eye, and this book has helped me to do just that. The hardest part about this project was looking for that elusive hammer to hang my beautiful art work on the wall. You know those crocheted toilet paper covers you were planing to make as Christmas presents for friends and family? Forget that! Nature prints are going to be the hot ticket item this year. Even the book alone would make a nice present for the artistically challenged. This book will take you step by easy step through the printing process. There are plenty of helpful tips and suggestions, and it is also beautifully illustrated. I think this would make a good project for children too. Exercise that left brain while they're still young"},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty","review":"It's difficult to write what I feel about this book. I read as much of it as I could stomach and then threw it into the trash in the hope no one would ever find it. This man, the author, is either terminally misled or has an ego the size of the universe. He knows how women feel? Excuse me? When was he a woman? I pity the poor woman who reads this and accepts it hook, line, and sinker. He is so off base as to be laughable, if I didn't worry that some women would actually take him seriously.Truly ecstatic lovemaking is a matter of giving and being given to in total love. It has nothing whatsoever to do with \\"succumbing\\", \\"surrendering\\", \\"giving up\\" -- on either part.I am especially deeply disappointed in Marianne Williamson for promoting this delusional writing.There was no way to get this posted but to choose at least one star for this rating. If I'd had a choice, I would have chosen the negative (-) sign for \\"Don't bother, it's just another male ego trip.\\" Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profound journey of self-absorption and avoidance.","review":"This story details a profound journey of self-absorption and avoidance of responsibility and the associated burdens in the face of tragedy. Although there is a positive resolution, the transition is not so detailed. It is as though it is simple exhaustion that transforms the character into an honorable person. This story is a close-up of the pathetic, like following a drunkard through the details of a hangover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Lacking","review":"Surprisingly unconvincing for a major Japanese novelists. Lacks the artistic imagery of Mishima or sensitivity of Soseki (or of Japanese writers in general). Maybe Oe's hailed for hopeful, redemptive themes, but that does not quite do it for me. I find this and Silent Cry unremarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple thoughts over uninteresting personal problems","review":"Oe got the Nobel Prize because of his attempts to be filosofical about human nature. This is the way I see it. This book is build over a very simple plot and puts up very simple psykology, which is not seen in real life. Why is it so hard to take responsability for Bird? And why does he long for Africa? And why should we care? Stop whining mr.Oe, try to be a man instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark, deep, and superbly narrated existential story","review":"Kenzaburo Oe tells the story of Bird (name of the main character)living in modern Japan. The story is how Bird deals with the reality, of being the father of a brain damaged child. Oe takes us into a dark journey of how Bird deals with this new reality.Bird has to face the problem of \\"How do I Act?\\" in a modern society lacking moral or guiding principles. Many incidents in Bird's life had no meaning - drinking the entire summer or having sex. Faced with the new reality, Bird tries to escape from it. He doesn't want the child to become a permanent reality of his life. He faces the choice of either killing the newborn or risking an operation (which might not restore the brain damage). Whatever choice Bird makes, he has to deal with the responsibility of making the choice. Instead of running away from the problem - Bird finally accepts his responsibility of being father of brain-damaged child.A dark, deep, and superbly told existential story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barking","review":"The book arrived in great shape and ealier than I expected. Was very pleased with the order and would definately order from them again!

Delightful illustrations. Wonderful introduction of farm animals to city children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Neil Diamond","review":"I had this album as a teenager growing up in the '70's. At that time it was one of my favorites and time has not diminished that thought. The songs have such a special meaning to me and others of my generation, and also other generations. These are the true Neil Diamond vocals that we grew to appreciate, and the words that will stay in our hearts forever. A truly remarkable CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Neil's best early efforts...","review":"These ten tracks are thoughtful and soulful and mostly mellow. All are well done, and the price asked is fair for a change, considering this is somewhat short given today's CD capabilities. You could put two early Diamond LP's on a CD and add five bucks and still have a bargain. If you like Neil, and don't own this one, grab it quick. If you want an introduction to the young Neil's serious side, this one's your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Some great songs, but I wanted the original Stones album and got a mixture of other albums. Be careful when you order cd's from Amazon....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil's on a bummer","review":"Diamond was at low point, literally, when he put this album together. A songwriter who can't sing shouldn't do cover songs. Plus, Neil was already into grunting instead of singing by this time in his career, and too far gone into strings and syrupy orchestrations. The only entertainment on this album is \\"Crunchy Granola Suite\\", which is Neil's hilarious attempt at rock and roll. And this was 1971."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't miss buy! You'll listen to this over and over!","review":"From the anguish reflection of \\"The Last Thing on My Mind\\" to the haunting melody of \\"Suzanne\\" this album is the by far the best of Neil. If you're looking for melodious music that captures the times, this is a MUST for your rock collection. I've played it so much that I have practically worn out the record! The new purchase will guarantee great listening for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A-Super ballads","review":"One of my first recordings ever. Back in the early seventies bought myfirst music casettes some three years into my first job after high school.I remember buying first my portable Sony cassettedeck/radioplayer with thethe most beautiful sound ever. Neil Diamond and Johny Cash were the firsttryouts. Amazing \\"\\" Man in Black\\"and \\"Stones\\"\\" were absolutely the bestsongs to play on my Sony Cassettedeck. Each and every song I rememberedand liked very much. From Neil Diamond I got to know Leonard Cohen'ssongs. Now that almost all music recordings are on disc I had to upgradeto this latest medium.

I bought the VHS version (which I absolutely wore out from more viewings than I can count) immediately after watching it when it originally aired on TV some years ago. A treasured glimpse into the personal lives of two very special people who, for a time at least, held the world in the palms of their hands due to the immense popularity of their TV show, I Love Lucy (Which was just one of 15 shows they came to produce in the 1950's.) You'll laugh, and cry, almost simultaneously, as you watch thisLucy and Desi: A Home Movie is a wonderful treat, and, as I say in the title of this review, is A MUST HAVE for fans everywhere. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raunchy but great!","review":"It has been awhile since Trina's last album, and she sure does not disappoint. Everyone knows that she is extremely raunchy, but that is why we all love her and her music. Once again, the beats are on point, and she has stepped up her rhyming skills. Mostly all the songs on this CD are club joints, including my personal favorites \\"Shake\\" with Lil Scrappy and \\"Da Club\\" with Mannie Fresh. Her current single, \\"Here We Go\\" featuring Kelly Rowland is certainly a twist from what other people may expect from Trina...never before has she done a slower, mid-tempo type song. Even thought this album is not on the same level as Lil Kim's latest release, she proves that she deserves a spot in the hip-hop industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her name says it all-da baddest chick","review":"My girl trina is doing it big. I love it when she drops any album. She is very talented. Her new Cd is a banger in all aspects. My favorite is \\"dont trip\\" trina and Wayne got together and smoked the studio. This song is the bomb. Also \\"Here we go\\" is another banger. Then her jam \\"shake\\" bangs sommore. To me and my crew trina's albums are like manuals. They teach you the ropes of the dating scene. Im known to quote her racy lyrics because I find her outlook on relationships is to die for. Please cop this CD and support my girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baddest Chick is back","review":"The only baddest chick is back and she's taking everyone by surprise with the new single with Kelly Rowland called Here We Go. Glamorest Life has to be Trina's hottest album that she's ever done. The only thing that I found wrong is that it has 13 songs and the fans just want more and more. Here is my review of the songs:Sum Mo - 10/10Don't Trip - 10/10Shake - 10/10Here We Go - 10/10Sexy Gurl - 8/10Club - 9/10It's Your B-Day - 10/10I Gotta - 8/10Throw It Back - 10/1050/50 Love - 10/10So Fresh - 9/10Reach Out - 10/10Lil Mama - 6/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M THE BADDEST B*TCH","review":"I LOVE TRINA'S CD.

After I Heard \\"Here We Go Again\\" Whatever it's called I was like how annoying can one person voice be? Kelly made the song half decent but, what else could she do since the whole song was retareded! I haven't bought the album but, I've listened to the sample. I couldn't see my self having this in my CD collection. It'd probaly bring the value down. All she talks about is how cocky her perverted commercial a$$ is. Wow! She degrades African American Females to another level. Lil Kim rhymes are way better than this trick!This CD is a cd where you let your friend buy it and you listen to it and then feel sorry for them for buying such a sucky album. I wouldn't buy it bootlegged or waste the trouble of having the MP3 file on my comptuer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Trina Does it NOT!!!","review":"When I look at Trina I think of a grown single mother with about four or five kids with three baby daddies. I mean, come on, she is aging and looks hard. All that make up on the cover softens her up and Photoshop is the best thing since the Atkins Diet, but blah, blah, blah,....shut up???Really, come on. She needs to get a ghostwriter b/c her lyrics are wack, weak, and just plain wrong. truthfully she is too dayum old to be rapping. Perhaps that's where I should have started and stopped. Plain and simple. It's a rap for the oldest baddest bytch in the game.Kelly sounds beautiful and i am disappointed her post-destiny child career is off to a poor start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her friends say I'm a tummy sucker don't go below the navel gotta love lil wayne!","review":"Trina skills are really trash I tried to give her a chance but she don't have nothing interesting to talk about. The only reason I gave her two star's is because lil wayne is on the best track or shall I say the only track that can stand by itself and I believe that's only because of weezy baby!Trina go back to strippin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CUBIC ZIRCONIA PRINCESS IS BACK!","review":"Before Ghia aka thug mister came in the game Trina was qualified as the worst female rapper ever but Khia has that title on lock and isnt giving it up easily. This album is just as bad as her other two albums. Her lyrics are cheesy and the beats are secondhand garbage. The only songs with decent production are sum mo, dont trip and shake. But Trina's preschooler style of rhyming ruins them easily. For the life of me I could never understand how a female rapper can be so raunchy and be so corny at the same time! She is exactly what Britney Spears would be if she was black. I feel sorry for anybody that looks up to this voodoo doll as a role model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here We Go With Another Album From Trina","review":"Trina need to close her legs and open a dictionary because last time I checked Glamorest was not a word. I'm not sure if she's really that ignorant but the way she talks and acts is not very persuasive. Personally I think this whole image thing is an act and she should definitely be consider on the next award show for a grammy nomination. Trina tries way too hard to be taken seriously as a rapper and a person. She seems to have a one track mind because she never ever talk about anything. After what about 5-6 years this is the highest step Trina has taken? I give her credit for actually releasing something that is not talking about screwing licking sucking riding and prostituting for money. She has matured a notch but I cant say the samething about the album as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy","review":"I don't too much care for any of her albums. There are too many young females out there that are getting the wrong message about life. It's not all about being glamorous, having the nicest cars, clothes, jewelry and sex. It makes me sick to see young girls looking up to her and her music, and then they think it's okay to go out and sleep with men for money, not to mention all of the diseases that are being spread around and teenage pregnancy. There is nothing glamorous about that. I don't see how she's being labeled as classy, how about trashy. It's never too late for positive messages to be spread. People need to think more of the youth out there that thinks you need to sleep around and have a body like the girls on videos to be beautiful.That's all you see on tv and hear on the radio, that's why there are so many depressed people out there because they think that's the way life is supposed to be but it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot hot hot","review":"Trina is a first class female rapper, she may not have the fame kim does, but she can def rap and come out with some blazing lyrics.keeps it gangster but classy. the only fault with this album is there are too many collabos on it, but u can see she has stepped her game and lyrics up over the last few years.forget about foxy, remy and jacki o....the only 2 worthy of recognition are lil kim and trina"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghetto Superstar and the lyrics and tight!!","review":"This cd is the bomb. Everybody be hating on Trina but that girl represents the truth and making money to the fullest. Don't hate the game. The Glamorest Life is tight.

I am loving it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her&Her Music done got to Skinny","review":"Trina was never much of a Rapper,but she kept you interested in some of the things she would say.She was basically a down South Lil Kim.Trina was aight for a song or two nothing more or less.but this Album is boring.Her flow is as skinny as She is.I dig the Thicker Trina.thick Trina gave Me something even when I had to keep some of Her songs on Mute.this cut with Lil Wayne is Boring.a bit too many guests to cover her musical shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww","review":"I didnt like any of the songs on this CD. Im glad it was a gift and I didnt pay for it. Trina was really slipping with this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trina Album Hands Down!","review":"This album is better than I expected. I'm a long time fan of Trina's and when I saw she had 13 songs, I figured I would be somewhat disapointing. So I bought it anyway to support Trina. I was wrong! This is her best work yet. There's no filler tracks, because each track has something new to offer. The replay value of this is incredible. When I heard the first song, and she said \\"I'm Back B!tches\\" and just tore it up.. I knew I was in store for Trina's best work. Please don't turn your shoulder at Trina, this truly is an album to remember. I reccommend this to all who love Trina..and even to those who hate her. The True Queen of the South is back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"Look, this is my second time posting a review for this lame cd. Okay this song is no \\"butt-shaking\\" music she's talking about getting cheated on in her first single! So, tell me how you could possibly dance to that? None of the beats nor songs could be considered \\"solid or classic\\" I mean The source nor XXL gave this CD any thing worth over 2 mics hell! I think one of them didn't even waste their time rating it! Little 13 year old girls shouldn't let their ears be affected to woman saying \\"ohh boy drive me crazy i want to have your baby//lick me up n down n ill suck you like a blow pop\\" Okay...\\"non-sense\\" well, if you bought this album make sure to go to the nearest cd-store and get your money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Trina grabbed us with her nasty songs when we were young club-hoppers, but it's obvious that we grew up and she didn't. Any self-respecting woman simply cannot listen to this album with any satisfaction. If she has ever wondered why Eve knocks her out in record sales - it's because she talks about things with more depth than shacking your a** and giving it up. #4 \\"Here We Go\\" was a great song, no wonder it's a hot single. If more of her songs followed that beat she would have better ratings. Garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glamorest Garbage!","review":"Trina really disappointed me on this one! What was she thinking whne she dropped this? I bought this cd on the release date because I was feeling the two singles \\"Here we Go\\" and \\"Don't trip\\" those were the best songs on the cd to me. Her rap is getting very tired and quite frankly what made her big, is going to be her downfall. She is still on the scene because she is pretty and has a nice body, but as far as delivering the magic, she don't. Please save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glamorest Life? Is this really a word?","review":"Someone should have checked the dictionary for the correct usage of the word glamour. GLAMOUR AND TRINA IN THE SAME SENTENCE? Even though Trina's attempt to dress up her image may work with the core fan base, she fails to dress up her lyrics and subject matter on this record.Nothing alluring here folks. Just another airbrushed, female rapper.I would like to know why Kelly Rowland would even agree to sing on this project? Next time, say no!Overall, it doesn't deserve a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"ha ha","review":"people are actually saying this rap trash is good? It's not music, it's just noise made on a computer with bad spelling. Where did the days go of real instruments and actual music. I would love to show Trina where she belongs. On the street, better yet in the sewers, exactly where my copy of this album is going! Some rap is good because it's done well. If you're going to get a rapper get missy elliott, she's at least a laugh and doesn't take herself seriously.

Otherwise it is barely useful as a creation engine for dull dungeons. The monster cards are only the basicmost ones from the Monstrous Manual, without the imprtant stats at that, the Magic Items cards have more gold than magical items, and those that are there are unusable in AD&D. And, of course, the dungeon design cards are only marginally useful for creating one color dungeons where all rooms are all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I bought this perfume from nordstrom a couple years ago and loved it!!!

The transfer is first class in both video and audio fidelity. This looks and sounds damn good for a 45 year old movie. The extras are also well worth viewing. These include brief interviews with Sinatra himself, composer Elmer Bernstein,and a host of others. Trailers to some other FS movies such as From Here to Eternity and The Manchurian Candidate round out this impressive dvd.This will probably be the definitive version of this film classic for the forseeable future. Well worth its budget price of $8.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb sinatra!","review":"I saw a few of the director Preminger's movies and wasn't impressed except this gem, which captivated me from start to finish. Mr. Sinatra gave a riveting performace equally matched by Parker and Novak and the rest of the crew.

Hooked on candy, so I know how you feel.\\" I'm paraphrasing slightly, but this is \\"The Peddler\\" character's attempt to translate the experience of the heroin addict. Huh? It seems as if Preminger was so eager to get his controversial examination of this then \\"hot\\" subject matter on film that the process and the content took on a supporting role. Where does this movie get its reputation? Where did Sinatra (and I'm otherwise a BIG fan) get a Best Actor nomination? Where do I go to wipe my memory of this embarassingly puerile pap?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Sinatra","review":"Frank Sinatra gives one of his most powerful screen performances in this Otto Preminger movie about drug addiction. Some of the scenes with Sinatra shooting up or going through withdrawal are harrowing still today; they must've been devastating to audiences back in the mid-50s. Sinatra plays ex-addict Frankie Machine, married to needy Eleanor Parker; Darren McGavin is the dope peddler who gets Sinatra hooked again and derails his hopes of becoming a jazz drummer. Kim Novak tries to foster Sinatra's drumming dreams, in contrast to Parker who just wants to keep him under her thumb. The script is based on Nelson Algren's book of the same name, but the movie is quite different, mainly in character focus: in the book Machine is much more self-driven and Novak's character is less supportive. Sinatra locked in a room going through withdrawal hell is one powerful performance. The music, by Elmer Bernstein, is jazzy and apt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of which DVD you order","review":"The Man with the Golden Arm (2008) from: NorAm International Partners, Inc.-Sold by netdealz and Fulfilled by Amazon.arrived quickly, No problem with the service, but this is a bad print with poor sound, Marketed by CatCom, no mention that this is packaged as a double feature with Suddenly and cartoons and commercials. I should have paid more attention and bought the 50th Anniversary Edition. Bad Menu. Cheesy opening narration, The CatCom tiger does't exactly roar like the MGM lion, he kind of sounds like he is having some gas issues. Has grainy 1940's Popeye and Superman cartoons, a rather strange 1980's PSA by Clint Eastwood about the dangers of crack, a Buster Keaton beer commercial, and a 1950's safe drivin PSA. Not the disc to buy if you want a good copy of an Otto Preminger classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"OTTO PREMINGER, OPUS 21","review":"**** 1955. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM was based on Nelson Algren'sThe Man with the Golden Arm: 50th anniversary critical editionand produced and directed by Otto Preminger. Three Academy awards nominations. A former heroin addict comes back home to become a drummer in a jazz orchestra but, after a few disenchantments, he starts to take heroin again. The choice of a contentious theme, a hero with weaknesses, a woman who reminds us of the dangerous heroin ofAngel Faceare unmistakably trademarks of Otto Preminger. Saul Bass's titles and Elmer Bernstein's musical score will simply increase your pleasure. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"Good book pretty well written..though I thought more could have done by way of research. which it was written back in the early 90s..it is a good book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unadvertised bonus features and great transfers","review":"Fox has not publicized the bonus features on this long awaited collections so, for the benefit of those who are curious, here's what is included in this collection:1. featurettes on Peter Lorre, Director Norman Foster, Producer Sol Wurtzal, and Lorre's personal stuntman Harvey Parry. The same crew that did the excellent featurettes on the Chan collection did these as well.2. Trailers for two of the films3. a clip of the Ritz Brothers doing a skit while impersonating Lorre, Karloff, and Laughton (attached to the end of one of the featurettes)4.

Both times I noticed it before leaving the surface and was able to save the FL-20. The first time Olympus covered it although not without some amount of hassle. I have not even bothered to contact them the second time. The problem is that the fitting and cable attach to the outside (left side) of the housing where it can come in contact with any number of things to include the boat as the crew hands the camera to the diver in the water. If they had mounted it on the right it would be somewhat protected. The second time it failed I was being extremely careful because of my first experience.

Judging by the title (\\"The Dinner Game in the English edition, but \\"Diner de cons\\" in French, meaning something along the lines of \\"Dinner of the Asses\\") it sounded like something that would turn out to be mildly funny and realatively plotless. I'm still not sure if I was right or not, either way. The general idea is that a group of friends gets together weekly to make fun of an idiot they invite. The main character throws out his back and his wife runs away, all immediately before his chosen idiot shows up. Pignon, the idiot, makes sometimes funny mistakes, but still doesn't manage to find out that he is the idiot. I won't tell you the end, though it's not some huge thing..

I was operating then under the delusional belief that French films must by nature be better than American films. I don't know, maybe that's true, but if so, this one was a fluke.This movie is juvenile and idiotic. It is predictible, trite, simplistic, and (worst of all) unfunny. It is more worthy of American television than French film. I was startled by how bad it was.

At first, it was a bit of a distraction totry to watch a movie and have to read the English, but,after a few good French movies, I am not even aware now,that I am watching, listening, and reading.

Especially one with an animal in it. For anyone who has ever bonded with an animal (especially a dog), \\"Old Yeller\\" strikes a nerve or two. The was also the first time I ever heard the phrase \\"It's only a movie!\\" after I saw \\"Old Yeller\\" because I cried so hard. This is probably one of the finest family films ever made by the Walt Disney people. It's a simple tale of a frontier boy who bonds with a stray dog (that more than proves it's loyalty) and the boy's final realization that he has to grow up. Dorothy McGuire is the steadfast mother and Tommy Kirk is the boy who must make a gut-wrenching decision that will start him on the road to maturity. I hated this movie for years but as an adult I more than see the beauty of it now and highly recommend it all round. But keep those kleenex handy because if you're like me, you'll need 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Back Yeller","review":"This is one of those Disney classic movies that stands the test of time. Brilliant direction, casting, and sets. The sets were done by the same man that did the sets for \\"Shane\\". Along with this wonderful story of a pioneer family and its incredible dog. You get a second disc filled with extra features. You get a Pluto cartoon on the first disc that shows before the feature. The movie will appeal the most to dog lovers but has something for the whole family. Old Yeller along with being a wonderful companion risks his life three times to save family members. The fight with the bear, wild pigs, and wolf are intense and not recommmended for young children to see. Furthermore when Old Yeller gets hydrophobia what has to be done will upset the little ones. The scenery is beautiful and the set shots are excellent. The movie is in letterbox format and the restoration is perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a good family movie for all but the very young."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't as sad as everybody thinks!","review":"Yes, most of the reason this movie is popular is because of the overrated dramatic death scene at the end, when I first saw it, it wasn't sad at all to me, so buy the DVD or VHS because it's a good movie not because of Old Yeller's demise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed me","review":"First, you must know I love animals, I love movies and I love movies in which I can cry my heart out.

Like many classics it is anything but. Why does everyone cry at this movie? I didn't cry at this movie; I didn't anything close to tears. This is not because I hate dogs, I think that dogs are not people and that the dog was better off after he was shot. Also this movie may have been much better if the acting had be decent. The acting of the boy made me laugh instead of cry when the dog died. And if his little brother had spoken one more time I would have screamed. This same little boy is in many Disney films and every time he is unbarable.

Give the guy a break, he's a Ramone and he writes like one. I thought it was fun after reading something like \\"Please Kill Me\\" by Legs McNeil.Dee Dee's childish style is sort of endearing and it reads like a punk rock William Burroughs when you get to the drug induced hallucinations. Basically, DeeDee is trapped in the Chelsea Hotel and keeps having heroin trips involving Sid Vicious and Johnny Thunders who want him to join their band (overdose? ok so it is obvious in parts :) His various encounters with the other characters are amusing. Its hard to believe the Chelsea was such a dump (it was) when they try to be so posh now."},{"rating":"2","title":"great single, other tracks are a slight disappointment","review":"THe high single was great, but i was really expecting more from the extra tracks like \\"the twilight garden\\" but it is still an awesome cd and worth far more then the money you would pay for it"},{"rating":"2","title":"This grew on me","review":"I've been a fan of Steve Young's, like for-EVER, honest-to-God, I first saw him at the \\"Young Folk\\" Sunday afternoon show at the Newport Folk Festival in 1969.

As a young man, he was brilliant, funny and self-destructive, and terribly handsome. Now, as a not-as-young man, he is brilliant, funny, mega-creative and terribly HANDSOME.I offer 4 stars for this review only because I've heard Steve with a-little-stronger vocal presence on past recordings, but hey, ANY musical offering from Steve Young is a gift.These songs are Celtic in flavor and pure Young in execution. Time has not weakened that beautiful voice, or his great guitar playing, if anything, his performance has more depth now than ever.We are just so fortunate to have Steve still recording. He remains an example of how good Americana music can be, but not in the same way as anybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for the honky-tonkin'-Waylon-Jennings-sound-alike Steve Young, you won't find him on this disk","review":"Even though I'm not wild about every song on this cd, Young's \\"blues/country/folk\\" style and his rich, sad voice make this album a winner. The absolute show stopper is the \\"Worker's Song/Handful of Earth.\\" Guthrie, Seeger or Springsteen couldn't match the emotion that Young puts into this painful anthem for the working man. A close second is the sorrowful \\"Sometimes I Dream\\" (which, even though it wasn't written by Mickey Newbury, should have been ... it's just THAT kind of song, and Young sings it as though his heart were broken)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for smoothing those edges in-between 'touch ups'","review":"I recently started having my hair weaved in July 2006, after a long hiatus from chemicals, dyes, etc. I actually had went back to a 'texturizer' after four years with just a pressing comb and a prayer.

Whenever I am in between touch ups and my edges are a little on the unruly side, my stylist David, applies this stick! Voila - no more unruly edges. The best part of it - no residue, no stickiness, no hardening (like gel). You can comb through it w/softness and ease w/out compromise.

We live in Palm Desert, which can be very windy and there is a lot of airborne sand. The regular bag is too porous to catch the sand, and the fine bag clogs almost immediately. After talking to the factory, my conclusion is that this unit is not for dusty areas. Also, the unit won't climb curved steps (mine are) and it took two cleaning cycles to cover a 16x32 pool.

He adores about 90% of the film (although the dinosaur part and the Dance of the Hours are his favorites) and does not seem particularly scared or bothered by \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" which he will watch by himself. He also loved to listen to the audiotape in the car. At this point if any of the Fantasia or Fantasia 2000 music comes on the classical radio station we listen to he can recognize it and tell you which film and what part it's from.

Unfortunately, in excising an admittedly racist-appearing segment within the Beethoven \\"Pastorale\\", *this* version uses a glaringly-apparent close zoom into the artwork - which is downright ugly and pretty much ruins the viewing experience.

Don't let the kiddie sequences fool you -- they're also a vital part of the experience -- this is an Adult film (and I'm not talking about those topless centauresses) that works on many different levels of perception.

As one who grew up watching Disney flicks at the theater every Saturday, this one is my all-time least favorite. The problem with \\"Fantasia\\" is that it's a film that adults love because they think they would have adored it as children. In fact, it's hard to keep kids occupied with this film, with its endless interruptions to have Mickey chat up the conductor. Boring for adults and unbearable for youth with short attention spans. I remember being bored to death watching it at six, and so were the other kids, because we had more fun having popcorn fights and running up and down the aisles than we did watching the movie. Try parking your eight year old in front of it and clock how long it takes him to get bored and walk away, and you'll see the real disappointment in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken packaging, ordered through amazon but from another supplier","review":"This is a great movie for kids though i'm interrested in seeing the newer edition, you can tell that this was dated.

There were no other screens to go to."},{"rating":"1","title":"i own the original on vhs","review":"Since my vcr is still working... And I want my grandchildren to experience the movie the way I did, I will not be purchasing a censored version. I think the censorship diminishes the historic significance of the film.

My son opened the packaging before I could stop him, and so I put it in the DVD player and hoped against all odds it would be in English. I was sorely disappointed again.

The marriage of top-notch animation and classical music was made in heaven. The music that was chosen is still popular even today - and there are many people who cannot listen to musical numbers from the movie without visualizing the scenes that went along with the music. Scenes include Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, the Nutcracker Suite, Sorceror's Apprentice, the wonderful \\"Rite of Spring\\", Beethoven's \\"Pastoral Symphony\\" with it's Greek mythology theme, the Dance of the Hours, and the very imaginative \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\".

Great service and just what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun well-written fantasy book","review":"The short stories in this little book are just fun little humanized versions of science as Calvino imagines it from the perspective of the formulas and laws that govern the universe. Some are fun and quirky, even engaging, while others are a little boring and too goofy, but overall Calvino's writing style just plain flows. There's something about the way he constructs a sentence that just makes it roll through this reader's mind. Sometimes I got so caught up in the \\"flow\\" of a passage that I had to reread it for meaning and content. In sum, it's just good, quirky fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"kid lit","review":"I really liked this book, not because it only took 2 days to read such a short collection of pages, but because it was like reading a child's book about the creation of the universe. Calvino is so very creative, I can't help but wonder if he was stoned when he thought of this idea...Non, non, ce n'est pas possible. Read it if you yourself are creative and looking for something fun to read. If you are overly serious and melancholic, then do not bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different","review":"These are not stories in the typical sense. Plot, character development, motivation, etc. aren't the main points here. Calvino takes certain astronomical ideas or theories and makes a story out of them. For instance, the big bang becomes a story about \\"people\\" all crammed together into one tiny point, who then explode outward into the universe, sometimes running into one another and discussing the old times. Some stories, such as \\"A Sign in Space,\\" are so intellectual and devoid of physical action, that they are disappointing. Others, like \\"The Distance to the Moon,\\" take a concept that is ludicruous and develop a good story out of it. These are not your regular stories--more like science fiction fairy tales. They are, I would guess, unlike anything you've read before and worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Ordered two Studio Series 52-inch five blade fans with four medium-base 60-watt light sockets. Was very disappointed to find that shipped items came with tiny light sockets that take only candelabra-type light bulbs, available with no more than 40 watts each. So instead of 240 watts of light the item affords a maximum of 160 watts. One of the ceiling fans was already installed at considerable expense before I discovered this fault, so I'm keeping it. I'm returning the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and cool","review":"I believe this product is being discontinued, so the price was wonderful for a full-size, very nice fan.

What a powerful and compelling masterpiece of POINTLESS VIOLENCE. Sure, it's got a plot; sure, it's got a theme; sure, it illustrates without sugar-coating the violence and mental effects of World War II; but aside from that, it's like porn, except with killing instead of sex. I didn't think I could be any further desensitized to violence after Blade II and an extensive series of concentration-camp documentaries, but I guess I was wrong! The trouble with this book is that the shock and horror of rape, murder, torture, animal abuse, etc. ad infinitum paralyzes your thinking processes, masking the theme. This book is a failure of advertising: nice themes, but it can't connect to the reader at ALL. Read Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness instead. This book bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud - fantasy passed off as history","review":"This book is mostly lies, and I don't mean the subtle kind common in such works - I mean flat out fabrications and inventions. It isn't worth a real review. For G-d's sake, if you must read it, check it out from a library or buy it used.If you don't believe me, check around, that's what Google is for.This fraud, Kosinsky, defames all those who suffered in WWII with his shameless gold-digging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only descriptions.","review":"An account of the bestial experiences of a child during World War II.This novel is exhibitionist and cold. It only rarely transcends the descriptions of brutalities, sexual depravations and filth. Art is not the reproduction but the arousing of feelings.This is an anti-war and an anti-mankind novel, but the author was more interested in the depiction of obscenities. The books of the Marquis de Sade are masterpieces compared with this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncomfortably real","review":"I'm surprised by any negative reviews of this WWII, quasi-Holocaust tale of a young Jewish boy wandering on his own during the war.The story is indeed rather \\"creepy\\". It's not a \\"feel good\\" read. It's also well told and beautifully written. The sexual, brutal, and homicidal aspects were, I thought, handled rather delicately yet without losing the intended hard-punch impact. Certainly some tough topics, but nothing gratuitous here.It's very thinly veiled that this is (tragically) an autobiographical novel. An important work in this genre', and again, very well written. Probably not for the extremely timid, but if you can handle frank truth, don't let the hand-wringers scare you away from reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant","review":"This book is definitely not for the faint of heart in its portrayal of the brutality of a world at war. The disturbing images paint a dark portrait of humanity as an unnamed boy drifts from village to village in Eastern Europe. From backwater superstitions to the persecution of anyone different, this boy witnesses some of the most horrible atrocities, which transform him body and soul. It is an incredible portrayal of life in the remote villages of Eastern Europe while the war wages in the distance. While I wouldn't recommend it to many people due to its graphicness, I would insist that it be treated as a classic piece of literature and a poignant study of (in)humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A putrid attempt at macabre storytelling","review":"I read this book many, many years ago. I have never stopped thinking that it is one of the most gratuitous pieces of fiction I have ever read. It is disturbing. What is also disturbing is that an individual would actually sit down and write it. It is incoherent in its effort to paint a reasonable story. It is a collection of perverted thinking.It was not to long after reading “The Painted Bird�?that I read “Last Exit to Brooklyn�?by Hubert Selby. There were many similar horrific and inhumane actions in this book but I could at least attempt to understand the basis for the behavior. In Kosinki’s book there was no connection between behavior and reasoning, it is just a putrid attempt at macabre storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another deceived reader","review":"I guess I'm another deceived reader who thought The Painted Bird was autobiographical. It is true that if despicable events really, truly occurred, we are willing to deal with them as readers because we feel great sympathy for the victim and we know he or she is just recording graphically experienced atrocities. However, if we learn the same stuff is fiction we recoil, betrayed and angry at the author for dreaming up such totally sick and perverse scenarios.I did think the author writes powerfully and tells his story dispassionately as would a boy paralyzed and shell-shocked by the evil that men do. But knowing this is not only fiction but racist propaganda against the Poles, suddenly Kosinski loses his appeal and becomes just another author seeking fame by whatever means necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"not literature","review":"There is no excuse for this book, which is basically a litany of every imaginary atrocity that man could possibly inflict on another man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collection of pornographic short clips","review":"This is a sad excuse for something to be taken seriously. If someone wanted to be jolted by man's insensitivity to man, \\"Night\\" by Weisel is of much more literary value. This book has none, zero, nada, as value goes. I'm sure that many injustices have occurred, but the author should have stuck to fact. There is no conclusion to his line of writing either, just an ending of his scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly without redeeming social value","review":"Do not read this book unless you do not like yourself and want to do yourself harm."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"aside from the gorish nature of the novel, which i do believe is a needed impact of the book to describe the nature of the people he has to deal with, i found this novel incredibly well written and very emotionally tainted. an outstanding piece of work. i recommend this every chance i get."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shame","review":"It's extremely unethical and irresponsible for Amazon to be passing this book off even as \\"semi-autobiographical\\" in order to sell it.I myself was taken in by this story when I read it, believing, as Kosinski wanted everyone to do, that it was based on his own experiences.As it turns out, the only authentic elements in this book are names of people who in fact cooperated in protecting his entire family. The plot and incidents described are possibly borrowed, but most likely invented out of whole cloth. See \\"Steps\\" for a taste of Kosinski's interests and imagination, or see Sloan's biography -- which also corrects the record regarding Kosinski's war-time experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe in book burning, but ...","review":"... if I did, this book might top my list. I made it past the story of the man spooning out another man's eyes and stepping on them, but when I got to the woman having a bottle of poop shoved up her and being kicked until it broke and then kicked some more -- that's when I gave up. This is the most disgustingly graphic book I've ever seen, and it's not as if it had a plot to make up for it. The whole point of the book (to where I read) seemed to be to shock the reader with wretched depictions. No thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot-less violence","review":"Maybe it would help if I weren't a sophmore reading this for history class. I have never enjoyed manditory reading. Then again, maybe not. This book had no plot. Almot every chapter had the young boy in a different situation, the author seems to have wanted to show as many horrible situations as possible. The violence, even if it was true to the time period, was incredibly graphic and drawn out. I get nauseous whenever my thoughts accidently flip to the eyeball scene. Besides, every young boy I know would have fainted dead away if he saw what the boy saw. I don't know, nor do I much care, if Kosinski made up every single word (it's a novel: historical FICTION). But for anyone who dislikes being made to feel sick and enjoys a plot should stay far away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Questionable Historical Value","review":"Although Kosinski did not write this work as history, American readers are liable to accept its claims as gospel truth. It is unfortunate that Kosinski invents events which never happened. For instance, his claim that Jews hiding in swampy areas were attacked by local Poles is flatly contradicted by eyewitnesses, and there are other non-factualities in this text as well. Considering especially the fact that Kosinski owes his very life to Poles who sheltered him from the Germans, it is thus particularly sad that he would write such ugly untruths about the Polish people. The Holocaust was cruel enough without the embellishments which Kosinski depicts in his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will never forget it.","review":"Read it many, many years ago, but lost the book. So happy when I found it on Amazon. Will probably read i a third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare to be Different, but not for the weak stomach","review":"What makes this book even more creepy is the foward which indicates that some of the graphic fiction in the book is based on the author's real life. Kosinski experienced some of these savage torments as a boy following WWII. The book is broad enough to not just capture the ugliness of war and hatred, but the true meaning of being different, being discriminated against and being alienated in the worst way because of the color of your skin (hair, and eyes). The happy moments experienced in the book are basic and essential pieces of everyday life that we all take for granted. Historically, based on Jerzy Kosinsky's own life, the events of his own childhood couldn't be overcome--dying with his own demons banging on the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perverted","review":"I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it. I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well. Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author. I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much. This book is going on my \\"Do Not Lend\\" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Frightening Reality","review":"This could be the most revealing book ever written about Occupied Poland. There are no visions of death camps, or trains of people being herded to there death. It is quite simply the true story of a young Jewish boy who must survive the paranoia and hatred that overtakes normally decent people in times of stress. If it is not the most important book written in the twentieth century, it is surely one of them. Each one of us is a painted bird."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK SICK SICK","review":"I can only say that this man must have been very sick in his mind to write this and suicide did us all a favour. He has made the Poles out to be as sick as himself and its all lies. How dare this book be taken seriously? If it is fiction then his detailed descriptions are something in his mind which are really perverse and dangerous. The Poles suffered as much as anyone and for them to be portrayed in this way is insulting and I am ashamed to see the well known and up til now respected so called intellectuals' praise of this work. i wanted to burn the book but its from the library. A health warning should be put on the front. If those sort of things did go on I would assume they were rarities rather than the norm as he makes out to be. The more scary thing for me would be that I was the only one who detested this book but I am not alone. Arthur Millar and his ilk have gone down in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again! Wish I could RETURN IT!","review":"I had to read this for a gothic lit class. Words cannot describe the horror, the perversion, the disgusting nature of this book. Perhaps I am a little delicate, or perhaps I know GOOD literature when I read it. This is too graphic to even work with the plot. All you can remember is the sequence of horrid images. NOT RECOMMENDED...unless you are an insatiable sick minded creep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nightmarish modern classic.","review":"Jerzy Kosinski is graphically realistic in his hellish depiction of the violence and dehumanization of one boy's experiences during World War II. The story is captivating, shocking, and told with the violent realism that is Kosinski's trademark. The language of the novel is beautiful and well-thought-out; it adds so much to the atmosphere of the book. Although \\"The Painted Bird\\" is not a book for the conservative or the squeamish, no author has captured the horrors of war in a more poignant and startling manner. \\"The Painted Bird\\" will make you question, ponder, and value every moment of your existence.

To me Nastassja looked much better with age and she really mastered the sex scenes when needed. Josh Holloway (playing the psycho depressed hunk) was fine too.

The book claims, for Chinese people, \\"homosexuality\\" is a trans. verb. I mean it, the book really makes such a claim. A trans. verb is like the verbs such as eat (I eat veggie), sing (I sing songs) etc. The book states that \\"homosexuality\\" is such a verb for Chinese people, and the homosexuals in China should be rendered \\"homosexualityer.\\" It is so funny, but I do not think the author means to ooze any sense of humor. He simply has very bad command of Chinese and English.

This here book is a case in point. A predictable thriller without any thrills, featuring an insecure heroine who suddenly, partway through the book, becomes a tough broad who can turn water into wine. It had me thinking maybe Sheldon was writing another book about MPD. Alas, no...I will give Mr. Sheldon this-- the drunken, washed-up ho act of Neusa Munez, and the \\"whip me, whip me harder!\\" penitent Marin Groza did elicit a chuckle or two. But that's all I'll give him.

He has a \\"dream\\" for which he will do whatever it takes to acheive, even if it means continuing to face a past he is running from. For those Scott Baio fans-it's not his best acting, but the \\"rugged\\" look looks good on him. I enjoyed the film simply because of being a fan of his. Others would view the film as being generic.

The rims of some of the plates are flawed; it looks like the glass coating melted along one side on some of them and the pattern doesn't follow over the edge on others.

I ordered 2 sets so I could have service for 8. It's very lightweight but durable as is typical of Corelle. My only point of displeasure was that the lines on the plates are not solid - they're like a graphic print where you can see small pixels. I read this in other reviews and decided to purchase anyway.

In particular, the cups and bowls are good, practical sizes. My one complaint is that the black stripes are a different finish and rougher texture from the rest of the plate. Occasionally when a fork scrapes across one, we all get spine-tingles! If you are sensitive to this, you probably want to choose a different style. But I do highly recommend Corelle in general.

When I opened the box, I was disheartened to see that the printed design is very poor in quality.

Corelle has one of those everyday dishes that don't scratch, can be put in dishwasher, used roughly... I can't get enough of Corelle.So when someone got married, this was the perfect choice for them. Of course, the square with black lines gives it that extra oomph to go from everyday to partyware. The design was smooth, sleek, and classy.

You can fit a bunch of stuff in it. On the downside there is only one big zippered pocket and a laptop zippered pocket, but not really anything else.

It would have been nice if they had made the DVD 2-sided & included the original wide-screen presentation. They did such a superior job with the earlier movie, \\"Pollyanna\\". It is a 2-disc set presented in 1:75. I don't understand why Disney so carefully presents one classic & treats another with complete disdain. The \\"Absent-Minded Professor\\" was put out on DVD in full-screen but within six months Disney released the wide-screen version too. I can only hope that they will do that with \\"That Darn Cat\\", \\"In Search of the Castaways\\", & \\"The Moon-Spinners\\".

It's very family friendly, with enough humor and supsense for both the kids and the adults, to keep everyone interested and entertained. Haley Mills, as usual, does a wonderful job, as do Dorothy Provine and Dean Jones, but for my money, the best characterization is the disgruntled boy-friend played by Roddy McDowall. His frustration at losing his prize duck to DC is priceless. I buy movies with the intent of watching them again and again. This one fits the bill very nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched BEYOND belief","review":"I'm sad to report that this disc was scratched so badly that it could not play for longer than 10 minutes before the dvd player would read an error message. I imagine it was simply over-looked and was unintentional to re-sell a movie in this condition, but it's still a frustration to have actually paid money for a disc that truly looked to have had a scrappy fight with sandpaper!I gave one star because apparently it's required in order to submit a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and lame.","review":"All the five star ratings this awful film has gotten just confirms that, well, the dumber the movie is, the more Americans will like it. A few enjoyable moments, this movie is at least an hour longer than it should be, padded as it is by insipid and stupid slapstick. The first twenty minutes are kind of bearable, and the final ten as well. In between it is dull as dishwater, idiotic, and lame brained. Don't waste your money. I bought it as a gift for a child, but it is just too awful to unload on even a 12 year old. I won't insult her intelligence by giving it to her and will throw it in the trash tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Darn Cat - with Haley Mills","review":"This movie is a classic.

Since decorum prevents me from stating my true opinion, I will simply say \\"Don't give Disney a single dime for the worthless tripe they are distrubuting on DVD\\". For them to give a \\"bootleg studio\\" treatment to this fine, 5 star film is purely corporate greed that borders on sadistic delight on the part of the Disney marketing team.

This movie is one of her best and we've watched it over and over. We loaned it out and lost it; so we're buying it AGAIN! It's a great family movie that is fun and has no sex, profanity, or other objectionable material.

Sam could have used our modern meanings in place of the antiquated words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed","review":"The author portrays himself as a victim, apparently never stopping to reflect, or at least discuss in the book, how his actions and inaction have affected others, including his children, ex-wives, family, and friends. Much too much time spent on self-absorbed thoughts and ultimately, Mr. Campbell never seems to come out of the dark. Simply nothing new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical and Hypocritical","review":"The author admits he used to be a bully. Rich, powerful corporate executive American bully. And claims that he has reformed through a series of new age miracles and a relocation to Europe. His \\"peaceful\\" coming to terms with his past typically takes the form of: I am at one with myself and my universe and from my heart I entirely forgive my ex-wife for being the heartless, cold parasite she will always be, and, by the way, she really deserves zero forgiveness. The reader sees past the charade of bile-flavored forgiveness/confession and realizes what the author suprisingly does not; that he is still a huge bully who cannot help bullying those he is trying to be at peace with. The personal reformation in this book is self-manufactured and self-aggrandizing. Mock-forgiveness is used as a weapon. The worst sort of spirituality text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clamps all 4 too short to use","review":"I wanted to mention just that, mine came with 4 clamps all too short to use.

Now pregnant with my second child and am looking to buy a different yoga DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much stretching, too much new age.","review":"I have health conditions which make it hard to exercise fully during my pregnancy. I thought a prenatal yoga would be a good way to do some safe stretching and be a little less active than full out aerobic exercise. It had all this chanting and talk of birthing your baby in a rain forest like women hundreds of years ago, and then it seemed to mix yoga with lots of repetitions so it was more like a fast paced yoga aerobic workout. This would be great for those who like new age aerobic exercise yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL","review":"I bought this DVD to stay fit during my pregnancy. I'm a pretty open-minded person, but I still found that the instructor seemed kind of \\"out there\\". I tried it a couple of times on different days, and I never got through the beginning of the video. I never even watched the second DVD on post-natal because the first was so awful. I definitely would recommend you buy something else. Don't waste your time or $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought for my wife, we both thought this woman was from space","review":"I was looking for a good exercise video for my wife on DVD, now that our tape player finally died. I picked this up, and we decided to do the first set together with our daughter, and mom is 4 months along with the new one. that was a huge mistake, this woman who does this i swear is an alien. She was so bizarre, and her viewpoint and philosophies on pregnancy was clearly new age california. No thanks, this was not a good workout video, unless you are into new age religion or cults."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!","review":"I love this video. I am expecting my 4th baby and have used this video for the last 3 pregnancies. I started this yoga during my 2nd pregnancy to avoid the back pain I had during my first. Not only did the exercises keep me pain free, but a few weeks into it I found myself getting tone and finding muscles showing all down my back! The instructor is kind of out there, but very calming at the same time. I love how there is plenty of stretching too. She talks you through the exercises explaining how they will help in your pregnancy and during childbirth and so you hardly realize you are \\"exercising\\", until a few weeks later you notice how tone you are getting. FYI - I always skip the meditation and the freestyle dancing - I'm not that alternative! I just enjoy the relaxing exercises, so if you are the same, just skip the parts that are too \\"out there\\" for you and you will find a great prenatal yoga practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Workout but too much Spiritual Mumbo-Jumbo!!","review":"If you are a very spiritual or new age yoga person you might love this. I am just a modern mommy looking for a yoga workout. The instructors endless banter about being in touch with my primal nature was annoying. Telling me to visualize squatting a in a forest and birthing surrounded by only birds and animals is a terrifying image not a relaxing one. The chanting was bizzare and the tribal dancing downright scary. I was hoping for just some great yoga poses with instruction but I got a video drowning in over the top touchy-feely spiritual junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!!","review":"When I first watched the DVD, I giggled because of the chanting. But after getting over the awkwardness of chanting out loud, I came to really depend on the chanting which was a great way to relax and meditate.The yoga strectches are great for beginners as well. This DVD made all of my back pain go away and helped rejuvinate myself for the day. The yoga exercises are great in strecthing your pelvis to get you ready for the BIG day to hopefully help you have an easier labor and birth. This by far is the best DVD out there that not only helps you stretch, but help you relax and rejuvinate after a long stressful day at work. A stressful mom makes a stressful baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse yoga video i've ever tried","review":"No way for me. I didn't like the chanting at all. I got a creepy feeling.

While Blue had a certain novelty appeal,the rest of the CD is the exact same.It is not music with any heart,eg,Move Your Body,Move Your Body,Come on now everybody.The beat is\`nt there either,its all the same.These guys should come up with some new material,as its all starting to sound too similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"christanity","review":"I rated this cd \\"2 stars\\" only because of it's song \\"blue\\" and it's imense bass. I also gave this cd \\"2 stars\\" because of it blunt statements about christanity and how it puts down our only reason for living! \\"Too much of heaven, can only bring you down\\", is a quote from the song. When I heard this I was frankly, disgusted! I can only hope and pray there reason for this blantant remark... I really thougth that this band was really awesome till I heard the whole cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey waz-up","review":"this cd is strange..........i kinda like it..very different....yo listen up heres a story about a little guy that lives in a blue world, and all day and all night and everybody around hims just blue like him, inside and outside blue his house"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really grows on you...","review":"This is one of those CDs you put down and then the next time you listen to it, you wonder why you didn't like it more the listen before. The songs are all quite different from each other. As a Depeche Mode/Yaz/Erasure fan, I really like \\"Your Clown\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all right","review":"It is all right. Every one said it was da bomb but I don't think so. It is an ok cd. I you have not heard the songs listen to a sample and you might be the one who likes it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, real Eurodance in the states","review":"It is about time they started bringing over true Eurodance stateside. This CD is great (and has more than 4 song, it has 14). Songs like \\"Blue\\", the bubble one (cannot remember the title), and \\"Silicone World\\" are true to the form and great songs. \\"Your Clown\\" sounds very Erasure-ish if they used electronic voice changing. Overall, if you want something that is not watered down like the Backstreet Boys and want some true dance music, then this is your CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of PET SHOP BOYS","review":"Europop is full of danceable, catchy tunes that will have you bopping your head and tapping your feet. With the top 40 hit BLUE, Eiffel 65 is sure to stay on the charts this year if they don't overdo the same sound. A decade ago when the Pet Shop Boys burst onto the radio, no one thought they'd stick around, but here at the dawn of 2000 is Europop emulating the same kind of sound and finding success."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's more to these guys than Blue!","review":"LIke everyone else, I bought this CD for Blue, having heard it on a foreign dance mix in June. Now, however, my favorite song is \\"too much of heaven\\"-- This CD has an infectious beat, without a single track I'm tempted to just fast forward through. I actually find myself wanting to listen to a track over an over again. Makes me wish there was more European music available in the States, and miles better than Mambo #5 (I see the people who are buying this CD are also interested in that song)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So GREAT!","review":"I just wanted to say that this is one of the best CD's ive ever bought! It has a LOT of great, upbeat songs, and its one of those CD's that you just let play over and over again, skipping over just a couple of songs. Tons of the songs get stuck in your head. just be prepared to DANCE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Europop Eiffel 65","review":"This album is one of the best ones I have heard in a looooong time, it has been on constantly and I am still not sick of it, I would have listened to it about 20+ times now and still love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scroll Up Please","review":"To the person who said that the singer is actually saying \\"I will bleed I will die\\", you are the misinformed one. This is a very common misinterpretation, but that is due to the lack of annunciation on the singers part. My uncle knows the group, and just look at the name of the song. Da ba Dee da ba....etc etc. I would appreciate you not spreading around information on the group until you have thoroughly researched, and not base it on your own ears. This is a good cd, but a little bit repetitive to all of the people out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This CD rules!","review":"All I can say is that Eiffel 65 did an awesome job! Blue is a big hit and it's definetly a great song. Too much of heaven talks about money dependence and how bad it is, it's a really good song, I especially love the beginning of this song. There are a lot of great song to dance, like Dub in life, Move your body, My console, Another race and the title track Europop. My favorite is Hyperlink, it's just simply perfect, I love both the lyrics and the music, you must have that song. The only song on this CD I don't really like is Living in a bubble. It's just not as good as the others. Your clown is a very interesting song. It's a slow one, but very enjoyable and definetly worth listening. If you like techno and eurodance, or if you just wanna have some fun, you should buy this CD now. You should listen to it before buying though. But I think, you'll love it. This CD is a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks da ba dee","review":"As a Dj i find this rather disturbing.There is some good electronica and house out there that never crosses over; yet the stupid club hits as this always sell like hot cakes.If you truly like that da ba dee song you will be happy to note that every song on this album is the same.I wonder if this band will have the same long lasting effects as as Chumbawumba,Stacey Q,The Jets,Snow or Kris Kross.(Note:To those actually reading this the last sentence was sarcasm"},{"rating":"1","title":"gimme a break","review":"Now this is just the dumbest cd I've ever heard the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because some of the lyrics are cool.

Not to mention their awful music videos...the cheesy computer animation is horrible. \\"I'm blue, da ba dee da ba...\\" Puh-leeze! This is a disgrace to the music industry.

Even then I should have suspected a track whose main gimmick is repetition and a vocoder wasn't the product of creative genius.Unfortunately the customer reviews here are too polarized. Anyone who appreciates other techno music, or just good music in general will agree that Eiffel 65 is an exercise in mindless, uncreative silliness. But neither is it the unlistenable junk that others claim.It's more the kind of music you should pirate as MP3s, get out of your system in a day or two, and then erase forever. Maybe if you find a used CD, pop down a buck or two. Europop isn't worth much money, but it could be a fun quick listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Music in the world.","review":"Eifel 65 is the best group ever. I highly reccomend.

I absolutly loved it! I also liked \\"Heaven\\". Although none of my other friends liked it I thought that it described very well how people are today: only interested in money!

I don't know why they aren't getting the message! I'm sorry if I'm offending any \\"Europop-ers\\" but this is worse than listening to cats puke for afew months! The best part is when the DJ says, \\"And that was Eiffel 65 with blue\\". Eiffel 65, the best advice do what Emily Dickinson did. Stay in a house, never leave it, for at least 15 years. And wear only white. The second best is PLEASE, for the sake of sanity and civilization, do hide behind the funky-tech music.

The song Blue would be listenable if were not for the lyrics about a blue person. \\"Move Your Body\\"? gee I don't think ive ever heard that phrase used in dance music before (sarcasm.) Its the same with the rest, the music would be okay euro dance, euro house, if it were not fo the really bad lyrics. They use the vocoder, (voice warper thing) on every song, making his singing extremely annoying at times.Buy, well anythign else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Blue single","review":"The only reason I bought this album was for the Blue song.

Eiffel 65 isn't bringing nothing new to the table. Their album is derivative, mindless, repetitive and calculated. The only reason people are giving this album any time of day is because of the constant airplay \\"Blue\\" recieved over the past few months. They're just a group who got lucky that's all. They won't be remembered in a year I GUARANTEE THAT.

Still, a few of the tracks are high-energy and in spite of their difficulties, make for some enjoyable music."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song and nothing else","review":"I bought this album because I liked the song \\"I'm Blue.\\" However, when I listened to the whole album, I was glad that I bought the album used for $3.

Though a couple songs on the Europop album have a catchy beat and occasionally ok lyrics, the album isn't worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy music not Blue at all","review":"The first time i heard this album i was like ewwww. All my friends were telling me to sell it to someone, but after hearing it a few times it was not as stupid as i thought it was and day after day i found myself listening to it more and more. Of course there is blue which we all know and the new hit move your body. But other songs like silicon world is my personsl favorite and even the slow songs have got a nice beat and interesting lyrics, sooner or later you will find yourself singing to the tune of Eiffel 65."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"my daughter loves this CD, plays it everyday.

The chord progressions work so well and listening to every song straight through is quite an experience. Being a musician myself I can understand the talent need to produce such work. The remixes are great too and just add fun twists to already fabulous music. My advice is to buy this album not just once, but a few times in case you wear out the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Eiffel 65","review":"WHAT IS THE EIFFEL 65 BOX SET? Well.

The information included with the box set is only a single folded over sheet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what introduced me to Eiffel 65's music","review":"People listen to 'Blue (Da Ba Dee)' and assume that all of Eiffel 65's music is the same. They're wrong. By listening to 'Europop', you will find that the songs can vary from fast songs like 'Dub in Life' and 'Hyperlink (Deep Down)' to slow and incredibly meaningful tracks like 'Your Clown' and 'Now is Forever.' I fell in love with the song 'Blue (Da Ba Dee)' and first discovered Eiffel 65's unmatched talent. The song 'Now is Forever' is an especially good song because it offers some valuable advice: Live for today and don't worry about tomorrow. 'Europop' is an awesome CD and I will always love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Europop","review":"This album is probably one of the best eurodance albums out there, even if Eurodance was already gone since the mid 90's. Eiffel had one of the biggest hits of the year in 99 in Europe with \\"Blue\\" and later with \\"Move your body\\" the animated video was a blast and the great melodies, beats and lyrics were just perfect for a eurodance record. The whole album is very pleasant, and most songs are pure dance music, you can really hear that they come from the same group. The group made another album a few years later, a decent album too but not as good as this one. Most songs appeal to anyone into dance music, Songs like \\"Blue\\" were surely more commercial then alot of other dance but too good to not be played. A good and fun dance album! We need more of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like having songs stuck in your head? Get this CD!!","review":"I first heard this CD two years ago at my friend's house, and was a little freaked out by it. It's very different than your average type of music, and even its worst songs are a lot better than all this pop music and boy bands. This CD is not for someone who likes predictability in music. The topics of the songs on this CD go from depressed people to the downfall of society to dancing...it's fabulous! Most of the songs, if you listen closely, give messages on how to live your life, and how most people are materialistic (\\"Too Much of Heaven\\") and only think of themselves (\\"Living in a Bubble\\").A hint: The most famous song on this CD (\\"Blue\\") is good, but the two best songs are \\"Living in a Bubble\\" and \\"The Edge\\" Living in a Bubble gives a great message, and is really fun to listen to, and \\"The Edge\\" is great dancing music.Buy Eiffel 65 Europop, and you will listen to it (along with the Beatles) every day of your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, despite the cheese.","review":"One excellent quality about this disc is the abundance of meaningful lyrics. Of course, with meaningful lyrics comes cheese, if the band isn't careful. And that's what happens with Europop. However, there are several excellent songs (\\"Too Much of Heaven\\", \\"Dub in Life\\", and, of course, the much too overplayed \\"Blue\\"). Even cheesy tracks are still good (witness \\"Your Clown\\", with possibly the worst line ever, \\"I don't want to be your clown, because I long to carry on\\", yet still one of my favorite tracks). The only track I can't really stand is \\"Hyperlink\\" (which others seem to like a lot, for some reason). Luckily, it's at the end of the CD.All in all, it is a great collection of songs, more meaningful than most of the fluff you hear in techno these days (as a friend put it, \\"vocals are great, lyrics are awful\\"), great beats, and very catchy melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"blue(dabadeedabadi)","review":"Im from louisiana and on a radio station down here they wore that song \\"blue\\" out and I dont like it very much to tell you the truth if you are a fan of heavy metal & hard rock music you would hate eiffel65 but I like different kinds of music but mostly heavy metal but i used to listen to pop and when i did i hated eiffel65 but this is my opinion.listen to it yourself and share you opinion but I just dont like any of the songs by eiffel65."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious blend of '80s influences","review":"My kids recommended this disc, largely because of the popularity of \\"Blue\\" as a single. All the tracks contain an infectious rhythm, but on top of this are finely tuned dissonant harmonies and vocal acrobatics. My favorites are \\"Move Your Body\\" and \\"Living in A Bubble.\\" The group's sound reminds me of a combination of the Human League and Tears For Fears, the latter band's influence strongly present on \\"Your Clown.\\" Lyrically \\"Silicon World\\" is reminiscent of Madonna's \\"Material Girl.\\" If you enjoyed the synth-techno pop bands of the early to mid 1980s then this will bring you lots of nostalgic pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar Sounds...Overall Good","review":"While some say this gets old, I dont think so. I've listened to it everyday while I do my homework for about half a year. I like too much of heaven, my console, blue, eroupop, & hyperlink the most. Your Clown is poor. It is pretty bad, but its the only flunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start Lets See Some Consistency","review":"Okay I have to admit I love this CD. It has a great thumping beat and one of the best variations in songs that I have seen in a while. ADVICE: Don't listen to all the songs back to back though..sometimes they can sound the same. I am not going to jump on the train and say that these guys are the best ever cause frankly I have been around too long to do that. So many of these groups have one hit and then die. Show me a good follow-up to this one and I will be a fan forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This has to be the worst cd that I have ever heard. The beat is bad, but also the same throughout the whole cdAny real techno fan should never hear this cd, and any real techno fan should never be looking up eiffel 65 either.I have done this as a public service announcement to all.

But on the upside the CD is very dancable and keeps your feet moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dumb CD!","review":"I do like the song \\"Blue (Da Ba Dee).\\" When I listened to the other songs on the album, I said \\"forget it.\\" The other songs on this CD are like too computerized and you can't tell what they're saying. This is not real music. Don't waste your money on this CD unless you've listened to it and absolutely love it. I bet you'll be sick of it in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't confuse \\"Europop\\" with \\"techno\\"","review":"This album is a poor attempt at selling European dance/techno music to ignorant Americans who don't know what techno really is. The songs on \\"Europop\\" are just that, Europop, except with the added ingredients of stupidity and blandness ( These guys are like Aqua with a male singer). Their lyrics are nauseatingly stupid, just listen to \\"Another Race,\\" or the song about the Playstation (Come on, is that really what music is about? Writing about video games?) Yes, Blue is catchy, but the song is truly idiotic and makes a mockery of the techno genre. But don't hold yourself back from buying this because of me (not that you would). However, if you want to try listening to true techno, try Gigi D'Agostino, or Antiloop. Eiffel 65 is just another boring, cheap techno imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Group of its Own","review":"You can't really classify Eiffel 65. I just call it basic techno. But it doesn't really have any sub-categories. It has hardhouse beats here and there, also trance, a bit of regular house also. So what I'm tryin' to say is that if you like any kind of techno, then this CD is for you. Also if you liked any of the songs you heard on the radio, or in clubs, then you will also like this CD. I first heard of them from my friend, before the \\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\\" song was even a hit where I live. It was pretty cool, because me and him got almost everyone in our grade to like them. Ok, I gotta go, see ya. By the way, GO GET THE CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is TIGHT!!!!!","review":"When I first heard this CD I played it over and over again.

All through the Europop CD, I was either resisting the need to get up and dance to a song or just moving to the music where I was (don't think the job would approve of my dancing in my office! ; }). Think it reminds be somewhat of the dance music from the mid to late 1980's blended the more technological music of the last few years. If you have heard either version of 'Blue', you will probably like one or more of the other songs. I really like, 'Blue' [Track 1 & 14], 'Living In A Bubble' [Track 4], & 'Europop' [Track 12]. But it's hard to choose for most of the songs for a good choice in describing the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a must have","review":"This CD is really good.

If you like blue you have to buy this CD today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of dance/techno music.","review":"Let me start off by saying that seriously this CD is really good. If you're a dance/techno music fan you will love this CD. If you're a fan of pop than it will probably open you up to a whole new, yet oh-so-slightly familiar, world of music. This CD opened my eyes and it will surely do the same for you. This CD is a dance music cake with techno music frosting and a few house music sprinkles. You'll love it!! These guys have great talent and, they're pretty cute too. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly catchy (da ba dee)","review":"Like most others in the US, I picked this CD up shortly after hearing the single \\"Blue\\" on the radio fourteen million and twelve times. All hype aside, while the lyrics aren't in any sense profound, they are more imaginative and worthwhile than most of today's mindless pop ballads. I would have to sum up this group's overall sound as that of cotton candy stuck in a vacuum cleaner, but it works well! I agree that the songs work best one at a time, and not necessarily all in a row; to the credit of Eiffel 65 they have produced something that is as unpredictable as it is satisfying. Go on and spend the money then MOVE YOUR BODY. Da ba dee. You just can't get them out of your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"The whole vocal effect thing is TIRED","review":"I heard \\"Blue\\" on the local top 40 radio station and said \\"wow, something cool on the radio for a change.\\" i saw the album on sale, bought it, and was so bored with the whole thing.

This is the kind of music that you don't need a brain to enjoy it. All of it is trashy sounds and cheesy lyrics and I hope that you will not make the mistake of buying this.

There is currently no OSX version of the Explorer, but Samsung do provide updates on a dedicated web site, so I imagine there will be a version available soon.As for the features, OK so the radio isnt all that great, but MP3s sound perfect, and you can fit an hour onto this player easily (at 192Kb encoding).

I really didnt expect much from this bluray version, but when i put it in to watch, my jaw dropped.

This movie is better with bluray because the setting in bangkok is full of art and nature, and it really shows thru in this movie.

However, they did it so cool:) When Van Damme goes to Thailand, the movie gets awesome. There are some very nice Thai fights in the ring (both in the background AND during Van Damme's bouts). The training scenes are rather long (always a plus with martial arts movies) however they aren't accurate to Muay Thai. Why? Thai boxers don't do Van damme's \\"splits kick,\\" among other things. And Thai boxers (in the old days) kicked banana trees (with rubber bark), NOT palm trees. Don't let this movie influence you to go try and kick down a tree with your shin. There, that being said. Go watch this movie:) Still want more? Hmmm... cool music (the old guy's flute rules), beautiful women, and comedy.

I think this movie is a cheap (even though it cost more) ripoff of Bloodsport. I think they just wanted another Bloodsport since that one did so well. Van Damme is a little too self-congratulory. The relationship is fairly unbelievable. And that part at the end when Kurt is angry with his girl (cant remember her name), demanding the truth that she was raped and beaten by TongPo (his nemesis), instead of consoling her. She decided not to tell him because she doesnt want to disturb his concentration, but instead starts crying and begging forgiveness for her inexcusable behavoir.

I practice martial arts and can say with certainty that Jean Claude was doing a hybrid of Shotokan karate (which he has a black belt in in real life), hapkido or another korean style that uses high flashy kicks, and some form of tai chi he was using while doing all the slow-movement scenes. The only muay Thai done in the movie was done by Tong Po, Van Damme was training with a muay Thai teacher but must have been watching karate tapes at night in his hut or not paying much attention in his lessons. As with his other movies, his Eurotrash accent and horrific acting make this film almost painful to watch, and the only good parts in the whole movie were the ones showing that cute Thai chick who was the teacher's niece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank the forgery","review":"If you believe Bloodsport is based on a true story you are mistaken.

The trophy he is said to have won; he awarded it to himself after it was forged at a place near his home in North Hollywood. If you don't believe me you can read it for yourself in a book, by B.G. Burkett and Glenna Whitley, called Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was Robbed of its Heroes and its History. Bloodsport is not a movie based on a true story. Frank Dux is a liar who like many others who have stained the memory of 60,000 American G.I.'s that died in Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Damme was never in better shape than in this film.","review":"NO, it is not a great film and it is corny.

I also found the training sequences to be very inspiring if watched while working out. Overall, an engaging movie with bad acting (JCVD must do the worst job of acting drunk in all of film history, but hey, he's never gonna be Foster Brooks.) that a martial arts fan can appreciate.

There is no waythis bok will become a classic, even less a hit"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was&#65533;(yawn) unsatisfying","review":"After reading Jeffrey Deaver's The Bone Collector, I couldn't wait to get my hands on any Deaver novel. I bought Praying for Sleep with the hope of more nailbiting action. Boy was I sorely disappointed! The slow pacing made me want to to pull my hair out! It took me almost a month-on and off-to finish the book. I could care less if Hrubek was caught or not, he never made sense and the end was too convenient for my taste. I'm supposed to feel bad for Lis Atcheson's plight but in the end, I didn't care either way. The characters were very one-dimensional and I didn't sense any humanity in them. There was no sense of urgency I usually associate with page turner thrillers. If you're looking for really good Deaver books, I highly recommend The Bone Collector and its sequel The Coffin Dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"The refreshing thing about Jeffrey Deaver is that, unlike so many other attorney-authors, he doesn't feel compelled to jump on the Grisham/Turow bandwagon.The bad thing about this is that Deaver attempts to tackle subjects without burdening himself with proper research.Only Deaver's well developed gift for wordsmithing keeps this book from a one star rating. The protagonist, Michael Hrubek, while a sympathetic character, is one who is plainly insane, therefore incapable of being identified with. As with much of Hemingway's fiction, there was hardly a character in it that I found appealing or rooted for, including Hrubek, who hardly utters a single coherent sentence in the entire story.The only other reason why this snoozefest got a second star out of me (aside from the fact that you cannot give half stars) was the surprise ending.This is plainly not a book to be sequelized and let us thank God for small favors. Deaver was clearly coasting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Deaver book I've read.","review":"This book is just awful. At least the first 125 pages are; I had to stop reading after I got that far. The characters are mostly unsympathetic, and unlikeable. The writing is dense, and unclear.I've read and loved most of Deaver's other works, and this one pales in comparison. It's without a doubt his worst. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"praying for action","review":"I was devouring Deaver's titles, one after another because of his book \\"Devil's Teardrop\\". But I was really disappointed by P.F.S. The plot is slow moving. I'm one-third through and I'm not sure what Hrubek wants. I keep hoping for action and it was a big let down one after another--like watching a B-grade horror flick. It's been a month since I bought the book and I'm still unable to finish it. It's simply too tiring. Skip this. It really isn't one of Deaver's best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Michael Hurbek is a schizophrenic escapee from a mental hospital, and he's on a mission to find Lis Atcheson, the woman who testified against him in a trial where he was found guilty of a vicious murder. The police, Michael's psychiatrist, a professional dog tracker, and Lis' wiley war vet husband are all trying to stop him, but Michael seems adept at evading them all, leaving behind him a trail of murder and destruction.Somewhat interesting core storyline, although some of the tangents were a little boring. Seemed like Deaver was trying to make this into a more serious novel without success. Characterization didn't do much for me. Acceptable read, but definitely not his best. I recommend his Rhymes and Sachs Bone Collector series as much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Michael Hurbek is a schizophrenic escapee from a mental hospital, and he's on a mission to find Lis Atcheson, the woman who testified against him in a trial where he was found guilty of a vicious murder.

All of his novels are based on a single premise - keep the reader entertained and involved and Praying for Sleep does just that.Mental patient and convicted murderer Michael Hrubek escapes from the looney bin. The people that helped put him there, Lis and her husband have everything to fear when they hear he has escaped.The head of the hospital covers up the disappearance and to make matters worse his therapist believes he is innocent. This leaves Lis afraid for her life...Deaver's novels stand out from the pack for many reasons - the well drawn plot lines and characters and the plot twists and turns. This one has an ending that you will never forget. Praying for Sleep will do for dark and stormy nights what Jaws did for the ocean and psycho did for showers. Don't read this one alone...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praying for more details...","review":"Jeffery Deaver seems to have showed up out of nowhere to become one of the best thriller authors in the biz...and I believe that 'Praying For Sleep' was the first time I had ever heard of him... I came close to buying this book on several occasions, but somehow always managed to pass it by in favor of something else. It wasn't until I got to know Lincoln Rhyme that I took a chance and picked up some of his earlier books. While good, you can definitely see the growth as a sheer genius at plotting that Mr. Deaver has pulled off in his more recent novels. My best recommendation for this book is to read it and NOT to judge it based upon some of his more recent novels and you are certain to have a fun time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite authour","review":"This book is excellent, Jeffrey Deaver is the master of twists and surprises. I couldn't put this book down, it was different from the Bone Collecter and Maiden's Grave, but just as good, he creates characters with such ease, and he sets the scene and the mood without ever being boring.I haven't read the Coffin Dancer yet, but I can't wait"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've learned my lesson","review":"I am a tried and true Jeff Deaver fan.... at least I was untilI read \\"Praying for Sleep.\\" It didn't actually put me sleep,but it definitely annoyed me. The author jumps around from one scenario to another, most of which are highly implausible. The book is confusing and slow. I bought it based upon my reading of Deaver's other works. I neglected to read the Amazon.com reviews. I've learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, just wish it fit better","review":"This stand is loose on Brunton gas canisters. Its difficult to put on because its just small enough you have to tilt it a bit to get in the grooves, yet big enough it easily tilts over and comes off. Getting a stove level with this on is harder than leveling one without it. Works good on a level picnic table though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare short account of visual expressions of music.","review":"I was really surprised by looking for the first time the visual appearance of music. It looks to me as the our days fractals, shown in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh ???","review":"After about 5 pages into this thing I found myslelf becoming more and more baffled, as the author continually threw out various terminology with no explanation of it. I kept at it for a while and it didn't get any better. He has all sorts of drawings and diagrams, but again -- he does not define his terms or even give you a clue as to where find any definitions. If the book had a glossary this would be marginally tolerable, but it doesn't and it isn't. This is too bad, because the topic is fascinating and the author is obviously very knowlegeable. Unfortunately he seems incapable of sharing this knowlege with the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Successful diatribe about \\"modern\\" life","review":"Although tagged as a novel, this work is a singular example of a polemic or diatribe even rant in the form of a monologue by one Joseph Shapiro whose target is modern America (c 1969) which country and its customs is synonymous with Sodom. Art, marriage etc in their modern manifestations are instances of how corrupt this society is. Purity can be found in the traditional Jewish faith. Joseph might be right. But it doesn't necessarily make for a riveting read. Most debates where only one side is heard, don't. For the converted only who like the sound of their own ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny yet still learn at the same time","review":"Yes, this video is adolescent and sophomoric in nature. Yet, it does the trick of making vocabulary building fun and makes you laugh at the same time.

There is also a disc with printable exercises that reinforces the meaning of the words. We both enjoyed viewing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO not recommend","review":"My two boys, in the early 20s, and I watched the first chapter.

I wasn't able to finish the book. It bored me. It didn't hold my interest. I got \\"Life At The Top\\" also and I am sure hoping it will be better. I can't exactly pinpoint what I didn't like about the book except that it seems he wrote his chapters like magazine articles and then put them together as a book without noticing that certain names and things are already mentioned in past chapters. And there just wasn't anything to hold it all together, I guess it didn't go deep enough into the areas that would have interested me. But really, how can you write much of anything about a building, particularly one with so many comings and goings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining","review":"Being new to the \\"tasting \\" of whiskey ( although quite an old hand at the drinking part).

I have a feeling now about how to describe whiskey rather than just \\"yum\\" or \\"@#$$#@$ never again!\\"Mr Stirk has an easy style and is not at all domineering in his views but leads the reader through the levels of whiskey tastes in an easy and inclusiotory manner.

There was one chapter in the book that described my bypass surgery to a \\"T\\" so that I finally understood what my body had gone through. It's an en lighting and informative book for folks with any heart condition. I am 79 years of age. A lesson to others with any type heart condition. Take heed. I had been previously cleared by my electrophysiologist to exercise and my wife and I had been going to the gym, 3 times weekly, lifting weights plus walking for over five years. The surgeon commented after my surgery that was why I came through the surgery so well and healed so fast was the good condition my body was in, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon screwed up - then sold out","review":"Was on email alert for several months and finally got a notification that powder was in stock - so ordered right away (would be great for Mother's Day).

I flipped right through it and found no interest, and it went right in the recycling bin. I was gifted a subscription so I guess I'll either be donating or recycling them all.

This magazine is purely for people who love fashion and make-up so much that it totally rules their lives! I would recommend to anyone who is not a Barbie not to get Lucky.

I am 27 and LOVE clothes, shoes and make-up but NOT anything in this magazine.It's Trendy and Very Quirky to put it kindly. Not a magazine for the stylish, classy, chic woman. No, instead you will find \\"new\\" ways to wear an UGLY gold lame top.

Overall I was not pleased. I would flip through this mag if I did not have reading material at the gym, but I would not spend hard-earned money buying it.

This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Better Years Ago","review":"This used to be my favorite magazine. I feel that in recent years it has gone down hill in a big way. The back pages used to be filled with offer codes for discounts at all kinds of shops but are now mostly filled with pictures of items you can enter to win. I also feel that this magazine has gotten thinner and thinner. It almost feels like it should be a weekly publication due to it's lack of thickness. There are very few articles anymore. This magazine has become a huge monthly disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Fashionistas","review":"This is an excellent mag for lovers of clothes, shoes, accessories, and new beauty products. Their style is young-ish, 20s- sometimes 30s, and the ensembles sometimes seem odd, but lo and behold what they suggested 3 months ago is now part of mainstream fashion. I was craving ideas for new outfits, and Lucky is not bereft of them. Also, their clothing choices range from Old Navy, to small indie .com boutiques, to high end luxe brands.I enjoy their features on new designers, and \\"How I'm Wired\\" about new tech toys. Yes, I read all of the fashion mags I can get my hands on, but this one's my fave. I even use the stickers they give you to mark which items you want to actually buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE!","review":"This is the best shopping and style magazine EVER! PERIOD! I'm serious, the pages are completely FILLED with tips on how to wear type s of clothes or patterns, how to find something that flatters you, places to go to find designer items for 1/4 of the cost. Few ads, lots of editorial reviews and suggestions, I love getting this magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most innovative thing to hit women's fashion magazines","review":"Brilliant all around, especially the little tabs for marking stuff that you may want to buy! The companion website is also updated properly. As noted earlier no hype...and best of all, most of the clothes featured are for real people and available at real prices. No $7,000 haute tissue holders here! Absolutely a must also for makeup/bodycare product junkies. Just order it, you will NOT regret it for a second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crumbles and is super messy","review":"My daughter was so disappointed in this product. It makes a huge mess, crumbles apart, its really a lot like moon sand which we hated too.Stick to play doh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like described","review":"I just purchased this for my 2 kids (6 and 2) because they LOVE play dough and moon sand. It is very crumbly and wont stick together, it wont roll into balls or shape into anything without the molds. It's difficult to get the dough out of the molds too.On the commercial it shows them making balls and bricks... no way. Don't waste your money, play dough is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Group","review":"Please note that Amazon has made an error. Obviously, this artist is a black woman from the islands, singing raggae. They have cross referenced her with Marcia Ball, who is a Louisiana/Texas Blues Rock singer.Someone from Amazon needs to make a correction."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've never heard of 'em, but you gotta have 'em!","review":"One of my favorite albums. Kind of punk-rockabilly-roadhouse...I don't know exactly what you call it. But I do know it's enjoyable. Several excellent tracks even though a few are forgettable.As of 4-22-03 they seem to have broken up. It's a shame 'cause they were awesome live.At any rate, buy it if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids book on Pops Armstrong","review":"This nicely illustrated little book is a great way to introduce kids to the life and music of Louis Armstrong. The biographical information dramatized is accurate (according to the latest footnoted biography of Pops by Terry Teachout -- also recommended) and presented in an engaging way. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Illusions","review":"I liked this book, although I liked Ms. Masci-Goss's first two books even better. This one was about a little girl who's father was rumored to have \\"done away with\\" his wife. As the story progresses we discover the \\"dangerous illusion\\".... things are not always as they appear. The biggest lesson this book taught me was about gossip and how dangerous it is and what it can do.I like the characters and the concept was a tiny bit far-fetched but you are so involved in the lovely characters you don't realize it at all. Been awaiting another book for some time but having seen anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book for a rainy day","review":"this is a hard to find book, writen about the danger that passionate love can bring to us. It is a romance novel, historically set, but stretches the credibility factor a bit. Good if you are stuck with some time to kill, but other than that, stick to other adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winding journey through stardom","review":"For anyone studying the concepts of fame, stardom and the idolization of celebrities, this book is a must read. Fowles' study is an extremely comprehensive examination of how the American public relates to its celebrities, and the services, both mental and emotional, that they provide for us. He also analyzes the difficulties that come with celebrity, those that originate from within as well as those that originate with the public. The one thing I can criticize about this book is its organization. Fowles starts out on one subject-- the compensation stars receive, for example-- and then ends up at drug abuse and death rates. However, this really does not detract from the quality of the research or the material. It was revealing on a personal level too. It made me stop and examine how I idolize certain celebreties myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"displeased","review":"I ordered a new book and although it arrived in acceptable shape, it has been used as evidenced by yellow highlighter throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY TOP 3 MOVIES!","review":"I love this movie! This is where I just fell in love with Reese Witherspoons acting. She's now my favorite actress. I'd never noticed her before this. She is superb! The movie makes you think about what is important and what we take for granted. It's not so deep it ruins everything. It is a real feel good movie! I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tobey and Reese!!","review":"Well, this movie in whole is not really together. It went to different directions from the original point somewhere down the line. Maybe because Mr. Gary Ross, the first time director, had too much to say in his directorial debut (he was a screenwriter. But the strong production value, the great cast, and the attention to artwork and to details are so winning that I can't help but to like this movie. Heck, anything Toby and/or Reese stars, I will watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"COLOUR CRAZY","review":"I LOVE the use of colour in this film.The story is clear and has several humerous parts espescially in the first half of the film.The use of colour is amazing in relation to the plot and there is also a rascism theme which Garry Ross has incorporated with change and acceptance.The characters were well developed and convincing especially Joan Allen as the estranged Betty-A great film (P.S My young brother James liked the film although he found some parts scary}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantville Reflects '50's&'60's","review":"In reading some of the other personal reviews, I felt it necessary to respond. This film was not just a fairy tale. Yes, it does say Once Upon a Time at the beginning, but that is not the point. The point of the film is that it is okay to be different, to teach, to learn, to escape the everyday, to wander, to search, to discover, to hope, to dream and to change. This film wasn't just some funny comedy with some tenderness thrown in for effect. Pleasantville gives us retrospect on the civil unrest that was happening, racially, in the United States during the 50's and the 60's when desegregation was taking place. Life imitates art and art imitates life. Reese was wonderful as always. Toby was interesting. William H. Macy was outstanding. This film is certainly a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in Mexico DVD no worky","review":"as with some \\"made in Germany\\" cd's i've gotten off amazon, this \\"made in mexico\\" blu ray does not play. yes i've got alot of other blurays from amazon that have played, no i don't need an upgrade for my player. i guess this is overseas licensing to make cds and dvds for an overall lower price. still its gotta play in the dvd player right? BOGUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, relaxing movie","review":"A very sweet and entertaining movie. It is nice to see Reese Witherspoon and Toby Maguire at the beginning of their careers. There is adult nudity, in pictures and artwork however, that unfortunately make it unsuitable for younger children. But it may not appeal to that age group anyway.As someone who grew up with \\"Father Knows Best\\", I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but problems with DVD transfer","review":"This is a funny and entertaining movie, but I had some Serious problems with the DVD between chapters 29 and 30. So bad, in fact, that I had to unplug my DVD player, then restart it, and then skip to chapter 31 and rewind to the problematic section. This is similar to a publisher sending out VHS tapes that are mangled at some mid-point of the movie and which get tangled in your VCR.I recommend the movie, but the DVD could cause you some problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoker","review":"How can Marshall Fine claim \\"Pleasantville\\" was hyped by many critics just for it's spectacular effects? Yes, the technological wonders of this movie is marvelous. But, there is lot more to this movie than just great special effects. Whether you agree or disagree with symbolism and messages in \\"pleasantville\\" to real life, you have to agree that it makes you think. If you prefer your movies to be \\"no Brainer\\" with just great visuals and audios, then there are many movies to satisfy your needs. But, if you prefer to leave your \\"thinking cap\\" on, maybe even discuss your thoughts with others about the movie afterwards, then this is a movie for you. As an extra bonus, you get stunning visual and audio as well in \\"pleasantville\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insults the intelligence of any average human being.","review":"This movie is an embarrassment. The movie has a great premise, but the storyline jumps around seemingly trying to analyze every human problem. The slut(Reese Witherspoon) reads one book and becomes a nice girl. What message was 'Pleasantville' sending when the boy punches someone to gain color? Gary Ross tries to address all racial injustices with 25 minutes of the movie; the \\"No Coloreds\\" sign is a slap in the face, and almost as bad is the shameless rip-off of the 'To Kill a Mockingbird' court scene. With its many shallow attempts at depth, Pleasantville is an insult to all good movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would like to know, please","review":"At the end of the movie there was a theme song that touched my heart. It goes, nothing really changes the world....Anyone know the title and singer of the song?Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two star - not a Buy.","review":"This movie deserved two star max. It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT thought-provoking. The movie also try to get some messages about freedom of speech and free thinking across but does not do it well. The movie Big (Starring Tom Hank)is one of my favorite so I bought Pleasantville before I watch it..... big disappointment. I realize that people have different test about movie so I'm gonna give mine for reference..... example : I LIKE : Dead Poet Society, Defending Your Life, Baby Boom, Four Wedding and a Funeral, Ransom, Matrix, Pretty Woman I HATE : Armageddon, Face Off, Con Air I Dislike : You've got mail, My best friend edding, and Pleasantville. I read the comment from viewers below that gave the movie one or two stars before I buy and I thought they were over reacted .... to my regret... I read them again after I watched the movie and find myself agree with much of what they've said. If you have not seen it I'd say you don't miss anything much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw it but dont like it.","review":"I actually bought this movie before watching it. BIG MISTAKE! I didnt really enjoy the movie. There was not as much humor in it and it was hard to sit through the whole movie. I would recomend it only if you want to be bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent visual metaphor","review":"Apparently many people missed the point of this film. Especially those claim it is propaganda. Anyone who thinks this movie is about special effects or sex doesn't deserve to watch it. The movie relies on it's color metaphor to depict change and both the concept and execution are flawless. The DVD has hours of wonderful extra material & if you have a DVD-ROM you can browse the entire script. Be sure to check out the Fiona Apple music video \\"Nothings Gonna Change My World\\" in the extra section."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASANTVILLE IS AMAZING","review":"I have watched PLEASANTVILLE at least 5 times, and it is better every time. The cast is amazing. Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon make the perfect brother and sister. Joan Allen deserved an Oscar nod for her brilliant performance. The visual effects certainly deserved Oscar potential as well. There were over 1,700 visual effects shots just for this film alone. That has to be a record. The sets of the 50s are brilliant and beautifully built. The score by Randy Newman is brilliant and reminiscent of the 1950s TV shows. The cinematography is brilliant. The screenplay is purely original and excellent. This film is just AMAZING and well...PLEASANT! If you don't believe me, see this movie! You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the most profound cultural commentaries in recent film","review":"Anyone who only saw the first ten minutes of this film would mistake it for something lightweight and fancy, a chance to show off special effects in order to capitalize on nostalgia for the 50's. That would be wrong. This movie is a sometimes agonizingly subtle commentary on the modernist yearning for a simpler past and how far we have really come. Take the following essay questions as hints as to what's really going on in the film: (1) Why doesn't Jennifer transform until she reads Lady Chatterly? (2) Why must it be Lady Chatterly rather than some other book? (3) Why does the wall mural resemble Picasso's Guernica? (4) Why are we initially misled into believing that the only ingredient necessary for the transformation is sex? (5) Why are they safe in the bowling alley? (6) How is David different at the end of the film than at the beginning? etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is WOW!!!!","review":"After my husband and I watched this movie, we couldn't stop saying how wonderful it was. Though we are both avid movie-goers, I can't think of any film which offers as much symbolism as this one. Terrific moments run through the whole movie, however my favourite is the court scene, the images of which were certainly not lost on us. It was the clever (and classic) courtroom scene from To Kill a Mockingbird, with the coloureds upstairs and the whites below. WOW!This movie is an absolutely brilliant piece of work. It really is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's only a movie!","review":"I thought this was a great movie when I saw it in a movie theater a year ago. I just bought the widescreen VHS and have watched it several times at home. Yeah, it's a little preachy and it slows a bit at the end, but it's faults are minor compared to all its wonderful attributes. Imagination, music, visual, and intriging story line. Even heard Mister Blue by the Fleetwoods from the fifties. Too bad it didn't make it to the soundtrack. Gary Ross has produced a terrific movie. A great fairy tale for adults. Didn't anyone notice its 'ONCE UPON A TIME' beginning statement. Wonderful story with great, great performances from all; especially Reese Witherspoon, William Macy and Don Knotts. For all those up tight individuals who take offense at the so called left wing liberal message, get over it; after all its just a movie! Any movie that can generate the large number of viewer responses this one has must have something going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Trying this again. Visually a great movie, but too many bones to pick. First of all, older sitcoms weren't THAT sterile. ( Did Beaver ever eat a breakfast like that? It never rained in an old sitcom? C'mon.) Also, why didn't the mob turn to color when thrashing the malt shop? Exactly when and where did the Whitey character enter the movie? Could go on but spent too many moments looking at the screen (when I wasn't dozing off ) and saying...WELL, DUH! Could have used some (any) humor and seemed as if it was written by someone who watches Mtv WAY too much. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantville DVD","review":"Bought as a gift for an 11 year old. Have not watched it yet, but I'm sure she'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb film","review":"Words pretty much fail me in describing this exquisite film: its beauty and sensitivity; its superb cinematography and direction; its perfect cast and their virtually perfect performances; and its INTELLIGENCE. Keep your hankie nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of 1998","review":"I recently saw \\"Pleasantville\\" and I was amazed. It was original plot and everything was just simply amzing about it. I'm suprised that it wasen't nomintated for best original screenplay. This moive got terrible reviews but thsoe people are just dumb. Everybody should see this movie, it shows just how the real world is and how it should be. As I said before, I was dazzled at it's special effects, plot, and everything in between. The first day this movie comes out, I'm going to buy it. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful erosion of innocence","review":"Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are completely convincing as siblings who are sucked into a 50's black and white sitcom. Nerdy Maguire is as pleased as the proverbial punch, while Witherspoon is dead set to get back home, or barring that, to drag the entire town into the 90's. As she leads them merrily away from their innocence, color erodes the complacent attitudes of them all, with some serious foot-dragging (headed by the always terrific J. T. Walsh). Joan Allen is dynamite as the kids' sexually awakening mom. Adroit social commentary never sacrifices the comedy. Truly delightful, and leaves you much to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"While I thought how they got into Pleasantville was dumb, I like the overall theme of the movie and the transformation from black and white to color symbolizing emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-boggling","review":"This movie is one of the most mind-boggling I've ever seen. More than a year after I've watched it for the first time, it is still opening my eyes, opening them so wide that I get sleepless when thinking about it at night.For this movie is about the fate of humanity. This movie is about why it is better to suffer here on earth than any kind of beatitude in a blissful paradise. This movie is about the inevitability and the adventure of change, it just shouts CHANGE! CHANGE! CHANGE! at you, and the backwards message of the movie is that if you don't, then you'll fade to grey. This movie shows you why civilizations clinging to the past are bound to disappear like dinosaurs because you just cannot prevent change, that children will be thinking differently than parents because this is the way humanity progresses, and that the one motor for change, for putting color in our world, for making it different, is the human mind and its craving for discovery.Gary Ross, you're a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good film!","review":"This film is fun. It comes across as dull as hell but when you've finished watching it, you'll be inclined to thinking that was a pretty good way to spend 2 hours. That cannot be said these days for a lot of films, so check it out. I really enjoyed the fiona apple video also.....it pretty cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I did get it.","review":"This is a classic movie. You'll love it, folks. As for a review, you either receive it or you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is a film i had always searched for at Best Buy or WalMart and never found. I found it online for a great price and i absolutely adore this movie! it was worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was expecting more features on blu ray","review":"I love this movie and was hoping to see a boat load of special features since I was buying the Blu-ray version, but besides the trailer, a music video, and a simple look at behind the scenes, there was nothing exciting special features wise. I was REALLY disappointed since the whole reason you buy DVDs or Blu-rays is for the features since you've already seen the main feature. I'm still happy to have it as part of my collection but I would have been happier to delve more into how the movie was made and maybe even the fictional mythos of pleasantville itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Who can watch those Leave It To Beaver type shows, see how everything always works out, and not crave some part of that? Although Toby Maguire is the lead I think it's Jeff Daniels who sells it best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I loved this movie since I saw it several years ago. Watching it in Bluray made the experience only better. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was all about symbolism. TO DAMN LONG!","review":"THIS MOVIE HAD IT'S UPS AND DOWNS. IT HAD IT'S FUNNIES AND LAMES. PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THEY COULD HAVE MADE THIS MOVIE A LOT SHORTER JUST BY KEEPING IT A STORY. ABOUT TURNING FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO COLOR BY SHOWING EMOTIONS THAT YOU NEVER DID BEFORE."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Honey, I'm home!\\"","review":"Teens George and Jennifer (Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon) are twins but Jennifer is a wild child while George's passion is watching re-runs of the 50s TV sitcom \\"Pleasantville.\\" One night, the kids are magically whisked right into Pleasantville - a swell little town where the fire department only rescues cats in trees, books are as blank as the foks' minds, and everything is in black and white. George loves it there, but Jennifer starts changing things when she takes her boyfriend up to Lover's Lane. Gradually people start seeing things in color, then it rains real rain, and *gasp* dinner is not on the table at six o'clock.This movie left me confused and disappointed. It seems to equate sexual promiscuity with intellectual enlightenment. Maguire and Witherspoon are perfectly cast and give excellent performances, but the script ridicules old fashioned values. I did enjoy the photography changing slowly from black and white to color, but I cannot recommend the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor deliverance","review":"About half way through the movie, I turned to my mother and thanked her for renting it- I would have hated to spend the money on it myself.The overwhelming theme of the movie is the need to imbrace change, and the director never misses a chance to hit you over the head with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"way to preachy.","review":"this was a movie that really should've ended in the first hour. Up to that point it was good, but then sentimentality and really un realistic ideas about what is better in life began creeping in towards the end. Even though it was preaching about the complications in life, and how supposedly so much better they are, it really made the argument seem way to simple. It's not that I didn't appreciate it, but my main problem was how it preached about what was better in real life, but didn't make the charectors EVER seem that real at all. they didn't explore consequences for the charectors actions, as would happen in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming caca (in vivid brown)","review":"This is one infuriating movie. A pleasant premise (and the goodwill of an unsuspecting movie audience) is turned on its head and exploited for what turns out to be the filmmaker's banal political opinions. Nothing in the second half of this movie is supported by the tone of the first half. I had a days-long disagreement with a friend about this movie in which I came up with a long list of inconsistencies and absurdities. I invite you to start your own list.But I will say this: It's a beautiful movie to watch (the transformations from black and white are gorgeous, and there's no denying the visceral power of the very first image of spot color), and Joan Allen, as always, rises above everything she's given. That's what makes it all the more frustrating. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT!!!! IT WAS VISUAL CANDY!","review":"I am a movie fanatic and i rate this movie one of top ten favorites. if you haven't seen it, SEE IT!! you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching","review":"Here is a movie that tries very hard to teach a lesson... on what it thinks is colourful in modern world - mainly: sex, lies, adultery and so on...It's ideas are too shallow and superficial without any thoughts on responsibilities and humanity, moral issues.A big ZERO."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my speed","review":"So much hype and praise for this film. I have no idea what all the fuss was about. If there was some sort of socialogical statement being made, it was lost on me. The story wasn't engaging, and the film on a whole, was weird. Didn't go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in sexual content.","review":"I assumed when making this purchase that this movie would be suitable for me to watch along with my two grandsons, ages 6 and 9 years old. Not so. It was a good movie but when the sexual activity began showing I had to turn the movie off and try to explain to my grandsons, the best I could for their age, that this is not appropriate behavior for boys and girls the age of the actors. Sorry that I am having to say these things to you but you DID ask, right? I hope you truely wanted my honest opinion.Thanks.Jane"},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel cheated!","review":"I was outraged to find that the end of this wonderful movie has been changed from the screen version! The entire situation of Joan Allen's character is different, and gives the film a completely different meaning in regard to her character. Did the Bible Belt police get hold of it, or what? If there has been a major change in the video version of a film, this should be indicated in your description. Just a simple sentence saying something like \\"This film has been edited and the storyline changed from the screen version\\" would have helped to warn me. I bought TWO copies -- one to give away -- and now I'm stuck with a movie with a completely different message than the one I saw. I am especially disappointed since there is no way for me to own the original version. Who made this decision and what were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very pleasent film","review":"from first hearing about the movie, pleasentville may sound a bit odd but if you take the time to watch, you will find it is a very good film. pleasentville tells of two 90's kids (tobey maguire in pre spiderman days and reese witherspoon before her breakout in legally blonde) who are given a remote by, don knots. they are then transported to the world of pleasentville which is like a replica of the 50's era were everything is black and white and things are 'pleasent'. now, they must deal with life in pleasentville before they can go home. the film is kind of a split movie, the first hour or so being a comedy and the second hour being a drama. this may rub people the wrong way when a film switches dynamics but in pleasentville, it works. the film also sports some great cinamatography as pleasentville slowly turns from black and white to full blown color. a really touching film that also scewers 50's cliche's be sure to check out the film that is, well, pleasent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Look, everyone. Let's let alone all the fuss and feathers about morality.If I had known this movie had Don Knotts in it-in his first serious dramatic film role ever, i believe, I would have bought it long ago.I died laughing watching him raise hell at Tobey MacGuire's character. To me, that was worth the price of a ticket. And a copy of the video.I give it four stars only because I feel the plot meanders a bit and at times the movie tries too hard to make a 'statement'.It's definitely worth seeing, though. And owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This movie was very good and funny. I liked it a lot. The cast was put together well. Anyone will like this movie. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks. This film dragged on...","review":"I got this DVD because of the great reviews it was receiving. I felt sorely disappointed. For me, this film dragged on and is not really my sort of film. I can see why it appeals to the American market though it tends to get onto the cheesy side.If you're thinking about getting this film, I'd suggest you read the plot and decide whether you just think that'd be interesting or if you think it's a fantastic idea. Your decision there is likely to produce the outcome of whether you'll like it or not.It's not a film for me but it sure did impress a lot of the Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"should've kept it lighter","review":"Though it preached about what was best in the real world, it seemed to give people way to much credit for being balanced enough to juggle the complexities of life when their teenagers. (hence the sentimental idea of teenagers having finished codes of morality)For heavens' sakes, when the kids burst into color, why not make them grow fat? Get full of zits? Suffer from deppression because of not being excepted into high school society because they can't afford to buy the latest fashion? (Or don't want to run the risk of being shot for them) Maybe put one on drugs. But hey, that would be reality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Different Movie","review":"I never saw a movie where Black & White and Color come together. I think Pleasantville is a great movie, but at the end, it kind of began to get slow. Even though it was mainly about racism, I still liked the movie, because I like old black & white shows from the 50's and 60's. I've never heard of Pleasantville-as a show, so I don't know if there really is one or not, but if there isn't, Pleasantville is a very well-done imitation of an old 50's/60's show, and the movie is very well-done, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning and just plain fun to watch","review":"After seeing \\"Pleasantville\\" twice now (once on DVD and once on VHS), I am forced to say, that I simply love this movie. The effects are stunning, the story, while unbelieveable is a lot of fun to watch. Sure, some of the symbolism is a bit \\"hit you over the head with it\\", but some people need to be hit over the head. If you get the chance, either rent or purchase the DVD. The bells and whistles you get with it are wonderful. The Fiona Apple video included on the DVD is a nice added feature. Rather haunting on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different, Something Good","review":"As you can see by the other reviews, everyone gets something different out of this film. For me, that's really refreshing, being able to watch a DVD several times and enjoy different aspects each viewing. Sure there are some scenes (Don Knotts) that take a great deal of imagination to swallow. Overall, this is a good film, funny, inspiring and thoughtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantville","review":"\\"Pleasantville\\" is a sparkling, witty, highly original film that examines the nasty underside of quaint family values as they are embodied in every age, especially as it critiques the social rigidity of black and white (i.e. prejudice) with its thinly veiled conceit of \\"color\\" (i.e. diversity, individuality). William H. Macy and Joan Allen are well cast as the teens' parents, playing nicely off Maguire's low-key, conformist David/ \\"Bud\\" and Witherspoon's wild girl. Enhanced by some charming special effects, \\"Pleasantville\\" is a blissful comic fantasy with a message of tolerance for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected...","review":"This movie is great! I needed it for my classroom and it was available and mailed to me within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept was pleasant, ultimate theme - unpleasant","review":"As a whole, the concept of the film and the visuals were great! But there was a serious lack of continuity and just far-fetchedness.For instance, we would believe that Pleasantville had no outside world. Then who did they lose the basketball game to?Even more curious, Maguire's character who so longed for family at the film's start, was not concerned at all that his TV mom would leave his TV dad. In fact, he smiled about it. This was supposed to be growth in him.Somehow marital fidelity and sexual purity ... is as dark and foreboding as book-burning according to the screenwriter... The film could've had something to say..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantville","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. I love the story and the way they have slowly turned each person from black and white to color. It says so many things in this movie that I just think it one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as \\"Charming\\" as you might think","review":"This movie was absoutly the worst, and in my opinion most offensive movie I have ever seen. The film, in subtle and many not so subtle ways trashes the traditional values that once made the family and our country strong. What is not shown in this feature is the ultimate outcome of Pleasantville's newfound \\"enlightenment\\". A town full of heart ache, disease, and moral bankrupcy. Sound familiar?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad, You Don't Care How It Ends.","review":"I have to agree that the movie spends too much time being preachy and simplifies things too much. I cannot see how this movie can be so thought provoking as I really cannot identify with any of the characters. Worse than being a preachy movie, it became a bad movie with a bad story about halfway through. If your story is bad, it doesn't matter how dazzling your special effects are and it does not matter how good your cast is. It got to the point where the movie was so bad that I did not care how it ended. The premise of the movie had so much potential but fell flat on its face. It was not uplifting in the slightest. Many reviewers found this movie to be \\"thought provoking\\" and that is fine. It's good for a person to think once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things are black and white for Gary Ross","review":"This file should really be subtitled, \\"Let's pretend the Sixties actually made things better.\\" While this movie is a thrill to watch and the story is not too bad, one never loses the feeling that he or she is being lectured. Ross fails to heed his own admonition about black and white. The fifties are painted as an illusion at best or an oppressive, fascist society at worst. But don't worry; a little free sex will fix everything. Of course they throw a little book burning for legitimacy. I've got the sequel, \\"Return to Pleasantville.\\" Good old Bud can come back to the town to find the town populated by poor single mothers with a thriving abortion facility, the malt shop now a STD clinic and all this in brilliant color.I understand that Pleasantville was not intended to be an Isben play, but a little more depth to the fifties characters would have greatly improved the film.BTW, the Civil Rights Movement started in the Fifties."},{"rating":"1","title":"theres nothing pleasant about trash","review":"This movie shows exactly just how this country got so messed up to begin with. The plot (if you can call it that) is two kids who get sent to the perfect world, and in a matter of days manage to totaly destroy everything good about it. This movie was cleary nothing but Liberal Hollywood lies. This movie seems to be aimed at younger children yet it permotes sex before marriage and other imperfections making them look harmless. After seeing this movie I am lead to believe that there is no hope for Hollywood, their lack of realism manages to retard them yet again. Parents please this is not the trash we should stride for as humans, help your kids by keeping them away from films like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantville","review":"A preachy movie created by a left winger who tries to impose his morals, or lack of morals, upon moviegoers. Do you gain color if you have premarital sex or cheat on your spouse? Cast members in this movie did! Apparently the creators think that premarital sex and cheating is okay, too and the colored people are portrayed sympathetically while the black and white people are mindless. Not all the special effects gimmicks can save this preachy, morally deprived movie. Save your money and do not buy this manipulative video."},{"rating":"1","title":"morally repugnant","review":"This film, while masking itself as cute and harmless, attempts in its own subtle way to completely trash and impune traditional moral values. Unfortunately this film does not show the consequences of Pleasantville's new found freedom. Broken homes, shattered lives and a society doomed to disaster. Dont be fooled. This isnt a harmless fun flick. Watch the film then ask yourself, \\"Are these people really better off?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Morally bankrupt movie","review":"This movie's only plus is the cool use of color vs. Black and white. And I must say it accurately reflects the pervading values of our time. However, in the name of \\"tolerance\\" it totally lambasts anyone who has any moral convictions (like being true to your marriage or being honest). People with morals are portrayed (should I say, \\"betrayed\\"?) as being hateful, narrow-minded, and ignorant. The \\"heroes\\" are the ones who do whatever feels good to them at the moment, no matter who else it may hurt or what consequences there may be in the future. The worst things were: (1) The root idea for this movie is excellent-the experiences of people of the \`90s suddenly thrown into the society of the \`50s. This could have made for a very entertaining plot, without trashing moral values; and (2) The previews for this movie (unless I was sleeping when I saw them) gave me no hint of its real content. I was totally surprised when I actually watched it. I should have asked for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN UPSIDE DOWN \\"TRUMAN SHOW\\"!","review":"If you liked the old televised series \\"Twilight Zone\\" or \\"Outer Limits\\", you will enjoy this cleverly written movie. Two teens with the help of Don Knotts and a powerful remote enter Pleasantville, a town of simplicity and predictability where every thing is always the same. It never rains, the weather is always bright and sunny. It's the \\"Truman Show\\" in black and white until the teens unwittingly start to change things. People, roses, and landscapes become transformed in vivid \\"living color\\". There is an underlying message of the power of feelings, emotions, love and hate. The movie is entertaining, and once our time travelers have changed Pleasantville and learned some lessons themselves, they are faced with remaining forever in this enchanted town or returning to their own time. A fine cast makes it all believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantville","review":"I bought this DVD for my husband. He loves this movie and had been talking about it for quite a while. The fact that its in blu-ray really pleased him.Pleasantville is a cute / heartwarming movie. Its one that the whole family can enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film made no sense...","review":"I assume this film had a message, but I had no idea what it was. Color, then black-and-white... Joan Allen having an affair with Jeff Daniels, who plays a mildly-retarded malt-shop employee... Mr. Furley talking through the TV set, and so on. A lot of moviegoers liked it. A lot of critics liked it. I thought it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things are so much better now","review":"All the positive comments from folks on this blatantly propagandistic film reflect their relief that those bad old 1950s (of which they know virtually nothing) are gone and targeted for terminal mockery, since things are so much better now, what with one out of five babies aborted, a majority of children born out of wedlock, and drug abuse and violence the major concerns of high-school-age kids, instead of all the poodle skirts and silliness of Pleasantville.Wake up and smell the Prozac, lemmings: Technicolor-land is worse than Pleasantville, and no amount of clever revisionism is going to change it.This film is a mendacious little piece of half-ignorant fantasy, and thus nearly perfect entertainment for most contemporary movie-goers, who can't even find Asia on a map, and had to have the SAT dumbed-down to jumpstart their self-esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typically Liberal","review":"Real simple - Freedom of speech and ideas are wonderful, unless you happen do disagree with the Liberal point of view. Watch this video and read most of the 5 star Leftist reviews. Agree with them or keep your mouth shut! This is becoming a tired mantra."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the 1 star people, ya some odd things but it shows all that is human","review":"Yes, there is instances of sex, nudity, masturbation, violence, etc; But there is also talk of change, acceptance, growth, joy, sorrow, and much more.This movie shows everything that we as humans are, both the good and the bad and how we can and have grown from it. It is a beautiful and meaningful movie which everyone should watch more than once (the first time just to see the story, second time to understand it).To the people who give it one star, the ones who all say its all about sex, etc, come on! Look deeper, stop pointing out only what you want to see! If we didn't have our bad side we would never appreciate, well, anything, not our best friends, our family, God, life, or a simple flower from the one you love to cheer you up, negativity allows us to have all of those things and so much more and that is one of the few messages of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Thumbs UP!","review":"When I first began to watch this movie I thought it was going to be a real \\"oh let's go back to the good old days\\" moralizing yawner of a movie. I was exactly wrong. What a beautiful commentary on how the human spirit must express itself. In short, I love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"A wonderful and unique movie.It successfully takes the very difficult stand that complexity is more desirable than simplicity and predictability and endless \\"pleasantness\\".It also has wonderful acting, and delightful images all the way through.Don't miss this one. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made!!!","review":"Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon get zapped into the sweet 1950s sitcom \\"Pleasantville.\\" Everything is in black&white; and everything is perfect--if you shoot a basketball in the air, it will ALWAYS land RIGHT in the hoop, guarenteed. Everything works like clockwork--the father comes home from work and the mother has the dinner on time. Everyone repects each other. But once Reese & Tobey start interacting with everyone, that's when everything slowly becomes inperfect--and everything slowly changes to color.If you LOVE the 50s, you'll love this movie! The only thing I didn't like about it was when Reese Witherspoon kept dissing the styles of the 50s."},{"rating":"2","title":"If someone says this movie is bad, I hope they're joking","review":"Wow. This is a really good movie. Like everyone else, I have a billion reasons for saying so. Let's just go straight down the list. It's well thought out. The plot is pretty consistent and doesn't leave much out (except why David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are there in the first place). My favorite characters were David and Jeff Daniels's character, Mr. Johnson. I liked the courtroom scene (very affecting) and the fire in the tree.The movie reminds me a bit eerily of Lois Lowry's The Giver (was anyone waiting for me to mention that?). But only in a few ways: most notably, the color. All in all, I thought this movie was cool. It's turned into one of my favorite movies, as Tobey Maguire turned into one of my favorite actors. Rent it now if you never have. It's a true must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul is breath- takingly georgous","review":"Okay, I think that in the movie, Reese Witherspoon is to dramatic for the role she play. She is too shalaunt and trampy in the beginning, Paul looks great in whatever he does, so I loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty dang good","review":"First off, I just want to say that this movie was not what I had expected. The trailers presented \\"Pleasantville\\" as a cute (but rather brainless) fun-for-the-whole-family type movie. After seeing it, I realize that it's hardly that kind of film.I was very surprised when I finally saw the movie. The entire film is a metaphor for the way society is today, from people's prejudice to the need to be unique. On the whole, I thought the presentation was fresh and original, with a good storyline to boot.My only complaint was with the ending, which seemed to be tacked on as an afterthought. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as described","review":"Needed the connector for an old laptop where it was missing. Connector came in a padded envelope. Exactly what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dishes great","review":"I really like our new dishes. They are true to the picture displayed.The 4 stars are for the mugs. 16oz mugs are just to large and heavy for eveyday use. Hot drinks cool before you have a chance to finish them.

Promptly, the damages were reported; however, the replacement pieces have not arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a sequel. Literally!","review":"This effort, \\"Gates of Noon\\", is almost everything \\"Chase the Morning\\" was. In fact, replace a few names, reheat for a few minutes, and you have the same book.In both books, Steve Fisher is a Shipping Expert. He's a hollow, empty man who traded everything worthwhile to succeed in the business world. Then he stumbles across a gateway to the past, called the Spiral.Something important of his gets taken by denizens of the Spiral. Steve chases after them with help from others dwelling in the Spiral. Big sea battle, even bigger land battle, Steve wins, claims the lady fair, and on to a new and better life.It was an excellent read the first time around. Reading the same plot again with different names inserted is just plain tedious. Michael Scott Rohan needs an infusion of imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Cast Listing","review":"Beware! This is not the performance listed on the label. Opera D'Oro has it wrong. I did some searching around the internet and found others who have said the same thing. One believes this might actually be the Moscow Radio performance conducted by Gennady Rozhdestvensky."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Prokofiev thinking?","review":"This opera is based on the book by Dostoevsky, and explores the decadent world of gambling, a topic close to the Dostoevsky's heart, supposedly a compulsive gambler himself.The topic is an ugly one and it seems that Prokofiev went overboard trying to convey this ugliness. His characteristic playfully rhythmic dissonances are present but the sweeping lyricism is noticeably absent, with the exception of the opening orchestral music. Another \\"War and Peace\\" it's not. In fact, you might think of it as \\"War and Peace\\" with all the good parts cut out.In defense of this particular recording, the performers are good to excellent. The sound quality is fair.Being a fan of uncommonly performed operas, when a rare production of this came to the Met, I bought tickets to see it and then bought this CD to familiarize myself with the music. Having listened to it a number of times I traded in my tickets! Not \\"a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental fantasy that doesn't follow its own rules,","review":"which is a huge no-no for fantasy. The characters are not developed; they come from the reader's stock of stereotypcial caricatures. The story is completely predictable, esp. if you happen to look at the photographs before you read all the way to the end. It is not a completely unenjoyable read, but I would advise you to pick this one up at a used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love romance and adventure this is the book for you.","review":"Leprechauns is a wonderful touching book. The characters seem so real,and each word paints a beautiful picture. Mickey and Princess Jessica struggle to rise above their families ideas of the way they should live. Their love is so powerful it makes you stop and realize that love is strong enough to survive any obstacles thrown at you. I recommend this book to anyone who believes in romance,and happy everafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable, instructions not very good","review":"I found this to be very uncomfortable and the instructions that I received were very limited.

Watching it now, as a 35 year old, I still find it to be an entertaining science fiction film. The acting is nothing special and the lead character (David) can be annoying at time, as is Pee Wee Herman as the alien entity. And even though the science (including space time travel) is theoretically possible, the movie is a bit far fetched at times. However, it is a fun film that will capture your imagination, much like E.T. It's nice to see the occasional (rare) science fiction film that portrays alien species as \\"friendly\\" and not hostile aggressors looking to overthrow our planet.

As I got older I never knew if this movie was on DVD and when I was able to pick it up I did. Upon watching this movie, it was just like when I remembered it and I feel that this movie definitely aged well, at least to me it did. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has kids or just wanting to watch a movie from when they were growing up when I was.

All the actors do good jobs. The special effects are OK, but there is room for improvement. The plot is uncomplicated and not sophisticated.

John plays with unique passion and a stylistic, sincerely reverent nuance rare in most classical piano recordings today. Not since Glenn Gould have we had an opportunity to experience the Piano played with such expertise, finesse and grace (like Gould, I could swear I hear John singing along). More importantly Chopin's etudes have never been heard so brilliantly crafted or styled, to this listeners ear, ever. I am confident in saying \\"If he could hear his music, as it is played by John Rusnak, I know Chopin himself would have loved it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leading pianists offer greater enjoyment.","review":"Chopin's Etudes are widely regarded as among the most difficult works in the piano repertoire, and are a challenge even for accomplished concert pianists. If the performer cannot overcome the technical challenges, the musicality of these Etudes can be lost, and the listener will hear only technical struggles. My personal preference is for the flawless technique and interpretive mastery of such esteemed artists asMaurizio Pollini,Nikolai Lugansky, andMurray Perahia. It is only when performed by such superb musicians that the Chopin Etudes can be appreciated as some of the finest piano compositions of the 19th century. Nonetheless, I hope Mr. Rusnak will continue his admirable efforts, and will grow into a pianist of the stature to which he aspires."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect gift for those who can listen, but not see . . .","review":"I have found a perfect use for the soothing piano music on this CD. Two of my friends have recently lost their sight, and they find enjoyment in listening to such calming music. A gift such as this, while suitable for anyone who enjoys listening to good music, is a satisfying way to show care and concern for others in these circumstances. Thank you for sharing your talent, John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blasting it in my car..............","review":"I remember first getting this cd and playing it in my car. I was rivited in my garage until it was over. The fluidity of Rusnak's playing puts me in such an incredible eurphoric world. He takes this old hat and paints it with a whole new box of colors! I think his playing is amazing! I love the fact that it isn't edited, this adds warmth and realism to these pieces. I have listened to at least 6 other recordings of the etudes and this continues to be one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pianist with a Passion","review":"The talent and skill of John Rusnak is what every piano student should strive to attain. John Rusnak is a musician with technical skills, a great depth of musicality, and a passion for the classical. He is genius; he is true to the composed work, all the while losing himself within it. It is a blessing to hear him. This is a great album within a really great album cover! :) A perfect gift for anyone who has a love for piano performance, classical music, Chopin, perfection, or passion...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"healthy brazilian recipes","review":"I am native from Brazil like Ratto and have been living here for few years. I was happily surprised when I found out that this book contained few authentic Brazilian dishes. The way the author cook them, however, is not traditional, there are many susbstitutions and/or ingredients taken out of the recipes. I think that the taste of some dishes will be very different than the original ones. However, if I can help my countryman here, I have to say that the recipes are very creative, simple, and, without a doubt, a lot healthier than the ones I usually cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now for something really new.....","review":"This CD really brings out the great talent in Lynne between writing her own original songs and music.

I look forward to more in the future from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected.","review":"Well written? Yes. Erotic? Parts of it, yes.I found this story a study in dehumanization and cruel conditioning, replete with months of strict bondage, months of orgasm denial; withholding of affection or any sort of human connection, denying speech or language usage and turning this woman who wanted to be a submissive slave into less than a dog.I'm into BDSM, but not dehumanization and particularly NOT pony play. I'd like my money back because had I known this book was about the dehumanization process and strict orgasm denial I would NEVER have purchased it.Do you rate a book based on how it makes you feel?

I'm not sure but I'll never read this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my gosh, I've found some erotica that totally turns me off!","review":"Curiosity bit me on the butt with this one and I couldn't even finish reading it. But while it's not my cup of tea, it might be someone's. In a nutshell - if you are into hardcore humiliation, slavery, physical punishment, sexual torture and dehumanization - then this may float your boat. I on the other hand will go screaming off in the other direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't deliver","review":"I really liked this book's premise, but I'm sad to say it didn't deliver. I was warned that it wasn't a romance, so I read it as erotica. Unfortunately, I found the author's sex scenes lacking and just a notch higher than saying that the characters \\"had sex.\\"Though both the main characters were relatable, I couldn't muster up the energy to actually finish the book and ended my misery when I was up 68% on my Kindle. It was interesting to see the other pets' relationships with their masters and there is a subplot of another master's part ownership of a pet and for some reason, the sex seemed better there than for the two main characters. So, it wasn't like she couldn't write the sex scenes better, she just decided not to. I really didn't like this book, but for making the main characters relatable and real, I'm giving it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"Second copy to replace missing first one. This book contains everything from whips and chains all the way to cages, humiliation, pet and pony play and damn good sex!The difference in this book and regular adult books, Jacob gets right into the head of the submissive, feels what she feels and makes it ok to feel like that. Really good read, pure undiluted D/s, hardcore without being crude.

A couple of them lasted forever, but when the last one got crunched, I looked for something similar. This LOOKS right, but don't be fooled. It's useless. Here's the problem: though the clamshell fits together very tightly, it is FLEXIBLE. That means no matter how tight it fits when you close it, if it twists slightly, as it will almost immediately, it will open and dump its contents wherever. It is completely useless and should be withdrawn from the market. The manufacturers should be ashamed marketing this garbage, and please, anyone who sells it: don't. It's too cheap to return, but hopefully it can be recycled with a low carbon footprint. BUYERS BEWARE. Instead, buyIndestructo Pill Box - 6 Per Package.

Richard Baseheart is the potential jumper with an overbearing, neurotic Agnes Moorehead mother, a distant, alcoholic father, and an ex-girlfriend, Barbara Bel Geddes, whom he jilted because he knew he could \\"never make her happy\\". I wonder what his problem could be? Paul Douglas is good-as-usual as the traffic cop recruited into the role of crisis negotiator. Nicely skewers the ghoulish media spectacle that inevitably coalesces, but doesn't yell at us soulless masses in the way ACE IN THE HOLE does. Vignettes that spring up amongst the gawkers aren't terribly compelling, but still keep things from getting monotonous. Crisp NYC location shooting blends really well with the excellent model and matte work. Grace Kelly's and Ossie Davis' debuts. John Cassavettes, Brian Keith, and Janice Rule amongst the extras. Bel Geddes would be blacklisted till VERTIGO. 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense Docu-Drama","review":"This cinema-verite account of a man hovering on the ledge of a high story New York hotel works on all cylinders. Director Henry Hathaway masterfully weaves all the threads of the ensuing circus flawlessly. From the police operation, the media hordes, the curiousity seekers on the ground, and ultimately to the scenes on the ledge we are kept enthralled throughout. The film that this one brought to my mind is \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" in it's portrayal of a media circus. For this type of film to work there has to be a certain suspension of disbelief. Despite the presence of some well known actors(Paul Douglas, Richard Basehart, Agnes Moorehead, Barbara Bel Geddes, et al) we are so caught up in the emotions of the events that we are led to believe them as real people. Film is also of interest for some up-and-coming actors who blend seemlessly into the fabric of the film(Grace Kelly, Jeffrey Hunter, Ossie Davis, Harvey Lembeck). \\"Fourteen Hours\\" definitely rates as an unqualified success."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me stay focused","review":"This kept my interest to an extreme.

Their live shows were a swirling trip, with pulsating amoebae projected onscreen and the lead female singer dressed as a tree; no drugs were necessary. This particular album captured that feeling perhaps the best of any of their outings, with their cover of (appropriately) \\"2,000 Light Years From Home\\" as the major highlight.Perhaps, from a musical standpoint, it's good that they never made the \\"big time,\\" as we'd likely have seen a number of pale imitators.

How is it that an album so ground-breaking, so mind-blowingly brilliant has ended up out of print, with merely a few ragged used copies floating about? Is there no justice in this world? This is an example of '90s music that we should be putting atop a pedestal, resplendent for all to see (hear?). The music on this disc still sounds as impressively innovative and fresh as the first time i heard it. There is a dark, interstellar vibe running throughout this album, something which sort of ties it thematically together. It is at times very upbeat, other times nearly somnolent, sometimes completely space-tastic! It is a masterpiece of modern rock that transcends that genre without even trying.

None of these actors come close to playing hard-boiled, which is what this film sorely needed.

If you do know history, then it's safe to watch this as pure entertainment, which, as such, isn't half bad. Stone's purely speculative connections about Nixon's youth and his role in the Bay of Pigs are just that, so beware. I had to watch it over three days: it's pretty long.

While this passes with JQ Adams, Nixon is too recent and well known of an historical figure, one with a too pedestrian of an American plebian style to be credibly captured as someone cut from the cloth of a British patrician; indeed contemporary American politicians, to the extent that they don't embody this, conciously cultivate a \\"low caste\\" style as part of the political persona they market to the masses.

Regardless as to what one is, it is sad to see how Nixon went down. He was truly a humiliated and tormented man. Several of his cabinet members were fired or resigned. He mentioned to Henry Kissenger the fact that he was his only friend. He was reduced to dancing to the tune of unsavory characters.

Also, the instructor starts to tell you what you are doing so you are watching to get the counts and preparing to do the exercise but instead of doing the exercise she switches sides, so you have to stop rewind and try again.

Groves was a man of much more substantial girth than Newman. Newman's portrayal seems to be accurate in all the ways that matter, however.

The primary thrust of the story, the Centre is so poorly defined and explored that the second and third acts are just an unfocused mess that have no real impact. The end of the second act plays like the worst kind of anime - just a bunch of quickly cut action shots with little meaning.Worth a rental, I suppose, but definitely not worth the purchase price.

It's nice to see the Hal Jordan Lantern, too. But overall I was disappointed in the length of the film, most specifically it's brevity. And padding the disk with extra JLU episodes doesn't help, since the story itself is a total departure from the version depicted in the earlier JLA storylines regarding the formation of the league and the advent of the Watchtower. Not to mention that any self-respecting comic fan who would shell out their dough for this disk has the previous disks already, as a matter of course. Good for a rental only, unfortunately -for me, twenty-three bucks or so poorer- IMO. But Wonder Woman in combat boots almost makes up for it. Almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"mcoka1","review":"I don't recommend this as a purchase. I was dissapointed with this being the first High Def Justice League release.

Not only the story was very true to the original, but the art itself was also inspired by the comics. Darwyn Cooke assisted in the creation of the DVD, and the only thing that was missing from the story were subtle elements that were removed for the sake of length. Originally, the story was presented in a large multi-issue format, so a two-hour DVD could not have everything. I would definetly recommend this to fans of classic DC stories and to comic books fans. For Children, the action and subject matter may not be what is expected if they are used to watching other TV animation, but overall, it is a great classic superhero story. The special features on this set were detailed and gave a lot of background to the DVD. There is also a great Batman: Gotham Knight Preview as well. This is to be the prequel to the upcoming Dark Knight film."},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually liked this movie?","review":"In my honest opinion, this was a terrible movie.

Wow, excitement there.The PG13 is just another excuse for immature writers to justify using excessive blood and graphic language.WonderWoman lets people kill each other than has the audacity to criticize American government. LAME.The cynical self loathing attitude of this movie wears on you.The build up takes way too long.Not worth the hype, just boring lousy drawn anime with uneccesary blood and graphic words.I strongly recommend the Justice League episodes for that classic comic book feel and fun.Avoid this clunker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch this with your kids!","review":"I watched the the first 5 minutes of this with my 6 year old son, and I was treated to the images of the Green Lantern blowing the brains out of some North Korean soldier with a gun.

Highly recomend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the graphic novel, pass on the movie","review":"I loved the graphic novel, but the movie cuts much of the most interesting parts of the story--how superheroes would have influenced, and been influenced by events of modern history--and focuses instead on the weakest aspect of Darwyn Cooke's story--an enemy that frankly does not come up to the standards of classic Justice League threats.The animation is particularly disappointing. when the characters are standing still, they manage to convey the vitality of Cooke's original art, but that all collapses when they try to move. At least the Blu-ray disk includes some bonus episodes from the Justice League TV show, which are far superior to the main feature.Buy the graphic novel, but give the movie a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliff-Notes Justice League","review":"It's a bare-bones plot outline; not really a plot. It's almost like you're getting the highlights, because the scenes seem unrelated to each other. People come in, make cameos, and then disappear. No one really gets any screen time, including Bruce Timm's paramour Batman. Even Superman and Wonder Woman are barely in it and the Justice League is in it for literally a couple of minutes. Each hero is abruptly introduced (no back story) and then disappears.The fight scenes are stiff-looking, as is the animation. While the character design is OK, and the graphic quality is alright, it doesn't look any better than a TV episode. I expected something more, especially since it has to prop up such a thin \\"lurking evil that we never see and is easily defeated\\" plot. There's actually more plot in the ending montage than anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done, love seeing these characters treated so well","review":"Like others mention in their reviews for this item, these are the characters and heroes that I remember from my youth. While I appreciate the work that goes into the new versions of Justice League or the Batman animated series, the characters in New Frontier are closer to the classics I read and so thoroughly enjoyed in the past.The story here is a bit weak and convoluted in the villian that must be fought, but the animation is top notch, the characters come with the history that I remember and seeing them come together to work as a team is quite fun.I hope this is just the start of more stories set in the same era and virtual world.5 stars for the nostalgia, 3 stars for the story, leaving a 4 star product for those that want to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the problem with The New Frontier......","review":"The running time wasn't long enough The New Frontier's storyline was too extensive so the story couldn't be told effectively in a seventy-five minute time span...a two hour and thirty minute time span maybe but obviously seventy-five minutes wasn't long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest DC Universe animated movies EVER!","review":"This movie is arguably one of, if not THE, greatest DC Universe movies ever.

The Justice League Unlimited stories ranged from good to mediocre, but this is a step below that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I'd read","review":"I read great reviews about this and decided to go ahead and purchase it before watching, considering I'm a DC fan. The best part about this disk was the special features, which include an interesting history of DC. However, the movie itself was bad. It seemed to use mild profanity just to earn a PG-13 rating to attract an adult audience. I found the film to be quite childish, and, to be frank, cheesy. I thought it was a waste and maybe worth a rental just for the special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Timm let us down! :(","review":"This DVD was a big let down. The story lacked substance and had little action and the art was sub-par compared to earlier Justice League seasons. Example: Hal Jordan goes through the entire movie without being Green Lantern until the last 3 minutes of the movie. DC tried to relive the 50's with this one, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman look horrible. I wish they would put the time and effort into making a movie that continued the Justice League Unlimited timeline. Everyone loved those stories. I wish I had those two hours back... the three episodes of Justice League Unlimited are reruns from Season 1. Dark Heart, To Another Shore, and Task Force X.

Gone is the tapestry of characters interacting and growing with time, replaced by a spastic melange of mannequins roughly enacting scenes ripped straight from the comics with some minimal attempts to make then relate to each other through the use of heavy-handed exposition.It looked good (usually when the animation was taken directly from the comic) and the voice casting was a good fit (if a tad monotonous after a while) and there were some genuinely affecting sequences, but in the rush to condense things, the scope and soul of the source have been lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I'll give you this. The animation was nice. There was a nice cast. That was it. The plot was incredibly disappointing. I spent more time trying to figure out what each scene had to do with the overall plot than actually enjoying the flow of the movie. Every character had to be introduced with back story included and every character had to have his or her own showplace. Don't we already KNOW their backstories? Don't we already know what powers they have and what they can do? Do we need tacked on characters? Green Arrow, Robin, and Aquaman were just there for us to see how well animated they were and that was about it.

I was hoping to share this experience with my own children - I had hoped that they would love it and the superheros as did I when I was young. I found that only 2 minutes or less into the film - this animated cartoon - supposedly geared toward children, was really only a form of Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Combat set in superhero facade. It became graphically violent in mere seconds. Not for children by any stretch of the imagination. It does not even represent the true nature of the original episodes. I do not appreciate when cartoonists make movies based on loved characters that are twisted into a version of the new ultra-violent society we live in. If you are a parent - read this - do not let your children see this movie!

The voice acting was very poor. The name actors and actresses came across wooden and stiff. After the brilliant animated DC JLA series this was a true come down. The New Frontier comic book had its problems, Twenty-First century attitudes grafted on to the 1950s, but it was much better done than this. The villian was true to the type of end of world threats that the JLA did fight in its first incarnation, which is about the most that I can say for this mess, except for the hilarious Martian Manhunter watching TV scenes. Only for die-hard JLA collectors. Language and violence make this definitely unsuitable for kids. It is also too boring for the average kid. The JLA deserves a much better animated treatment than this drek."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ANIMATED VIDEO EVER!!!!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this - it is awful!

In a word: Ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast. Weak story. Weaker Animation.","review":"Lucy Lawless is a great talent for genre films. In general, there is some great voice direction and acting. The music composer did a great job with moving the film forward. It is too bad that these voices and music are giving life to a story with no \\"center\\". The subtext has a good morality play for our times, but this is lost among the mess. The saddest part is the lack of quality control on the animation. In one scene some detectives looked like they had no waists. My kids do better (they are young animators themselves). They consistently got things as basic as Superman's uniform wrong. A travesty.

The movie opens with a man shooting himself in the head, and then moves on to one of the to-be heroes killing what looks like a child soldier at close range. I'm all for intelligent plot lines aimed at a wider audience, however, you would think that the billions of dollars made by the Pixar films over the last decade or so would have convinced film makers that this can be done without making the movies inappropriate for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justice League New Frontier","review":"JL New Frontier seemed liked it was a rushed project.

Really this was just a bad idea that actually came out worse that I had thought it would. The original graphic novel is among the most overrated comics that I can recall. Its a tired, boring formula of going back reintroducing everyone in a different era with slight differences tossed in. Here you have literally no character development and just an empty headed mass villain mess for them to fight.I do like the way they did Wonder Woman and the Martian Manhunter but other than that the other guys are the same more or less (read less). The voice overs are not very good and the choices (outside of WW and MM which are both great) are nothing to write home about.They need to dig deeper and find better works to adapt or these direct to DVD movies will unfortunately die a quick death.

Take the PG-13 seriously. The movie opens with a man's suicide (by handgun). The final act is not shown, but it's clear what he is going to do with the gun. Several scenes are bloody. Sure it's cartoon blood, but it can be disturbing even for kids as old as ten. A few \\"son of a _____\\"s and some other choice language top it off.Otherwise, it has some nice moments, particularly some of the origin scenes for Silver Age Justice Leaguers. But overall, it lacks the charm of the TV series (and the series pilot had cooler aliens). Better than the Superman:Doomsday movie, but still not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"JL New Frontier - Nothing New","review":"I liked the JL series characters much better than the ones used in the New Frontier.Here is a comment to all animated series directors/producers: Could you please be consistent. In one episode, Superman is all powerful and almost nothing can hurt him, in another he is beaten easily; same for all the other characters. Also, the Superman series, the JL series, the Superman movies, the new animated Batman series, the old Super Friends series, and now the JL New Frontier movie, all have somewhat a different background story to tell about each of the characters, how they came to be, how the league started, who started and leads the league, etc. Finally, as for any Sci-Fi film, have you noticed that the good guys never add to their arsenals what they have learned from other encounters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The storyline was poorly implemented with too many unfinished elements running around to make a good movie.

Beyond the voice differences, the animation just wasn't as clean.Don't get me wrong, it was a decent hat-tip to the Golden/Silver Age artwork, but comic-book artwork has so seldom worked on in animation...which is why I liked the stylized Batman TAS, JLU type animation and artwork.

Voices don't fit the characters, underlying political statements, and a dull story don't add up to exciting superhero action. Letting them say mild cuss words doesn't make it more exciting or \\"adult\\" either. Yeah, slinging the SOB word REALLY advances the story there. I guess they thought the profanity would make it either \\"edgy\\" or maybe cover up the lackluster writing of the story.The only reason I gave it a 2 because the action scenes with the Flash were at least decent.

The voice talent here, seemingly upgraded from the regular actors from the regular series, is so lackluster. I like many of the actors, but found their voice acting to be so uninspired.Having watched this, I wondered what made Bruce Timm's original JL and JLU series so good. I think the answer is its concise format: each episode (or double ep) tells a story and gets out. \\"New Frontier\\" does in this movie format what perhaps Timm would do in the first and last five minutes of his episode(s).

Unless my unit was unusually noisy. this is the noisiest humidifier I've ever owned. The noise level was intolerable; especially for a bedroom. I had to rerun it after 1 nights use. Too noisy. I've had several \\"quite\\" humidifiers over the years -- this unit is definitely not qualified to fall into that category. I can't comment on the other qualities of the unit like humidification, as I didn't have it long enough. However, the tank size is nice and big, and easy to fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE--Product description is WRONG","review":"Product description for this model states that it has auto shut-off when the tank is empty. This is WRONG! I was so angry at getting YET ANOTHER humidifier that did not shut off, I called the company. Turns out they have DELIBERATELY REMOVED the auto shut-off feature. Yet, they do not describe this in their literature, and the description given to retailers (amazon.com is certainly not responsible for the text) is clearly wrong -- and has been so for YEARS.So be aware that you can't leave this humidifier alone for long without getting dry, dirty air out of it. Depending on your reason for needing a humidifier, this could be a real problem.What a lousy, incompetent company! The warranty is worthless as well, judging by the comments of others below."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your time","review":"The 1st one I brought a week later, the fan was not working right. I pressed the low button and the air was on high, and if I had the air on medium it turned on low. When I had it on high, the fan just shut off. So I returned the item, and decided to get the same one, 2 months later it's the loudest thing in the room. It make such a bad sound,I couldn't sleep either my husband, and he's a good sleeper. My baby was up too! Now I don't even have the receipt to return it. So save your time and don't even think about buying this item. Big mistake"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell Cool Mist Humidifier","review":"My husband and I very pleased the way this product works.My only complain is the filter.It got dirty and we tried to wash it but did not come clean. Does this filter have to replaced every month or so?It does a great job pumping cool mist into our living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 4 gallons........","review":"I wanted to get a humidifier that I didn't have to keep filling up everyday. Well the description said 4 gallons! and I modified my search for 4+ gallon capacity . I only hold 1 gallon of water and now....great I have to fill it 2 or 3 times a day. Not happy... I think I should return it. and get the 99$ Honeywell instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The motor burned up after a week.","review":"I'm so disappointed. I've used the warm air humidifiers by Honeywell and changed because of the kids and dogs. The unit is a nice size and worked well. But after a week the motor died. I came home to a burning smell coming from the unit. I'm hoping that it was a fluke but I don't think ,y husband will get another one. The hot air ultrasonic worked for 4 years and it kept the rooms warmer when the does we're closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool vs Hot","review":"Bought as a replacement for a Honeywell \\"QuickSteam\\" model as the water container had cracked and then leaked. HCM645 is labeled as \\"QuietCare\\" Cool Mist, but the fan is very loud at all speeds. Also seems to vaporize about half the water the \\"Quicksteam\\" model did. The good news is that the water container is the same for both, so I now can use it on the older \\"QuickSteam\\" model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hcm 645","review":"I have two other portable humidifiers from diffrent manufacturers.Do not waste your money. Altough the design is nice, this machine is to loud even on lowest setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 4 months of use","review":"4 months old, $10 for return warranty shipping? Oh yeah, plus at least $10 to send it in. My ex wife had one of these that died after a year, this one didn't even last that long. Save your money - buy a big stock pot and stick it on the stove. JUNK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no warning when no more water","review":"When there is no more water in the humidifier, the humidifier does not stop so it appears that there is still water. The older models would stop as to let you know that you had to fill it up. Everything else is great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy","review":"We purchased this humidifier about a year ago from Home Depot for our toddler's bedroom. I could not even stand to hear it on the baby monitors let alone sleep in the same room with it. It is very noisy and the motor rattles terrible. We spent upwards of 60.00 for this machine thinking it would be a better one than from Walmart but much to our surprise it's not! I still have my receipt and would love to send it back but I surely would not want a replacement. My husband and I have a Bemis humidifier in our room that is now 12 years old and is run everyday and it's still going strong and quiet as can be.... I would have purchased another one like it but you can't find that one anymore. So I guess the moral to the story is I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Trouble","review":"I can't believe all the good reviews I read because I had so much trouble with this item. I returned the first one because it leaked before I had ever used it. I found the cleaning process to be awkward because I used the item in the bedroom and the bathroom sink was too small to clean the chamber efficiently. The company did replace my leaky one and after I had cleaned the replacement one, and before I had even used it, which is required, I filled it with water and it was so heavy and difficult to hold it slipped from my grasp and the plastic water chamber cracked against the sink. Luckily it didn't damage the sink, but needless to say I was quite angry. After having 2 of these items, I never even got a chance to find out how well they worked. I threw the second one out and never applied for a refund but I was left with a negative feeling toward this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine For Me","review":"We bought this humidifier about 3 months ago because our bedroom was becoming so dry that we were waking with dry throats, bloody noses, and so on. This machine has solved that problem and we have encountered no significant difficulties with it. It is not too difficult to maintain, and the only problem in that area is locating filters in local stores, although Amazon and other online retailers carry them. (I do wonder why the tank always leaks water at exactly the moment I move it over the machine, but not before; I can't figure it out but there must be a reason why this happens). Re: Mold. Apparently the person who complained of mold didn't realize the filters should be changed regularly, frequency depending upon the quality of your water supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and effective","review":"It really is quieter than all other units I've had, eg., Hunter, Holmes, other Honeywells, and it puts out moisture faster than the others as well. It has a different design from cheaper models and seams to be made of a better grade of plastic. Most importantly, it does a reasonable job of keeping a 1200 SF apartment comfortable. After Super Saver shipping (2 days for me), I'm plenty satisfied with this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, Leaky, and Moldy","review":"It's loud, like being in a cheap hotel, we can't sleep with it on at night. Leaky, the tank is always leaking, when we fill it up. Moldy, the filter gets mold 1-2 weeks after we put a new one in. It is now in the trash. Save your money buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as anticipated","review":"I recently purchased a Honeywell \\"Quietcare\\" Humidifier HCM645. But it is not quiet at all. It occasionally has a rattling noise, and the fan is quite loud. I have portable fans that are quieter than the fan in this Humidifier. I probably should have returned it, but I suspect another one would be just as noisey. Plus, since it's washed, set up and full of water, to return it and prepare a new one would be a lot of work. Now I have also discovered that it needs the filter changed once a month, at a cost of $12.99 each plus shipping. Also they recommend a cleaning cartridge, which is not included and is another expense. I would never buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusably noisy","review":"I read the other reviews that complained about the noise of this \\"Quiet Cool\\" humidifier. I thought, heck, I like white-noise sounds, I won't mind this. Or maybe the reviewers are being unreasonable.No. Really. This unit is absurdly loud. And I've had several other Honeywell-aka-Kaz units in the past.Otherwise, the operation is fine - easy to fill and use. Straightforward controls. I never have the problems others seem to have with mold on the filter, likely because I run it until the tank runs out and periodically let the filter dry out completely. (And I change the filter every 6 weeks.)I bought this for my daughter's room, but we will only be able to use it during the day, it's just too loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item","review":"Thanks for sending the wrong item with a much lower value..

Having this product for about a month now, i finally opened it. I dont think the fact that i had it for a month should affect the product at all. this product is like WATER. it is NOT the real biosilk, OR it is terribly watered down. In any case it is not what the REAL BIOSILK is at all. the REAL Biosilk is very thick and viscous. It is slippery and leaves a coating on your hands when poured.

It's very expensive and I don't see why. It's not exactly like other products on the market but there are similar ones. Pantene sells a silk product and it's cheap and garnier fructis sells a product with some of these ingredients for much less. I do like this product though. It smells great and gets the job done. It does last a very long time, but so does the gargier fructis product under their sleek & shine line, its called weightless anti-frizz serum. I don't think the garnier fructis product smells as great biosilk though. I probably will buy it again because like I said, nothing else is exactly like it. When I use it I get all sorts of compliments about my hair like \\"Your hair is like Barbie hair!

My hairdresser used Sabino Moisture Block on my hair about 3 years ago and I instantly fell in love with it. It is like Biosilk but it is lighter and makes my hair incredibly shiny and soft with staying power. The bottle is smaller but you don't have to apply as much as you do for Biosilk. I like to apply a tiny amount to dry hair, friends always make comments on how shiny my hair is. The only reason I would consider Biosilk is if they ever stopped making Sabino it costs $20 here on Amazon and it is worth twice that amount because it lasts a looooonnnggg time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is not ORIGINAL!!!!!!!","review":"First time I ordered this product in Amazon coz I have very good experience with Amazon, but for this product I am not even ready to give one star for this product.

And the smell doesn't go away. If you put it on in the morning, you can smell it all day into the evening and I am sure others can to. If you don't like the smell of cheap perfume or cologne, you probably won't like this.Second, it doesn't do anything in terms of conditioning or moisturizing hair. I noticed no difference, positive or negative, after putting it on consistently.Third, it is greasy and annoying to have in your hair unless you are used to it.Overall, I recommend a good conditioner instead. If you want leave-in treatment, try Infusium 23 Leave-In Treatment (which is much lighter, minimal fragrance, and actually conditions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biosilk","review":"I think this stuff is a great product.

I want a full refund.UPDATE: Seller basically said 'sorry about that' and they said they do check to be sure things are sealed etc before they go out ... so I guess according to them, I the customer am a liar.

I attributed it to my age...I turned 40....thought maybe my hair was just changing. Then recently I figured it out because I could smell the alcohol.

I've used the biosilk serum for two years, and I really like it! :)Additionally, it's delivered in a day!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album was boring and bland. I bought it because I very much liked Conjure One's first album (I thought it sounded similar to Balligomingo's Beneath the Surface- somewhat pop, but very melodic and soothing too), but this album wasn't nearly as good. 'Endless Dream' is the only good song, and maybe 'Extraordinary Way'. The rest aren't bad, but aren't interesting, either. I reserve this album for background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment from the first album!","review":"I must admit to being an obsessed Delerium fan. When the first Conjure One album was released, I was reasonable pleased with the direction I felt the artist was headed.Bought the second and was totally disappointed - nothing \\"magic\\" in this one! Didn't even live up to being just another Delerium theme work, fell far short of that AND offered nothing in the line of growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"In so many ways a genius delight; rhythm, voices, synths, oriental, dreamy, invigorating, joyful and ethnic.Looking forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinarily good!","review":"If you have enjoyed Delerium then you are pretty much guaranteed to like this album. I have always liked Delerium but my only complaint with their style is it's \\"relentlessly upbeat drowning in sugaryness.\\" Yes, you will find Conjure One to be a bit faster and darker in some corners, which is a good thing - you can't enjoy the light without some darkness to define it, right? All the better to trance and dance too...Extraordinary Ways has wonderful vocals, lush orchestrations (listen to Pilgrimage a few times and it's Delerium deja vu all over again, but with a wonderful dark twist), and excellent engineering that left me feeling very satisfied that I found a few new \\"five star\\" tunes for my iPod.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe is the genius, conjure one is filler.","review":"The songs in which Poe participates are SO much better than the rest of the album that they are not even comparable. I feel bad for her that she has to team up with mediocre people just to get produced, but I am grateful that she gets the opportunity to put out some material and I am grateful to conjure one of that. Don't get me wrong, conjure one is not bad, but they just don't do anything of note by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, what happened to Rhys?","review":"Ok, if you started out - like me - and really liking Delerium (old to new) and then expecting when Fulber split from the group to make some awesome CD's, think again. I don't know why he thinks this music is popular, cause it's not. Singing in every track. No ambience. I guess Delerium is pretty much dead.Of course, I have a lot of respect for Rhys, for his musical genius over the years, and I thought these tracks might have some sections between the singing like great rythmic buildups, but there's nothing. Just painful singing... and the people who sing are wannabe singers, nothing compared to the likes of Sarah McClauchlin and Kristy Thursk (sorry if mispelled).Listen to the tracks on Amazon before you buy. It's really helpful that Amazon provides the samples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chimera revisited","review":"Being a huge fan of the first Conjure One CD (it's still in my car's changer), I was excited when heard about this CD. That is, until I listened to it. Just like Chimera, this CD went the way of boring, uninspired and unoriginal pop garbage. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding second album from a great Delerium off-shoot","review":"Although the tribal/mystical beats from Conjure One's first album are less apparent on Extraordinary Ways, Poe's vocals still make an amazing overlay to some great electronic music. It's different from the first album; I would say the first was certainly more original and eclectic, but this is a great follow up. Make sure you pick up their first album as well as Delerium's Karma, Poem, and Chimera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting projects but autonomous robots is still too slow to action as atheletes!","review":"I got this book 1 or 2 months ago. But I might read it only one page because I have collected at least 380 textbook in my library! But this book has some interesting issue for me at least the name of the book which is the latest research direction for robot which can be acted as human but it may be too slow to perform useful task for real human. From my recognition this book has no mathematics exercises but it may be hidden in text somewhere in the book.I hope that sometime I might interest to read at least 1 or 2 page per day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Street","review":"When I opened this and watched it for the first time, it was not what I expected. The moves are definitely street/urban and look good when done on a music video. But doing this as a part of an exercise routine, not as exciting. Also not as good for breaking a sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good for a workout.","review":"First of all, I LOVE MaDonna Grimes. Her personality is fun, and she is a fabulous choreographer. However, this DVD should not be called a workout. It's more about learning to street dance. There are seven 8-counts in the routine, and MaDonna teaches them in a way that is not cardio. She slows it WAY down to teach it to you, then gradually speeds it up. Meanwhile, there is NO music going in the background. Eventually she turns on music and you do this 8-count really fast for about 3-4 minutes which does elevate the heart rate before she slows it WAY down again to teach you the next 8-count. MaDonna is friendly and the choreography is really 90's street. I love the choreography and MaDonna, I just do not feel that this is a sufficient workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thoroughly substandard guide","review":"I bought this guide for my son as a gift, and have since received nothing but complaints from him in europe. He says that for reliability, insight, quality of maps and other information, his firends' guides are far superior. He asked for the Lonesome Planet, but on the salesman's recommendation, I chose this one instead. A mistake, I've learned. Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the tried and trues!","review":"Anyone who wants to try to write a guidebook has a high standard to meet. The old reliables (which will go unnamed here) are just super-dependable and well-researched. This book, as I know unfortunately now from experience, feels like a slap-dash job. Using no other guide book -- not even an out-dated Let's Go -- have I run into as many mistakes, bad judgments and outright false leads as I did using this one. I only travelled to eastern europe and greece, so I don't know about the sections on france, spain, england, etc. But a book not written by pros (and one glance at the authors' bios will show you this one was not) ought to come with some sort of disclaimer. At least Let's Go uses Harvard kids. I will be writing a letter of complaint to the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairly repetitive and often offensive book","review":"This book makes jocular mention of Hitler's regime. It compares modern German police to Hitler's SS and further insults Germans and other nationalities. I find the book offensive and inappropriate. When it isn't making my blood boil, it's a hodge-podge of useless name-dropping and erroneous information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great picture, poor sound","review":"I bought this DVD to branch out from the popular WAVES series, of which I own the \\"Hawaiian Dreams\\" & \\"Hawaiian Zen\\" discs. Compared to these videos, \\"Soothing Waters - California and Oregon\\" offers superior picture quality and more frequent cuts from scene to scene.However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the audio quality detracts significantly. Wind noise is prominent; anyone who has ever made a home movie outdoors with an inexpensive video camera knows this disturbing, thunder-like rumbling all too well. I can also attest to the fact that, at least with a decent audio setup, cars and people can clearly be heard in the background.This would be a great disc, if only the audio were as professional as the video. As it currently stands, I would recommend the WAVES Virtual Vacation series videos instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointed","review":"I bought this DVD based on the high recommendations of the other reviewers. All I can say is that I was very disappointed in the quality of the video. I wanted something that would look beautiful on my 61 inch Samsung. Almost all of the shots seem to be slighly out of focus, as if they were shot with a cheap camera with a poor lens. I compared this DVD with various beach scenes in movies I have and the scenes in the movies look a lot better! Sure, they use high end film Panovision cameras, but that is the quality I was hoping for. This DVD will be in my next garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Relaxing DVD I Have Seen - Very Special","review":"This DVD is flat beautiful and I love it. The gorgeous scenes and great sound make me want to go back and sit beside the ocean again. The experience is just what I can remember when I visited the coast a few years ago. It just seems to melt my stress and tension away.And talk about relaxing. I have to remember not to watch it too early in the evening, or my wife has to nudge me to wake me up to keep her company (she hates it when I go to sleep when she's trying to talk at me.) The scenes may be the prettiest ocean scenes I have ever seen. This is the only DVD in my collection that I watch again and again, just like you never get tired of a beautiful painting. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also Disappointed","review":"The video quality is passable, but the sound is muddied and is often marred by low frequency rumbles from wind hitting the microphone. You'd be better off listening to a crashing waves CD and closing your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found after a long time of searching","review":"Long time ago I saw this album at a lokal music store. Short of money I decided not to buy it. One week later the cd wasn't there anymore. The store keeper had never heard of it. Island records germany didn't know anything about it. Now I found it after searching for several years.This live album of drivin 'n' cryin marks the most powerful time of the band. Rock dominates for heavens sake country and other influences of Kevin Kinney and co. I saw the band in that period in Essen, Germany. It was a great concert and so I'm glad to get a \\"document\\" of their glory times."},{"rating":"1","title":"You said that before. A few times","review":"Although rich in description and detail (and complete with many wonderful images) the writing was, at times, rather poor. Worse, it was repetitive. The author described a scene in a film in the chapter \\"The Artist,\\" and then described it in the same way in the chapter specifically dedicated to that film. THEN, if the scene was similar to one in another film, the author felt the need to describe it once more, as if the reader were too stupid to remember. Additionally, he often made a scant reference to piece of information that could have added to the topic being examined, but instead of briefly detailing it, he simply mentioned that it was available in another book. (This might have been excusable once, but he did this multiple times!) He was dedicated to his subject, having quoted interviews he conducted, etc, but the book would have been much better if he had been even half as devoted to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I enjoyed all of Clark Cable's movies. They don't make men like that anymore it's a delight to see them reproduced."},{"rating":"2","title":"clark gable collection","review":"The main reason for ordering this collection was to get The Tall Men, my husband actually went to see this movie in 1959 and never forgot it, and since then has always spoken about trying to find it. So we are really pleased with this selection, and has certainly made his day to receive it and watch it, and enjoyed it once again.Thanks to Amazon it has been possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"anamorphic or not","review":"Seeing as 20th Century Fox is advertising The true Story of Jesse Jaemes in its upcoming release in March as 1.33 ratio I would like to know from anyone if The Tall Men and Soldier of Fortune are Anamorphic as the info on here states all 3 films are 1.33. I collect all CinemaScope films from 1953 to 1967 but why does Fox have to release in 1.33?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Splatterpunk, anyone?","review":"A word of explanation: splatterpunk is a term for horror that relies heavily on blood and gore to make up for its other deficiencies. In the case of this book, the deficiencies include plot, character development, and overall writing skill. The cumulative effect was not fear, but nausea. This book is \\"scary\\" in the same way the 11 o'clock news is scary. If you enjoy stories about children and animals being mutilated and killed, then by all means order a copy. Fans of good horror fiction, ex. King, Koontz, Straub, Lovecraft, should pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Book","review":"I bought this book thinking that while I don't think he's the world's greatest horror novel writer, he has good \\"punchline ideas\\" and that short stories would be perfect for him. Unfortunately I'm very dissapointed. What it comes down to is that a large portion of the stories make no sense! They wander here and there and taper off to an ending that's not really an ending. I feel like he took general ideas, made them as gruesome and possible and felt no need to actually base them around a real story. They honestly make no sense some of them. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Collection is in my collection, but I never finished it.","review":"A friend gave this book to me with a very positive recommendation. I will preface this review by mentioning that we are avid Bentley Little readers and find his particular brand of horror/humor very amusing. I own many of his books including \\"Dominion\\" and \\"Dispatch\\" two ridiculous but very intriguing stories.While I love this author's ability to spin a unique and captivating tale, I must admit that the actual quality of his writing is often hideously poor. (ex- using phrases like \\" he stared deadly at it\\") The short stories don't have the ability to build interest like some of his novels, and therefore, without the development and suspense, are pretty boring. I read full force for a few chapters, then began to skip around, finally putting the book down unfinished; something I never do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop comparing him to Stephen King, he is better!","review":"I was suprised by the short stories I just read. I just finished The Collection by Bentley Little. This was my first exposure to the author. He is one demented person. I love it! everyone compares him to Stephen King and I say he is ten times better than the master of redneck...um..er.. macabre..Mr. Little at times can be boring and too historical, but when he is in top form, he can blow your mind away. His ideas are very original. One can only imagine where he comes up with these delightfully macabre tales. Recommended must-read stories in this book include The Woods Be Dark and The Sanctuary. I guarantee once you start reading this book you will be hooked. great for late night reading. Guaranteed chills!! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"How disappointing! For a Bentley Little fan, this book left much to be desired. After reading The Store, and The Return I figured just about anything he wrote should be golden - not true. Mediocre stories - not scary, not particularly horror filled, or even interesting - some plain flat out stupid! I would not recommend this book even to the most die-hard fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anything can and will be printed","review":"I picked this book up and read the first two stories. Like tasting food that turns out to be a stomach-churner, you don't need more to make a judgement call. Note that my copy cost me 10 cents - hardcover in new condition gained from a local book sale. Maybe the folks who process my recycled paper will have a use for it. I honestly got my dime's worth. But I need to cut my losses, and avoid giving it any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here beyond shock value","review":"Another review here lambasts people for comparing Little to Stephen King, and that is a sentiment I greatly agree with - for entirely different reasons. King is a wordsmith whose work should be recognized as true literary art outside of the realm of strictly 'horror' fiction; Little's work is hackneyed and pure pulp, trumped up for shock value with very little beneath imagery used more to appall the reader than anything else. Each story in this collection can be likened to a low-budget horror B-movie: violence, gore, and very little plot worth noticing. Absolutely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, in so many ways.","review":"The other negative reviews get the main point across on why this book is so bad. What irritated me even further were the \\"Little\\" opinions he wrote before each story. Save your politics for another time. I read for enjoyment, not to get lectured on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"The first story in this collection was enough to nauseate me. A young boy is murdered by having a shovel blade jammed in his back--sick enough for you? If you're the type of creep who enjoys \\"writing\\" like that, this is the book for you. If you're part of the 99.9% of humanity that would be repelled by stories such as this, save your money.For a decent horror collection that won't make you want to throw up, get Stephen King's \\"Night Shift\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Short Story Collection Since NIGHT SHIFT","review":"Bentley Little proves once again why he is the best horror writer working today. These 32 stories effectively showcase his incredible range, from quiet horror like \\"Monteith\\" to the hardcore splatter of the edgy \\"Llama\\" to the unclassifiable weirdness of \\"The Man in the Passenger Seat.\\" This guy can do it all! Perhaps most of interest to his fans are the short introductions which precede each work and explain where the author got the idea for each piece. A must-read for all serious horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little indeed","review":"i can only put it this way: i didn't get it. the style was so shallow, the psychology awful, the descriptions too bad, the way that the happenings were described made it so little credible (i never bought the people's actions). worst of all: the plots were poor, or weren't really plots in the common sense at all, or was unrecognizable as plots because they were so standard stuff. i mean: the mother is a killer. the boy thinks about killing her. and, surprise: HE KILLS HER. truly amazing! and considering the other flaws described above, the story is so uninteresting"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Bill Wilson...","review":"Little goes for cheap thrills to divert your attention from his lack of talent. The plots are weak, and most of these stories seem like something a freshman would turn in for an intro to creative writing course. I paid [$] at a used book store and still feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star, but only because I had to","review":"I had actually read 3 of Little's novels previously - The Walking (pretty cool), The House (eh),and Dominion (Cheesy but readable). I was not a Little fan, but I could read him in a pinch. His style is mildly irritating (stilted, but readable), and his gratuitousness seems to know no bounds (Dominion, especially). But this collection has actually made me opposed to Little and his work on a cosmic level. I read this directly after reading \\"Everything's Eventual\\" and I can only compare the juxtaposition of experience to be like listening to a Britney Spears CD on the heals of listening to the Beatles. I have no idea why this man gets such high praise. It reminds me of horror written by someone who has seen Killer Klowns a thousand times, but has never read The Shining. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. The plots are not just ridiculous, but someone needs to tell him that every quirky idea that enters the brain is not necessarily a good idea for a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE HORROR????","review":"THIS BOOK IS GOOD IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FEW LAUGHS.

I've never had anything like it before, and enjoyed it a lot on the first two bags. However, six bags of it was a bit much for us - we wished we had a more standard flavor (e.g. Parmesan garlic). Also, they were a bit too salty for me over time, though I generally think this about chips. Summary: Great new and interesting flavor, but not an plain everyday chip - worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Surgeon of Crowthorne","review":"An incredibly serendipitous account of how the Oxford English Dictionary came to fruition after years of dedicated hard work by an army of voracious readers and word lovers.Most importantly, Winchester tells the tale of Dr W.

Even the best ones need occasional cleaning and lubricating, and this is no exception. I've found that a small amount of basic oil (WD-40) works great, when used carefully. If you don't mistreat this thing, It'll last forever. I've been using this one for almost a year now, on a daily basis, in huge yard wars. It mean that this thing has literally shot tens of thousands of times, and it's just as reliable as it was when I first purchased it. Take it from an expert; this is a very good budget gun. It's reliable, powerful, pretty accurate, and will never jam, for as long as you take good care of it.Also, I want to note that when people complain about jamming or accuracy, it's generally due to low quality of the plastic ammo. If you use cheap ammo, any airsoft gun will stop being good. Get some good ammo, and this gun will perform admirably.

Pollyanna's parents taught her to play \\"the glad game\\". In this game you look for the good, the positive, the beautiful, etc. in situations that at first seem very negative, or undesirable. There is always something good to be seen and gained from our negative life experiences. This version of Pollyanna is older, but really well done. We have also seen the newer version, and liked it very much as well. The two versions are different in the way Pollyanna's story is told, but the same in terms of the message. Both are very much worth watching - totally wholesome and safe for family entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollyanna","review":"We are in the process of updating our collection of Disney movies to DVD.

It wouldnt play on my dvd player - it comes up with an error message saying \\"wrong code\\" . sigh.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is 100 times better...","review":"The book is a beautiful piece of literature. There is true \\"gladness\\", purity, and depth of characters. The movie shares the same names for the characters and overarching plot. That is where the similarities end. Instead Disney has changed personalities, relationships, and other such alterations. I guess true beauty isn't very \\"movie worthy\\" because there is less scandal.(you won't be disappointed with the book!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the story of Pollyanna","review":"I was horrified when I saw this movie version of the book. They changed everything about the characters except their names. Yes, Pollyanna is glad, but it fails to capture the essence of her struggle to be glad when she is faced with so much adversity. Miss Polly is not ruthless and conniving and does not influence the town as depicted in the movie. She is struggling herself, which is where Pollyanna comes into the picture. My children were flabbergasted at seeing this film. They knew the characters and these were *not* them. The plot is so skewed that you will miss it if you see this film. Do yourselves a favor and get the BBC version, or better yet, read the book. It is truly a delightful story that you will cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching, Moving Film!","review":"When \\"Pollyana\\" came out in theaters in 1960, I went to see it with the other neighborhood kids. I was a boy of 9 at the time, and didn't think too much of it.Seeing it again as an adult, the emotional depth of it hit me very hard. You have to live a lot of those things yourself in order to appreciate them. It's no corny cliche that love has the power to transform the lives of people it touches.Pollyana did nothing more than give her own simple kindness to the townspeople, and many of them were quite taken aback at it. But it wasn't wasted. The townspeople thronged back to Pollyana in gratitude when she needed them most. It moves me to tears. All the actors make it a believable, special story.By all means, show this DVD to the kids. But don't forget that it contains a lot of good things for adults, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a darling movie!","review":"This movie is so good! I thought no movie could be better than those of Shirley Temple, and I was always hoping a film similar to Heidi would be released. Luckily I found \\"Pollyanna\\" on DVD. Wow! I sort of pushed my Shirley Temple gift set near the back and brought forth my new Vault Disney DVD collection. Pollyanna is very similar to Heidi and I recommend it to fans of that movie. This movie is about a little orphan girl-Pollyanna-who is sent to live with her strict aunt. Everyone in the town is always grumpy, but Pollyanna teaches them her \\"glad game\\" and makes everyone lovable and cheerful. Only at the end of the movie when a terrible tragedy takes place, does everyone realise how much they appreciate Pollyanna. A wonderful family film that isn't only for children, but for adults too. The DVD comes with lots of documentaries, interviews, pictures, and some music too! Even a commentary! Trust me, fans of Shirley Temple may also appreciate Hayley Mills too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollyanna","review":"Great family movie and I recommend it for family movie libraries.

The Glad Game is not a game -- it's a way of life, a positive attitude. When young Pollyanna and her father were disappointed that the package from a missionary relief organization contained not a doll but crutches, they determined they would find something to be glad about. After a bit of thought, they decided to be glad they didn't NEED the crutches! At the end of the show, though, when Pollyanna is unable to walk due to an injury sustained falling from a tree, you have to think she would have been glad to have had those crutches."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"IF YOU LOOK FOR THE BAD IN MANKIND YOU WILL SURELY FIND IT!\\"","review":"I had never seen this movie until recently. When I saw the running time was almost 2 1/4 hours I was a little leery, but I gave it a shot. This film is one of the least corny Disney films I have ever seen. The story of a young girl who is orphaned and comes to live with her rich aunt. The effect this upbeat child has on her aunt and the townspeople is very positive brings the townspeople together. This is a very good film and I would recommend it for family viewing. The 2 disc vault collection has a great transfer and a ton of extras! I would like to point out that some of these Disney releases have included the original cartoon short that aired with the picture in theaters. This is a trend I hope other studios follow! Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glad movie","review":"If you have never seen Pollyanna you are missing a treat. Pollyanna, an orphaned girl, breathes life and fun back into her mother's home town. With her Glad Game where she finds something good in everything (even when the worst happens) she brings smiles and joy to the hearts of viewers. This is a wonderful movie for families to watch and has a wonderful message of hope even in the most trying circumstances. I highly recommend parents watch this with their children. It will bring a smile to their faces and laughter to their lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollyanna - the movie vs Pollyanna the book.","review":"Have been reading \\"Pollyanna\\" to my granddaughters 7 and 10. They were loving the story but didn't relate to the era so sourced the movie to give them an idea. Unfortunately it didn't follow the book very well, but all in all they recognised most of the characters and the settings, clothes and day to day life of Pollyanna really came to life. As a standalone movie though the whole theme of \\"the glad game\\" and finding good in everything rings as true now as it did when I first saw the movie as a 10year old.

The amazing process where Southerners again deluded themselves into thinking that the Civil War was not about slavery but independence is adequately detailed. It is not also made particularly clear that what most people in the CSA were considering was really the exchange of slavery for serfdom.

Don't miss it this holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Underrated Christmas Movie","review":"Whether it was because of a low budget or lack of major Hollywood star power, the writing and acting in this movie is phenominal and really hits you every time you watch it. I know that every year when I watch around the beginning of December, it always gives me that warm feeling.Must have for any Christmas movie lover. Harry Deen Stanton is brilliant and really lets you believe he is an angel. Mary Steenburgen plays her stubborn best and it really gets you yelling at the scream, \\"BELIEVE!!!!\\"The kids are great and take on very emotional roles and you believe them.Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story for the whole family to enjoy!","review":"I love this film! I think that financial and parental obligations can cause Christmas to be a very stressful time for many people. The main character, played by Mary Steenburgen, is a very unhappy person. She is obviously in a rut and the fact that another Christmas is coming, with all that entails, is not helping. This is a great story about seeing what you have, instead of what you don't. It is very emotional, as fairy tales are, and has a wonderful moral. It is heartwarming and appeals to the child in all of us. My family and I watch it every year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My children laugh...my husband sighs...","review":"but I simply HAVE to watch (what my teen-aged daughters dubbed, \\"Kids Fall in the River and Drown\\") this movie every single Christmas. I know of no better movie to imbue one with the true thankfulness and appreciation that is the Christmas Spirit than this gritty, occasionally depressing, but ultimately redemptive and glorious film.Some years we watch with too much empathy (years when we've faced financial insecurity or lost loved ones). Other years we watch with abundant gratitude and happiness (so thankful we're safe, warm, secure and surrounded by each other). Whatever the case, whatever the situation, however much my long-suffering family rolls their eyes as I produce this film, we always, always end up teary-eyed, filled with love and hope, and totally, completely satisfied we've had one MAGIC Christmas experience.I'm going to buy the DVD to replace my VHS, so I can continue to \\"inflict\\" this classic on my family for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie made my husband cry and that's not easy to do.","review":"This is my all time favorite movie and I have been trying to purchace a copy of it for three years now and no one seems to have this movie in stock. This movie will make you cry, laugh and be so grateful for what you have and be able to have a more full and meaningful Christmas with your family. This movie makes you want to pick up your children and never let them go. This movie will also give you a new appreciation for your spouse and made me fall enlove all over again with my husband and not take him for grantid.

I watched tens of them and I tell you that I am one of few people who agrees with this review!! it is silly. What a lesson will your children learn from the little girl who trust a stranger that he is really an angel!! Oh No!!!!!!!!!!! now bad guys can pretend to be angels. Do you really like it that you little daughter and son leave the house in the night to talk to a stranger who will convince the mother that Santa is real?!!!!! so mom is the stupid one here who does not believe in Santa!! Do not forget that Santa is the ONE who will bring the father (who got shot during the movie) to life., Let Santa solve our problems and make our children with limited thinking..

I am glad my children were old enough to think that it was silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I am a big Lover of Christmas movies and try to find new movies to add to my collection every year. This movie is a huge disappointment. It cannot be compared to any of the classics; It's a Wonderful life, Miracle on 34th Street, Christmas Carol or even Prancer! There were too many faults to list....my advice would be to steer clear of it and certainly do not watch it with children! The Angel answers to Santa not God!! Stick to the tried and true classics would be my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"One DARK Christmas movie!","review":"As a fan of Christmas movies, I remember seeing this years ago and watched it again recently. This film was terrible. The plot was far too dark to be enjoyable, and the actors looked completley bored to tears. The little girl was adorable and the only positive thing in this entire movie. There were way too many loose ends that we never tied up and the movie was way to depressing. Harry Dean Stanton is a fine actor but he looked like he would rather be anywhere than this atrocious movie. Mary Steenburgen is a phenominal actor but was TERRIBLE in this role! These actors looked like they were forced to act in this movie and were completly wasted. The effeccts in the film were very hokey and I cannot get over how dark the plot was. The end fails to deliver and punch as well. Avoid this film folks it's dark and boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I ever purchased","review":"I was so disappointed with this movie. I knew nothing about it but thought with Mary Steenburgen it would be good.

The style is an unusual mix of fantasy and realism. The ending is a series of emotional triumphs made the more so by Mary Steenbergen's acceptance of the power of magic to inform and give meaning to daily realities. It is an existential journey to faith.Two other things I would mention relative to other reviewers. The child molester image of the Gideon character was not apparent at the time. In retrospect it may have been better to have a female angel, but Gideon is effective in his humility and soft-spoken nature.The other thing is that other reviewers mention the special effects. I saw this movie in the theatre and it was amazing. I was overwhelmed by its power. It was nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography and won in that category in CanadaI really wish someone would show a clean copy on the big screen again. As it is I have watched the movie every year since as an annual rite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie","review":"A movie I have looked for I finally found, Bought as a gift also.A Favorite of mine A make you feel good Christmas movie.

The author seems focused on Morrison's anti-journalism to the extent that he seems to lose sight of his subject. Since Morrison is difficult (if not impossible) to interview, the author has been left with little more than the music to review. His reviews are passable but his insistence on noting numerous incidents where Morrison is arrogant and/or unappreciative of others turns the book into one long, cynical complaint regarding Van's character. The ending alone, wherein the author quotes Morrison's obscene rant to an audience member who requests a song from him, is depressing enough for me to recommend anyone to pass on this one. Sometimes ignorance IS bliss. Go buy Saint Dominic's Preview and listen for the real story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"I didn't even buy this book, but I thought it was so bad that I wanted to warn others. A complete waste of time. Somehow I feel like I know LESS about the man than I did before. The only good parts are the interview quotes from magazine articles that the author had nothing to do with.

William is a slave who is about to become a father. His woman, Dover, is taken away by her white mistress. But William cannot take life without her, or their child, and so he decides to follow her north. What follows is an incredible tale of courage and determination, mixed in with greed, cruelty and sordidness. Through it all, William never falters, and I loved the plot twist at the end of the novel.If you are interested in what it felt like to be a slave, you should read this book. David Anthony Durham writes in a way that engages your senses, and makes you see the multiple viewpoints on both sides of the color divide. I highly recommend this novel. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 3 Way Love (token)","review":"Anthony Durham writes a beautiful novel called Walk Through Darkness, it's a slave trying to desperately seek out his pregnant love that was taken to another state, unbehold there's also a slave tracker that's on his trail that desperately wants to nab Lewis before others do. This novel not only show u how back in times slavery was, but it tells a story of courage, desperation,family, and true love.

Two Of Disney's Best Stars.","review":"I think most people express their love of this movie so well there is not much more to add. It's a wonderful family film and a true classic Disney treasure. I love Helen Hayes, she was one of Disney's brightest stars. She was charming and wholesome, which is so appropriate for Disney. I hope Disney never loses it's wholesomeness. Wholesome is the foundation of the whole organization. I hope they never lose that quality.I heard from one reviewer online that this film has developed a cult following in England with some college students. That's just great. I hope more attention can be brought to this deserving little film.For anyone interested in more Helen Hayes Disney classics, I suggest the hilarious 'One Of Our Dinosaurs is missing'.James(alice fan)the whole Dean Richards thing is a mistake. can't seem to change it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Foster makes this movie awesome","review":"I'm not a big fan of old live action Disney movie (or new ones for that matter) but this one is a keeper. My younger siblings were watching it for the first time and I had nothing better to do so I did too. I'm glad I did.Jodie Foster is absolutely FANTASTIC as Casey, a cynical (albeit young), orphan with a lot of street smarts. David Niven provides genuine humor with his numerous roles. I'm not going to say what happens, because if you have already seen it you already know, and if you haven't, you should. Suffice it to say that despite a possibly lame fight scene at the end, this movie definitely deserves five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it as a Child, still love it as an adult!","review":"If your looking for a \\"G\\" movie to enjoy with your family without violence, language or adult themes; this is it.

When the DVD came out I just had to have it. The movie is an excellent look at the values of a delinquent youth and how those values can be changed.

This movie has something in it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming as Ever","review":"You won't watch this flick for Jodie Foster - you'll watch it for David Niven.

Good family fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the first...","review":"As I undertand it, this is the first novel portraying the character of Perry Mason and he doesn't display several of the characteristics Gardner would put into him later; he is rather hard with his client, but he is entitled to, because as his client's husband ends up dead, Mason appears to be the main suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Book of Perry Mason Mysteries","review":"This is the first Perry Mason mystery written in 1933. Nobody will call it a masterpiece. No thrilling battle at the courtroom. Not so well-plotted as a whodunit. And Mason does not display his ingenuity of outwitting the authorities (the police and the prosecution) and/or trapping the real murderer.Still this book describes Mason's unchanged attitude throughout the whole series most clearly; even if his client betrays him, he never betrays his client and does everything he can to protect his client. And the wild character of early Mason is vividly described. I don't recommend this book if you've never read Mason mysteries, but I bet this is a must-read for Mason fans.The title means the client, a young beautiful married woman who seems to hide her claws under velvet. She is definitely the nastiest client of all the Mason mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"9.9 out of 10 Stars","review":"This saw is a locomotive. It can literally handle anything you throw at it and ask for more. The built-in casters are worth their weight in gold, and the saws 600lbs make it rock solid. I stood a penny on end right next to the blade and turned the saw on and it did not even budge! With the saw running you can place your hands on the table and feel NO vibration! The cuts are glass smooth and effortless. One very small gripe: 1. The fence rails were VERY difficult to assemble and align properly due to a misalignment in the bolt holes that were pre-drilled at the factory. Other than that, the saw is perfect!

Donald Sutherland's character was too unpredictable and used too conviently by the screenwriters to try to move the plot along. As for William Baldwin, I just don't think he's come along as an actor. And overall, the pacing of the movie was cumbersome. Definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT ALMOST GETS WATCHABLE","review":"In my country, I don't think this film even made it to cinemas, and after seeing it I know why. I was warned away from this film, I watched simply out of morbid curiousity and plead with others not to make the same mistake. Fortunately it is fairly low profile. You can't blame the actors, we've seen they are all good at their jobs - a bit past their prime - but still good. It was the script, and the effects left something to be desired. What's more, there's just too much Russian at the start, and they forgot to put in all the subtitles. It starts slow, and hovers between watchable and just plain bad. In the end, it just wasn't watchable enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why such a waste of talent?","review":"Jaime Curtis didn't have to do this movie. She was miscast -- majorly miscast. If you wanna see a good movie from Jaime, then rent \\"Mother's Boys\\" or \\"Halloween\\" or \\"Halloween: H20.\\" Just don't watch this. No suspense at all. Only character development the fact that you know what they do on the ship. Donald Sutherland did a fair job. But he wasn't miscast. Wanna see a good movie from Sutherland, go rent \\"The Puppet Masters\\" or something like that. Not this!

They encounter a terrified woamn(Joanna Pucula) and then they find that the ship has been taken over by a lifeforce of an ruthless alien intelligence.The film is actually based on a comic book, created by Dark House Comics(Time Cop, The Mask) by Chuck Pfarrer(Darkman, The Jackal).

Sutherland, is very good to a production in which you see, since the cover, that is low-budget. The movie itself has no absurd flaw (it's natural to this genre to be absurd, so nothing is strange.

Similar to the Alien series.Jamie has done better films, but she is equal to the task on this film. William Baldwin also does ok for a beginner. Donald Sutherland is his typical self. He can be counted on to play his characters convincingly.The premise of the film is a lifeform that exists as energy. It needs to find bodies to do it's work. A Russian trawler (spy ship) just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The virus is able to download itself to their computers and so the horror begins..... Add a huge hurricane and there you are.If it weren't for the special effects, this would be a B grade movie. There were some really cool shots of the robotics that the virus is able to create from the machines and humans that were on the ship.Anyway, this one is worth at least two viewings. I've seen it three times, including once on broadcast TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly bad.","review":"Virus makes a mistake at every turn. It's stupid, boring, and senseless. Rather than being campy like Deep Rising, it takes itself too seriously, thus there's no entertainment factor present at all.

This CD is a must for any Jazz Pianist and any fan of jazz for that matter. This CD not only displays his virtuosity as a pianist, but his brilliance as a compsoer, and an arranger.

And somehow the author makes it look easy to do.My nephew knows most of these clever and sweet poems by heart, and I have to admit, so do I. If you're a cynical ex-kid like me, this briliant book will take you back to a time when puddles and bugs and sticky stuff were fun things to be played with, not avoided.

Total musical satisfaction! I thought these guys MUST be famous or at least well known but the opposite appeared to be the case. None of my friends ever heard of this absolut creative, eclectic music. Loop are the masters of combining ethnical influences (asian, east-oriental) with great melodies and wrapping it up with some interesting beats to this unique electronical music package. Whenever I play it people ask me who this is and end up buying it too! No hesitations to recommend it to anyone who likes bands like Transglobal Underground, Enigma, Dead can dance and such....by the way, ALL their albums are that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely But Cold","review":"You'd expect a sample-driven project to equal at least the sum of its parts. Oddly, Loop Bites Dog gets nowhere by using samples (and instruments?) from the already over-exploited third world. The music is passable easy-listening fare, relaxing and accomodating, but its tissue-paper depth is frustrating to more engaged ears. Looking for a challenge? Try Autechre or Aphex Twin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is the best language tool i've tried. The pace is much slower than other programs so its easy to absorb the material.

Isak Dinesen's love for the land that she called home shown through in every remarkable story she told about her farm. The smell, feel, look, and even life of the land was so wonderfuly painted that I lost myself in it. I found myself not wanting to stop reading, but dreading the approaching end of the book. A must read for those who love to travel even if it is only in their minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book that takes you to a different time & place","review":"This book, (actually autobiographical) is a very enjoyable read that takes the reader to the time and place that it was written(early 20th century Europe colonized Africa). From this perspective, it also provides a great outlook from that time of what the future could hold for European/African and in fact human/earth relations. The only drawback is that at times, the author focuses too closely on some non-important characters and side stories and looses focus on the larger and more interesting picture of her existence in Africa and her interaction with the people there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie is a massacre--the book is brilliant!","review":"(Dear Previous Reviewer, There is no \\"delicious irony\\" in Karen Blixen's \\"need\\" to use a male [are you sure Isak is male?] pseudonym to be published--this nonfiction work is clearly narrated by a woman. Refer for examples to the Old Knudsen sections.) Karen Blixen is an open, likable, insightful narrator, and the stories of her 12 years running a farm outside Nairobi are each enthralling, tales of an Africa which now exists only in the past. She has used the perfect combination of facts and her own reflections on people & events of this life, and she is not self-centered in focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"I consider Out of Africa to be the best-written portrayal of Africa by a foreign writer. She did a great job in her portrayal, indicating that she was well versed not only with the land, but also with the native African peoples she met and knew as well as their way of life. The fact that Karen respected that way of life made her to have a deep understanding of their customs and lives at a time of colonialism where European settlers lived an exclusive life from the natives and only dealt with them as sources of cheap labor. I could not help recalling other titles set in the colonial era such as Disciples of Fortune, Nowhere in Africa. However, Karen towered above the others in her unique style of recounting her stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Harris does a perfect read","review":"It's amazing how each media gives a completely different feel of this fabulous book. Dinesen's book gets 5 stars. The movie gets 5 stars for telling the stories in the book as well as its beautiful handling of the relationship between Karen and Denys. The audiotape of the book would get 5 stars as well, if it was unabridged.

More of a day to day diary of her life on the coffee plantation and not nearly as interesting or historically the same as the movie...I think the movie may have taken a lot of creative license to make it interesting. However, it does give a very good description of life in Africa in the early 1900's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Africa abridgment too limited","review":"The two-cassette abridgment was way too limiting for such a magnificent book.

I am biased, having spent time in Kenya, but even so it must carry universal appeal for all. It is in essence a bittersweet love story, a search for the most meaningful life. But also remember that this is a far cry from the reality of 'Baroness' Blixen's life in Africa - the truth is much less romantic. None the less, it is a pity that Karen Blixen never received the Noble Prize for her work, even though Mr. Hemingway thought she should have - in place of himself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the common places","review":"Never wrote a woman a better book in my opinion, where epic, liric and ethic intermingle into the most beautiful prose ever written, only a spark away from poetry self.

I won't repeat them here.This book is for people who love to read; who love to linger over beautifully written sentences. Dinesen's writing has a beauty, an elegance, that is impossible to describe, but also impossible to ever forget. It is elegantly spare, elegant in its moderate pacing, and elegantly rich. No other author writes like Dinesen (Blixen). Read her to enrich your own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond My Expectations","review":"I decided to read this book for two reasons. First, I liked the film from the 80s that was based on the book. Second, I have visited Africa several times (six and counting). I anticipated that the style of writing would be old fashioned but that I would enjoy the subject matter (Africa) enough to make it enjoyable.My expectations were far exceeded. The author \\"paints vivid and beautiful pictures\\" with her story telling. For example, some of the sad tales left me feeling personally sad. The book was very enjoyable.For those interested in the history of the British Kenya Colony, I also recommend the books \\"Something of Value\\" and \\"Uhuru\\" by Robert Ruark, set at the time of the build up to, and then, independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed as it told very little about her relationship with Denys Finch-Haddon, and I had just read his biography TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN.

The characters were not developed enough during the main part of the story. The flash ahead of 30 years seemed too contrived and lazy to be an effective ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slumming author wastes time of both of us","review":"The Innocent pretentiously invites a comparison with Kafka's The Castle, and then belabors it over 200 pages that prove satisfactory as neither serious novel or spy yarn. The point that spy work is often absurd has been made, thank you very much, dozens of times before; and the main character is such an astonishing drip and dolt (taking up with an East German woman who practically has Mata Hari stamped on her forehead) that it's impossible to care about his progress from virgin idiot to non-virgin idiot. Some will no doubt say that that's the point of the book, that Leonard is a real character, not a Follett-Ludlum (or even Greene-LeCarre) fantasy. To me, the fantasy is that he could have survived Basic Training without getting killed by either his own stupidity or his fellow recruits for the good of England...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spy novel with substance","review":"Great book!

At times, it has too much information but I know that I would prefer too much information than not enough information.If you are looking for an entry to learning Qigong or just a refresher, I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful introduction to Quigong, if a bit erratic.","review":"This book is not going to be the only Quigong book in your library. However, it is a useful one.Simply, it's an introduction to Quigong in various forms, from exercises to medicine to martial arts. It's not the most consistent book, and there are times where one may wish for more detail or less. However, there's also enough good material on breathing, exercises, history, and what to expect when you get deeper into Quigong that it's worth the price.If you're an experienced practicioner, it's probably not worth your time, though it may be good for helping others start out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real starting point for me!","review":"This is the book that began everything I've ever learned about Chi and meditation!

I found it to be an amazing explaination of something intangible (chi) explained with real science by a PhD in Physics. Dr. Yang turned out to be one of the most sincere and highest level of expertise authors I could have ever hoped to find on the subject. I have read many other authors on the subject, which he (humbley) encourages you to also, and I still haven't found anything that connects with more substance and no fluff than Dr. Yang's.

Their corporate guidelines mandate that they charge you ten bucks to answer that question. Or any question if your product is out of warranty.For this I wish I had never bought my printer from them.

The song, \\"I'm Upside-down\\" had been in my mind ever since and for years I had tried to track it down, not really knowing which version I had seen. When I finally found this, it did not live up to my memories. The tranfer was what I had expected: watchable, but old, soft-focus VHS quality. The film itself, though, was hard to get into becuse a good deal of time is spent at the beginning with Lewis Carroll (Dodson) and his University cronies. It seemed endless and by the time Alice finally fell down the rabbit hole, I had fallen asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a classic, transfer quality is a problem","review":"This should have been a classic film but suffered commercially because of the clash with the Disney version. This British film fan hadn't even heard of it until this year. If you are able to view Region 2 DVD's I would recommend the French version available on the French Amazon site. This has much beter picture and sound quality as it seems to have been taken from the film and not a video source.

With Vortex, I was not disappointed. Vortex was a very strong effort, albeit not quite as good as Bond's Red Phoenix which was truly outstanding. Bond presents another high-tech military thriller -- in this case set in South Africa. The storyline is entirely plausible, with a key event putting the country in turmoil and setting the stage for all of the fast and furious action that is to follow. As in Bond's other works, character development is solid, diverse and believable. The reader truly understands not only the emotional turmoil of battle, but also the underlying political issues of South Africa and the surrounding region. If you like Bond or the military thriller in general, Vortex will be a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHEER CLASS","review":"An absoultely outstanding technothriller which kept me reading to the very end.

Of the three maps printed in the book, none of them have a scale, which is the cardinal sin of cartography. Ten miles? A hundred miles? Beats me. Also, while the map of all of Antarctica understandably does not have a north arrow (when you're at the South Pole, every direction is north), one of the smaller maps has south as up while the third has north as up, which is needlessly confusing.These quibbles aside, the story is fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time. Saying \\"never have so many done so much for so little\\" sounds cliched, but it's true. What a horrible exercise in futility, although of course at the time the men did not know their efforts were for naught.

Not only is there the quiet and dark to face along with corpses, but will one wake up? And if that's not enough, there's also a serial killer on the on the loose. See if Ewan McGregor survives the late shift or is just spooking himself. And see and feel exactly what it's like for no one to hear your scream but you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Serial Killer Mystery!","review":"One of the strong elements in the movie is the story itself. The idea of a college student taking a job as a night watchman for a morgue is very SCARY! Now add to this the suspense of murders and rapes taking place in the morgue. It all will end up putting you on edge, and you'll fail to guess who's behind such crimes.This type of movies used to be very popular back in the 80s more than the 90s. And you might think that such story might not do good in the 90s... but hey, you'll be the judge of that after you watch the movie.I recommend you rent it, not buy it... unless you collect such movies in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Watched Alone in the Dark!!!!","review":"Not as gorey as I thought it would be, but the suspense was killing me!!!!

Watch this one if you have extra time to kill, or cannot watch a movie with subtitles no matter what. The American remake certainly had a bigger budget and it shows, but all the elements that made the original such a quirky mixture of black humor and genuine thrills have been neutralized, not to mention the Danish local context, in which, for example, a gun makes no appearance until the climax of the climax. (Thereby making it more effective as a weapon) Josh Brolin gives a great performance, the only improvement over the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok,scary movie about a morgue attendent's nightmare!!","review":"This movie is about a young college student who takes a night job at a morgue. After he does this job for a while , he is framed for murder!!Nobody believes of course. Nick nolte plays a man trying to solve the murders. The movie is fairly suspenseful , but the filmakers showed wgo the murderer was a little bit too early in the movie. of course i thought the end was a littlr bit too predictable!!Overally a ok movie for a rental !Why is this not out on DVD yet!!!It would be better if was in widescreen!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ATMOSPHERIC!","review":"This movie touches on most peoples innate fears. The idea of sitting in a town morgue at night alone is unsettling to most. This film works because it uses my aforementioned statement and mixes it with a murder mystery/shock tale. The movie uses quietness and surprise in a frightening way. I felt their were a few unnesscesary scenes pertaining to Ewan McGregors' friend. The unstable adolecent act was overdone and added a false hipness to the film. Nick Nolte put some nice touches on his role. The overall foreboding feel of the movie worked.I would really give this movie 2 and a half stars. The dvd quality is ok, but a special edition is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST HORROR IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!","review":"If you are into edge-of-your-seat thrillers...this is the movie for you....its so frightening and scary it kept me guessing through the whole thing....im a big horror movie buff and this is definitely on my top 5 list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"You can see that this director is very talented.

I'm as happy in a cheesy action film as I am in an artistic film. The reason being is that I am capable of suspending disbelief and turning off my brain or vice versa depending on the situation. But I just couldn't do it with this one! It was too farfetched, dull, and dwelled more on cheap psychological tactics rather then good film making. If you are in the market for a good scare, I'd suggest Jacobs Ladder or The Exorcist, which are both frightening films. And in the suspense department, I'd recommend The Usual Suspects. I would not recommend this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed.","review":"I first watched the original when it got out 5 or so years ago. And I though it more than excellent. Truly creepy, spooky and intriguing. So I obviously had high expectations for the big budget remake even though being a little skeptic. My skepticism was justified. Besides from being highly tuned down in all regards, they had also complete lost the essence of evil which is what made it so spooky in the first place. The acting wasn't all bad(Thus two stars instead of 1) but not spectacular either.Really, they should never have made this. And I don't see how it could have gone this wrong....If however, the unlikely happen, and you like this movie, you really ought to see the original(dubbed/subbed/whatever) version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead On Arrival","review":"Another disappointing and flaccid serial killer thriller. Nightwatch never overcomes its genre cliches or matches the visceral intensity of earlier flicks such as Silence of the Lambs or Seven. This, despite a how-can-you-lose mise-en-scene morgue setting, creepy Lynchian details, and normally oddball actors. Instead, it relies on the inherent and cheap titillation of murder itself for any movie excitement-which, if you think about it, leaves a different kind of icky feeling than director Ole Bornedal or screenwriter Steven Soderbergh probably intended.The DVD itself looks and sounds great, especially in the morgue sequences. There are no special features to speak of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good. Disappointing","review":"I saw a commercial for this on the video for Scream and after seeing all the Children of the Corns (One through five), I rented this. It was REALLY bad. The opening murder was cool and I thought I was going to see a GREAT movie, but I was horribly wrong. The main character tries to act American but his accent keeps breaking, the killer was bad, and all the entertainment value went down the drain. If you rent this for the sake of Patricia Arquette, rent Lost Highway instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent selection.

Add the tea when bubbles start to form in the container you are brewing in and let it steep.

For fans of The Harp Consort there is much here to relish. Kapsberger's Ciaccona is the most exciting piece on the disk and is a bookend to a remarkably similar piece on The Harp Consort's Spanish Dances CD. I give it four stars only because the music of Kapsberger is not as uniformly engaging as much similar early Baroque/Renaissance music. Lislevand is a virtuoso of the theorbo and Pedro Estevan's percussion is perfection. All in all a rare treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"I really didn't care for this book. The author did not write the story in an engaging way, and I did not feel drawn into the world of Queen Elizabeth at all. In a word, boring. Another annoying aspect of the book was the author's tendency to slip in stories out of chronology. She'll be writing about the Queen's coronation, but suddenly she'll drop in a story from 20 years later. And she does it again and again. I love to read all kinds of books, and I seldom ever put down a book without finishing it, but I found this book to be such drudgery that I quit reading it. Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for the intellectually challenged. Very Disappointing","review":"Now I understand why the reviews printed on the cover of this book are reviews of the author's past books. Quite frankly, there is not much to be said about this work of gossip. This book is a shameful excuse for a history book. People who enjoy tabloid magazines and filth; the type that focused on Lady Diana's dates, affairs, and tennis partners will enjoy this book immensely. It seems to me the author spent a great deal of time tracking down gossip and rumors related to Elizabeth. If you are an avid biography reader or history buff, this book is guaranteed to disappoint you. I couldn't wait to finish it, and hoped that the author would finally bring in some substance into this work. That does not happen. Don't waste your time on this one. Try Carolly Erickson's Book, The Frist Elizabeth instead, or any other book for that matter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly historical rubbish.","review":"This is a sweet attempt to tell a somewhat romantic story of Elizabeth 1. For those interested in English history they might want to read 'Character's of the Reformation' by Hillaire Belloc. This English historian deals with the political side of the Tudor monarchy and the men who actually gave Elizabeth her marching orders and who ran the government during her reign."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Life of Elizabeth I","review":"Overall a good book, but someone with the experience and research time invested that Allison Weir has should know that Elizabeth I was the wife of Henry Tudor, the first in the Tudor line and by some number of degrees this Elizabeth's great grandmother. This is actually a book about Elizabeth II."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want dry details about every historical fact...","review":"then don't buy this book. This is not about the logistics of battles or family trees, this book is about Elizabeth and her court.I have always been interested in learning more about the great \\"Elizabeth,\\" yet fearful of reading some dreary and dull account of soldiers and armaments. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a rich book full of lively descriptions of Elizabeth I and her courtiers.I sailed through the 490 pages, and feel like I am a little bit closer to who Elizbeth the person and the monarch was.I did wish there was a little more background on her childhood and perhaps the surrounding politics, but other than that, I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment, not history","review":"This book reads more like a harlequin romance novel than a work of serious historical scholarship-- needless to say, I was disappointed.Weir's book contains no notes of any kind, and only a very cursory list of sources. As a history student, I found this shocking and somewhat suspicious. Certainly, it is irresponsible scholarship, blurring the line between fact, supposition, and fiction. At times I felt Weir was interested in presenting racy, bodice-ripping details, without regard to their truthfulness.The book focuses almost exclusively on Elizabeth's life after ascension- a glaring fault. Without any kind of understanding of Elizabeth's childhood and experiences before the age of 27, it is not surprising that Weir's analysis of Elizabeth the Queen is, at best, both one-dimensional and superficial. You might enjoy this book if you are interested in what Elizabeth wore, what she ate, her possible love affairs, etc. But don't expect any kind of in-depth analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Witty, Fascinating Social History","review":"I have read many biographies about Elizabeth I, as well as several books by Alison B. Weir. This particular biography was a wonderful exploration of the personalities of both the Queen herself and her closest associates. Her courtships, quarrels, and behavior are thoroughly covered in a very droll manner - in fact, this is the wittiest history I have ever read in the 25 years I have been reading the subject. Weir actually had me laughing out loud with her knack for pointing out the humorous side of primary documentation. A long, satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Weirs best","review":"For some reason, I had a terrible time finishing this book, which is unusual for Weir's books. Normally I can't put them down, but I just got bogged down in Liz's repetitive courtships to be fully engrossed. I know the author's intent was to present a personal history rather than a political one, but the resulting work is uneven, derivitive, and often just dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Read","review":"I am an Elizabethan freak so it takes a lot for me to really get into a book about the period and not nit pick it. This book follows Elizabeth across her life. I didn't think it offered much of a new perspective or new data however. It was a pretty standard biography of her (I've read about 10), but Alison Weir is a good writer which makes it enjoyable. If you are looking for new facts or a more thought provoking read, I would suggest David Starkey's Elizabeth. It explores her youth more and discusses many of the possible theories of a pregnancy, dispells tower gossip stories based on scientifc records from the time period, and is also an enjoyable read. So if you want something a little mindless and entertaining, or if you are new to this field of study, this is a good book. If you're a little more seasoned, I would choose the Starkey book and if you can afford both, I would suggest that so you can compare and contrast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling like a mystery novel","review":"I came to this book out of my interest for Elizabeth from the striking film with Cate Blanchett. While the film is not entirely historically accurate, it captures the emotional impact of Elizabeth's reign. This book has drawn me in and I'm about one third of the way through it, and find that I cannot put it down. It is very accessibly written, very exciting, and reads almost like a mystery novel. It answers all my questions about Elizabeth, her time period, and her reign. If you want to know more about her in broad strokes as well as specific details, and want something other than the feared 'dry, academic' style, by all means please pick this book up. It flows, reads fast, and stays in your mind. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond portrait...","review":"Though this reads at times like a college textbook, it is thorough and intelligent, brings light to personality and the choices made throughout her reign. Not only does Weir introduce the internal workings of the throne, but also the society without, its culture and changes. When you are done reading this, not only will you know everything about the Golden Age of England and its Queen, but you will love them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much love, not enough genius.","review":"I found the bio to focus too much on Elizabeth's love life (and lack thereof) and not enough on her particular political genius (which I was more interested in finding out more about). I did not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized, repetitive mess; Erickson much better","review":"It is hard to believe that such a marvelous topic as Queen Elizabeth could be rendered so dry, so disorganized (jumping enormous leaps in subject from paragraph to paragraph), and even redundant, three times tellinbg how the Spanish overestimated Catholic support in England, etc. Even spelling and grammar mistakes. Read Carolly Erickson instead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and impersonal.","review":"After seeing the movie about Elizabeth I was left thirsty for more information about this facinating historical figure, so I went looking for a Book. I wanted something that read like an interesting novel, not tedious lists of family trees and impersonal second hand accounts of what was speculated about this woman and her reign. I'm sure it is well researched and accurate in it's content but I was left falling asleep each night while I trudged through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too narrow","review":"This book should have been entitled _The Marital Intrigues of Elizabeth I_. By page count, I estimate that it is:50% about Elizabeth's potential marriages;20% about marital and sexual politics at her court;20% about Mary, Queen of Scots;10% about everything else.No doubt these are important topics, but are they *that* important? I learned virtually nothing about Elizabethan domestic politics, art, society, technology, science, warfare, religion, or home life. Reading this book, one could easily be left with the impression that the only thing Elizabeth actually did during her entire reign was dynamically and proactively not get married.If your understanding of Elizabeth would be incomplete without a detailed description of rejected suitor Charles of Anjou's pockmarks, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable But Disappointing #2","review":"I agree with Readable but Disappointing #1 the entire book could fairly be summarized as \\"Elizabeth flirted endlessly with many men, realizing that her marriage, offspring, and choice of successor were her most prized (and only) major assets.\\" The amorous intrigue for her hand goes on and on and on and ... you get the idea. As interesting as it starts out, at a certain moment it just seems pointless. She played the same game for decades -- do we really need to know every twist and turn? Perhaps more disappointingly for me, since I really bought my first Elizabeth book to learn about her, I found myself wondering if this woman ever signed a bill, proposed something to Parliament, plotted state strategy with her advisors. This book could more accurately be titled \\"The Personal Life & Interminable Marriage Intrigues of Elizabeth I and Her Court.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"History Without the Dryness","review":"I've read four of Alison Weir's books now, and whereas I usually dread to read dry historical novels, I truly enjoy hers. I enjoyed reading about the Elizabethan times, and the intricacies of politics, particularly when the monarch is a woman. With all the pressure to produce an heir, I find it amazing that she was able to hold out and never marry. And I also found it interesting that Weir never flinched from portraying Elizabeth's darker, pettier side. It made her seem more human than she has been portrayed before. I found it a great read for the British history enthusiast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weir's Life of Elizabeth","review":"Another of Weir's books on the Tudor period. Great starting place for people interested in Liz I, though not the greatest for a professional historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masking political achievements with the marriage debate","review":"The book provided interesting insight into the Life of the Queen famous for her positive impact on her country. I found that the author seemed to be trying to make her into an early feminist however. Endless pages were devoted to her string of marriage negotiations. This apparently left little room to discuss her major accomplishments. Multiple chapters focused on her ongoing relationships with Leceister and Essex, yet there was only one brief chapter on the Armada. Overall only about 3 of the 26 chapters dwells on her actual foreign or domestic policies, with the others largely dwelling on courtroom romp. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for a Queen","review":"This magnificent book has me convinced that a woman can rule a complex country.

You won't be disappointed in this book. It is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written biography","review":"Alison Weir does a fantastic job in recounting history in layman's terms. Details are vivid and engaging without the hyperbole you would expect in descriptions of the life and times of Elizabeth I.The book is very easy to read and compelling. The language is not so simplistic that you think you are being talked down to, nor is the language so difficult that you have re-read pages twice to understand. The personal life of Elizabeth I is presented against her public one, though, as Ms. Weir acknowledges, it was hard to differentiate the two. It's as if you are reading a very engaging novel as the life Elizabeth led seems so unrealistic at times.I carried it everywhere with me until I finished. And now, I make a point of re-reading at least once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite an insight","review":"I have read many books on the lives of the Tudors. This one is so realistic, it is like she was writing about the present instead of 500 years ago. It is a fascinating book"},{"rating":"2","title":"England's Most Endearing Monarch","review":"Another great book by Alison Weir, but the first half of the book should be renamed \\"A Husband for Elizabeth.\\" As in Elizabeth I's life, the first part of the book deals with whether or not she will marry and the prospects of who would be her husband. Alison Weir does give the reader a lot of information, but the book is pretty easy to follow. It was not only facinating to read about how and why she ruled the way she did, but also the clothes that made that era truly \\"Elizabethan.\\" Having already read Mary, Queen of Scots, I appreciated reading Elizabeth's point of view regarding the whole \\"Mary Situation.\\" A nicely written book to take the reader through the life of Elizabeth I. As with Alison Weir's other books, this one contains wonderful portraits of all of the players involved in her life as well as a geneology table to keep them sorted out."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow start","review":"This book had a real slow start. I admit, I am not the best reader, if I read 10 pages I normally fall asleep. But this book couldn't get past one page. She had such an amazing life, and I feel like the first 100 pages didn't cover anything... I swear it just kept talking about the dozens and dozens of men trying to marry her, and it takes it a small paragraph per man over 50 pages. Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a good one","review":"well its a good software as far as the rendering is concerned its better then bryce and light effects are good camera handeling is ok.transforming the images in to heave texturized maps is superb.awesome software.but above all its ik is the best i have ever seen in any other 3d software other than hig ones i guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily Meditation","review":"Wonderful book for a daily meditation. 365 thoughts of our Beloved Saint Therese of Lisieux.

It takes only seconds to pick it up, open to the day and read one of her inspiring quotes; they are ALWAYS simply worded yet deep in their understanding of the true charity of God. If you practice The little Way of Spiritual Childhood or desire too you will not be disappointed in the help you receive from this daily devotional. Also if used during the day it's excellent in reminding one of who you are and where you are going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked very well for me!!!","review":"I purchased this when my family commented on my teeth looking yellow, they are usually pearly white. I was hesitant about trying this at first, but this worked really well for me. My teeth are beautifully white in only a few days, unlike other methods and products. I use for thirty-minutes to an hour for several days. Very pleased, and have received lots of compliments on my teeth. Definitely, will use again. Keep in mind, that with all bleaching kits you may not see the results of the FINAL color for 2-3 weeks. So if you are planning dental work wait a few weeks for final color, you do not want technicolored teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The easy path to System Software","review":"After working on C, C++ and a little bit of Assembly languages, you feel excited about the knowledge & underlying mechanisms of assemblers, loaders and linkers etc. I have gone through this book and found it extremely helpful in getting the complex concepts of system softwares. I agree with the idea of author to give the concepts on the basis of a hypothetical machine, rather than going into the complex details of any real system. This provides a big scope of the subject, givingyou the ability to feel at ease with any system.What I like most in this book is that, its not so big and with just eight chapters, you feel comfortable about the idea of reading the book.I think, its a must to read book for computer science students."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Systems Programming","review":"This book, while old, is a good introduction to the SIC/XE assembler. I used it as a reference for my Systems Software class, and it looks like i'll be able to get some use out of it when I take my compiler class as well. I must say, the book could use more reference on how to assemble complete instructions, our professor went over this in class but I found myself wishing that the text had more information on it. All in all not a bad textbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book is poorly written. The writing is very dense and not broken up into sections. There are no word in boldface, not many subsections with headers. The result is, I read through a chapter, then when I want to go back and find how to do a certain thing, I can't find it. I have to skim through the whole chapter. It's material that requires doing step by step things. You can't just read it straight through, you have to go back and find concepts and do them. And having no boldface terms and few section breaks makes this a completely tedious process. I'm a computer science major and of all the textbooks I've used, this is by far the worst. I hate it! If you are a professor, only use this one if you hate your students and you want to punish them and make their lives miserable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it...","review":"This book is filled about 500 pages of such incredible verbosity that it is wonderous that anyone can come away having learned anything.

If you just want a universal remote to control one basic entertainment area...then it is overkill..although it will look nice.If you are looking to replace all your remotes...of any kind..in any room....then this is the best i have seen out there in this price range.

Two years later, this refurbished almost caused a fire. I smelled something melting just before going to bed, it was the pronto in the charger. My friend also had two of them break under normal uasage. They are pooly built and I don't think a company should replace a one week old unit with a used one.From a usage note.

I am fairly new to Playmobil overall. I am impressed with the detail and overall sturdiness of this ship. It is a very large ship as well. The detail is incredible. Even the anchor is metal, which really suprised me. There are tons of accessories and the sails are actually made out of an almost cloth-like material. The only downside I can see to this toy at all is that there is no PLANK! I thought all pirate ships were required to have a plank! With all the imagination that Playmobil has put into their products, I am just a bit shocked that they overlooked the plank for their pirate ship. I would suggest they add this on future models. Otherwise, it has certainly not only entertained my 4-year-old son, but my husband is pretty enthralled with it as well! I will certainly buy more accessories to go with this and will be buying other Playmobil products in the future as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $$","review":"My son got this last Christmas and he still is always playing with it. He also has the treasure chest and the dungeon that he uses with this. Playmobile puts out the coolest toys! He loves the working canons.

He loves all the tiny pieces, especially the little coins to put in the treasure chest. This is a great ship and well worth the money spent!!!

I have long scale bass that is very heavy; the Slider does not provide the support required at the position I need it when worn as designed (it's too low, and the right front strap (I'm right handed) is in the way. However, when the strap is configured and worn like a Dare strape (i.e., one side of the strap split and worn/looped over the neck at it splits and is supported by both shoulders in the front, the back straps doubled and attached to the back lug as a single strap - the slider mechanism on the player's back), the strap works great. In the Dare configuration, it provides great support, is very secure, and comfortable if adjusted correctly. The strap holes for the lugs are very secure, an advantage over the Dare (I had to add velcros to my Dare because the snap connection opens unexpectedly, sometimes, but the Dare is a bit easier to adjust)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I received my order in great time,before the Christmas holiday, was pleased with the ease of how to process the order, and the look of the product was even better than the picture.

It is not a Rock and Roll album, it's an Alternative Rock album. If you're into bad music like Green Day, or Metallica, you'll probably love this CD. However, if you're expecting good Classic Rock like Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, The Allman Brothers, or Tesla from their Mechanical Resonance days, this isn't a very good CD to check out.

If anything, they've come back better than when they disbanded. Almost all of the songs are excellent and there's not a weak song on the entire CD. They still have the same signature sound but have added a few new touches. After listening to 'Into The Now' several times already, I think this is their best work outside of 'The Great Radio Controversy.' Tesla has always been somewhat under appreciated and hard to label.

Everything Tesla is known for; boot stompin' rockers, \\"Got No Glory,\\" and the acoustic leanings of the Aerosmith-ish \\"Caught In A Dream,\\" are found here. It also helps that harder edged songs like \\"Look At Me\\" and \\"Mighty Mouse\\" are among the best they have ever done. If there was justice in this world, this would be a huge comeback.

And, when it's over, you play it again, and again. Do I have the nerve to elevate this record to that status? Yes, I do. Why? Because it's a hard rock classic in an era of mostly crap. It will never get the mass air play it deserves. If you are reading this, you're probably no stranger to Tesla.

I would say this is not quite as good as some of their records from their heyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let this music spread!","review":"I'm a diehard Tesla fan; I love all their albums (including Bust a Nut!) and I've seen them live several times. This album is their best yet and it couldn't have come at a time the music world (and the world!) needed it more. If Aersomith released Caught In A Dream the song would go straight to #1. Into the Now and Look at Me set the tone for an awesome album experience from top to bottom. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"takin' a bow into the now","review":"All the original members still together. The melodic, two-guitar leads of Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch; the soaring, yet slightly sandpaper-ish singing from Jeff Keith; and its sturdy rhythm section bassist Brian Wheat and drummer Troy Luccketta.The band has not only grown over the years, but also clearly reconnected to bring about seamless collaborations like \\"What a Shame\\" and \\"Look @ Me\\".They are just a great rock n roll band that always have delivered great rock n roll albums. No BS, just a great attitude that shows through with their excellent songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's revisited","review":"I was nervous to see another band of the 80's was releasing a new cd, but at the same time excited to purchase. I was relieved to hear that a group is still capable of playing good R&R while maintaining their roots. There is not one outstanding song on this cd but decent offerings throughtout, although one who listens to Tesla must realize that the musicianship is what brings this group to the forefront and my is it brilliant on this cd. Anyone who is a fan the the 80's rock genre must pick up this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Power Rock Ablum in 15 years!!!","review":"Finally a band that gets it, Thank You!!! Every track is just killer. There produced but not overly produced where you don't feel the emotion and the happiness in each and every song. What I always liked about Tesla is how heavy they could be yet they could be very sincere and emotional not like most of the bands of there era where it seemed forced and unreal. Tesla thoughts and feelings were very honest and you can feel it in there music. So if you like straight ahead power rock that isn't \\"bummer music\\" thats trying to show how good life can be this ablum is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL","review":"This is an excellent followup to \\"Bust a Nut\\" which also was excellent(and highly underrated). Great production, great musicianship and Jeff's voice is in top form. It hasn't changed a bit. There isn't a single weak track on the album and you'll find yourself wanting to listen again when the last track is over. It's classic Tesla with a modern sounding production edge to it..with excellent vocals. Get this today. You gotta support this stuff people..these guys deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"All I can say is WOW...This shows that Tesla has not lost a step in the years. I don't think there is a bad song on this CD. Usually when a band comes out with a new CD after such a long absence. They don't age well. But Tesla has manged to transcend time & make some AWESOME Music.............. If you Love Tesla.. You must get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag","review":"When I first heard that Tesla had released a new album, I was afraid it was going to sound like it had been written in the early 90s. Thankfully, this CD sounds contemporary to current \\"new\\" bands.The music on the CD is comprised of mostly chunky guitar chords. I think the producers of this CD did an excellent job of making the guitars and drums stay alive and vibrant without wallowing in too much mud. I also liked the use of certain vocal, drum, and guitar effects I hadn't heard (or noticed) on previous Tesla albums. The music I think is pretty solid on this album.However, the lyrics are abominal. It's like they are sentences sung to the music. The lyrics don't compliment the music, but rather interfere with the flow. The word are clumbsy and fairly banal.The three strongest songs are What a Shame, Come to Me, and Caught in a Dream. There were several other songs I liked the music for, but the lyrics just ruined it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who wouldn't love these faces?","review":"I bought this tape to entertain my friends' babies when they come to visit.

I recommend it anyone who has children or 'entertains' them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video, diapers, and formula is all you'll need.","review":"I'm exaggerating, of course. But that was the thank you I got from my sister a month after I gave her this video for her newborn. My niece was staring at the babies on this tape after just 3 weeks - which was amazing. I particularly like it because it doesn't have Barney, or Elmo or some other such character programming my niece when she is still soooo young."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a clever video!","review":"This video captivated my daughter's attention and she is 4 months old.

Cut 0ne is \\"What is music(original mix w/notes)\\" nice sample flows very danceable in the way of house style. Cut three is the \\"Mr Racous mix\\" witha blast into a more breaks style emulating the early 90's rave sound. The hidden secret on the disk though are the \\"Spice\\"remixes. Cut two is the \\"low power mix\\". Love that spice. The intro starts off slow then introducing \\"the spice must flow sample\\" while building into the smooth baseline and sweet re-mastered original chorus linet that was so dominant in the original. And cut four , the \\"hi power mix\\" kicks with deep base pounding breaks that'll blow you away. A must have for any Eon fan. Smooth and to the point, it rips."},{"rating":"1","title":"More for a young teen reader I think.","review":"I like the author and have enjoyed several of his other books but this one was more like what an adolescent might enjoy. Its sequel is just as bad if not worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War We Didn't Know About","review":"I always try to find fiction written in the places I am vacationing. I read \\"The Keeper's Son\\" on a scuba diving trip to see the wrecks of our ships sunk by U-Boats at the beginning of WW2. No book could have satisfied this need more than this one.Until I was a diver I never realized how close to our shores WW2 was fought, nor how the government kept it under wraps. This book reeled me in, hook, line and sinker. When I saw the German U-Boat 352 at the bottom of the Atlantic 25 miles from our country, it sent chills up my spine.The Keepers Son added color, character and a suggestion of the mystery that surrounded this period. Was America really invaded by a U-Boat crew in an attempt create terror? When you add the romance and the quirky Outer Banks character and culture, you wind up with a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for WWII fiction fans","review":"A good fictional account of what was happening on the coast of the United States at the beginning of the war.

Thank you to all the Men and Women Past and Present that serve in our USCG."},{"rating":"1","title":"That sinking feeling","review":"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book. I'm from North Carolina and have spent wonderful days on the Outer Banks. I'm interested in submarine warfare; I just saw the full-length (nearly 5-hour) version of \\"Das Boot.\\" I had read nothing but good things about all of Hickam's work.But I was quite disappointed. The plot starts well, as the reader learns of the tragic aspects of the two main characters' histories. But their romance is written on an adolescent level, as is the book's humor. The story quickly becomes rushed, sketchy, and ever more unbelievable.Hickam cripples his book with the use of preposterous coincidences, and his last chapter sinks the whole enterprise like a torpedo sinking a freighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hickam is one of the best writers around today","review":"I think Hickam is one of the best writers around. His books are always interesting and page-turners. I love this novel. The characters are compelling such as Dosie and Josh, and Miriam and Krebs. And I learned so much in this novel. I had no idea about this big battle off the Outer Banks during World War II. My husband bought this, just loved it, which made me a little reluctant because he talked about the battle scenes. Then I read it and knew Hickam had written a romantic adventure that women can love, too. So is it a man's novel or a woman's? Remarkably, both! It is also a great tale of the sea. I could even feel the sand between my toes, smell the salt air, imagine myself standing high above the ocean on a lighthouse. Just good adventurous romantic stuff. I'm looking forward to the next in the series. The Thurlow family rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story telling","review":"I loved the \\"Coalwood Trilogy\\" for its story-telling and the author's character development. I was worried when he strayed from Coalwood that this would be lost. But this story was really good! After I got about a third of the way through, and things really started to happen, I had trouble putting it down! The relationship between Josh and Dosie is a strange one, but maybe that will play out better in the rest of the \\"Thurlow Trilogy\\". Mr. Hickam has an excellent grasp of life in a small town--as well as inside a submarine--and makes his characters very human. A must-read if you love great story telling and action! This will keep you guessing until the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD COMPILATION FROM HIS ARISTA YEARS","review":"I happen not to agree with the other only review on this album.This CD is a solid example of Iggy's amazing and hilarious extravaganza during the years 1979, 1980, 1981.Sure it would be better to buy the albums \\"New Values\\", \\"Soldier\\" and \\"Party\\", but if you're unsure of how Iggy sounded in the early 80's, then \\"Pop Music\\" is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"unnecessary","review":"This is an absolutely unnecessary Iggy Pop compilation that contains songs from his Arista albums. All that this cd basically is, is \\"The Best of New Values, Soldier, and Pary\\". Unfortunately I was tricked into buy this compilation when I was new to Iggy Pop and I didn't really know what it was. Instead of buying this, get the newly re-released American versions of New Values, Soldier and Party (all 3 disks contain bonus tracks). I hope that you don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Glimpse","review":"Hurston's journey takes the reader into the minds, hearts, the very souls of two star-crossed lovers, offering modern day sojourners an uncommon opportunity to experience the rage and tenderness of the lives of those imprisoned in caste prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Love Story","review":"This book shows how a African American woman finds her true identity and overcomes the prejudice and racial profiling of the majority community. This book should be read by everyone because it will show you how bad the majority was to the minority and how everyone should be treated regardless of color of skin color.

America that holds us close and bites our csouls trhough our flesh. Passion, sexual freedom in a lover too young, too young to be anything but a transition, a transition to freedom. A Black love story, Black literature that throbs, that vibrates with power, and ends with the baptism of the land, of Janie. Washing away tears of infidelity, of grief, of dread, of poverty, of fear and replacing them with the eyes that were watching God and God looked down and cried onto the land, onto Janie onto the fields where her fingers had bled, where her hands had split, where her tongue was kept silent and held to converse life and moisture.Share your freak with whomever because it's a beautiful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st","review":"This book was interesting but at the same time confusing. The main character seems to not be in control of her feelings, or in other words the author does not seem to be in control of her feelings. The character feels one way about something and then in the next moment it turns up side down because the author dosn't seem to be sure of what she wants the character to feel. That is until Tea Cake comes in. Then it seems that the author had been leading up to that and knew exactly what was going to happen and what was going to be felt.Because the majority of this book is about Tea Cake I found very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurston belongs with Faulkner and Morrison","review":"This book is one of the greatest depictions of the South in Florida, and certainly one of the greatest works set in Florida. This book is part history (the founding and growth of Eatonville, Florida), but mostly a social analysis and a look into the turbulent life on an extraordinary women. Fellow atheists, do not let the title put you off; this is not a book deeply set in Christian values and belief, but I won't give away where the title comes from--it is a dramatic moment to be cherished. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their eyes were watching GOD","review":"My daughter loves this book so much she brought two, hard copy and paperback.

I had a bit of trouble with the dialect at first, but after getting a list of phrases and their meanings, it all fell into place.

It was also very helpful to read about the author's life. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-read\\" for all","review":"Janie's spirit and ability to be introspective and also to analyze her life and the people around her transcend her status as an uneducated black woman in the south during Jim Crow. The book takes us into a world that is often physically and mentally a test of endurance, but not without joy. It is a testament to the human spirit and the spirit and soul of one particular woman who refused to settle for less than the all encompassing love she knew would complete her and sustain her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their eyes were watching God","review":"If you are a reader who enjoys reading classical materials, you will like this one.

But this book hurts my eyes and is so hard to read because you have to sit down and disect every sentence of dialect. There are ways to write an affective story and get the language across without making it completely unreadable. It takes so much longer to read than it should, and with the frustration of trying to read the dialect, the beautiful story gets lost, and I'm not even sure what it's about anymore.

The story was created just so Mrs. Hurston could use \\"black vernacular\\" or ebonix of the early 1900's. The sharp contrast between the ebonix and nornmal English narrative was NOT, in my opinion, a great literary device. It was neither educational nor informative to read long sections of dialogue like the sentence in the title of this review. Forcing myself to read improper English, to say the least, for an English class was very annoying. I don't think any educator would want me to write or speak like the dialogue in this book, so what is the point of reading it? The story was powerful and moving, but only if it had been written in English. Ah reckon dis be de en' of de review. Ah be wishin' dat Ah ain't gointuh hafta read nuttin' lak dis again.

Despite my efforts to take pleasure in the experience, the literature lacked any excitement. In addition, the imagery was sparse, and when it did appear, it was very dry. As the main character, Janie was a one-dimensional sap with the emotional integrity of a neanderthal. While the dialect attempts to create an authentic view of a southern locale, it succeeds only in aggravating the reader. Wading through the perplexing vernacular takes all attention away from the story itself, although this may not be an entirely negative aspect.

I'm not trying to be racist-- the main character is only 1/4 black, and her caucasian features are repeatedly exhalted for their beauty (thin lips, straight hair, etc.) The few white people in the book are the ones that give her support, while the AA community turns their back on her during her time of need.

She weighs and appraises unfolding events and makes deliberate and difficult choices in order to live a life defined by the depth and passion she determines, with no holds barred.While this novel has been defined as one of the finest Black novels of all time, I feel that it is more than that...it is one of the finest novels about a person throwing off the expectations and pressures of others and pursuing their own truths.

The book covers the trials and tribulations of the main character, Janie, as she attempts to find personal happiness and her purpose in life through multiple marriages. Throughout the novel, Hurston uses the husband figures as building blocks, creating distinguishable similarities and dissimilarities between the characters in order to keep the flow of the book from episode to episode. Using the husbands as the backbone to the novel, Hurston progresses the book to a climax, making her developing character, Janie, complete.

It is a story about finding oneself and becoming a stronger person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"After reading this book, I felt as if my intellectual freedom had been ground under by the iron boot of PC liberal thuggery.

Most of all, it attempted to beat the reader to death with the \\"plight\\" of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Oprah and Halle!","review":"I read Hurston's book about 10 years ago but this is one of the few times when I enjoyed the movie even more than reading the book! I think Oprah's vision brought a fresh look and insight about Tea Cake I must have missed when I first read it so I will definitely read it again. Oprah was right about the casting of Halle Berry too! Halle was acting in this movie and how beautiful she is! She gets more beautiful the older she gets--Lena Horne had nothing on Halle. I kept thinkin' \\"Go on, Halle!\\" especially during \\"the kiss\\" that defines all kisses!

I thought this book was phenomenal! It gives you a sense of calm as it describes a part of Janie's life! I thought her description of \\"sitting under the pear tree\\" being happiness, was very deep!I believe that no matter how deep or ,as some would describe it, \\"sappy\\" everyone should read this book. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because in the begining she goes on and on about her husband (the first one). My favorite part was when they had the hurricane at the end and her husband (Teacake) rescues her from the rabid (viscious) dog with rabies--but she has to shoot Teacake later because he gets the rabies from the dog and goes nuts! Enjoy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Piece of Literature","review":"I've never read anything so beautiful. The characters were so rich and the story was just perfect. Janie, the main character, was everything a woman is supposed to be, beautiful, confident, strong and capable. I felt like I was there, I felt their pain and happiness. The way she described things not only made you feel as if you were there but it was written in this way that is so beautiful that even if she were describing a rotting carcas it would still sound like a delicate little flower. I would recomend this book to anyone. Even the coldest person could cry if they read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading","review":"This book was chosen for our book club selection.

The book about the life, loves, and maturing of a woman, Janie, iis superb.Though the book begins slow, and some areas seem vague and irrelevant, after completion you will just sit there and think about it. I thought for a while and the book was excellent.Well written, topped off with southern dialect that makes the story all the more imaginable, Their Eyes Were Watching God was a powerful book that you will surely never forget, and be incredibly inspired by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart","review":"This book should be read by not only everybody interested in the African-American experience but by everybody interested in the human experience. For such a little, skinny book, it's bigger than most. It is truly the story of a woman's journey. It becomes the reader's as well. The simplicity is stunning. Towards the end, I have to admit my heart shattered into a thousand pieces, but I wouldn't have had it any other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice writing style, but pointless","review":"I read this book for school, and we went over all the good points of this book and its literary merit, etc. The writing style is smooth and descriptive, but I find the plot dull and trite. She is a teen searching for love and her voice, and the story is her traveling from husband to husband and her not being satisfied. The idea of her finding her voice is inconsistent and unfounded. If you want to read a book about a silly girl who doesn't know what to do with herself, and if you want to be bombarded with overused symbolism, be my guest and read \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" by Zora Neale Hurston. Only read it if you are looking at the writing style, do not read it for the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Zora Neale Hurston's most famous novel, and now a TV movie thanks to Oprah, this is an amazing look at the lives of African American Women post-Reconstruction. The novel follows Janie and her journey from teenage bride, to shopkeepers wife, to a cradle robbing, free spirited woman. The novel is set in Eatonville, Florida, the first black community in America. I learned so much about life in the South and the struggles that Black women faced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay--what's the big deal?","review":"I'll preface this by saying that I may be off base in my judgement of this book (and I invite others to agree or disagree with me), but I really don't understand the hooplas of praise it has garnered since it's reissue twenty years ago.While I agree that Hurston's prose style is lyrical and easy-to-read and her use of dialect quite effective, I have a problem with the novel's main character -- Janie. Are we supposed to look up to her as a paragon of oppressed African-American womanhood? I understand that she's abused (in essence) by her first two husbands, but Tea Cake doesn't strike me as any better yet she loves him above the others even though he most directly physically abuses her.I also found the climactic scenes of the novel rather sensationalized.What are we supposed to make of Janie? She doesn't seem to develop at all through the course of the novel.Maybe I just don't relate?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooting for Janie!","review":"This book is one I hold dear simply because Janie is NORMAL and I'm sure that no matter race, creed, or location most women can relate. She isn't perfect, she isn't an amazing hero of sorts, just a woman trying to find who she is and what she wants in due time. Packed with detail and a great plot, \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" is truly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Eyes Were Watching God...Great!","review":"This book is very powerful in the struggles of a beautiful lady named Janie. Living a horrible life of heartbreaks and no love from her 3 marriages, Janie still moved on. She looked for a better life to live to recieve better treatment and be someones wive and not slave. When she finds Tea Cake, she realized that her life became better with him and that she could live a happier life. She realized that she didn't deserve all that [stuff] that she has been through from her other 3 marriages.

Dubois did not like this book at all! It was because it makes a mockery of African-American men. It's ture! They are portrayed as nothing more than monkeys. They have no sense of family, spirituality, commitment, determination. This book makes one root fot the Klan more than Gone With the Wind did! The only thing which keeps me from giving it 1 star is the beautifully written narration. It's abou the only part worth reading because the dialogue is simply IMPOSSIBLE to understand. Only read this book if you already hate your fellow man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, Not bad, Just average","review":"Their Eyes Were Watching God is not a bad book. Indeed, it is adequately written, characters are fleshed out well, and the storyline is at times compelling. The big problem is that this book is touted as great literature- and it is not. I think alot of the adulation the book has received is more about the author's race than the quality of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult","review":"Like a large number of the reviewers here I was required to read this book for my English class. It was very difficult to get into it. It was near plotless and the dialect gets old very quickly. I couldn't stay focused on the story. I didn't see any substance in it. I can see why some people enjoy this book, but I don't think most people would. The thing I found most annoying about this book was the frequent jumping between southern dialect and the standard literary 40-letter-word vocabulary. They just don't go together very well. It shocks me that they expect highschoolers to read, comprehend, and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is horrible","review":"My highschool class had to read this in class so due to the many people in our public schools who can hardly read this took us about a month and a half to read. The story didn't start off good for me because its a book written mainly for women and I am a man who enjoys a Tom Clancy novel well I felt that it also puts down the African American race by making it look as if most African Americans are like Tea Cakes who is a run around or the judge who beats his wife and treats her about as good as a slave (which isn't good at all). This book in my opinion is smut and if I where African American I'd be upset that people said this book showed the struggle of the African american it does not it does show many steryotypes similar to the ones that the movie hollywood shuffle fought against I'm sorry if that step on some toes but thats my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality novel","review":"This book is a great book, highly recommended for anyone interested in early days of America. While I don't want to give out so much information that it will spoil the book for you, I'll tell you that this book is situated around a woman named Janie. Janie is a young woman who had struggled all her teenage life to find a loving man. She soon marries a man who sets off to a new town in southern Florida and becomes a mayer of the town.The book, being set in an African American town, has context in an African American voice, so it may be hard for the younger ones to understand the context fully, but its not a killer to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in African American life in the era after the end of slavery. The book has some boring parts, but is ultimately a very touching novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"I didn't even finish the book because the slang dialogue was too complex. I hate when authors fill so many pages with slang because sometimes it makes it way too hard to understand or keep one's attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"The context of this novel is not nerely as important as the amazing manner in which it is written. Some people find the dialect confusing, and sometimes it can be, but in the end it only served to enrich to the story. The main character, Janie's need to \\"go to the horizon and back\\" and her stuggle to find the life she wants is told perfectly, and, unlike other Harlem Renaissance works, it is something that everyone of every race can learn from and relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is a beautiful book.

I absoulutely enjoyed and will read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point is what, now?","review":"I (was forced to) read this book for an English class. I began reading, and found, within a very short period of time, that I really didn't care what Janie did with herself. There are so many great pieces of literature out there, so many truly meaningful, inciteful works, that this hardly seems the thing to be wasting the young impressionable minds of our high schoolers on. It might be a decent read, but certainly not comparable to a Melville, Bradbury, or Richard Wright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of talent","review":"This book was a huge disappointment for me. Janie, as the main character, should be the most well-rounded character in the novel, but she is so flat and two-dimensional that I honestly didn't care what happened to her. Even the mule was more interesting than she was. Changes in attitude come out of left-field (she decides that she hated her grandmother all along in the course of three sentences, contrary to all previous evidence), and so much time was spent describing her unparalleled beauty that it left me nauseous.The worst part for me was that Hurston was obviously a very talented writer. Every once and a while, there would be a flash of brilliance in the narration that would make me smile, but the bland main character and generally predicatable plot left me wishing Hurston had spent less time being poetic and more on developing Janie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Over-Rated!","review":"It is a mystery why people think this is such a great book. Perhaps I'm not \\"artsy\\" enough, but I fail to see the genious in this book. Aside from the colloquial jargon, which I admit, takes talent (but is very annoying), there is nothing that can keep this book up to the level of Faulkner's work (which it has been compared to). The plot is extremely linear and predictable, not to mention unbelieveable; that storm scene is so fake it came across as humorous. The main characters bother me, they make situations worse, for example: Sethe should've waited for a man she loved insead of jumping into situations. I know people make mistakes, but she never seemed to learn from them. I don't know why schools make students read this, it's a waste of time. There are many books of the same genre that are MUCH better, like Toni Morrison's Beloved (or any of her books for that matter). Beloved is deeper, more artistic, and more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I had been looking for","review":"My mother said she had been searching for a hard bound copy of this book for years.I found it on your website and ordered it.It got here very quickly and was in excellant shape.It looked so good it was hard to tell it was not used.It came so quick I was able to give it to her on time for Mothers day.thanks Donna"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Eyes Were Watching God","review":"Good book.

But giving a lover the freedom to bloom means you will hold them forever, and they will possess your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sensation of this book is definately on fire.","review":"In the book, \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\", Zora Neale Hurston paints a picture of reality, what life will teach you and it's rewards. How allowing someone to have some restrictions on your life (especially when you have no say so) will teach you to go for what you know and what your heart tells you. If going against the grain will make you stonger and happier, then go for it. BUT, you must be able to face the consequences, good or bad, with your head up high."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books","review":"I rarely re-read books - as there are so many books I haven't gotten to yet! - but my copy of Their Eyes Were Watching God is well-worn.

I can see myself opening the CD to a random spot in the book and enjoying it all over again.Give this book a full chance. Skip the opening chapter if necessary and come back to it later.

Great ideas and a new sound that had never been heard before. I am sure everyone remebers the bossa nova and its international success, which ended up changing the modern jazz sound.

The band is very comfortable, and real leather. The metal watch clasp also has the Star Wars logo indented on it. I recommend this item for any fan of the films that doesn't want a watch that looks like a child's. The box that accompanies the watch is extremely luxurious.

But my complaint is the same - if you want to start to understand, learn and apply rules, the grammar is spread all over the place, and only part of it - the 'easier' bits - seems to be included in the book at all. It does a bit of the accusative, eg., but not the more complicated aspects, and nowhere does it bring all the rules applying to any case together in one place, so you're left guessing a bit what the rules might be (eg. instrumental). If you wanted a phrase book, you'd buy a phrase book. You can learn some vocab, of course, but it's hard to apply it more broadly without the knowledge of the grammar to do so. The CDs are useful as far as they go, but they're not great. It's OK, but I'd expect more for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great winter read!","review":"I loved this book even though I wasn't alive during that time.

I want tell you anymore, you'll have to read the book to find out. Artemis might be highly intelligent but he's no athlete. He is a criminal.

Holly Short enlists his help in foiling Opal Koboi's plan to get revenge on those that foiled her last plan and to expose the humans to the fairy world. Artemis has one trick up his sleeve in order to help him to remember the fairy world. At the beginning of the book he is trying to steal a valuable piece of artwork though at the end he happens to go on the straight and narrow.

I only owned the first three which he read in a week, and then he began nagging me to add the newest book to my collection. I'm a sucker for anything that will get kids to read, so I ordered it. He read it in one night and said that it was great. Since then his \\"word-of-mouth\\" advertising about the book has resulted in at least six more kids reading the whole series. Based on the number of girls that have requested to borrow it, it appeals to both boys and girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book!!","review":"I LOVE the Artemis Fowl books. They are magical, with all the fantasy of fairies, trolls and pixies. The author also manages to come up with something entirely new and different each time. This book is no exception. Although written for younger teens, just like Harry Potter is, this book is also fine for adults, if you don't mind a dwarf that propels himself by farting in the underground, as a means of escape, or in other aspects as well.If you read the other Artemis Fowl books, I highly recommend this book as well. If you haven't read the other Artemis Fowl books, I recommend doing so first before attempting this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was.....","review":"great!

Artemis's true character along with many others seem to really come out in this book. My favorite characters were Holly Short and Artemis. I must admit, however, the commander who replaced Root fit well as kind of the antagonist as well as Opal Koboi. If you don't remember who she is or you don't remember much about book two, you might want to reread the first three books. This book really enhances the trilogy. I wouldn't be surprised, however, if there's at least one more book coming in the series. It almost seemed kind of like a new adventure was about to start at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Report","review":"I am definitely in the minority here but I could not get into this book. I tried twice and managed to get about one quarter of the way through it, largely because the Yahoo Bookworms' book group is reading it. Alas, eventually I told myself that life is short and I can't be bothered reading something that I don't like!What I did like about the book was the concept of a criminal teenage protagonist, and I liked the cloning aspect and the basic plot. What I didn't like was the characters. I just couldn't stand Artemis and found him to be elusive and not that well developed.Surprising because I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I expected to liked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"\\"Man is coming to the center of the Earth.\\" This is bad news for the fairy people who live in the Earth's core.

Will man discover the existence of fairies?Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception by Eoin Colfer is a fast-paced and very imaginative fantasy book. It takes place on the surface and in the center of the Earth and is from the point of view of an omniscient narrator.

(FIVE STARS)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the last one","review":"I didn't like the Eternity Code because I had expected Artemis to go back to his old ways but instead it was just basically a repeat of the much better Arctic Incident. This one however was much better and I was happy to see the return of one of my favourite characters, Opal Koboi [I like a good villain]. Despite her evil plot making no sense at all, the action of the book was very entertaining and the plot was occasionally shocking. There's the death of a big character in this book, almost as surprising as the one in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and you'll be very surprised with Holly's decision at the end of the book.All in all, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A no-nonsense guide to music career success","review":"A few years back, Angela Beeching (my dear colleague at New England Conservatory down the road) wrote a \\"Career Guide for Musicians\\". I was very impressed at how resourceful the guide was. Well, she finally got the chance to flesh out that first guide and \\"Beyond Talent\\" is the result. While ably covering all the nut & bolts of music career success (networking, building your image, recording, performing and raising support), the chief value of the book lies in the wisdom Beeching brings to creative career development. She understands the psychological profile of the career musician and that understanding shines through every page of her book.In addition, Beeching tackles lesser-explored subjects geared to her primary readership of classical and jazz musicians: residency programs, performance health, teaching and grant opportunities. Up to date and immensely practical, Beyond Talent should be on the bookshelf of all career musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Informative Guide!","review":"Angela Beeching's \\"Beyond Talent\\" is a must-have book for musicians -- both young musicians who aspire to a career, and working musicians who wish to be more successful.

This one too closely mirrors the reality I see and read about in western society everyday.If I want to see drug addicted losers with no morals all I have to do is view the world that surrounds me on any given day.So I give the movie two stars not for the acting, but for the content.I don't find a story line that features druggies and the drama that surrounds their lives particularly intriguing or entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Audio","review":"Perhaps we rented a bad copy, but I missed at least 30% of the conversations because of a combination of strong Aussie accent combined with use of Aussie slang that I couldn't translate quickly enough and just plain bad audio.

The noir feel was beautifully crafted with the costumes, scenery, and stereotypical characters. Megan Fox played her role perfectly, with the 'demure, soft spoken but gutsy' typical nior heroine, opposite Rourke's 'sleezy, washed up, bitter' hero. I will say that the romance between them was a bit difficult to watch, but I'm just not into beautiful 20-something year olds and 60 year old skeevy men.The story's fantastical elements, which should have felt more cheesy, were strangely compelling.

Beautiful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars for a bleak picture that doesn't add up","review":"The first thing you notice about this bleak story of another time and place is the brown and grey sets and costumes. Everything from the building to the clothing to the interiors is all drab. So from the start, you know this isn't going to be any fun. I find it hard to believe that even children are so subdued that they can't play or even chase a ball past certain artificial boundaries. I was also waiting patiently for a reason why these now young adults can't just walk away from their fate of organ donation and ultimate death. Perhaps this is spelled out in the novel from which it originated but to me, it's just a big hole in the plot. Anyway the acting is fine, especially some of the children that control most of the first half of the film. Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley were good and Carey Mulligan almost saves the film as Kathy. In the end however, it's just a somber, bleak version of the world that doesn't make a lot of sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never let me watch this again.","review":"Don't watch this video unless you want to feel a constant sense of depression throughout the entire viewing.

This is nightmarish beyond belief! Think Nazism. Think Satanic ritual killing. Think of the most sadistic, hellish concept imaginable; you have no right to your life, you belong to someone else who tells you why you exist and when and how you will die. The reviewers who think this is a meditation on what it means to be human completely miss that this is a horror story beyond belief and indulge in the type of thinking that enabled and empowered the most evil regimes of history, especially the 20th century regimes of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Amin, Pol Pot, ad nauseum. A pox on all your houses!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"The acting was very believable, however the subject matter was so depressing that it was difficult to watch. I wanted there to be a happy ending......."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit incomplete, but effectively thought-provoking","review":"The movie does not make it entirely clear as to who started this program, how many were involved, and why none of the unfortunate donors can ever strike out on their own and leave England altogether. (Perhaps they were being tracked via the microchips that set off the sensors?)However, the rest of the story is very sad, thought-provoking, and emotional without being syrupy or preachy at any point. The three leads do a great job of showing the anguish of these ill-fated young people, whose sole purpose is to donate organs. (I am not spoiling anything--this info is on the back of the DVD box.) Imagine what it would be like to be one of them and know that you are going to die before you turn 30 because of repeated donations.There is no reason for an R rating for this movie, incidentally."},{"rating":"2","title":"We All Complete, So We All Care","review":"I'm older. I'll be completing soon. Did I have free will? If I did, did I use it wisely? Will my life have been worth anything? This is a devastatingly sad movie, along the lines of the great 1983 classic Testament. If you are not moved by this film (you will be) you have no soul. Without a soul, what worth are we? This film is a great work of art in that it illustrates the nobility of humanity. The moral I take from the film is that we must all love our neighbors as ourselves, no matter what government or science dictate. We must elevate humanity. We are not just matter and energy. We should all be noble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"This movie has an interesting premise and overall message. Without giving anything away, I can say the story is very good, albeit a bit slow. This is not a movie to watch after a long work-day, but rather, on a weekend or cozy evening.The cinematography looks beautiful.

This is the most depressing movie in the history of movies. The studio tried to market it as a \\"haunting\\" movie about eternal love. And then they wondered why it didn't make any money.

To call this a \\"movie\\" is simply false advertising as no one moves. If I found out that I was the victim of a nationwide conspiracy to use my organs without my permission, not only would I move I would make sure some of the evil snots went down with me. I would slay - Conan the Barbarian style- every last one of the conspirators I could get my hands on.

The clones accept their fate and do nothing about it. The clones do nothing and nothing happens in the film.This flick could have used a bit of drama, action, kung fu, conflict resolution...ANYTHING to pick up the pace and make something happen.Great concept but there should have been something; a revolt (you're not taking my organs!), showing the anguish that a life exists just to aid somebody else, something!This was the wrong approach for this movie.I was completely disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry guys its just a dumb idea","review":"Visually Great, acting solid-story is flat out stupid.The problem is the whole idea that clones would be treated worse than cattle is such a flimsy idea unsupported in any way the whole pile of garbage falls on itself.

SPOILER ALERT: My instincts tell me that every group would produce a few bad apples that would not march obediently off the cliff and they would spoil the whole barrel.While it is true that we shall all die, being treated like produce who exist merely for medical benefit of unseen strangers is bound to bring the survival instinct to bear.

Story line barely believable. In this movie's society, for people to know the horror of their fate and not act upon it stretches reason to the breaking point. Had this been placed in a Sci Fi setting, or a Nazi prison camp, it might have been a riveting drama.

When I got it, a friend said it was very sad, so I immediately figured out what it was about. The acting by Mulligan was superb. I really felt her scenes. The production values were first class. But I asked myself repeatedly as I watched the film, why did the protagonists not run away? It makes no sense to me why they stayed under those conditions.

I was practically screaming, \\"Why don't you just cut off the bracelets and leave?\\" I mean really? That is the biggest problem I had with the movie, because all of the characters seemed a little too comfortable and accepting of their circumstances and eventual fate, no one tried to run or fight. If it had been set in the 50's, like it kind of looked like it was, I would have been slightly more accepting of the premise, but otherwise I just couldn't accept the plot.

I would have been more interested in seeing how the program really worked then looking at the pathetic, doomed, love trio drama.

That the author made a profit should be a crime. I'm always frustrated how sick minds can often be so imaginative and creative at the same time. For people (sheeple, actually) to accept their fate as these clones did without even attempting to live their own lives is completely ridiculous.And then to make a movie! Oh, please; spare us the agony! The actors and actresses would seem to have been desperate for work to participate in this Sham. (Pun intended)For me to enjoy a movie, it should meet at least one of these criteria: entertaining, funny, riveting, enlightening, edifying, or educational.

One doesn't care about any of the numerous characters. The narrator Augie isn't likable, and the so called adventures are nothing but a long string of stories that amount to nothing. Bellow seems to try to use every word he knows and in ways you've never heard in sentences that don't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club Bomb","review":"This book is long, overly descriptive, and difficult to read due to the constant addition of characters many of whom come and go without giving the reader a chance to care about them. There are chapters and characters that are more compelling than others - but it seems rather hit or miss. Also, more than once I found myself a page or two into a description when I realized that I couldn't remember who or what was being described. The worst part was spending energy and time, page after page only to have it end abruptly and seemingly without purpose.

And no, it is NOT because I'm a slow reader. I've managed to plow through long or \\"difficult\\" novels with nary a hitch. Augie's picaresque adventures, however, make both \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and the unabridged version of The Count of Monte-Cristo seem like Hemmingway's terse prose. Saul Bellow manages to place you, gentle reader, in an alternate BIZZARO universe where time passes while events around you unfold at breakneck speed. During Dingbat's stint as manager for the sea-sick boxer, I happened to observe the sun and clouds race across the sky as they invariably do in cheesy B-movie remakes of H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\". My young bride was an aged crone by the time that dang lizard came around.I want my life back! What the?

He is taken along on a trip to smuggle people form Canada, goes along with his brother's whims and practically marries a woman chosen for him, goes to the shore with an employer, who wants to adopt him, runs off to Mexico with a strange woman and her eagle, ends up in Europe with yet another woman he doesn't say no to, and finds that marriage is less than he would have wanted. He doesn't seem to be able to take control of his own life. Undoubtedly there are many people like this, good hearted with a streak of innocence, but winding up with something less than success. And throughout the book one can see Bellow's disenchantment with rampant Capitalism, which is evident with the successful men in Augies experiences. I like Augie, and I sympathize with him. It's a good read . . get to know him, and learn about yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and tedious","review":"I'm sure it's really a masterpiece and that I have no patience, but I felt I was waiting for the story to really start.

I just wanted the book to get started and it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"More perspiration than inspiration...","review":"There seems to be a lot of hyperbolic praise for this book...and I can't figure out why. I gave it five stars, true, but, in terms of all-time, world-class literature...it barely breaks the surface. A better bildungsroman--by far--is Of Human Bondage. I recommend the book, but it won't be a transformative experience, or a tour-de-force that will leave you open-mouthed.

My mistake was reading reviews on this piece of junk AFTER it broke, instead of doing my research beforehand. Had I read up on it, I would've seen that everyone is having the same problem and Rival's customer service is not helpful. The store would not return it, since it was 1 week past the 90 day return policy and I don't care to get another Rival anyway. I would much rather pay the price for a new one by another brand.

After about six months of occasional use (we used it at most 20 times) it broke again - wouldn't turn on. Further troubleshooting traced the problem to a defect in the timer switch (love that multimeter). The warranty is a joke.

It has lasted quite a while considering how much we use it. It's element comes out using only one hand to lift it out of the oil. The pan is removable, and washable, which is a nice feature. It holds about six pieces of chicken at a time, not a whole chicken, unless you use a banty chicken. Even if you pour oil past the recommended oil line, it won't hold a whole chicken, I tried. If you stuff too much chicken in at a time, it won't cook evenly. The recovery time on heating oil after you take out a batch of cooked food is quick.

The author talks a lot about these strategy cards, and it seems like they are central to the book's intents. However, the strategy cards are nowhere to be found on the kindle edition! The tables are impossible to read on the kindle - the print is extremely tiny, and you can't increase the font size.

Gives, as all these guides do, a quick overview of what is involved in playing Video Poker. Then she delves into the deeper aspects of choice of game which is based on the printed paytable and its implied \\"expected return\\" and volatility level. You see some games while having very attractive payoffs for those very rare hands, require a substantially higher bankroll to play with a reasonable expectation of achieving the theoretical long-term payoff while others with lower payoffs (but more frequent) require less bankroll. Lots of tables are included containing all the really essential stuff sought after by the serious Video Poker player. Now if you are NOT a serious player, this book can still be a valuable investment because there are removable strategy cards at the end of the book covering all the most common machines.

However, the CD is literally by \\"2Pac + Outlawz.\\" This is not a 2pac album (ie. no 2pac solo, not enough 2pac for the CD to be credited just to him.) If this CD had a bit more 2pac, and a few tracks with artists other than the Outlawz this CD would have been 5 stars. 2Pac and the Outlawz are a good combination, but dedicating a whole CD to the group takes to much of the spotlight off of 2Pac. Also, the solo song by the Outlawz is very out of place. They got a solo on the CD but 2pac didn't. This is the only time on the CD that it is not true to the title of the group as seen on the cover. Overall though, this is an excellent CD with an often insightful lyrical contribution by 2pac. The posthumous nature of the CD is not detectable through the high-energy performance of the fallen star."},{"rating":"2","title":"2Pacalypse Yet Again","review":"To cut a long story short, this album simply proves that 2Pac was and is still one of the best rappers of all time.

The album has it's moments with Highspeed, and Letter to the President, but as far as releashing such albums as \\"All EYEZ ON ME\\" or \\"MAKAVELI\\", the producer's must be waiting for 2000 to releash something good.

Either way, this is a nice pan, and works and fits well plus no more oil leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEATS,BEATS,BEATS!","review":"NO DOUGHT I LIKE MR POOKIE AND ALL WE REP.

It is comfortable and is not hot during the summer heat.

You -can- do yoga, without being a \\"circus performer\\", (as is mentioned in the book). As there is no unecessary physical extreme here, there is also no judgement of motive: You want to do yoga / you have your reasons / yoga is good / any motives to do yoga are good motives.

I did received the box, with the jewelry box inside. The problem was that when I opened the jewelry box, there was nothing inside! That is correct, it was empty! My guess is someone in the wharehouses took it from the box before shipping it, but I will never know... The worst thing was that this was supposed to be a gift for my wife for Christmas.Now, the Amazon service was kind enough to try to re-send it as soon as they could, but it will not arrive before tommorrow, which is Dec. 27, way after Christmas!

Several problems with this author, but two big ones are-why is everything so drawn out? Holy god an editor from an earlier (better) era would slash this story to ribbons. And it's just so ineptly structured and completely stale. Coben dialogue is strictly cliche spoken by carboard 'characters'. Unfathomably dull. Incomprehensibly bad. Yikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy","review":"Loved this book. It keeps the attention and although there are many \\"coincidences\\" and close escapes from death it makes for good reading. The characters were fully fleshed out as well. It is a page turner, but one with real writing quality. It's my first Coban book and I will definitely be reading others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be a big fan","review":"I've read all of Harlan Corben's books and thought they were witty, imaginative and a great read. My husband & I picked up the unabridged audio CD version for a long drive this week. It was so awful we stopped listing to it and tried the AM stations. Very disappointing. The plot wasn't bad but the dialog was awful and rehashed the same thing from 2 or 3 perspectives. It was like he added about 200 pages of superfilous dialog to make up the word count."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T listen to the audiobook!","review":"I have to be honest and say that I haven't quite finished this book yet, but wanted to warn anyone who is thinking of purchasing the audio book of The Innocent. I typically love audio books...they make my 35-minute commute go by so quickly. This one, however, is so over-detailed and TEDIOUS, that I'm tempted to go out and find the hard copy instead of finishing the audio version. I tend to be a skimmer, and this is one book that I would probably skim through at least half of if I had the opportunity. The whole time I'm listening to it I just want to yell \\"Get on with it!\\"The story is okay so far, I guess. From reading the other reviews it sounds like I've already made it through the best part and it's all downhill from here....fabulous. Harlan Coben is not one of my top 10 authors anyway and I'll definitely never make the mistake of trying to listen to one of his books again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is missing","review":"I can tell you that the main plot is thrilling. The problem is where you can find it. The book goes out of the main story so many times that you almost forget what you're reading. The book's end lacks in wits, HC just got out of ideas and finished the book like a fairy tale: Everybody found what they wanted and lived happily ever after. That's not the way to finish this book because this book has a potential to a paramount end no matter if it's merry or not.Query: Which were the good guys?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read full of twists and turns!","review":"some advice: do not take a lot of breaks while reading this novel-- you will become confused! i read the book in about a week, and found myself referring to previous chapters and events to refresh my memory. this was my first Coben novel, and it won't be my last.http://www.lehrerin.us/books.htmlfor more of my reviews!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sustained Suspense","review":"Fast paced page turner all the way through, with plenty of rich characters and plot twists along the way. My only problem was with the conclusion. There were many, many loose ends of very complicated relationships, and every single one of them was tied off completely and in a fashion that the only missing line might be \\"and they lived happily ever after\\". This was satisfying in one way -- happy endings are okay. But with these tough people in the awful situations they faced all the way through the book, I expected a few tough things unresolved, as in real life. Anyway I'd recommend the book, since Coben's style and pace are great, his dialogue never flags and keeps the tension high throughout"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced thriller","review":"Having read Tell No One and No Second Chance, I was anxious to read The Innocent. I finished it in one sitting. It was fast-paced with lots of twists and turns. Just go with it and you won't be disappointed. A good way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out as a 5-star thriller, ended as a 2-star snoozer","review":"The first 25 or 30 chapters, Coben had me. Not that his writing is really notable or even that great, but he is a master of drawing you in, then as each chapter ends, he reveals another tiny part of the mystery to propel you in to the next chapter.That's the good news. The bad news is that this novel basically fizzles out about half way through. Improbable character motivations, unrealistic law enforcement situations, and the ultimate no-no, a convoluted plot that crashes and burns in the end.I really wanted to like this book but the unbelievable writing ultimately sinks it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Confused","review":"This book started out to be interesting, and then halfway through - became a little muddy, and towards the end - completely confusing. You will need to create a flow chart to keep up with the jagged plot.There are so many characters who are introduced without going into depth, that I kept wondering who each one was, and what was his/her part in the story. I realize it is only a novel, but it went from being somewhat believable to sounding more like a story that a first-grader would spin - it just became more ridiculous and silly.I realize that most of Mr. Coben's fans disagree with my rating, but I like a book - even a novel - to have some semblance of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING AND TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE!","review":"I have to agree with reader/reviewer,\\"Confused\\", that you need a flow chart to keep track of the characters and their doings in this book. I liked the first 2/3 of the book, but then the plot started branching all over the place. The motives of the characters weren't clear to me, and there were so many poorly developed characters that I couldn't keep their stories straight. Even though I took extra care to read slowly and comprehend, when I was done with the book, I couldn't tell you who did what--nor did I really care anymore. I have read thousands of books of this genre through the years, but this one just got ridiculous. I've read Coben's other books with enjoyment. I realize that this is not the popular opinion of this book, but it's mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted pasts","review":"One squeeze too hard on the throat of another college student, was all it took to ruin the life of Matt Hunter, a 20 year old student, who was involved in a fatal bar room brawl. Matt was sent to jail for 4 years, completely altering his life, his prospects and his plans to become a lawyer. After meeting and marrying his lovely wife, Olivia, everything seemed to go wrong:just as they discover that Olivia is pregnant, vile photos, seemingly picturing Olivia with another man, appear on Matt's cell phone. Olivia reveals her rather sordid past to Matt and then their world collapses with murders, beatings and threats to involve Matt with other crimes, because of his past record and involvement with a pair of crooked FBI men. A major part of the story takes place in Reno and is connected with a team of erotic dancers with whom Olivia was formerly entangled. The ending became a tad too busy for my taste, but I still give the book 4 stars for an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this book","review":"did not meet up to Harlen Coben standards. Very hokey. I like the father but not the son in these books. This was just plain awful. Typically I love Harlan Coben and have read about 20 of his books. This one...would not suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good example of a Harlan Coben novel","review":"I have read almost every Coben novel. With The Innocent, I found that I lost interest about one half way through and by the three quarter mark, I really didn't care what happened to the main characters. I found the main character naive and his wife a constant boor. The plot was convoluted and certainly not plausible. It was though Coben tried to fill up space with loads of unnecessary twists. I finally finished it but was exhausted from the struggle. I'll continue to read this author, however and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many tangents","review":"The book starts like gang busters and grabs your attention. Then, as you keep reading chapter after chapter, Coben goes off on tangents that quite frankly don't add a lot to the story. I found myself doing a lot of skimming to get back to the story of Matt and Olivia. In the end, the story comes to a good conclusion. But getting there -- took a lot of patience. I would not read it again knowing what I know now."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful","review":"This was a page turner. From the very beginning it has you trying to figure out where it is going and why. Even towards the end when you think all the pieces to the puzzle fit, there is another twist. Very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent","review":"The Innocent by Harlan Coben is another fine example of this great author's storytelling mastery. Coben weaves an intricate tale of suspense that is multi-faceted and complicated, yet easy to follow all at the same time. Coben is one of the finest suspence/thriller/mystery writers in the market. The characters in this book are all very well-rounded and realized. They each have flaws, and yet that is one makes each of them all the more accessible. I rated this book four stars based on the fact that it was a fun read and a wild ride. This is a great way to spend some time. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Me Up All Night!","review":"I'd never heard of Coben when I grabbed this during a recent trip to Barnes & Noble. Little did I know that I'd be compelled to read the entire thing in one day/night. The term \\"page turner\\" is used way too freely in book reviews, but \\"The Innocent\\" certainly qualifies. Coben hooks you immediately and never lets up. The reason I resisted giving it the full five stars is the same as cited by previous reviewers: one too many plot twists at the end. The whole thing winds up feeling just a wee bit contrived. But that shouldn't stop you from reading this. Just don't plan on getting any sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Formulaic But A Formula That Works -- 4 1/2 Stars!","review":"For the fourth consecutive novel, Coben relies on his proven formula in which the main character's happy life is upended by some event that the reader can relate to. This formula is one that, for the most part, works big time. The plot devices used in The Innocent, while similar to those in each of his books since Tell No One, are suspenseful, full of twists and turns and will keep the pages flying through your finger tips. The characters are interesting and well-developed, although they require you to suspend belief perhaps a bit too much. Another minor criticism - and I stress MINOR--is that as a result of The Innocent following the same basic formula of Coben's previous three books, it lacks some of the originality I earlier had come to expect from this very talented author. Nonetheless, The Innocent is well-worth reading, very engrossing and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last page. Fasten your seat belts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first 2/3's and then a little messy","review":"I'm not going to repeat what everyone has already written, but I have to say that for 350 pages, Coben had me on the edge of the seat reading like I was in thrillers heaven. Then things started to unravel and then artistic license began to creep and then unbelievability evolved into \\"you gotta be kidding me\\".But okay, it's a thrill ride that doesn't stop - not even for the parts that are too coincidental to be possible. Take it to the beach or on a plane and when you're done, you won't remember it, but you'll have passed away a couple of hours without looking up from the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"An established author settles for less","review":"I'll start with something positive...I loved early Harlan Coben books. The characters were well drawn, dialogue sharp and the plot sizzled. This novel, however, didn't do it for me. The story was weighed down with so much backstory and needless description, I couldn't relate to or care for the characters. Budding writers are given guidlines to follow if they want to be published (weave in description, limit back story information, show don't tell...the list goes on). Coben, as a seasoned writer, pretty much breaks every rule with The Innocent. Guess the publishers let these important points slide just because he's an established writer. Don't waste your money on this one. Wait until he goes back to the basics and gets it right again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review of The innocentby Harlan Coban","review":"This was my first contact with the writing of Mr. Coban, and I started reading the prologue while walking from my mailbox, into the kitchen and on to my favorite chair without lifting my eyes from the pages. The book was fast paced, interesting and had a thousand quirks and turns. I felt sorry for the protaganist, wished him luck and was happy with the final outcome. It was a book I could not put down until I turned the final page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great - 3.5 Stars","review":"Matt Hunter served time in prison for an accident that wasn't his fault. Upon release, he tries to put his life back together and seems to have done so, until he gets a picture sent to him on his camera phone. The picture is of his wife and his life starts to unravel. The novel is very entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, Harlan believes that his readers are only reading his books for the trick endings, so he throws in one too many tricks and the book seems not merely contrived, but also disjointed.I am a fan of Harlan Coben, but I am concerned that he is now writing books to merely try to trick the reader as much as possible. I would rate the books as 3.5 stars because it is a 4-5 star book throughout, but then the end is thrown together so quickly and haphazardly, that the book falls below four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"A potboiler whose pace quickens and thickens only because its story stretches taut over a mindfield of plot contrivances and utterly incredible coincidences. A white-nuckle light read? Yes. Memorable mystery? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than his best","review":"I did not care for \\"Just One Look\\" and had high hopes for this one. I was disappointed. Coben is good but this is simply not up to some of his best in the past.You will be entertained with a tangled plot but perhaps I expect too much.Lots of surprises and a review of the plot would take multiple paragraphs. I would not discourage your reading the book, just know that it is not up to par in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Angst is My Angst!","review":"Poor Matt Hunter! Just when he was getting his life back together his personal freedom is again in jeopardy!Harlen Coben knows how to catch you by the throat and not let go until the final sentence. Keep the Advil handy! Story is a bit convoluted, but if you read carefully, you will not lose the drift.All the way through this book, my heart went out to Matt. He endured, took a lot of hits, but survived it all. And it all begins with a drunken college party!More characters in this book that you can shake a stick at and keeping them all in order takes a lot of concentration. But it is all worth it in the end and Coben again writes one heck of a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very brief","review":"I happened to be searching for another Harlan Coben novel and wanted to see the reviews on The Innocent. (I had picked this one up at a free book giveaway and wanted to try another.) There were no reviews! It's been a few months since I read it, but I have to give it high praise. I like Wilbur Smith, Dan Brown, Jonathan Kellerman, Robin Cook, John Grisham etc. The Innocent is a novel about a young college student who tries to break up a fight and accidently kills another student he'd never met. He ends up in a maximum security prison for 4 years. When he comes out he's disillusioned and pessimistic. He chance-meets the mysterious young lady he'd almost forgotten about, but that he'd met in Vegas, before his prison nightmare. She's lovely, but does she have a history? There's plenty of suspense, secrecy, psychology, and a bit of action. I consider this a very well written book because all the mini-plots tie in together. I was totally shocked in the end. I feel I know the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo go Harlan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We are 5 funny women who call ourselves TNT for Thurdsday night tennis.

I had never been so riveted by a book, and had never even heard of this author before. I actively seek out his books now, and his latest, \\"The Innocent\\", does not disappoint. In his protagonist, Matt Hunter, Coben creates a main character who readers will immediately root for. The story continuously offers new twists and turns, that are impossible to figure out ahead of time. This is a fantastic summer read, and I truly, highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Groaner","review":"PUH-LEEEEEEEZE!I just finished this groaner.

I only got two months use out of the unit before it stopped working completely: no mist, lights or power. Honeywell makes wonderful humidifiers, but this model is a complete dud.I have a couple of tips for other unfortunate souls who are about to return this horrible humidifier. A rep from KAZ told me to send the unit in to their Return Department and they would replace it at no cost (although I have to pay for the shipping to KAZ). If you're returning one of these units, be sure to tell the rep to do the following: waive the $10 warranty fee, and send a different model of humidifier as a replacement. The rep I spoke to had no problem with either of these requests. Now, I'll just have to wait and see if they follow-thru on a good replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good product, but suffers from a fatal flaw","review":"I bought a new Honeywell Quicksteam (HWM-330) several months ago from a local store, to help keep our bedroom at a comfortable humidity. The humidifier worked well enough, but less than a week after we had been using it, the unit wouldn't turn on again the morning after we used it.We suspected the problem was that the unit burned out after having used up its water supply during the night. To their credit, Honeywell sent us a brand new unit after we sent the broken one back to them. But once again, the new unit died after running out of water overnight, less than a week after we had received our second unit.It would be one thing if they had advertised the unit as NOT having an auto shut-off feature. In that case, we never would have purchased it; however, we've had two units die after less than two weeks of CUMULATIVE use, and for the same reason. As such, I strongly recommend AGAINST purchasing this humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for 4 months","review":"We were happy with this humidifier for a short while, after 4 months, it does not work anymore, no light, no power, no warm mist.The warm mist is better than other types for few reasons:- Less germs, the water boils before getting into the air- No spare part, filter to buy every so often...- In winter, the warm mist warms your room as well, so you need less heat.- Quiet, I repeat QUIET. No like the fan things.Too bad this product is of such poor quality that after 4 month of light usage, it is dead.The product is manufactured by Kaz, and the warranty is pretty much useless as you have to pay for shipping and send a $10 check!!! What kind of warranty is that?So, to sum up my advice, buy a warm mist humidifier, but not this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after three weeks! Do not buy!

This is going out to the trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"Are you kidding? This thing is great. I have had mine for 2 years now. It produces lots of steam- it's 3 gallons for God's sake, dispenced in less than 18 hours if you like. It is easy to clean. The mineral pad placement is brilliant because it doesn't get anything else dirty and doesn't clog the machine. I broke the water container by accident last night and need another one.

But I love its white pretty design and really don't want to lose it.I tried to tear it apart and put it together again and again for 30 minutes. Magically.....it worked again! After that, I used it every night and never have problems any more. I was so happy that I save it back. It's quiet, functioned well and pretty. I never feel thirsty in the midnight or wake up with dry throat. I love this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy to fill","review":"The humidifier works well. It takes a few days of adjusting both dials to get the humidity set to the desired level. At first it will go through the water like crazy, but once you get it set right, it uses less. My only complaint and the reason I returned this is the tank is awkward to fill. The cap is on the underside, so after you fill it, it needs to be turned upside down to screw the cap on. The problem with that is the top of the tank is curved, so you need to make sure to hold it otherwise it will fall and spill. It is also heavy since it holds so much. I prefer theVicks UV 99.999% Germ Free Humidifier. It does cost more, but I think it is worth it. It has two tanks that hold a comparable amount of water in total and they are flat on the top so they can be set down when filling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great.... when they work..........","review":"I've had 2 of these already - in the past few years.

Then so as not to run out again, I bought this two cartridge set from Amazon for 27 dollars, a great buy compared to what I paid for one ink cartridge at Office Depot.Occasionally I use generic black ink from Databazaar with (so far) no ill effects. On text one won't notice much of a difference if any compared to OME, and on photos there might be a slight difference in sharpness and contrast. The main difference I've experienced is that the nonCanon ink cartridges have a noticeable shorter life.

Now that she's 4 months old, she actually starts cooing when she sees the cover and still likes looking at the pictures and the opened cutouts.I am not rating it 5 stars because the tabs are pretty difficult to open. It is a great book while parents are doing all of the opening and shutting for a small baby, but once the baby starts wanting to use her hands it's frustrating because it's too subtle of a design for her to do herself.

Gogol depicts the harsh and brutal brotherhood of the Russian Cossacks with a romantic splendor that is fun and easy to read.The book also serves as a great commentary on the lengths to which religious fervor and vengence will drive man.If you're a teacher, beware of studying this novel, as it reads like a primer on prejudice, anti-semitism and even misogyny, and surely many parents will want to challenge your choice.But that doesn't have to stop average readers from enjoying a great, old-fashioned adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romantic Rhapsody","review":"Gogol gives us in this little book a romantic snapshot from Russian history.

The overall characterization and theme of this book is very didactic (teaches socially and morally accepted lessons). I would prefer that 5th or 6th graders learn more about thought provoking issues. For instance, the characters (espically Dan) avoid realistic discussions and expressing their feelings about death. I mean really, those tornados killed dozens of people. Can it be possible that Dan did not know any of those victims?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging for both children and adults","review":"I read this book to a child I was baby- sitting, and much to my surprise, I became as enthralled with the story as he did.

He finds himself in New York City in \\"Little Moscow\\" with his deceased brother's girlfriend. The mob who was trying to kill his brother is now trying to kill him.

Worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Damme's best movie","review":"I am a fan of action movies, but I've found some of Van Damme's previous flicks (most notably, Knock Off), to be below average. After seeing this movie on TV, however, I was quite impressed and ended up buying it.As with most action movies, this one features a hero (Van Damme) who has to kick some butt, aided by a beautiful girl (Natasha Henstridge). The movie starts off with a pretty good car chase, followed by lots of scenes with guns firing and martial arts sequences. The plot isn't extensive -- Van Damme's character's twin brother is killed and he now assumes his twin's identity, only to be hounded by the Russian mafia and corrupt FBI agents.I've only seen the VHS version, so unfortunately I can't comment on the DVD sound and video quality. Nevertheless, this is a good standard action flick -- in my opinion, Van Damme's best movie (or at least it rivals Bloodsport), and I recommend it for any action movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goos Films Must Be Revisited","review":"If one contextualizes this film, Blockade revisits the Spanish Civil War and later the Hollywood Blacklist."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the grind you'll ever need","review":"With 136 tracks (yeah 136 freakin' tracks)this is pretty much all the grincore you'll ever need again. and since the \\"vocals\\" were done by different people each 12 tracks or so, its like hearing a different band each time. just dont let anyone else hear this album (they'll think you're insane)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good enough to travel with","review":"This was my first and I am sure last book by this author.The book is filled with Cliché after Cliché, followed by such character stereotypes that it just hurts.

But this book falls far short of the standard set by the earlier novels. I had to force myself to finish reading the whole book. The writing in places was terrible, almost amateurish in style and substance. There were many places where there were technical mistakes in the operation of simple machines such as a camp stove for one. Other mistakes in aircraft structure, assualt team tactics and others. I will say that the premise of the story was a good one, its just too bad the writing fell short.If the person reading the book had no knowledge of any of the various tools, aircraft, weapons and such, and also no experience with military training or tactics.....then they may enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Is it just me, or does anyone else think that when the Cusslers sit down to write a book they first bring out a huge box of crayola crayons and whenever the part comes to introduce a character they blindly pull out a crayon to describe the color of that chacters eyes.And why does Dirk Jr appear to be the oldest 20 something year old in the world. There is a huge problem when a now 70ish year old Cussler is writing a story whos characters are straight out of college.When the kids showed up in (I think it was Valhalla Rising or Atlantis) it should have ended with Dirk Sr excusing himself as the kids made there way touring his car collection in the hanger, and dirk retreating to his living area upstairs, grabbing a quick shot of scotch and pulling out that huge gun of his and putting it to him temple.

First, the plot is dynamic incorporating possible history into the present, a trademark of Cussler's. This has more than a touch of Korean politics involved. It does make for interesting conjecture. Secondly, the Pitt siblings have the major roles. Dirk and Al still are the eventual superstars.Finally, Clive's son apparently did some of the writing (how much is not specified).

I'm about a quarter of the way through Black Wind, and I can confidently say it's going to be worse than Trojan Odyssey, which is easily his worst book ever. Maybe it's the death of his wife, or maybe it's burnout, but Clive needs to give it a rest.

As if errors and fractured syntax weren't enough, excessive, flowery adjectives are littered through out the text. The mistakes are jarring and it is apparent that little attention was spent in either proof reading the text or in editing. One can only hope the majority of the text was produced by Junior and that the Senior Cussler will step up his faltering efforts.

After finishing the book within 2 days, I became his devout fan and quickly rushed off to grab a few more books. I just got hold of Black Wind recently, and boy oh boy.. I've never read such a boring book before. It took me more than a month to reach the last page and I did that by flipping through the pages after doing a quick scan of the contents. I was really very disappointed with the book. Cussler Jr murdered his father's fame! Cussler Jr tried to clone an Al junior but failed miserably. I don't find his cracks a bit funny at all. Al Giordino is my kind of superhero with his wisecracking jokes and perfect partner of Pitt Sr.I have read some reviews about the book before but I refuse to believe it and regretted spending my money on the book. Towards the end, I was still trying to convince myself to like the book .. but sorry, Clive, I've tried my best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Throughout the first three quarters of this book, (after which I took it back), I found myself thinking, \\"This is a bad imitation of a Clive Cussler.\\" Previous reviewers have pretty much said it all, so I'll be brief. Even discounting the appalling grammatical mistakes and inappropriate adverbs, for the first time ever in a Cussler book, I found the hero(ine)ridiculous and unsympathetic. Cussler's strength has always been his ability to make the most implausible of plot twists credible. This book totally missed the mark on all fronts, and I doubt would have been published at all without the Cussler name. I apologize to both Cusslers, but we all know you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disapointment","review":"I have always eagerly awaited each Clive Cussler novel and this was no exception. The story is classic Clive Cussler and by itself is fascinating, however, the writing is boring. To me, Clive Cussler did not write the book, his son did. The women \\"gush\\" and the men \\"snarl\\". It was so predictible! I even knew who the person was who was in the boat before they were even rescued.

Yes, I know the plots are boilerplates but that has never mattered to me. Dirk, Sr. and Al were lovable characters whose shenanigans and savoir-faire attitude were entertaining. Dirk, Jr. and Summer are shadows whose characters have not been explored in this book. [The authors' offhand mention of their origin leaves the reader at a loss.]What does matter to me is that this book is very poorly written. The numerous errors in style actually detract from the storyline so much that I raced through the book in an effort to finish it before the assault on my senses became overpowering.I do not know whether to lay this problem at the feet of Dirk Cussler, Clive Cussler or the editor (a new one, perhaps?). What I do know is that I will be very cautious before purchasing another Cussler book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book was an utter waste of time. Very pooly written for a novel of this genre. The situations and ways out of them not just unlikely but utterly and fantastically impossible.

What WAS Clive thinking?","review":"I'm very saddened and disappointed in this book. I have read EVERY one of Clive's novels that feature Dirk Pitt, and this is definitely the poorest specimen I've ever seen. I have a very hard time believing that Clive even wrote much (or read it before it went to print) much less allowing his name to be put on it (so it would sell?) - he must be allowing his son to venture into writing (hope he doesn't give up his day job) without worrying about his reputation as an author.

The writing was stilted, the dialog an absolute nightmare, and the women were pathetic. I am not a flaming feminist, but not one of the female characters had any strength when around men...the message sent was, \\"just leave it to the men honey, we'll take care of you.\\" At times it felt like the book was a poorly done rip off of a conglomeration of James Bond movies. I went back and forth from being bored to laughing out loud at the absurdity being sold to me. If this is what Cussler and son are going to produce I suggest we all save our money.

The authors reverse compass headings, put forth impossible time lines, use inaccurate terms for machinery and technological matters, and use common words improperly.This book reads like it was written by a high school student on the Sunday evening before it was due, with all the incompetence and lack of diligence implied.Perhaps the person at fault is the editor; I don't know.

You're not picking up a Clive Cussler novel for deep, thought-provoking substance.

I wish I had the book in front of me to directly quote the last sentence I read but it sounded like something you'd hear in a really, really, really bad action movie. It doesn't even approach being kitchie, if that was his intent.This is a really, really bad action novel/autobiographical fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Wind","review":"Anything Clive Cussler writes is so worth reading in my opinion.

His subjects are so within my specific tastes of adventure and suspense! I will read him any day! Keep writing Clive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!

What cannot be excused are the unrealistic responses to dangerous situations the characters constantly encounter and yet, are able to escape with little or no consequences. The use of Deus Ex Machina can only be forgiven in extreme cases--this is not one of them.The characters are two dimensional in their perfection as well as their near invulnerability. They have no flaws which is an impossibility.

Imagine your most boring, nasal impaired, sleep producing college professor -- that's the guy narrating. There is also an irritating \\"ding\\" every time a translation occurs.

At first, Steve is sent back exactly as he is, only not dead. But then Lucifer appears, complaining that the set up's not fair, because it would be too easy for Steve to get a woman to fall in love with him. That's when God, at Satan's suggestion, turns Steve into a woman, forcing him to have to get a woman to love him for who he (she?) really is. And off we go! I especially loved the way it ended.

The humanity of the characters (including a retired policeman from earlier novels who was a young man when Hillerman started writing, a young police man and woman who are falling for each other, and the people involved in the murder and the tragedy of their lives) is well expressed.

If ANY little dust or grit gets under the screen protector, and it will since there is a slight amount of play in the protector's fit, it will be held there and be constantly rubbed against the screen.

The device had help to dig some permanent marks into the PSP screen itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For PSP Owners!","review":"I bought this PSP screen protector as an alternative to the stick-on style I had before I swapped my faceplate. With stick-on protectors, you're always going to get lint and dust stuck to it before you even put it on the screen, no matter how hard you try.

I bought this product and not only was the packing terrible and was horribly scratched when I got it but when I put it on just for kicks before I returned it, it gave off a rainbow effect on the screen and actually scratched it. Screen protectors do not protect your screen! They are made of cheap plastic. You wouldn't wrap your favorite video game discs in plastic would you? Just get a a good case like the logitech play gear case (the slide on case that comes in the value pack would even do well), and a fine piece of cloth (similar to the one that comes with the psp in the value pack) and be careful with it when you play. The psp screen does not scratch that easily. In fact it scratches just as easy as Nintendo's first GBA. I really don't know where this hype is coming from about the screen being scratched.

Randall is torn between telling the truth, which might cause someone harm, and keeping the secret, which might harm someone else. Woven into this main conflict are hints of other conflicts relating to issues of race, poverty, and growing old alone.

It was bad several years ago. Simply re-badging it doesn't make it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor effort","review":"Lesbian Vampires fails in every category it possibly could. It's attempts at humor are not at all funny. To call them sophomoric would be an undeserved complement. It is neither sexy nor scary, which is what would be threshold issues for this kind of movie. The actors are unattractive and there is absolutely no dramatic tension. There is also nothing to admire in the technical qualities of the film. Even the most amateurish camera work and production you've ever seen is superior to this very poor effort.

I purchased the album when it was originally released and I thought it was great. But now with the extra tracks it makes it more complete and grabs more of the movie's feel on CD.

The sound quality is better then the original one but not that good compared to some other SACD's I own. The best one until now is by far 'Brothers in Arms' by Dire Straits.

In such an age of bold and daring gaming products we are expected to buy and ENJOY Hooligans? I have never played a game so redundant and mundane. The gameplay and idea behind it all is so impossibly repetitive. You have to do the same thing (break into shops, steal the money) over and over. Who thought this would make for an enjoyable experience.The graphics are terrible, characters are tiny-perhaps made of about 10 pixels max, every level is the same, every shop looks the same, controlling characters is difficult and annoying and the whole thing becomes tiresome incredibly quickly. If you like scrolling beat-em ups then check out a game likeStreets of Rage 2or perhaps some of the Streetfighter games. They are far superior in every way.Hooligans has about as much to do with football as Sesame Street has to do with drug dealing. Kind of like real football hooliganism.

Another young woman then appears on the homefront, one who MIGHT be perfect for her son but who in reality makes her(the Mother) absolutely crazy.

Our Building Construction class used it as a primary text, and nowhere does it tell you basics. For example, the drawings have few if any dimensions, which are pretty critical to one's understanding of basic construction (e.g., studs spaced 16\\" on center).

It does an excellent job on shirts that are blends and a good job on shirts that are 100% cotten. This steamer works well and saves time.As several reviews mentioned it takes some learning time. For me it works most efficently when I gently stretch out the fabric. Also, you should be careful. Like an iron, steam is hot.I have used the steamer on other items - tees, drapes, casual wear and it works well with these items.My one concern is that the hanging rack is not very durable.

I've tried switching power sources, changing out the water, investigating to see if anything is clogging the intake, but I can find nothing, and the unit doesn't even get warm when I plug it in.

I was so hyped up and exited. Even though I got so many steam burns that I started steaming wearing gloves, I was happy. About half a year later things went sour. The steam comes out in short bursts, it took longer and longer between the burts to produce steam and then it started leaking form the canister. Now it takes 30-40 min to steam one pair of dress pants and I have to have it in some sort of a tub because it tends to leak more that it steams. I hate it. I wish I could return it but I had it for 1,5 years.

You get ease of use, 90 minutes of steam, and very solid performance. If new to steaming, it takes a few times to get the feel of it. So, give it time.

This one seemed pretty good for the first 8-9 months although I agree with others that the included hangar is pretty useless and we always seemed to be hanging up the steam tube backwards for some reason. The last months of it's short life, it began sputtering water out of the steam handle and would only output about 10 seconds of steam at a time with another 10-20 seconds of nothing. The last month or so it began leaking water from underneath the unit. In it's a last day, about a 1/2 gallon water poured out all over our carpeted closet while we were gone.

I thought I saw it all, when it comes to gunfights, until I saw this film. The picture is beautifully filmed, the music wonderful, and the casting chemical. Cheech Marin, Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino add the perfect finishing touches. This is not a chick-flick, or even a date-movie.

There is a great cast with Salma Hayek, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino. This movie is great, I like the beginning where Buscemi is exaggerating about El Mariachi about the shootout he witnessed in Zaragosa. I also like when Tarantino tells his joke to the bartender. This movie is worth watching even if your not mexican. It takes place in Santa Cecilia, Mexico. It is like a south of the border Pulp Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unrealistic and lotsa gory [stuff]","review":"That pretty much sums it up. Banderas' character is looking for his wife's killer, and is always finding himself being [at risk] by dozens of people at a time.

The first scene had promise--I love Steve Buscemi. The rest of the movie proved to be a disaster; I actually laughed at this movie, and I don't think it was meant to be funny at all. At least not the parts I laughed at. It actually contains the stupidest scene I have ever witnessed: Antonio Banderas jumps backwards from one building to another, kills everyone firing at him, both on the building and on the ground, and manages not to sustain one injury doing so.

The video doesn't look any different to me, and I am viewing on a 60\\" LCD projector (sony grand wega). I have a sony surround sound system, and the DTS is just awesome. I give this 4 stars because it is too expensive. I bought mine at best buy for less than half the price. At that price I would easily give it 5 stars. No extra footage or anything, but really, the audio is just the best. I am a big fan of DTS encoding, and was very happy to find this bargain. If you liked this film, you will experience it so much better with the DTS encoding (if you have surround sound). I don't think that simulated surround would sound anywhere near as good. SO, make sure your system can decode DTS. If it can, buy it, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mexican John Woo film","review":"Without question, Robert Rodriguez made a sequel to El MARIACHI that looks exactly like a John Woo movie.

Roeder does a very good job of conveying the conflicting feelings that all teens have in their relationships. He also does a great job of building up enough sympathy for the main characters that you definately feel moved at the end of this Romeo and Juliet tribute.I don't mind giving away the end because Roeder's references to Romeo and Juliet begin in the very first sentence.This isn't high literature but it is very effective and you will cry in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing, It Made Me Write My First Review","review":"I'm usually the last person to want to disparage someone's art, and it's clear that Mr. Roeder has a great deal of affection for his characters. Perhaps a bit too much. This isn't a bad book, per se, but it certainly isn't very good.The death trap for any writer is when s/he gets into the habit of telling and not showing. That's a pitfall Mr. Roeder has not yet learned to avoid. Brevity can be your friend as well. I just don't know how the story can both move along too slowly, but also too quickly, but there we are.I must also confess that I find the novel's denouement to be at least a teensy bit irresponsible, especially for a work that seems to be directed toward gay youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid doesn't begin to describe this book","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a book in my life.

This was a turn off and detracted from the message. Now about the diet: if you want to get technical, yes the detox takes only one day. The problem is that you have to prepare yourself for the detox over a seven day period by following a very difficult diet. My guess is that if you follow the diet, you will get the results you want, but I gave this one a low rating because of the author's style and the misleading title."},{"rating":"1","title":"not exactly one day...","review":"This is one of those books that sound too good to be true, and is too good to be true. The cover makes promises the context can't keep. There's a seven day \\"prequel\\" of very restircted eating, the \\"one day detox\\" of just juice, and a three day sequel of very restricted eating, all to be followed with serious dietary changes for life. If it was easy for people to eat like this they would already be doing it and they wouldn't need this book. There's a lot of good nutritional information here (although she said vinegar makes you acidic, when, even though it is acidic, it makes you alkaline when metabolized, which is what you want if yu want to be healthy).

I faithfully followed the diet guidelines for the week leading up to the fast, then followed the fast to the letter. This included adding the fiber to the first and last drink of the day. Results? I lost two pounds by the next morning. Not the 3 to 5 pounds expected. But what disappointed me most was that I do not feel detoxed. I did not have a bowel movement during the 1 day juice fast, or the next day, or the next. I am bound up and in misery. I probably will have gained all the weight back by tomorrow and feel worse than before. I am following the three day sequel guidelines to the fast, but it is not working for me.

This diet, in order to work, consists of a 7 day pre-diet that is so low calorie and low carb with so many supplements that it's really the 7 days prior to the fasting day that kicks off the pounds. (Gittleman has quite the supplement list that she sells along with her book.) But like any other \\"too good to be true diet\\" you have to stick to a very strict post-diet in order to keep the pounds off. Otherwise, you gain more back than you had on in the first place. The one day diet is very simple and I can save you the money you might have spent on the book right now: Start early in the morning and drink one cup of diluted cranberry juice and then the next hour drink one cup of water.

Without even reading it, I got right away that Ann Louise was using weight loss as the \\"carrot\\". Everybody who lives those 11 fast track days gets to experience what it feels like to be healthy. Plus Ann Louise gives the public more health gifts -- the importance of detox even to the thin, the dangers of imprudent fasting, and and the connection between stubborn weight and a toxic body.

First she advises that eating organic butter, yogurt and whey is okay because they don't contain the milk protein casein. Whey is the protein itself separated out and even organic butter contains milk. Be very careful if you have a cow's milk allergy as I do. I followed what she was saying instead of checking out the facts for myself and I kept wondering why I wasn't feeling well on her diet. Secondly, she has you eat a lot of goitrogenic vegetables on this diet.

Indeed my recent book, Toxic Overload, describes over 30 different illnesses (including obesity), their individual links to toxic chemicals and ways to tackle them. Yet despite overwhelming evidence relating a more polluted environment to obesity and a greater need for nutrients, Ann Louise Gittleman is the only nutritionalist I know of who recognises this as a real problem.

Primarily because I couldn't believe someone would pay money to get this movie made. The producers are probably still banging their heads against the wall for this one.The script sounds like a sixth grader with a foul mouth wrote it. Andrew Clay displays his lack of acting and humor over and over. There are so many useless pieces of information and dialogue it's almost if this were to be taken as a joke. The direction was probably non-existant as was any type of cinematography. I could have choreographed the action sequences better, as they were painfully slow and contrived.I'll admit that only the best of the action genre movies appeal to me.

It was a toss-up between this, and the classic green Stanley one. I chose this one because it has two removable rings at the opening, so you can really clean the inside. The smaller ring is adequate for pouring. Also, I like the collapsible handle.But, it does leak if laid down. I recently noticed the outer/larger ring has a crack, kind of along the threads. I'm not sure how long it's been like that.I don't know how well it holds hot/cold temperatures. I always nuke my coffee/tea.Otherwise, it has lasted a long time, so it's worthy of two stars. Next time, I'll try the Stanley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Thermos","review":"Worked great for about 3 months then developed a leak. It started leaking from the main seal at the top. Leaks everytime I pour a new glass. Also, the smaller inset lid needs to be tourqued down very tight to prevent leaks.

I wasn't paying too much attention to it, but my husband pointed out that the surface is entirely gone in some areas. Yikes!

The nicks could not be reproduced once the pans were cold, so I can only guess that the polymer infused surface, once hot, become soft and vulnerable. We followed all instructions on using the pans -low heat, pre-heating, etc. One pan we have used daily to cook eggs. The other we used once. We wanted a set that tolerated metal utensils, so this set was especially appealing. Unfortunately, the nicks indicate that these pans do not hold up to regular use with metal. When we took the pans into the store, they agreed to refund our cost. They also said no one else had brought pans in with the same complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them for cooking - yet there is some residue","review":"I have had this set of pans for over 2 years now. We purchased them following our wedding - and got wonderful extras at that time with the purchase. We cook on them pretty consistently and have not had any problems. It is true they are minor stick, but a little oil tends to keep them in check when cooking. Additionally, there is a bit of starchy residue - as others have mentioned - that appears after cleaning. I tried initially to get it off and had some success, and eventually I just let it be. Thus far it has not affected the cooking or the thermal properties of the pan. It still cooks wonderfully, has great weight and good seal on the lid. Because of my enjoyment of these, I have purchased additional Calph One pans to go along with this.In addition to this set, I do recommend a couple axillary pans such as a small non-stick skillet for eggs, etc, and a deep, straight sided pan such as the saucier. Both are wonderful compliments to the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"After careful consideration and after reading these \\"5 star\\" reviews, which BTW had to have been written by Calphalon employees themselves, because this cookware is terrible! EVERYTHING STICKS! My pots and pans look like they have been used 20 years. I went with this particular item because of the teflon/cancer links, and I wanted to use metal cooking utensils. The material the cookware is made out of is very porous, its very hard to rinse even soap out of, and very soft when heated. It is very easy to nic this metal with little force, and the actual cooking surface makes everything stick. Its hard to scrub clean and has never looked clean since I first used it. I have tried the Bartenders scrub, nothing works. I've done everything the manufaturer recommeded and this cookware set has left me EXTREMELY dissappointed! SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!

There is no excuse for making these so difficult to use...preheat, postheat, cool down, let the food rest. Sorry, I just want to make some eggs - not a science experiment. Besides, all the tricks in the world does not keep the food from sticking. The clean up is labor intensive every time you use a pan - soak overnight then the next morning scrub your brains out with bar keeps friend with mediocre results.I'm convinced The Emperor Has No Clothes with this one.

Cleaned only with a Scotch-Brite pad as recommended by the manufacturer.Pan still works fine but I have stopped using it because of the damage to the cooking surface since I don't want to eat the advanced polymer. Plan to send it back to Calphalon with a letter of complaint.I thought these pans were my dream come true, a semi-nonstick pan that would stand up to everyday use without damage-- but it's really not much better than a cheap teflon nonstick counterpart.

I find them very easy to clean following the manufacture's recommended cleaning methods. I don't find the food sticks too much. It is similar in performance to my 20 year old magnalite (out of buisness) or stainless pans I've used. To limit sticking you'll still need good cooking technique. It isn't like a non-stick pan but you'll get better browning than non-stick. I try to treat the pans very well, but even so they are getting small dents in the bottoms of them. I don't even understand where they might be coming from. I don't see any such damage to my regular old stainless pans or any of my other anodized pans, which are much older. They still cook ok, but I'm worried about longevity, and it isn't going to help with food sticking."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly disappointing false advertisement","review":"Does anyone think this is non stick or is it stainless steel with a color coating?

Food does stick to the bottom of the pans. I have learned if you leave the food, like a piece of chicken, in the pan till it's almost burn point, then, and only then, does it become \\"non stick.\\" I will use these pans for a few years and then trade in to Calphalon under the warranty to something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable yes, beware of sticking","review":"I am nothing close to a professional cook, but was really taken in by the reviews and descriptions of this new Calaphalon line. So I splurged... While I do love the durability and ability to use metal utensils, I just can't get over how badly things stick - everything from eggs to pancakes to burritos to sauteed spinach. No matter how much butter and oil I use, no matter how I try to follow their instructions of letting the food \\"warm\\" for 10 minutes outside of the fridge before cooking, etc, I've just never seen such sticking.

After a month of trial, I am DEEPLY disappointed. I CANNOT believe Calphalon advertised them as NON-STICK. Everthing STICKS.

Therefore it did not meet my needs and I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great - unless you want 100 year-old material in a new cover","review":"The book essentially repeats the theories and provides descriptions of electrical concepts that have been taught the same, old way for years. There's nothing new here, and a great many books from the 1960s offer better discussions and explanations. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honky Tonkin' Roots Country At Its Best","review":"I bought this CD on a whim. I was at Larry Joe Taylor's Chili Cook-off and Texas Music Festival and Davin had just left the stage. I missed most of his set because I was back at our campsite but the two songs I did hear were enough to get me to purchase this disc. I really didn't expect much, having never heard of him around the Texas Music scene before (my fault! ) but I was absolutely blown away by this album. There isn't a bad song on here and there are some really outstanding--unbelievably outstanding songs on this disc. It's hard to pick favorites because they are all great but \\"Things Ain't Like They Used To Be\\" and \\"Head Over Heels\\" are my two personal faves. I own about 1000 CDs and this is probably among my two or three favorite discs. 5 stars, no doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"This manual lacks more information than it actually contains","review":"This book may be well organized, though it is not very comprehensive, it is good for some specifications and if you want to perform minor repairs, and scheduled maintenance.It lacks troubleshooting information, and has very limited descriptions for repair procedures. If you own or have just purchased a 300zx buy the factory service manual, you will be so glad that you did. I have found haynes to be the poorest and least detailed manuals on the market and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who is looking for a clear, concise answer to a specific problem. And It does contain enough information to get you in serious trouble if you are trying to repair your own vehicle without prior automotive experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Haynes Book","review":"This is the Haynes book.

Whereas there is none of that in THIS collection by Crowe. Instead, you get at least 30 repetitive pieces (I lost count) out of 100 that all begin or contain minimal variations on the line \\"Winebringer! Bring me more Wine!\\" What this collection is I don't know, but it's neither scholarship nor poetry. \\"Poor Hafiz!\\" (as the Persian sometimes refers to himself) has taken on a new meaning indeed in the hands of someone like Crowe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This !","review":"This awful bootleg has been issued and reissued for over 30 years. I have it on LP. It's an amateur recording made at the September 13, 1969 Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival held at the football stadium of the University of Toronto.Why does it sound so bad? For one thing, the concert promoter (Detroit's \\"Uncle\\" Russ Gibb) was a cheapskate, and provided only the minimum P.A. system, and this did not include stage monitors (which is why you often see photos of singers of that day singing with one finger in an ear so they could hear themselves).My guess is that, \\"Ain't That Just Like A Woman?\\" and \\"Goin' to the River,\\" the two songs obviously not sung by Alice Cooper are by '50s rebel Gene Vincent, who the Alice Cooper Band, formerly known as The Spiders, often backed up. He played earlier that day.All this junk does is make money for the bootleggers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appealing at all","review":"Like the first book \\"Undeniable\\" this one was written in a very juvenile writing style.

I mean do you want to visibly see the net tensioners sliding their way up the rope as the net sags. Are you sitting at home thinking, man what I really want is a net that's super loose at the bottom so there's no way I could ever play a ball off of it? Well then this is the net for you. You'll love having people over for a game and tightening the net every five seconds. Your friends and family will be amazed at how poor the quality is, and wait till you tell them how much it costs! They'll be even more amazed. This is literally the worst volleyball net I have ever owned, it's going back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I ordered this net for my husband for father's day. We play a ton of vball and use to be big sand vball players. Since having kids it's difficult to get to the beach so now we play in the grassy park in front of our home. Well much to my (our) dissappointment this net did not work well at all. My husband set it up fairly quickly but when we tried to tighten the sides that are made to pull the net so that the net stays tight kept sliding down hence making the net droop!!! VERY DISSAPPOINTED!!! So we immediately packed it all up and sent it back. I would not reccomend this net at all. It just does not work well. Especially if you are considering playing any sort of competitve vball because the minute someone spikes into the net it is going to droop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructions stink","review":"The instruction on how to assemble are horrendous.

As you might expect, when the box is beat up, there's probably some tiny thing missing. Yup, there's a plate at the bottom of one of the poles that was missing. Not a big enough deal to make a stink about it, but it still stinks to buy something and have a part not be there.All in all, though, the net is fantastic and sturdy. It's easy to set up and take down, and the net itself seems good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!","review":"I bought this volleyball set for our annual luau. The ages of the group of people that play volleyball are between 23 & 30. The guys tend to be a bit rough on the net. I have to say this net held up quite well and I can see being able to use this net for many luaus to come. The set was easy to put up and I like the idea that everything fits neatly in a zippered bag for storage. I would recommend this set for anyone looking for a sturdy volleyball set that's easy to assemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Park&Sun","review":"This volleyball set is pretty good. The only thing I dislike about it are the four stakes that hold down the side ropes. The stakes are pretty cheap but you can always buy bigger and bettter ones elsewhere. The quality of the net and poles are there and I would recommend this net to those who love the game of volleyball. The ball that comes with the set is no good but if you play at a competitive level then you should already have a better ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the pool","review":"My son wanted a heavy duty volleyball net for our pool.

A very nice performance of some outstanding Czech chamber music.

Sometimes I got it right and sometimes the story had a twist. The length of the stories are perfect for younger ages of nine or ten but I think older kids would enjoy the book also. The illustrations that go with the stories sometimes made you think a particular story would be scarier than it actually was. Overall I enjoyed the book.

I think the book sounded interesting and looked good, but the stories weren'tscary and interesting. I would have given it five stars if it was scarier and more interesting. I think that \\"wonderful sausage\\" was the best story out of all the stories. I thought it was the best because it was scary and interesting.

The auther of the book is Alvin Schwartz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary","review":"[Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. It's basically the same thing over and over: someone thinks that they won't die but they do. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will like it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven King book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier.In summery: It stinks. It's not scary. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revised: A waste of your money!!","review":"This is a revised edition of a book that was part of a series so famously gruesome that it was the most frequently challenged book of the nineties. This was not because of the stories themselves, which are mostly retellings of pretty well known urban legends and ghost stories, but because of the ORIGINAL artwork by Stephen Gammell.Those illustrations are so lurid, frightening, and demented that several of them frighten me to this day, as an adult.Helquist is a talented artist to be sure, but don't make the mistake of purchasing this new edition of More Scary Stories if you are truly looking to be scared: invest in an older copy: You won't regret it. (Unless of course you are buying it for a small child or nightmare-prone preteen, in which case I would NOT recommend the older editions.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically Frightening Follow-up","review":"Alvin Schwartz goes back into the rich history of urban legends once again and offers up a wonderful collection of many stories I previously had never heard of before as a child.

It's been at least two weeks... and bedtime is still a nightmare. The minute the lights go out she starts thinking about this book and the tears start! Ugh! We learned the hard way that our daughter wasn't ready for this type of book. If your child is at all sensitive to scarey stories - avoid this book.BUT! If your child loves spooky stories/movies - this is the book for you! It is well written and the illustrations are very scarey (my husband LOVED it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"an easy ZERO... the software forces you to choose 1 star","review":"I urge adults to really think carefully about what is in this book before they expose the children in their lives to its quite stark cruelty and depravity. There is really very little here that is scary in the sense that youngsters crave - suspense - but rather there resides some genuinely disturbing scenes of merciless, mindless, violence. Serial killings, cowardly murders, extreme cruelty to animals - we'd never let our nieces and nephews, sons and daughters read about the BTK killer in the newspaper, but we blithely hand them this book because it presumes to represent folklore. If they wrote this in school, they'd be sent to the psych for fear of being the next klebold."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gayest Stories Ever?","review":"These stories could not raise one goosebump on my entire body. I read this to preschoolers and they didn't think they were scary at all. They laughed at me for reading the stories. They said that they were the gayest stories ever. I have three uses for this book: a coaster, firewood, and toilet paper. This book is NOT worthy of being read. The only reason it got one star is because that's as low as it would go, plus the illistrations made the book 0.95% \\"spine-tingling\\".

For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book blog listed in my profile...I seemed to remember these being more ghostly in nature, and not so brief. A great read for children - it WILL spook them. But probably not a good read or reread for adults. It was nice to revisit some of the stories from my childhood, but I will look elsewhere for classic ghost stories. I do remember them being a lot better then they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murphy's review","review":"In the book there are many different stories and many different people.The stories are very detailed and very scary and that is why I liked the book so much.In one story called \\"Something Was Wrong,\\" a man known as John Sullivan found himself walking along a street in downtown. He could not explain how he got there. He saw awoman walking down the street so he asked her what time it was. But when the lady turnedaround, she screamed in horror.

Fun for kids, even as young as 4-5. Not \\"scary\\" in the true sense, but enough for them to appreciate these stories and have fun with them. Plus, Mr. Schwartz, whose voice you might recognize as the narrator to oft-played, \\"A Christmas Story\\" on Dec. 25th, makes for a delicious storyteller. Excellent for Halloween fun!

It is best to read it in the dark whith your friend or whoever you read it to will be shaking and shivering from the first stories to the end of the book. I try it once and it made the book scarier.

The card is chock full of of B-level fighters who do not deserve nor belong on a stage as large as the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The UFC Heavyweight division is nothing but a terrible joke and the main event of Arlovski vs Eilers(a bum) is ridiculous. There are only a handful of fighters you can consider top 10 on this entire fight card.With that said, there are a few interesting bouts. The Rich Franklin/Evan Tanner fight is somewhat entertaining as is the Karo Parisyan/Matt Serra bout.In the end, save your money. This is a pretty lackluster not worthy of your hard earned dollars.

I would have given them a rating of 5 except for the packing liquid and the fact that a number of the cans were dented, some severely.

Maybe these gloves would work with shorter, duller thorns, but the long thin thorns of a thistle go through them like they were made of paper. Plus, the gloves don't feel or look very well made. And, if you're doing any really heavy duty yard clearing, you'll want gloves with a velcro wrist strap to keep things from getting to your hands through the open end of the glove.

He is very knowledgable on the subject.This 1992 book starts out with a history of drinking and patterns of drinking then it gets into a history of glassware in Europe and America- all of this is very interesting. Then it gets into shot glasses and their history.The shot glasses shown are all black and white drawings and not actual color photos and although this does give a good idea, it's not as good as a color picture. I see that he has done books that do show color photos but this is not one of those. For shot glass collector's, this is a very useful, fun and informative guide on their hobby. But it falls a bit short in the photo department so it only gets 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"still works","review":"I bought this book when it was released by Knopf (early 90s) and I was impressed both by the writing and how Beth dissected so many adolescent feelings that other writers merely labeled. Some reviewers may be upset that her stories are consistently dark and her characters tend to overly internalize things....it doesn't match their perception of how kids are today . But I would suggest that while today's kids are more juiced up and likely to act out feelings (versus internalize), it doesn't negate what's deep down and driving the pseudo-empowered behavior that makes news headlines.

The music just isn't any fun to listen to, it's not beautiful, it's not mysterious, it's not good. I thought I would have a great cd with this because I had loved the scores to The Rock and Gladiator, but End of Days was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this CD zero stars I would!","review":"This soundtrack contains music by so many \\"confused\\" bands, it should have been dubbed \\"the 1999 Millenium scare tribute albumn.\\" When I recieved this CD in the mail, I realized that it was a mistake and wanted to return it. The backlisting of the bands I thought was horrid, for instance Korn is the first band listed. Eventually I conceded by removing it from its cellophane wrapping, and putting it in my stereo. I listened to the first five seconds of both the Rob Zombie and Prodigy tracks and then pulled it out of my CD player, put it back in its case, and then packed a lugghi in it before closing it. Since then, I've retired the CD to the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story, bad acting","review":"If you like watching young adults over act in a rotten script, here's your film.

The actors were poor and the characters were annoying as hell. But the most irritating thing BY FAR was that this was a total Christian recruitment film.

So disrespectful to other spiritual paths!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth it only for Campo fans","review":"Bobby Campo is shirtless through most of the movie. That's a plus. The rest is terrible.

I like this product! It fits in my desk drawer at work because it folds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort","review":"This DVD is marketed as the utlimate documentary on Operation Valkyrie. It doesn't come close to the Oscar-nominated \\"Restless Conscience.\\" It has some good content but there is far too much filler and the story of the July plot is not put solidly in its context as part of a German Resistance movement that spanned 1933-1945. The live recreations are laughable in terms of casting and accuracy and the \\"interviews\\" with experts and surviving family members consist of 2 to 3 sentence snippets. This could have been so much more. The second disc of extras has some good stuff but why add an hour of Eva Braun's home movies? What does that have to do with killing Hitler? It just more padding to look like value added.

If you want to teach children about the presidents I would recommend this from George Washington up to McKinley. But from Teddy Roosevelt up to the current president, this show is full of left-wing stealth bias that will enhance your child's public education brainwashing.The show's depiction of modern presidents is entirely inaccurate. The show also chose to focus on less important aspects of each president's term.I would recommend watching this show on history channel before purchasing it. If your political stance is more left wing then I would suppose that this show would be perfect for you and your children.

Also consider \\"A History of God\\" by The History Channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly biased","review":"Having been a student of history for years, I was appalled at The History Channel's portrayal of our Presidents. After all, what right-minded individual would feel compelled to characterize Jimmy Carter(a known anti-semite) as merely a victim of circumstance? Likewise, Ronald Reagan is portrayed as an oaf who stumbled blindly into pure luck and managed to make few decent decsions. Nonsense.

Those who want to hear Afro-Latin music at its most creative and inspired should get hold of this collection. This is music from a softer, dreamier era (the 1970s) than today's hard edged M'balax.

It is intersting to see Mr. Cassini's sketches next to the actual pictures of the garments. It is a coffee table type book that one would enjoy flipping through causally and not one that I would say one would want to read word for word like a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done but not very original.","review":"Bowery Electric have almost completely abandoned the monochromatic sound of their masterpiece album \\"Beat\\" which came out a few years ago. \\"Lushlife\\" certainly looks like a major label release and it sounds like one too. The vocals are much higher in the mix, the sounds are crisper, cleaner, better produced, almost too polished in places. The drum loops sound a lot more canned than they used to as well, and the wash of fuzzy guitar feedback has receded to the backrgound and all but disappeared in lieu of warm, crackly strings and samples. All of these things considered though, this is a very well done album. It might be an attempt to breakthough, and it might be successful on that end, as these are downright catchy songs sometimes. On one hand then it's a disappointment because the subtlely of tracks like \\"Postscript\\" on the last album has been abandoned, but it's still an undeniably nice pop record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over and over again.......","review":"I can't get enough of this CD, I have been listening to it daily since I heard it on KCMU.

The entire work seemlessly conveys feelings of space and motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lushlife falls short...","review":"After a couple years of waiting for this album, I must say that I was quite disappointed.

Unless you'd like to complete your Bowery Electric collection, this album should be left on the shelve..."},{"rating":"1","title":"rock that can opener","review":"The third album from this Manhattan electronic duo is a small victory for the homeopathic approach to music: The less emotion these tunes show on the surface, the lonelier you feel just listening to it, and the more sullen and distant the mood. Voila! But since any old repeating noise can set a mood, why not just save your money and make a Lushlife of your own with household appliances? Lawrence Chandler's programming and arranging aren't half as clean or efficient or sonically balanced as the hiss of your space heater. And these bass lines wish they had the presence and swagger of your washing machine. I'm less sure of what to do about Martha Schwendener, who sings the same five notes as if she's been up reading tax documents all night.

The follow up, however, is surprising only for how awful it is. The tight beats of Heavy Mental have been replaced with synth beats that don't conjure half the atmosphere that Heavy Mental managed to. The lyricism is awful, even by Wu-Affiliate standards. If you're expecting another B.I.B.L.E. on View From Masada, don't hold your breath. Almost everything that could have gone wrong on this album did. I'd have given it two stars, but Killah Priest is capable of so much more that I can't emphasize enough how much fans of Heavy Mental will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why mending the damage?","review":"As a 49 year old German female \\"non-survivor\\" still fighting the hunting shadows of my childhood, verbal, physical, spiritual and mental abuse, rape, molestation and being sold in to slavery, I'm fighting know for the prevention of child abuse.

They are not your average band and I think they will be around for a lot longer than anyone thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a highly overlooked cd","review":"I am a 30-year old music lover who did not expect to like this cd. I heard the song \\"This Time Around\\" on MuchMusic and based on that one song bought the album. All the songs are very good - unlike anything i was hearing on the radio which bored me. \\"Wish that I was There\\" is a \\"hit repeat\\" melody - i love all the rhythms.

If anyone believes that, I beg you to listen to this disc with an open mind. You will be surprised. These boys are talented! What I appreciate the most is their ingenuity. Bands seem to be in a rut these days; it is hard to find ones that are totally unique. (I am not denying that they are out there, I am just saying they are few and far between.) You won't see Hanson copying anybody. They write and sing simply for the sake of doing so, and that is apparent on this disc. They throw themselves into their music for their own pleasure.

They have come such a long way since their \\"Middle of Nowhere\\" days. The songs are honest, intelligent, and well written. They've all become better musicians and vocalists as well. I especially enjoy the tracks \\"You Never Know,\\" \\"Save Me,\\" and \\"A Song to Sing\\" just to name a few. The guest spots by John Popper and Johnny Lang make great additions. This disc is sure to please all the Hanson fans, and even pick up a few more unsuspecting fans along the way. :) What stands out the most about this record is what great human beings these guys seem to be.

So I advise you to go get this CD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold up Hanson fans....'till I talk","review":"No CD is perfect, although this one, is about not even a millimeter away to being perfect. This is their best album, in my opinion, because they express their feelings in a song, in a song that still rocks! It can't get any better than this. I can be picky about my music sometimes, but this CD is the greatest, Hanson put all their effort into this, and it really payed off. I can't resist singin' and dancin', even in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanson does it again!","review":"When I first popped in this cd, I had such high expectations after hearing \\"If Only\\", \\"This Time Around\\", and \\"Save Me\\", which are all wonderful songs. I was dissapointed in some aspects, and myself being 14 years old, that's pretty hard to do when it comes to Hanson. The best song on the cd is definitely \\"A Song to Sing.\\" Dont' get me wrong, the cd is good, but some of the songs i absolutley cannot stand. \\"Can't Stop\\" is just purely annoying, \\"Sure About It\\" makes me sick. Then songs like \\"love song\\" make up for it. Overall, for as much time as they were in the studio, something a little better then this should have been put together.Of course, you should give it a listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the wait . . .","review":"Proving once and for all that they're not in the same box with the so-called \\"boy bands\\" with this awesome new record, This Time Around was definitely worth the three years.

It's unfortunate that the title track has not gotten much airplay (at least not where I live) because it would be a HUGE hit! It is so way beyond \\"Mmm Bop\\" it's like night and day. Isaac, Taylor, and Zach have certainly matured as both songwriters and musicians.

What kind of a song is named \\"Mmm bop\\"? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. But anyway, the Hansons now think they are this bad rock group like Blink 182 or Kid Rock. They should be laughed right out of the music business for even thinking that. They sound exactly the same as they did on their earlier albums. They are also the most arrogant teenagers I have ever seen. When referring to Nsync, the baby Hanson said, and I quote, \\"We sing better than they do.\\" I just have one question. What do girls see in them? They are SO UGLY! Especially the old one. Are teenage girls so desperate that they need to idolize those UGLY guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanson is soooo over","review":"This time around they will realize that there time is up.

My friend listens to it all the time! It is horrible! They have been out of the music picture for soooooo long and then all of a sudden burst back in the scene with this album? The songs are to hippy and sounds like their from the 70's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy I suppose...","review":"Hanson has never really impressed me. The songs aren't that clever and good voices aren't too hard to come by these days. This latest merging of their poppy past with phishy jam-rock sounds to me like a desperate (and probably successful) attempt at not being a one-hit wonder novelty act. but the songs themselves are bland and barely stand out in these last few years of ultra-happy mtv pop that the brothers hanson helped bring about. while it can be enjoyable at times i can't give it a solid review and would gladly reccomend the Apples In Sterio's new album \\"The Discovery of the World Inside the Moone\\" over Hanson. Now THAT is a truly innovate pop group."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just dont like it!","review":"This Hanson album is indeed a big let down,especially since theothers were so good.I loved middle of nowhere and three car garage,and I was excpecting the same amount of high qualty,but I think I would have been better off buying a celine dion C.D!I think the slower songs sounded more or less the same,esspecially wish that I was there. This song repeated the same line over and over again in the chorus - like a broken record. I used to think that hanson were the greatest thing ever( as middle of nowhere was my first ever C.D), And I thought the songs were really catchy, esspecially mmmbop and speechless. I still think of middle of nowhere as one of my better C.Ds, but I dont think as highly of Hanson, if at all! If you like Hanson buy this C.D - But be warned , you might not get what you want!

I've always liked Hanson, so I'm kind of partial to them anyway, but I've also always seen what it is people dont like about them. They're singing ability was kind of shaky, though their tunes were kind of catchy, and their songs, lyrics, and image lacked maturity. \\"This Time Around\\" changes all of that! I was blown away by their newfound maturity, and how well it was displayed in such a wide ranging album. It's amazing!! The album is a little bit of blues mixed with rock and their signature pop, but it's not all that bouncy, happy pop like Middle of Nowhere.

But THIS TIME AROUND shows that Zac, Taylor and Isaac, far from being one-hit wonders, have the talent to back up their early success -- and then some.Don't let the sluggish sales of this album keep you from buying it. Hanson clearly opted for artistic growth over commercial appeal, which is not to say they haven't recorded a fun album. Although none of the singles achieved the popularity of \\"MMMBop\\", this CD is full of great singalong tunes. Some favorites are \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"You Never Know\\", \\"If Only\\" and the great title track.Hanson chose to do an old-fashioned rock n' roll album this time around, and their accomplished songwriting shows they know their music history. Long after NSYNC says \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" for good and the Backstreet Boys are all in rehab, Hanson will still be around, probably rocking harder than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"it was okay, It wasn't too easy to use and My Son found it complicated.

Mine has failed twice. Then you are relegated to Dell Hell. I bought a five-year advanced exchange warranty for the product yet it is nearly impossible to enforce. Dell requires a SERVICE TAG to talk, email, or chat with them. Displays don't have them. You must call customer support, be subjected to long holds, and serviced by people who are unintelligible and incompetent. They will then botch the call requiring you to start and repeat the process over and over again. You feel you are caught in the movie, \\"Groundhog Day\\". My latest adventure has gone on for six hours over three days. They shipped the replacement display to the wrong city although I verified and re-verified they have the correct address. Unless you enjoy pain, do not buy from Dell.

I haven't noticed any dead or stuck pixels. It has a matte finish and there is no glare. The surrounding black frame also has a matte finish. To my eyes, the colors are reasonably accurate. However, I haven't done extensive image work nor have I played DVDs on it. This display has a USB hub with a flash card reader and the USB portion was defective in mine. I'm at an educational institution and Dell replaced at my mere report. The replacement unit has the same crisp display and so far its USB hub has worked. One last point, portion of the display is very hot to the touch. I don't know what the wattage numbers, but it is hard to see how this qualified for any energy star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for the price but you get what you pay for","review":"I loved this display until it stopped working. Owned it for 13 months before the power button broke and the monitor was stuck in the off position. A quick search will reveal that this is not an isolated incidence but clearly a design flaw. Keep looking and you'll find many posted workarounds. An apparently not so uncommon problem with the power button is that it somehow becomes loose and twists out of position. I used a safety pin to reorient the button allowing me to turn the display on but the button easily spins and stops working again. Luckily I found lots of good advice online. One post suggested using tape to keep the button in position. Another post suggested plugging the display into its own power strip and using that switch to turn it on and off while yet another suggested never turning the display off at all.

He doesn't berate that community, but helps the reader understand what they are about. Schwartau's book makes this dangerous issue easy to understand and is written in a way that everyone has a chance of reading this book. He also fills the book with examples of security breaks that he has encountered. His stories seem scary at first, but he also emphasizes that there are ways to deter such attacks. His idea is not to get readers to stop using computers and the Internet because of such attacks, but to get them aware of what it out there and to take countermeasures. His real life stories are what make the book interesting to read and enjoy. I think that he could have offered sort of program that would allow the reader to see an example of a security program, maybe negotiating a deal to market a program would have been nice to include."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensational and erroneous","review":"Winn Schwartau's new book is rife with sensational statements and overblown generalizations--both guaranteed to inflate book sales. This book attempts to distill a paranoia that reaches *far* beyond what is necessary to instill proper caution in those who manage computer system. He demarks no difference between malicious, destructive crackers and those thrill-seekers who enter unauthorized sites with no thought of destruction, or even of unauthorized reading or downloading. The final straw came when Schwartau began talking about terrorists using focused microwaves to turn one's dental fillings into radio receivers. Next thing you know, he'll be advocating that everyone wear aluminum foil helmets to \\"keep out evil mind-control radio wave\\". If you want sensationalism and terror-mongering, buy this book. If you want to read about the *real world*, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Stuff","review":"This book is a good explanation of hackers of all varieties, their techniques, and what ordinary people and businesses can do to protect against them. In a usually-even-tempered voice, Mr. Schwartau tackles common misconceptions and explains what hackers really are and what threats we should really be worrying about. He has had a reputation of being a Chicken Little with regard to hacking, but at least a respected Chicken Little. None of this is real knock-your-socks-off stuff. But it's good in an enjoyable sort of a way."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD QUALITY - - BAD QUANTITY","review":"9 PRODUCTS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE, JUST SEND 1, NOWHERE SAYS THAT IS A SINGLE UNIT FOR 19 U.S. $THAT INDICATES THE BUYER TO THE 9 ARE BUYING ITEMS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Book 2, Terrible Editing but a Good Story","review":"The title says it all. The editing job on the last 2 books in the trilogy is absolutely disgusting. My wife's 7 year-old cousin would have done a better editing job. Seriously.But the meat of the story is worth it. The carnival is in town and the events of the first 2 books shape the \\"final\\" showdown that is to come. The last chapters get confusing with the demon that Crowley fights and the Curse of Serenity Falls both teaming up. It's hard to separate which is demon and which is curse when you are turning the pages so rabidly.Good story, well worth my wait. I want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what horror is supposed to be!","review":"I really liked the trilogy. Moore creates a great 'hero' (Crowley) and a fast paced creative story.

I have probably read this one in excess of 25 times over the years. This is why I have my \\"handle\\" and designed my web page as a dedication to this book. \\"Changeling\\" by Zelazny is another great one. All the Zelazny novels are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful Surprise!","review":"Having been a fan of Zelazny's Amber series I picked up a number of his shorter novels to pass the time. Jack of Shadows was a truly pleasant surprise and a joy to read.The story's hero Jack could learn a thing or two from the old saying \\"Power corrupts & absolute Power corrupts absolutely\\".In his quest for vengence against those who stole his love & his life (well one of them anyway) he becomes worse than those villans he hates. He knows only destruction until he comes face to face with his own soul. Will he restore the world or destroy it? You'll have to read it to find out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating work about evil","review":"I found this book to be one of Zelazny's best, and one of my favorite books in general. It achieves a very difficult task: getting the reader to like and sympathize with an evil protagonist. Despite the unspeakable acts he committs, and the unsavory characters he associates with, you find yourself liking him. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what there was to like","review":"I like a lot of Zelazny's stuff, but this book did not do it for me. The science was pretty silly (a planet that stays still), and the world needed a bit more fleshing out. It's almost like a detailed outline. The scale of the story is huge but there's little or no detail. It would have been much better to see Jack in action stealing things and outsmarting people rather than conquering the world.I'm not sure I understand the symbolism of the story. If Morning star was trying to prevent Jack from following in his footsteps why did he have him do what he did?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underestimated work of Science Fiction/Fantasy brilliance","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The world that Zelazny creates is a vivid and imaginative one, full of beauty and ugliness, light and darkness, good and evil. The book is all about duality. It is about objects and their opposites, ideas and there antithesis. And at the center of the work is Shadowjack, a character whose presence betrays the ideas in the rest of the book. He is a shadow, inbetween light and darkness. He is the grey between the white and black of the world in which he lives. This book is brilliant on so many levels. As a simple work of fiction it is entertaining and brilliantly written. As an allagory it is beautifully crafted and deeply moving. A must read. Buy this book and share it with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bag","review":"This product has been through thick and thin, on four continents carrying 2 Canon 1D Mark IV bodies and 24-70mm and 60-200mm lenses.

Some of them came broken, so there was nowhere to hang one of the baskets.I didn't return it because the amazon outer box in which it came was broken and to repackage I would have to purchase another box which is not worth purchasing to send back an $18 item.

I found the lessens to be unclear and the learning curve VERY steep. (Remember, I've been studying Japanese for some months, I know some of this material already). In my blog I referred to this book as Japanese for People Who Have Lots of Time to Study or Japanese for People Who Remember Everything They Have Ever Read.

I think the name alone must sell a lot. I've never seen anyone gain real proficiency, though. If your goal is to gain a logical understanding of the grammar and some vocabulary while avoiding fluency, then this is the book for you.The problem is that the book presents itself as a method to gain fluency, but it is very light on exercises. In order to gain fluency, you must practice fluency. Building vocab, reading dialogues, and reading essays on grammar will never get you there.I highly recommend that people serious about gaining fluency supplement this book with something that is more exercise intensive. Or better yet, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable but dissapointing.","review":"The problem with Japanese for Busy People is not so much the information that it contains, but what it DOESN'T contain and the way the information is presented. Though the opening section on kana was especially useful, all of the lessons essentially consist of memorizing vocabulary words vaguely related to 'foreign language' type subject such as \\"At the movies.\\" Though some may prefer this methodology, I found the vocabulary and provided phrases especially lacking as far as practical implementation is concerned.

Some of the lessons and vocabulary may not be so interesting, but are necessary to get you started. Also having a teacher who can add to what the book offers is very helpful.**One thing I really do recommend about this series is that if you are serious about learning Japanese then find and buy the kana version of this book and buy a booklet that teaches you how to read and write hiragana and katakana.

Second, although the content of the book would be useful to a person who had successfully completed a formal education in calculus and was in need of a review, the authors chose to bill this book as a quick and easy way to understand the intricacies of calculus for those who have failed to grasp the basic fundamentals. They do a great disservice to the readers whom they dupe into buying this book by making false claims about its nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I wasted my money","review":"Based on the description of this book, I thought I could gain a better grasp of the subject, only to discover that I was more confused than when I started. New concepts are thrown out with no explanation and examples are obscure at best. To make things worse, the silly cartoon-like attitude of the book is insulting to anyone who's looking for a serious solution to their dilemma. The implication is that the material is as easy to understand as a child's book, but there is no help for those who don't immediately grasp the concepts. After completing a Calculus class (and feeling quite comfortable with the subject) I revisited the book and confirmed that it is a terrible presentation for those who are in fact \\"Utterly Confused\\".

The benefits of course are the long range shots, and I can honestly say that they Opteka works fantastically. I also read that the night shots suck because the lense blocks the flash a little, which is true, but if you're taking night shots, I would imagine that they'd be close range....at least mine are, so I don't have that issue with the lense in relation to a night shot. More importantly, I've read the same thing about the Kodak lense, so for the money, I'd say get the Opteka.

Poor workmanship & quality.","review":"Not sure if merchandise Amazon gets is seconds or rejects, but my husband purchased his second pair of this style boots because the first was so good. We bought the first pair through his uniform company for $135. When he'd worn them out (1.5 years) I looked online and found them for $90 here and we ordered them.Out of the box they were fine, but after 2-3 months of wear the stitching was coming undone. Now, after only 7 months of wear, the soles have cracked at the ball of the foot on both boots.We checked the Doc Martin website and they say that you have to contact your retailer for a return. There is no information on the Amazon website for arranging such a return. We're outside the return window, and if we return them anyway, according to the return policy, we pay shipping PLUS lose 15-50% of the purchase price as a restocking fee. Hardly worth the trouble.

After finishing Essential Thor vol. 2 I think their Thor comics deserve a seat at that same Silver Age table of greatness. In this volume you get the debut of Hercules and his rivalry/friendship with the Son of Odin. Along with Hercules come the Greek gods and the villainous Pluto. Ego the Living Planet threatens the universe. In the back up stories, Tales of Asgard, we see the Warriors Three (Hogun, Fandral and Volstagg) join Thor at center stage to battle Fafnir the dragon, fend off Ragnorok and of course deal with Thor's evil brother, Loki. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better filtering than the smaller A cartridge....I'll admit.","review":"This seems to filter the fine sediment much better than the smaller \\"A\\" cartridge combined with the smaller 1500GPH pump. I purchased the 2500 intex pump as I was dissatisfied with the 1500 pump's performance. I have the larger 18' pool and it simply didn't do the job. Now I have learned to run the filter a few hours per day....if I use the pool or not. If you rinse the filter out every other day and you should be happy.

I wasn't going to buy an expensive one when we're nearing the end of swimming season.The only way this filter works well is if you take it out, clean it, and let it dry before reusing it. And it's only good for one filtering cycle. You have to have at least two of these in order to be able to filter your pool every day.I will definitely be going back to Pleatco next season."},{"rating":"1","title":"shipping too high","review":"Unfortunately my local WalMart was out so I had to settle for this ad. The front page price is the best I had seen. BUT, the low advertised price does not last long. At checkout you realize they are porking you with shipping costs so they can get the average price of the product. Probably about twice what the shipping should be. I won't be returning to this site again. I already know it will not matter to the company b/c their theory is as long as we get a customer to purchase it one time then we have made a sale. They made their inflated profit. Typical business looking out for number 1.

When I received the package today, to my surprise there was only 1 filter in the box instead of three. I am keeping it because I am not spending the money to ship it back.

There are not enough listening and vocabulary activities on the c.d. As a total novice in Polish I need a lot more chances to hear the pronunciation. Each chapter gives you a very brief dialogue and doesn't even review the pronunciations of the lists of new phrases and words from the book. Then, in the chapter review they include new words and phrases not yet introduced!! Hello? How can you review something not yet introduced? My fiancee is Polish and I will be going to live and work there next year. If anyone can recommend a decent polish workbook with grammar for beginners I would really love to hear about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible AND a RipOff","review":"I bought this yesterday the local bookstore. The packaging on the outside reads \\"Includes Two 60-minute CDs\\". CD #1 contains 48 minutes of audio and CD #2 contains another 22 minutes. That comes out to 1 hour and 10 minutes...NOT the 2-hours proclaimed on the packaging! Very misleading.On top of that, this book/CD set jumps into the language as if you know some of it already. Little discussion/explaination of the nuances of the Polish language. It jumps into dialogue immediately with very fast speakers (instead of slowly exploring the pronunciation in depth) and I missed several consonant sounds. The alphabet was glossed over so quickly that I had to hit \\"rewind\\" on the CD player every 10 seconds. Bad investment. I'm taking it back and hope I can exchange it for a better program!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning Polish is a daunting task","review":"Any way you look at it, to a complete novice, learning Polish is difficult. The book seems fairly well-laid out, but there is just not enough Polish on the cds to be helpful. Each lesson is approximately four minutes long. The dialogue goes by too fast to be comprehended and it seems that there is more English on them than Polish. That is annoying when I have to keep replaying the lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no way to learn a foreign language","review":"The problem with this CD & book combo is that it teaches you Polish as if you already know it - and know it very WELL. Polish is a language that many of us don't know at all - I mean, not even one word - and this CD moves right into it without those important first steps (slow pronunciation, breaking down the word little by little, explaining the meaning of the words, etc). When I'm learning a foreign language, I like the \\"Sesame Street\\" approach - you know- A-Pul - APPLE!) so that I get the pronunciation right and know what I'm saying. I would not go with this course. A better one would be Pimsleur Polish (the one with the 8 CD's and word booklet) because it's easy to follow and you don't need to stop and start your CD every two seconds to replay the section. Teach Yourself Polish only taught me how to pull my hair out in frustration. I say, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves Way Too Fast !!!","review":"Moved way too fast for me. The first lesson starts out w/ the Polish alphabet and immediately jumps into pronunciations. The CD does not walk you through each lesson the way a CD-ROM does, it only gives the correct pronunciation of the words. You'll have to read the book closer to be able to follow. Even when they speak, they speak too fast to hear them. I had to keep backing up the CD and replaying it. If you are a beginner and catch on super quick, this may work for you. But if you need more detailed instruction and build things slowly in your mind as you understand them, this would not be your item. Not a bad item but too fast for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was a terrible waste of money. My wife and I are moving to Poland in 6 months and wanted to begin learning Polish so that we can get around Warsaw without much help and to be able to communicate effectively. This CD and book set was practically useless for beginning language students. After 3 weeks with the CDs we are still on Lesson 1 and cannot understand half of what is said. The book as a great deal of information that is not even included on the CDs. No phonetic pronunciation guides are included in the book so new vocabulary that is introduced is a guessing game as to how you should pronounce it. A native Polish speaker that I know looked at the book yesterday and told me that there are incorrect sentences and slang introduced in the book as \\"correct grammer\\" and that we should not use this series to help us to transition to life in Poland. I would not recommend this set to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse rip off ever","review":"DON'T ever buy this book.....I couldn't learn comfortably...there is more English in it than Polish....how fun wgen you have to replay 50 times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, new Looney Tunes the way we want 'em","review":"Truly a blast..if you're a Looney Tunes fan (or even if you've never heard them before) this cleverly written show-on-a-CD is a refreshing new take on all our classic favorites.

With all the junk out there that young people are reading these days, it's great to see a story that can be exciting and suspenseful without being too dark.

As the story goes along, each book keeps getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a ABC Book","review":"This is Homeschool Mom's daughter, I am 14.I LOVED this book and the ones after it. It is not an ABC (Already Been Chewed) Book. Christains and non-Christians will enjoy it immensly. Every page is Packed with non stop adventure and mystery. Very fast moving and yet unsolved mysteries hang in the air, ones that started hundreds of years before the characters were born. Well plotted and Extremly well developed. Characters are deep and beleivable. The Conflict is REAL. The Danger is REAL. I never ever had any trouble with the things in this book. The relationships that build are deep and again Real. This is a book no one should miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I read this series a few years ago when someone gave them to my kids. The kids seemed to enjoy them, but the books got under my skin. The author has this bad habit of throwing in a ten-dollar word or some overly flowery or complex construct in the middle of YA novel. A time or two I could forget, but it occurred with an irritating regularity. I got the impression that the author was trying to impress the adult reader with his vocabulary rather than to write a good story.The story line was typical YA and thus not too deep but appropriate for the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfuly disapointing","review":"thin plot... thin charicters... yuk.unbeliveable premis, but i could deal with that. however- the absoulte cornyness? no. you also may ask if this book is really christian. my answer? if everyone claiming to be one and yet never once asking for God's help is, then yes. but toward the end of the books, bryan davis even loses \\"we strugle not against flesh and blood\\" in that a few demons who come on the seen can be knocked down when a man jumps them from behind. and as i said above, God is never asked for help in this fight, nor is the name of Jesus envoked against these \\"demons\\". don't waste your time like i did in reading these. if you want some good christain fiction, try Karen Hancock (adult fic.) or C.S.

Christian dragons.. because that is so... logical..If you want to reinforce the mass-media brain-washing of your kids into mindlessly following what they are told the Christian faith is without ever studying or thinking about said faith for themselves, this is the book for you!From what little I read before it got all preachy, it seemed like it was very well written. But very well written religious propaganda is still propaganda.Helpful hint for the writer: Dragons, if they existed, wouldn't have souls and there for wouldn't be eligible for salvation.Salvation is a human only thing.You should try actually studying a religion before trying to write about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The making of a fantasy fan","review":"Bryan Davis uses unique methods to draw the reader into his fantasy. I bought the book for my son-in-law for Christmas and ended up reading it before he did and I'm not usually drawn into fantasy. Mr. Davis' analogies are fantastic.

The author created a captivating story filled with lots of suspense and mystery. His excellent character development and strong story line made me read far longer each night than my wife appreciated.I look forward to the next book and am sure it will be even better than the first. My four star ranking relates to my being a middle aged man. I think it's a five star book for youth readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star and nothing less!","review":"Its sad that there is so little of a selection of Christian Fantasy and the books that are out there are somewhat hard to follow and require motivation to pick back up to read again. I found this book in the teen section and decided to give it a shot. Gotta say, I absolutely loved it. Loved it to the point of buying the entire series including the first of the Children of the Bard series continuation. I read through all the negative reviews and don't see how they apply to the book at all. Thumbs down to all that gave this book a bad review and spoke ill of Bryan's writing style. I thought it was perfect. Perfect blend of detail, suspense, and other emotion allowing you to connect with and feel the characters with little to no problem.

Anyway, I enjoy many of the songs here. 'All Things Considered' (maybe I could be the subject of this song) 'Sad to Say', 'Riot on Broad Street', 'Where you Come From' and 'Day He Didn't Die' are highlights for me, although I don't think there are any bad songs here.

Ska is slipping to the background as straight ahead punk/pop begins to dominate the band's sound. This is all right because the best songs here are the more convential pop/rockers \\"So Sad to Say\\" and \\"I Know More\\".

Too bad for me. Anyways it's decision time to see if we want all the features this has and spend about 100.00 or buy new. I must say that I have never had a microwave oven quit after only 1 year, even a cheap one. Not sure if I just got a bad unit or just not a good durable unit to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"New R-820JS replacement","review":"After at least 35 YEARS of use, my old Sharp mIcro/convection oven has begun to get a little tired and the Magnatron tube takes a little longer to microwave frozen dinners. The turntable is getting a little weird also but there are not too many things that last 35 years these days so I have decided to get a new R-820JS. I have used it almost every day and it has worked perfectly up to now. I use it on a cart as my primary oven in lieu of the built-in. I think this oven is the best appliance I have ever owned.Using the combo micro/convection roasting works just great & reduces cooking time while browning just like an older style oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Microwave","review":"Love this microwave. We purchased it to replace our toaster oven and microwave.. my only complaint is that it doesn't \\"toast\\" very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"New version of an old friend","review":"My old Sharp convection/microwave finally gave out. I used it every day, especially as a regular oven. I couldn't replace it with anything less. The new version makes all the same great features much easier to understand and use. A digital readout guides you through setting up each feature and is very easy to follow. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"only lasted for a year and a half and wouldn't grill a steak like the previous 2 sharp micro convection would that I owned...this one was like baking meat not grilling...it would do chicken or any meat that took a hour or so to cook OK but failed miserably on anything thin or needed high heat to brown quickly...look elsewhere because this model sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp R-820JS convection microwave","review":"It only worked for a week then died while heating water. Been in the shop getting fixed now for about 3 weeks, waiting for 2 parts. I have used Sharp convection microwaves in the past and was expecting the same excellent quality. What a disappointment. Don't buy this oven. Continue searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"Had this microwave for 2 years. The grill feature gives VERY uneven results - stick to your bbQ grill. It takes a long time to heat anything up and as I found out this week - it cannot pop a bag of popcorn - even a small bag. Each snack size popcorn bag took 5 minutes and then less than half the kernels popped.Will be replacing this with anything but a Sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A OVEN FOR EVERYTHING","review":"I have purchased this over for over 4 years. Works amazingly especially for all the days when you don't want to turn on that big oven just to toast/bake/grill some food. Best machine invented! I've researched for a long time for a product like this. All my three teenagers have no problems baking a frozen pizza. Makes life easier! Highly recommended. Only negative: Doesn't make good popcorn. Other than that, great investment. You will use it everyday for anything..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but no way to register","review":"Sharp has a terrible web site. The window for registering the product comes up blank. Filled out a form to let Sharp know and the submit button doesn't work. Called their 800 number and the person didn't know what to do and after being on hold the second time I just hung up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bit of junk!","review":"I have never before had a Sharp product that I was not impressed favorably with. This thing has the tinniest cheap feel. It does not set level, and the door often needs an extra push on the upper right corner to shut properly. The microwave is not as fast as the one it replaced and the interior is small. The automatic programming is well thought out, though. It tells you just exactly what to do for things like setting the clock. After about three weeks it just abruptly quit. Not even lighting up. Thankfully I still had the old micro wave out in the garage and I brought it back into the kitchen. My wife and I were glad to see it. It is also a Sharp and is just in a whole different class for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"This may do everything, but it takes so long it's not worth the wait. It also takes up a lot of counter space. I am opting for two ovens - a small microwave and a small toaster oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss popcorn","review":"I got this because I wanted a convection oven/microwave and I had a sharp before and it worked great. This is a piece of crap. I have not had popcorn in a year it either burns it or doesn't cook it. I cooked a chicken on convection mode. It was the worst piece of chicken I have ever had. It was like rubber, my cat wouldn't even eat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work well & Began Arcing","review":"The oven appeared to be well made with many neat features, but it never worked as well as an inexpensive 11 year old Sears model it replaced. We returned it when it began arcing under the turntable, actually beginning to burn the driveshaft for the turntable. Amazon returns has made it painless - print out the return label, re-package & drop off at UPS. Hope the refund process works as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thank heaven for Grill 2 Oven","review":"I bought this micro convection oven for my boat. It replaced the microwave only oven I had, I already cooked pizza, toasted bread, bake biscuits, etc., It is great to have it on board my galley."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp microwave","review":"We have owned this product for about three years now and it has never let us down. It not only works as a standard microwave, but it makes great pizzas, pies, and anything you can make in a toaster oven or your standard oven. Works great, that's why we purchased this one for our son for Xmas this year. He has a standard microwave oven and suggested that he would prefer one like ours. Now he gets his wish. Love the oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this appliance","review":"I had some hesitations regarding the looks of this product as it wasn't stainless steel (on the outside) but gray. I wanted it to match my stainless appliances and not stand out like a sore thumb. It looks great! I've not had any problems in the 7 weeks we've owned it (admittedly, that's not much time). The stainless steel interior is easy to clean and the multi-functionality of this appliance puts it steps above the average microwave / convection oven. It is easy to use with clear instructions. I keep the manual in the drawer below this countertop and reach for it when I want to try something new. I recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this microwave to use during a kitchen remodel. I was hoping that the convection/microwave combination would be useful during the time when I did not have my built in ovens or microwave available. The first thing that we tried to use was the popcorn function and that was enough. HORRIBLE. Would not pop more than 1/4 of a bag of popcorn. If you tried to add more time to the automatic setting, it just burned it. Worthless. Also, reheating anything required a least twice the usual amount of time. The buttons were very un-user friendly and my children complained that \\"it looked old-fashioned\\". I could not recommend this unit for anything. It was returned immediately. Very disappointed. I promptly purchased a similar sized Panasonic unit and have had no issues whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% as advertized!","review":"We were looking for a convection microwave.

Not even an email indicating why it was removed.Guess they are changing their practices after all.And there is no way to retrieve it either.Im not going to waste my time as last time, but a quick summary:Pros: Looks good, thats itCons: too much depth, too slow, lousy toaster (main reason for purchasing it..for a small home)...too many buttons to press for a simple operation, and if u make a mistake, start all over again, lousy lcd display, cannot view from top or side.Now lets see if they remove this review !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks chintzy, stainless steel only on the interior","review":"I have no opinion on how this cooks because I never turned it on. Opened the box and saw that 1) the front of the microwave was cheap-looking silver plastic, and 2) only the interior is actually stainless steel and so it didn't match anything in my kitchen. Sealed it up and sent it back to Amazon. If you read the description right you'll see they disclose it's only the interior that's stainless, but definitely not what I was expecting for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught on fire! Horrible warranty experience!","review":"The microwave itself worked great for almost a year, but when I called Sharp warranty service to get it replaced after it caught on fire and started billowing smoke, they told me I had to either bring it to an authorized service repair center 5 miles away (I live in Manhattan and use public transportation, so this is not just slightly inconvenient, it's inconceivable). Find a microwave that isn't a safety hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"sharp over the range microwave","review":"DO NOT BUY A SHARP OVER THE RANGE MICROWAVE. THEY HAVE TWO MODELS.

There is no way I can express the functionality of the Sharp R-820JS microwave/convection oven, because I could not install it. If I had been told that it could not be installed over a heat source, I would not have purchased it. No where in the description of the oven was this noted. In all of the 35 reviews, no one said anything about not installing it over a range. I found out that it could not be installed over a heat source when I read the manual. That was too late! I had already purchased the unit, and it was delivered. Perhaps this has happened to other people, but they have not written of their disappointment of not being able to use this product, due to the negative feature of this Sharp oven. Hopefully, this will prevent others from getting it and having to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off da Chain","review":"The first cd was good but this one is even better.

I thought it was a great deal for a portable DVD player. We bought it to use on long car trips for the kids to watch movies. I thought it was fine initially, I didn't really notice any problem with the volume. However, after using it on approx 5 car trips, it will now only work if we use a piece of duct tape to hold the lid down over the DVD. Some sensor went bad and even if the lid is closed it still says it's open. Some might wonder why I didn't call customer service for help. Therein lies the main reason I give this product 1 Star -- NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I tried the number in the manual - I get a recording that the number is not in service. I looked up Spectroniq's website and tried that number also got the same message no service. I will never buy a product by this company again, and I feel really bad for people who bought expensive products from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectroniq stinks!!","review":"I bought a Spectroniq dvd player so I could let my kids enjoy their movies both in the car on trips and in the house so there would be less fighting at movie time.

I never listen to this cd, but I love It's Dark and Hell is Hot and The Great Depression. This cd has a million stupid skits and no good songs.

Yes, many of you Ruff Ryder fans are impressed that he has put out three albums in two years, and that his artistic integrity frees him to say exactly what's on his (limited) mind. But one day you'll tire of his song and dance--\\"I'm angry, I have pain, I'll murder you, I screw pretty women\\". Give me more. Expand your boundaries--or lose them entirely, if you can. His music is cathartic, I'll allow that. Losing yourself in it is a good outlet--screaming along with his words gives you a false sense of connection with a famous man. But the anger he sells you is contrived. He has his image and he'll stick with it. Fans slurp it up like hot soup....Every time I hear \\"new single by DMX\\", I know I'm not going to hear anything new. I know I won't be inspired or impressed.

Heck if you like hip-hop get this cd it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Man is Back!","review":"This album is tight! It contains the same mad beats as DMX's previous two albums, and keeps it real on almost every track.

D got no love at all.... I actually liked the cut w/ Regina Bell on it, I almost bought the album for that one. After hearing that y'all gone make me lose my mind garbage i quickly scrapped that idea. I got to hear it at a friends house about two days later. MAN was I glad that I didn't waste [money] on it! I'd have to say that each of his albums has been 1/2 as good as it's predecessor. Flesh of My Flesh was good at best, while Then There Was X is [really awful].

This is only an ok recording. The whole way through it sounds like it was rushed through production. It just doesn't sound complete. It also has to much of a pop, mainstream feel. I mean I think it was meant to click with the TRL fans or something. I think DMX is just trying to ride out his success with less than average music.If you are a DMX fan, I would suggest this cd because its got his famous style.

I was never into his stuff before. After hearing a couple of the songs on the radio, I just had to go out and pick it up. What The B*****s Want and What's My Name are probably the best tracks on the album. The beats on these two songs are unbelievable. His lyrics throughout the album make you sit up and listen.

He also needs to stop yelling in every song and concentrate on his lyrics. Now, if you want REAL, true talent, buy a Bone Thugs N Harmony cd. Now thats a group with talent.

This album lacks originality. If you really want, you can buy it and hear all the same thugged out sh1t that you can get on most other hip hop releases (including DMX's).Most of the beats on this are worse than previous albums, and DMX just recycles the exact same formula that he used on his previous two albums. Worse is the hypocrisy on his tracks. In one he talks about how it doesn't matter how much you pay for what you have and how rich you are, but then on another track the theme is getting money.Everybody's already heard about getting money, getting women, killing enemies. If DMX wasn't going to say anything new, why did he bother making this album at all?If you want some good hip hop, check out Mos Def or Gang Starr, because this is definitely an album to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkman does it again","review":"DMX is back with his best album yet. ...and then there X is slower than his other albums but i think it works. if you are going to buy an album i advise you by this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps putting it down.","review":"Dmx's energy gets higher and higher every album and on his latest he shows he is still at the top of his game.

This guy and the product he puts out is sooooo terrible. It's all about killing minorities and women. I hear a lot of people compare this clown to Tupac.... actually he is the anti-Tupac: DMX is not intelligent, not emotional, not interesting and has absolutely nothing positive or meaningful to say. I mean I heard that joker Carson Daley on MTV say that this CD was \\"an amazing, amazing CD... definitely get that one... we're big DMX fans at MTV\\"... basically making it out like this CD was good when frankly it's not worth a thing.If you're looking for a good rap CD, get ANYTHING except this trash.

Those two stars, by the way, are for the beats on the album. Nothing that Earl does is worth listening to if you're looking at the lyrics. He uses every rap cliche in the book, so I just can't feel any of his songs. On this album, he comes with rhymes my 8 year old brother could top, and he don't even like rap yet! For all the people claiming that DMX has the best album ever, did you actually listen to the lyrics on this album? They're horrible! So again, if you're going to give this album 5 stars, back up your review with some lyrics of his that are actually tight.

Not his best, it is still better than most artists in thier prime. Although not as good as \\"It's dark and hell is hot\\", it has some of the best beats from Swiss Beats and Ruff Ryder camp yet. Along with Sisqo and many of the Ruff Ryders, DMX drops hottest rhymes ever heard. DMX can flow like none other and if you liked his first album you will definatly like this one. It is not as hard core as his second album which did not get the credit it deserved. This is one of the best album's in years once again showing that DMX rules the hip hop world.

Swizz Beats and his Ruff Ryders Production Crew provided some of the best head banging beats.. proving there are one of the best production teams out there ..

A real dmx fan will be able to appreciate the energy he puts into the music, no one emphasizes words better than x such as on \\"one more road to cross\\", but overall it seemed rushed he needs to sit down and write like he did on its dark.

You all now what i mean, the way he says a line (pause) another line (pause) another line (repeat for entire album) Sure, most of his beats and lyrics are tight, but without the essential flow over the mic, to me he is more of a preacher than a rapper.

Maybe a couple nice tracks but overall the album is forgettable and whoever said this album was more than three stars is smokin something serious. DMX could be great because he has a lot of personality and pours emotion into his songs, but with Swizz Beats........It's sad to say that will never happen. Party Up with its mad exposure is so played out it makes you wanna jump off of a cliff. Unlistenable. other ok songs include One More Road To Cross, DXL, What's My Name and uh nothing else.

That is the worst beat X rhymed on, but it's worth listening to because X rips it. Cop this quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"X's 3rd album is definately his worst. Unfortunately he played the commercial game a bit here and his style is not the old violent DMX we knew from his previous albums. Evidence of this is doing \\"What These B*****s Want\\", a duet with Sisqo. SISQO! There were a few joints that were okay but not as good as anything on his earlier ones. \\"One More Road\\" and \\"Party Up\\" are my best joints on here. I recommend you listen to It's Dark... and Flesh Of My Flesh instead. Or save your money and buy The Great Depression, which is much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confused and Isolated","review":"I really don't buy DMX's religious beliefs, especially whenthey are mixed with lyrics that are the same as Eminem.

He still makes you feel and understand his pain, but on his first album he came with original never heard before rhymes and beats. On his second and third you feel like you are hearing a copy of the first one.This is not bad in a way, because he sticks to wat he does best.I believe that is a big part of keeping it real. You have to give this album some time to get in too your head. So spin it a couple of times before you coment it. As a real DMX fan I can say it is a dope album, but I hope that on the next one he takes it back to his roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is not that bad","review":"Now i don't follow hip hop. the only hip hop cds i have are pink eminem and toni braxton i listen to punk rock.....but, i think this cd is groundbreaking..beautiful that song with sisqo is the bomb. while i don't see how he can sing about god in one song then go to rapping about killing someone. but i guess rap is violent like that oh well. pick this bad boy up it rocks"},{"rating":"2","title":"DMX","review":"This C.D. is alright. It isn't his best but I still listen to it. My favorite song on there is probably D-X-L because it has a good beat and it isn't just him rapping on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the hardcore?","review":"Positives: DMX still brings it hardcore on a few tracks and you can see why his previous albums were so popular. His voice is cool and I like the intensity he puts into his rap.Negatives: He has all the same faults as Ja Rule or maybe it's the other way around. Too commercial now, and his spectrum of topics is very limited. I guess he tried to freshen his style up a little, but I like the grimy underground music X used to put out and this album only briefly visits that part. \\"Party Up\\" is undoubtedly the worst track on the album but it's the video he put on TV first. The rapping in most of these songs is still pretty decent but the choruses are just bad. What's next? Singing kids? We should have let him stay underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"this clown cannot match the legend, the king 2pac","review":"DMX, doesnt come close to the raw style and lyrics of the late Tupac Shaker DMXS style is as weak as his image, posing in pictures where he has blood pouring down his body made alot of people and other rappers laugh this so called rapper off stage. Its just like Eminem said, DMX is and always has used 2pacs style to make money out of people who just have no taste in rap/hip hop and are just looking for a replacement of 2pac. Forget it there never will be a rapper as real, raw, excitng, and controversial as 2pac."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst skillet ever","review":"This is an awful electric skillet. As mentioned, it doesn't heat evenly, and it takes FOREVER to cook anything. The handles on the pan get hot like the rest of the pan, so it's a little deceiving because you think you can just lift the pan off when you're done, but instead you burn your hands. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Great design in concept and appearance, but you would do better to hold a candle under a frying pan. This skillet is raised in center so oil and liquids run off to edges. Even after checking and re-checking to make sure that the pan was properly seated on the base, it took forever to brown pre-cooked breakfast sausage and even cook scrambled eggs while this thing was on high (400). I'll bet that had I left them in the pan and walked away, the skillet would not have been able to burn the eggs! I'm not going to keep it long enough to see whether the non-stick coating peels off after 3 or 4 uses as others have reported. What is most disappointing though, is that Rival continues to market this piece of garbage. They had to be aware of its performance long before making the decision to put it on the market, and that speaks volumes about the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing rival electric skillet","review":"rival electric skillet with removable pan. it does not heat well. i ruined a dinner i could cook in my old electric skillet with great results. i was very disappointed. i threw away the heating element and have written rival to see if i can put the pan and lid in the oven, but have not had a reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to other reviewers!","review":"I loved this skillet the first two times I used it: the removable pan is a really fantastic concept, and it cleaned incredibly well. I bought it because I'm always hesitant to believe the worst of a product, and Rival is a well-known brand.Unfortunately, in this case, other reviewers were definitely right. Once I tried to make a gravy in this skillet (in other words, an extended heating time), I saw where the negative reviews were coming from. The skillet browned up the sausage all right, but once I dusted it with flour, I could tell it was losing heat. It went quickly downhill when I poured the milk in, and I ended up having to transfer all that gravy into two stovetop skillets!This was an extremely frustrating experience, and I'm glad I kept all the original packaging. At least I'll get a refund. I hope other readers will be saved from making the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"I agree with most of the other bad complaints about this product. The only good thing about the frying pan is that it comes off to clean. The bad part is that it does come off. The pan sits on the heating coils and does not get as hot as the pans with internal coils. This also makes the temperature setting worthless, as it isn't correct. You have to set it at 375 to cook something that would normally have a 325 setting. All in all, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defeat the safety feature","review":"The safety engineers have done it to us again. They have incorporated a safety button that prevents the element from heating if the pan is removed. The only problem is that the pan does not depress the button far enough for the unit to come fully on when the pan is in place...it won't even boil a cup of water! I defeated that safety feature by wadding up a piece of duct tape and jamming it in the recess then covering with another piece to keep the button depressed. Now it works perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this from what I thought was a reputable source, and I thought I would love the removable pan. I come up with a new reason to hate this pan every time I use it. First of all, the pan is warped so liquid flows to the edges. Then the heat is uneven, cooler on the edges, hotter in the middle, so if you want things cooked evenly, you must watch and rotate food to the hot parts of the pan. Lastly, it says it's dishwasher safe, but when I put it upside down on the top rack, water collected on top of it so that I got splashed when I opened the dishwasher. Don't buy this frustrating pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there isn't a \\"negative star\\" rating","review":"In addition to the crappy design and worse execution mentioned by other reviewers, this pan is out and out dangerous. The exposed element could easily injure, and injure seriously, if the user forgets that it's hot, and pan isn't in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a good product, but...","review":"This would have been a great product except for one problem. The pan has a raised center! This makes it impossible to fry, as the oil settles in the edges of the pan with none left in the center. What were these designers thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsatisfactory","review":"My rival pan immediately got bowed up in the middle the first time I used. it.

The bottom, (teflon coated), is bubbling and I believe the teflon is coming off. I use wood or vinyl cooking utensils on it and it looks bad to me. The fact that the coils are not getting red, even at 400 degrees, leads me to think that have a faulty skillet. I feel that I should get my money back or a replacement. I am sure to put the pan on the coils properly but it is just a terrible disappointment to me as I have not had bad luck with other rival products I have bought. what or who do I contact to find some resolution to this problem? Your help and advice will be truly appreciated.

I agree with the others. After seasoning the pan in advance (per instructions), I made pancakes the next morning - it was a disaster. The center is slightly raised (probably to allow grease to drain), but that caused my batter to spill to the sides. Even at 400, it couldn't hold the batter in the center of the pan or brown my pancakes...well it could, but by the time the entire pancake was cooked on one side there was no need to flip it! The concept is admirable (removable server), but this may have been part of the reason it couldn't hold heat. Plus it was more difficult to handle. The removable pan doesn't lock in securely, so I had to remove two pieces of equipment from my cupboard instead of one.I'm glad I hadn't thrown out my old trusty pan.

No amount of oil or butter can stop virtually all foods from sticking. I was initially attracted to this product because it has a removable pan. However, it does not heat evenly.

I read the product manual and heated oil in the pan to \\"season\\" it prior to my first use. I have experienced the uneven cooking surface and uneven cooking temperatures. I find the thermostat annoying as the light just indicates that it is on and there is no indication that the set temperature has been reached.

The way Rival markets this unit, it sounded like a nice feature. However, after using it the first time I noticed the pan bows in the center when heated up. If you try to cook anything that has a liquid consistancy (ie, eggs, pancakes, etc...) the food item runs to the sides of the pan. This happens due to the pan thickness being too thin, causing the center to expand and bow up in the center when heated. It could have easily been resolved if they had either made the pan thicker or put ribs on the pan to provide structural support.Don't waste your money on this skillet if you are expecting a flat cooking surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I bought this skillet 6 months ago and I have already thrown it out!

The book was filmed in 1967 and starred Paul Newman in the title role."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"Been a long time since I've read Leonard's stuff. Having fondly remembered Get Shorty, Maximum Bob and Rum Punch, I thought I'd download a few of his books to my new Kindle.

I've taught two kindergarten-age children to read with this book; by the time they entered first grade they were at the \\"top of their class.\\" I've looked through all the \\"modern\\" phonics and reading books for all levels at the major bookstores, and there's absolutely nothing that comes even close in its ability to allow a parent to really teach a child to read. Working through a page or two a day with your child is all it takes, and before long your child will be able to read ANYTHING -- and you'll probably learn some things you didn't realize about English pronunciation as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring compared to earlier work.","review":"This is the fourth book I have read by Sharon Olds. I found The Father to be less enjoyable than her other collections of poetry such as Satan Says or The Dead and the Living.In The Father, it seems that Olds has finally come to terms with her father and forgiven him for the past, but I am not sure if Olds just doesn't have anything left to say, or if I'm just not interested in hearing it. To me, The Father seems to be typical and redundant-in content and style. Don't get me completely wrong though, there were a few poems I really liked, and several metaphors here and there really caught my attention. As usual, Olds was very frank and direct about her emotions, but overall I felt very uninspired by this collection of poems. By the end I was just bored and ready to be done with the book. It is like reading someone who doesn't know what to write about but feels compelled to write anyway. If you have never read Olds, I would recommend her earlier work first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful introduction to the Bengali Language","review":"This book is a fantastic journey into a new language.

Ms. Rowe writes less in the action genre of mysteries, but in the intellectual genre, where as Poirot puts it, you have to use your little grey cells. The former slave, and Celt, Libertus, has to do this. He makes his errors and takes his knocks for them, he deals with Roman attitudes towards social ranking and sexual ranking, and finds his way through the blocks put in his way. If you like historically accurate period writing, Ms. Rowe does it well. To me, it detracts if something is out of character and out of period, but I am a history buff and perhaps notice it more. But Ms. Rowe stays firmly on track, both in clever plotting and historical accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty to Sing and Ask About","review":"My preschool-age boys have this book but we plan to buy a second copy to save because we all like it so much. The boys always ask to read and sing \\"Dinah!\\"-their name for the book because of the part in the song about Dinah, her kitchen, and blowing her horn. The illustrations are so interesting that my boys are as interested in the pictures as in the singing. When we finish singing, we often go back through the book and talk about all the wacky and wild stuff that is happening. Dinah's restaurant is truely a happening place and all the customers are thoroughly enjoying themselves as the food is flying around them! I definately recommend this fun book. A warning to you though: the song gets stuck in your head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spa Lounge CD","review":"I bought this CD especially for 2 of the cuts.

Ours has 4 post with curtian rods connecting each post. This item doesnt have rod sleves and hangs from post to post. The middle is solid so from overhead looking up there its covered from post to post by fabric. This creates several challenges, 1) what to do about the sag from post to post and 2) What to do with the sagging center top fabric. It comes with some hooks to attach the center to the ceiling but our celing was too high to use them. Bottom line is if you have a low ceiling or a bed with several slats across the top you'll get this to fit. Else, you in for problems and will need a sewing machine to make adjustments.I wound up buying sheer drapes to hang from our canopy bed rods. The quality certianly isnt bad for the price but its not a one size fits all situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"The material is cheaper looking and instructions are a joke, like another poster said. I literally had to hold the canopy drapes on my posts with hair bands! I also placed two sheets on the top and front post to give me a greater sense of coziness.

Needless to say, I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This might be a good product for someone who wants something purely for looks but as far as functionality it is a waste of money. There are so many gaps and the fabric is cut so poorly that we had to use 26 - count 'em - 26 safety pins in an attempt to keep out mosquitos. Where the fabric should have been cut straight in order to overlap the open flaps it was cut at angles away for each other so we had to pull it to make it overlap. There are huge gaps at every corner, presumably for the bed posts, and not enough fabric to overlap and cover the holes. There is no way this is useful as bug netting."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't look like the picture","review":"This product looked very cool when I saw it on the computer.

For the most part, the album is slow to mid-tempo but it definitely grabs your attention. My favorite songs included \\"Separted\\", \\"My first love\\", \\" I wanna Know\\" but to tell the truth I had never had to skip over any tracks!

Avant a R-Kelly wannabe? I don't know, but if that were his intentions, he's acting pretty good. But I took all my biases away when I heard the album. Songs that sincerely took my breath away were 'My first love' and 'I wanna know'. A song that also sounds familiar to me is 'Why', a really beautiful track. And if you can't get enough check the remixes of 'Seperated' (feat. Destiny's Child and Kelly Rowland).

With Avant co-writing most of the songs on the album, he has already gotten a head-start on his own creative writing department. With songs like his first single \\"Separated\\", he brings a message to today's R&B community, already hearing comparisons to R Kelly with his songs. Other songs on the album include my favorite \\"Get Away\\" as well as \\"Keys to the Range\\" and \\"This Time\\". This is a more than adequate debut from an up-and-coming R&B/soul singer. Only 5 stars for the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"straight to your heart","review":"This recording from Avant is a true great peice of work.

The crew was flat. The whole story made no sense. I could not even finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. do not buy.","review":"This thermos has poor heat retention. If you fill it with a hot beverage, and cap it, you can immediately feel the heat from the out side. In other words, the heat does not stay inside, and in other words, it is a poor insulator.What should you do?I would buy an old Stanley Aladdin (pre 2001) from ebay. Those were great. I have one from 1983 that will keep piping hot coffee pretty hot even after 10 hours. I have also heard really good things about the Nissan thermoses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Metal","review":"I used to play this album on my radio show two years ago. It was harder than most of the American metal at the time, and the production was outstanding. Specifically, the effects on the singer's voice, coupled with the unrelenting drive of the music and the inherent harshness of the German language create a complete and unified sound. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but boring.","review":"This book is painfully slow leaving me drifting off, reading pages only to have to re read them. It has an interesting story in their but it just failed to interest me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult, plodding book","review":"This is a historically-based tale of Gunnhild, a legendary Viking queen of the 10th century, and a sort of Livia of her day. She schemes and charms her way into a position of power as the wife of the King of Norway, then uses her magical talents to keep herself there and to support her husband and their children. She makes too many enemies, though, and most of her schemes come to naught.I was kind of disappointed in this book. The characters never came alive for me, and for most of the time I found myself plodding through the text, made more difficult by the Norse names and turns of phrase. Maybe I should go back and read Anderson's Tau Zero, of which I have fond memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple & cheap, but only one page wide","review":"I bought a few of these stands because I wanted something cheap and simple that my wife could set on the ottoman while she played the guitar. These work wonderfully for that purpose. They come as a flat sheet of cardboard(which means they come in a rather large box). I'm not sure how many times they can be re-flattened and put back together, but they stack rather nicely when folded into stands. They only hold one sheet of music at a time, so get two or three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabs don't fit in the slots","review":"I have ordered these before and they are wonderful for the price and do last a long time considering they are cardboard. These however, did not fit together properly and several ripped as I was putting them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the changing table","review":"I'm a huge fan of no-frills yet interesting mobiles, and this one fits the bill. There are 2 detachable animals, a mirror, and a ring with a chime. It is very colorful and can be hung from the ceiling with an s-hook. If you are looking for lights, music, and cheap plastic, this won't be the mobile for you. If you are looking for a cozy simple fabric mobile, this is a good investment (as are most Haba toys). Wish I'd bought this for my first child! One thing to note - it's a bit heavy, due to sturdy construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT made in Germany- beware!","review":"Unlike the description of the product suggests, this product is not made in Germany.

It holds his attention much better than the Baby Einstein DVDs. There's a section with music that I really love as well. The playgroup activities shown at the end of the video really gave me some good ideas of things I could do at home with my baby. This is a great DVD and I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read!","review":"Pacemaker technology is not an easy thing to learn. Often the question is where to start. This illustrated guide presents the basics in a fun way combined with easy to read text.

Recently, I've grown tired of just letting it be and decided to do something about not only the acne, but the scarring itself. So I bought this stuff a week ago and tried it out.First off, the acne cream smells horrible. I found it quite unbearable, not to mention it burns as well, while the wash is an abrasive soap with a milder medicine-like smell. But no pain no gain, right? Wrong. After a couple days using this stuff, I broke out in even more acne. There were literally over 20 red spots scattered all over my back! This has NEVER happened before.I continued to use it, though, just in case the acne was somehow being caused by something else. But now I see acne forming on my chest as well.I will not be using this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New West","review":"Very strong debut. Yes, the influence of Mr. McCarthy is all over this, but the author has a wonderful command of language that is distinct to that of McCarthy. He's maybe a little more readable while still being poetic and strongly evocative. I felt the story meandered a little bit, but on the other hand the ending was more satisfying than I expected. You head toward the climax really wondering which way the author is gonna take things and, fortunately, he provides an unexpected and reasonable outcome. Good stuff. I'd be happy to read his next one and hope he keeps at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare For The Blessing","review":"Dr. Millicent Thompson has written this clear and in-depth book for christian believers to grow and mature in the things of God. I found this book particularly enriching for me as a woman, wife and mother over the age of forty. It is encouraging for women who are married; single; divorced; widowed; women in ministry and christians in general. It was inspirational to read that the \\"Winters\\" in our lives--(hard/testing time)are only for a season; they too will pass. Also, Winter time is a wonderful time to prepare for the Spring in our lives as expressed by Dr. Thompson. It was very well written and easy to read. The author speaks out of her life's experiences and shares those experiences with the reader. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Get This Book","review":"I read this whole book in two days because I am going through some serious rough times and uncertainty about God's call on my life. If you're wondering where you are in God's plans and it feels like you are not only getting no where, but you're being attacked by the enemy, you need to read this book. It was so helpful and insightful and straight to the point. \\"Don't Die in the Winter\\" was a God sent book. It was right on time for when I most needed it. Get this book and hear what God is saying to you through Millicent Thompson (Hunter). You're not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"will last a long time","review":"stainless steel and brass great product work well keep pump primed but i only use it 2 mounts out of the year"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't caught up in this book","review":"If I knew more about this book, I wouldn't have bought it, I would however check it out from a library..."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds like violence","review":"a great collection of songs from a very prolific band. since this is a group of recordings from different stages of the band, there are alot of styles and shifts represented on this cd. the first 3 songs arte from the very first 7\\" and are some of my favorites....their is a very paranoid style of playing in these early recordings and it sounds great even now. the rest of the cd goes through other 7\\"s and some compilation tracks (of which Braid must have recorded around 7000 songs..hehe). it all comes full circle with the last 3 songs which were on the last Braid 7\\" which showcase a more driving streamlined style. good stuff all around...but probably only recommended for fans of the band...not a good starting point for those curious about Braid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very compatible","review":"Difficult to download..

If you're into to Hatebreed and bands of the like, this is it. Rick and the boy's from 25 ta Life are true pioneers of the scene. Not only are they a great band to see live, but a great band to play with. They may not have been one of the firsts HC bands on the scene, but they did more for it then most. I've had the pleasure of playing with these guys on many occasions. Let me tell ya, they were always willing to help out new bands. So, if you want to hear the roots of bands like Hatebreed, by this album. NYHC underground (or just in general) at it's finest.........Planet Freak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Incredible Muscle Child Costume","review":"The size seemed correct and once worn, the costume made quite an impression (from far away it looked great). My son was very excited about the muscles. The quality however wasn't very good. The mask was made with cheep foam as was much of the rest of it. After one wear it showed major signs of wear. The costume is so spectacular in the movie, what we got as an actual costume was a real let-down, typical made in China product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too uncomfortable for my 4 year old boy.","review":"When I first saw it I thought it was going to be a good one, but once I tried it on my son, it was too big, too stiff that he didnt want to use it..

It arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery date and was very true to the picture except the mask. He loves the costume and its great that the wrists and the leg bottoms (black parts in the picture) taper to fit a little more snug so that we can use it for Halloween too in case the weather is a factor. Will have to wear a coat OVER-not under for these reasons. The mask is flimsy-just as I read in a review-a foam type with stretchy plastic to hold it on. My son won't wear that-it tends to fold over around the eyes and nose. I plan on checking in the Halloween aisles for a different type of generic mask. Otherwise-it seems to be of good quality and the \\"muscles\\" are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best present ever","review":"The BEST present we ever bought our son. Don't wait for Halloween to get your kids costumes - they make for amazing Christmas and birthday presents too! Our son has worn this costume on average, about 4/week in the last year and a half, and it's somehow grown with him - that's GREAT QUALITY!!

I dont problems with my sets, I wasnt missing any soundtrack on the first volume.Yes, they could have been remastered and all that, but like I said, I am just excited to be able to watch them again, the tapes i had them on are getting old, pushing 18-20 year old VHS tapes, that quality was getting bad.Just a side note to some, the Annointment Trials were originally broadcasted once a week for 5 weeks (the other 4 days were other new episodes), so the DVD is in the original broadcast order, they were rerun back to back in the subsequent reruns of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"The SAME as Volume 1","review":"An MSRP of $65 is insulting for a program (while absolutly great) that has single track mono sound and a direct video transfer with no touch-up work done to restore artwork that is 20 years old.

These people are walking contradictions! And about the company...Warner Bros did make good on their promise to correct the mistake of disc one: they reissued disc one (via mail) with music restored to the second episode to whoever signed up for it.

Get it, get it, get it, even if you have to be a corporate sellout and buy the cd on the major label. (Those who remember, this lp first came out on the indie label ...)This cd, this is a mockery of what these guys are. Kind of like what Danzig has become compared to his Misfits (or even Samhain) days. It's a joke of itself and it doesn't come off well at all.Also, if you really want to dig and get into this vibe.

That album punch you in the face, it huts but you love it and want more; that fealing wasn't in SOUNDCHASER.It's just my opinion and in the other hand i think Soundchaser is a step forward since UNITY and the proof that Rage wanted to return to path left in the 1990-1996 era with albums like THE MISSING LINK or TRAPPED!, authentic masterpieces of power/thrash metal.SOUNDCHASER is really good, and it can't be out of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest metal albums of all time.","review":"This is one of the best metal albums that I've ever heard and I've heard hundreds. I'm a big metal fan and I only discovered Rage about a year ago. This album has it all: its catchy, no filler, it rocks hard, great songwriting, and astounding musicianship. Even though it could be considered to be power metal, Rage has nothing in common with the poncey hairdressers who play the poofed-up version of the genre. If you don't like power metal, you will still love this as long as you love METAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Lighting.","review":"These bulbs are really good products. They are made in Germany and that should tell you a little about quality..especially comparing to China products. I've only had them a little over a month and expect they will last many more...we will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things that should be common sense","review":"It's aggravating, in a way, to come across a book that says basically what you've thought for a while, but in an unformed way. \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" should be required reading in journalism and communications school."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Before i talk about the book, i just want to say that amazon shipped this to my ship's fpo address in 5 days. I am currently deployed to the gulf and it usually takes 20+ days to receive. As for the book...it's amazing. I've long wondered why the majority of americans are not outraged by the actions of our government. This book explains why."},{"rating":"2","title":"politically radical yet superb","review":"This is the one Chomsky book to read if you're going to read only one. It's a scathing indictment of the \\"free\\" press, packed with a massive amount of carefully documented evidence. The focus throughout is on the nature of pro-establishment propaganda foisted on the public by the elite print media, primarily the New York Times and Washington Post. The authors painstakingly compare the editorial positions and news biases of leading media with the information available through third parties (typically foreign or smaller-scale U.S. media) and find that the elite print media are slanted far in favor of official Washington policy--with journalistic integrity and independence pushed aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"ed herman's a genius","review":"Ed Herman has often written quietly behind Chomsky's bigger name but he's no less important a messenger and translator of American media and foreign policy bias and hypocrisy. Manufacturing Consent is a withering analysis of these \\"inconvenient truths.\\" Herman and Chomsky's important writings, both as collaborators and individuals, have been largely ignored by the mainstream press for the last 40 years, affirming, ironically, their very thesis. If you read this book undefensively, putting aside your biases, you will experience Kierkegaard's \\"fear and trembling.\\" If you read Ed Herman's other books, you'll appreciate why he's not more widely known, but should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Documents how structured knowledge is never truly open.","review":"This book reveals well how difficult it is for democracies to maintain an informed citizenry when the news media are so prone to political manipulation and economic pressures. An important argument, regrettably weakened by some careless (NOT dishonest) scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's easy to understand, just ask questions that frighten you.","review":"Ask yourself:Who killed ArchBishop Oscar Romero?How many US mercinaries are there in Saudi Arabia (or the Middle East in general)?Why are US millitary bases spread through out the world when the Soviet Union is dead?If you answer questions like these, then you can begin to read this book.(If your of poor class in American, then you do not need to ask these questions because we already understand the nature of this system)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anatomy of America's Propaganda Machine","review":"Edward Herman and Noam Chomksy's \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" is an alarming, disturbing, and finally brilliant exploration of the political-economic realities of American media. Armed with a solid hypothesis and reems of empirical data, the authors thoroughly debunk every myth that leads us to believe that American journalists and news reports are liberal, impartial, independent, or even remotely accurate in their presentation of \\"fact.\\" Herman and Chomsky study the media the way that a biologist would study an organism; they apply scientific method and rigorous structural analysis to come up with theories, experiments, and conclusions. In the end, they expose the media for what it really is: an organ of state power through which the elite manipulate, control, and exploit the masses. If you're interested in unhooking your intellect from the American propaganda machinery, \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" is the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most revealing book I have ever read...","review":"This is a must for anyone who thinks we get a representation of reality and democracy through media. Noam Chomsky is the, \\"most brilliant intellectual alive\\"...even if that quoted source portrays him in a negative light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noam Chomsky is an idiot","review":"This book was a mandatory read for my propaganda class at UCLA. If colleges didn't force people to read this smut, his book would be even lower than his 1800 on amazon.com. Noam Chomsky's whole argument is based on cause correlation which is an inherently flawed way to measure the media's reporting. Chomsky believes that when one event occurs it is directly related to another. Anybody who understands how to do research knows that you can't rely on this method to make valid conclusions. To make up for this discrepancy, Chomsky repeats himself a thousand times throughout the book. This book gets my lowest score. I highly recommend Anne Coulter's book Slander which does a much better job of explaining biases in the media. She presents facts explaining how the media is liberal, not conservative."},{"rating":"1","title":"More conspiracy theory propaganda","review":"Wake up and understand who controls the media and who they vote for. Why would these Dem voting owners and employees possibly push a Republican Agenda? Can you possibly answer that?What about Dan Rather trying to subvert an upcoming election with false reporting prior to an election and yet he was supported by his media outlet until the whithering fire from other outlets forced him to admit the story was false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drains Quickly","review":"We bought this battery to replace our original camera battery. When this battery arrived we charged the battery for 10 hours prior to using it, as the instructions states. After charging it we tested it and took a few shots and found that it worked with our camera so we turned the camera off. The next day we tried to turn on the camera, but it did not turn on so we charged the battery again. Once it was done we placed it back in the camera to test, it worked, we turned it off....and I think you know what happened the next day.Giving this a one star because this battery does NOT hold a charge for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy these batteries","review":"I have purchased non-Canon batteries in the past and they've worked well. Not so with these. From day one, they have not held a charge. Incredibly, I noticed as I was packing for a trip that they weigh a fraction of what the Canon batteries weigh. You can squeeze them and compress them with your fingers, which of course is impossible with a proper battery. Clearly they are skimping on the substrate. They will leave you angry and ripped off. They are completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This battery won't recharge","review":"The battery comes pre-charge for the 1st use. But it won't recharge with my Cannon G2 factory charger.

When I ordered my Cannon EOS 40D from some website in NY or NJ I asked for a second battery. I was charged $[...] for a second battery but it was THIS one not a real Cannon battery, so the guy screwed me by sending me a $[...] battery and charging me full Cannon price.The Cannon battery is still going strong after 2+ years the \\"non-Cannon\\" battery lasted about a year. For less than $[...] bucks that's OK. Just DON'T let it sit discharged for long periods of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but...","review":"It does not last nearly as long as the rated Ah implies.

Within a few days of receiving it, I went to the Web site that goes with the book and downloaded much of business planning software. It was great!I also applied for a trademark after reading the free eBook, How to Get a Trademark Quickly and Easily, which I also downloaded from the site. Great book, great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance of inspired Roslavets works","review":"This CD shows to sides to Nikolaj Roslavets' work. The symphonic poem 'Chasy Novoluniya' owes a lot to Scriabin's later symphonic poems (and also uses his chord system) but it is an enjoyable piece nonetheless. The violin concerto, here performed in exemplary fashion by Gridenko and Holliger, shows much more inspiration and originality than this composer is usually given credit for. It is a powerful work which shows a more mature side of Roslavets, betraying influences from Honegger and maybe Hindemith. It is unfortunate that so many of Roslavets' works were destroyed, since this disc shows the great promise cut short by both an unfriendly government and a musical tradition hostile to this sort of 'scriabinism'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but another new one is better","review":"This book is good, but it is out of print. A new book, \\"Genuine Gold\\" by Paul L. King, is an excellent book on the same topic. As an Alliance pastor, I stongly recommend it if you want to know the true early history of the Alliance. I was excited when I read of the early years of the Holy Spirit working powerfully in the C&MA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and pointless","review":"If you have never heard anything by Korn, Soulfly, Limp Bizkit, Downset, Deftones, System of a down, Biohazard, Machine Head or Slipknot then this is the most original album ever. If you have heard these bands, then expect something very familiar. For those into safe, unoriginal, boring bands only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and fun","review":"There are few actual laugh-out-loud funny moments in this movie but it is cute nonetheless. It has a plotline very much similar to Fran Drescher's TV show \\"The Nanny\\". Fran is a beauty college instructor who, through a misunderstanding, ends up in the fictional country of Slovetzia as the tutor of the president's children (one is played by the \\"bee Girl\\" from the Blind Melon video *hee-hee*). She brings the children out of their shells and also teaches the president a thing or two (about opening up, freedom and love). Unfortunately it takes her leaving for him to realize it, but there is a 'happily ever after' ending. This movie is a must-have for Fran Drescher fans needing a fix!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgetable once upon a time/fairy-tale story!!!","review":"This movie is hillarious! If you like either Fran Drescher or Timothy Dalton, you MUST see this movie. Although very similar (in terms of plot) to The Sound of Music and The King and I, it's got some great modern-day humor that those are lacking. (Like the \\"talk to the hand\\" part!) It's also got a great soundtrack. If you like romantic comedy and a great cast, this movie is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a goldmine for all you Fran fans out there!!","review":"If you are a Fran-fan buy this! It is just great. It\`s a story about a beautician , Fran ,or in this movie Joy Miller.

Fran's my favorite actress!","review":"Fran Drescher is FANTASTIC! She's got a great sense of humor and I love her taste in clothes. If I could go shopping w/ her, it'd be tomorrow. I think she ought to come out w/ another television series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance for the whole family","review":"This movie should be viewed for what it is - a sweet, simple romance that asks nothing of it's viewer but offers plenty in return. Non-fans of Fran can't really expect to enjoy it, as it is very much her movie, but she carries it brilliantly. Laughs are aplenty and the romance is kept at a sweet, innocent level. You can't help but be drawn in - it's certainly one to watch time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Some movies get lost in time, but this is just a great feel good, humorious film.

If you need to buy a P.O.D. record buy Satellite, and stay far away from this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good","review":"This is a great cd a little different from there last but change is good. it is a lot more reggae now and it is hevier with less rap. it is a lot more solid then there last cd every song is great the best in my opinion is wildfire it is a very cool sounding song with a lot of different sounds. this is a must have if you are a pod fan so all i have to say is very good job to p.o.d"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for them!!","review":"I have read some of the reviews, and I am totally shocked and annoyed that people are upset with them for the \\"gothic\\" look and the fact that they don't mention God... They have other CD's that DO mention God, and I think it's GREAT that they have this CD out!! People who are non believers will listen to this and love it. They will then go out to find more of their CD's and the message can be put out there then. I believe those who dislike this CD for the shallow reasons they do are selfish and are not getting the BIG picture!! This Cd was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Hey to all of you doubters out there. P.O.D. is back and better then before. There new lineup has a new guy Jason Truby. He is formally from the band Living Sacrifice another band that is close to P.O.D. Sonny said himself he wanted to change his voice on the next cd and he has sucessfully done that!! The album is good with the songs such as \\"Will You\\",\\"Change The World\\", and the powerful song \\"Find My Way\\" make this cd a great buy to the common rock lover!! If there are any doubts about P.O.D. let them be flushed down the tolet! This CD rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great Cd, but check out Pillar instead","review":"this is a good Cd, but Pillar, a similar band, just released their second cd entitled \\"Where do we go from Here\\" that truly knocks this one out. Check it out. you'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a step down","review":"I had high hopes when buying this cd, i hear \\"will you\\" and loved it. but the rest of the cd is bland. You are able to hear the diffrence with the new guitar player, but he is much worse. the guitar in this cd does not change much, its noit dynamic at all. the vocals are ok, but nothing like they used to be. one song i was impressed with was the last one, \\"eternal\\" it actually has very good guitar playing, as it should because its an instrumental. the ironic thing is that this is a song which features a guest guitarist which im sure did alot of the song himself. the only reason this cd didnt get a 1 is because of the songs \\"will you\\" and \\"eternal.\\" this cd could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disapointment","review":"If your expecting a P.O.D. like in Fundamental Elements of Southtown or Satelite, then don't buy this cd.What you'll get is a slow and mellow p.o.d., and not the hard hitting and exploding p.o.d. that we know.Out of the 11 songs 'Will You' and Asthema are the only 2 songs that come at least close to the old p.o.d. Don't waste your money on this album, instead burn it and you be the jugde."},{"rating":"1","title":"wahts with nu metal","review":"sorry but i used to like P.O.D. but this cd is BOOOOOOOORING! every song sounds the same, thank goodness for kazaa so i could download it before buying it. i'm sick of all the nu metal crap that all sounds the same... you guys should check out real bands like thursday, death cab for cutie, bright eyes, saves the day, coheed and cambria, and new end original..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im blown away","review":"I'm the last person in the world to pick up a rock/punkish/whatever cd, but something told me to pick it up and ever since that day, I have not been able to put it down.

And i don't like the \\"gothic\\" look of this CD! P.O.D does not belong with a Christain title i listened to 2 seconds of this CD and did not like it! Fact: they do not mention God anywhere in their CD what kind of Christian band is that? One that's afraid of their religion ill tell you that! i spent $15.00 on this CD and it was a waste of money! so if ur a strong Christian and don't want things like this blocking ur Christian lifestyle do not get this CD!I mean i went to all sorts of sites(Christain sites) and all of the reviews i read about them were that they did not like P.O.D. If you want some really good,fun,CHRISTIAN music i recommend Relient K or if you like \\"rap\\" check out Toby Mac he mentions God in all of his songs and it's GREAT music not a waste of money! so go buy one of those CDs. trust me you'll feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing a Better Style","review":"I've heard many criticisms from hardcore P.O.D. fans that say they have lost their touch with their base and are \\"pop\\" or on a \\"bandwagon\\" now. I would agree that they went that way with \\"Satellite\\", but this album is completely different. Bringing in Jason Truby from Lving Sacrifice, a band more hardcore than P.O.D. ever was, has allowed the music to combine a metal sound with the popular hip-hop sound in the vocals. Also, looking at P.O.D.'s career as a whole, they have evolved from a rapcore band to a metal sound, and I believe that's fine. All groups must have some evolution of sound, firstly because it's inevitable to mature as the members' lives mature, and secondly, to create something new everytime can lead to new horizons. If you're like me and were mostly frustrated by \\"Satellite\\" and prefer a more metal side of P.O.D. similar to that on \\"Southtown\\", buy this album in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beat The Horse Bloody...","review":"I've read this over & over again on other Amazon reviews and I hate to beat a horse bloody, BUT why are all the newer rock bands, Staind, POD, Limp Bizkit, making these slow ballet albums. Stick with what you know, hard drums, hard guitar, and hard lyrics.Take Linkin Park for example. They stick with the same format with their latest album and it rocks. Check out Amazon's top 100 sellers and you can always find that album.The only POD like songs on this album is 'Will You' and Asthema. They sound like the POD I know and LOVE. I was expecting ROCK but got Easy Listening.Lets hope Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots new releases next week don't ballet out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"my god POD does it again?","review":"This album is really bad I don't like it for nothing trying to be all the reggea, hard rock band it's just not working for them don't get this album for nothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Got IT","review":"My roomie in college over 10 years ago grew up in Chula Vista. He knew these guys personally and watched them form and grow as a band. He introduced them to me. We were fans \\"way back in the day\\". Today, I am a bigger fan than ever.Some call this album a sell out. To me it is a progression. The rhytymn section sounds tighter than ever! And over the years, Sonny has become a good vocalist! Each song burns with passion and emotion. The styles brought to the table (reggae, hardcore, arena rock, rap etc...) all mesh together in a sonic kaleidescope that is a joy to hear!If you think P.O.D. does not remember how to rock, simply catch a live show! You will not find a band who hits harder or louder! but in listening to their latest offering, you'll find a band confident enough to try new sounds and go new directions.
